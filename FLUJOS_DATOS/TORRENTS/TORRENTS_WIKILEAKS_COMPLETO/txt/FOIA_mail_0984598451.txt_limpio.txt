from michael mann mannmultiproxyevscvirginiaedu to tim osborn tosbornueaacuk subject re verification results date wed 14 mar 2001 143411 0500 cc srutherfordvirginiaedu mannvirginiaedu hii tim that all sounds great and indeed the 19th century will be hot topic pun intended as we try to rectify toms model response w the instrumental record and proxy reconstructions ironically the 19th century is one in most dispute over the past millennium it seems you accurately summarize what my understanding is of the breakdown of lead roles i dont see any reason for changing that i think scott and i will have our hands full w the other items so if you can take the lead role on the mxd paper comparing the two methods etc that would be great my intention is to give you and scott full credit for anything i show at meetings that is result of mutual collaboration of course both of your are coauthors of my egs talk so all sounds great scott when tim sends revised plots can you prepare some revised ppt files and let know when they are available to download hope to get all this straightened away next week after i return from the frozen north michigan mike that soundsat 0705 pm 31401 0000 tim osborn wrote thanks alot these look good i think were really making some good progress now just to confirm my understanding is that youre next working on similar plot showing the comparison of the regem results w the straight gridbox agebanded estimates you and keith have produced over the longer period ie back to 1600 or so it would be great to be able to show those at egs mike youre welcome to show these results at egs i had to leave early today wednesday as my wife was ill but ill be back at work tomorrow what ill do first is just to modify the figures ive already sent to you comparing the verification regem run with instrumental data over the 18561900 period what i want to do is to modify the final map so that the grid boxes that actually have treering sites in them are highlighted in some way then we can visualise more clearly whether the local information is much better than the nonlocal information i was in bit of hurry with my email earlier i didnt mention that the map is based on all those grid boxes with at least 20 years of instrumental data during the 18561900 period i found the yearbyyear pattern correlations quite informative too and was particularly impressed by the fact that there were really poor years at least thats my recollection not having the plots in front of at home having modified the map as described ill repeat the analysis but comparing the 14041855 period of the full reconstruction from regem with our existing yearbyyear maps and quasihemispheric averages i shall compare them against our traditionallystandardised version since it would be unfair to compare them with the agebanded version the yearbyyear maps we have already got are calibrated on gridbox by gridbox basis individually using simple linear regression between the density series and the instrumental temperature this gives us coverage for those grid boxes with density data in them we throw away those that do not correlate significantly with their local grid box temperature that leaves around 100 boxes with fewer further back in time we then try to reconstruct all remaining northern hemisphere grid boxes using principal component regression pcs of the calibrated density used as predictors on grid box by grid box basis but only actually retain those that have significant correlations during an independent verification period so we gain quite few more grid boxes again timevarying so we have this perhaps rather odd combination of local regression plus principal component regression producing our maps i shall use this set of yearbyyear maps for the comparison with regem though as with the instrumental temperatures ill sometimes highlight or subsample just those with trees in ie those locallycalibrated our original plan for carving up the analysispapers was for to take the lead on the comparison of methods with the same data set scott on the comparison of data sets with the same method and mike to concentrate on the 19th century stuff including verification against the instrumental data etc i saw tom crowley last week and he showed some results indicating how critical the 19th century is for getting good match between his forced model results and the various proxy reconstructions so the 19th century could certainly be hot topic phil jones would be useful here as he may know of more early instrumental data from europe that might help depending upon homogeneity anyway im refreshing our minds about the 3way split of work because i this might be an appropriate point to confirm that such split is still the best way to go im still happy with it and ii to point out that the regem comparisons with our existing densitybased maps falls into the bit that im to take the lead on so while im completely happy for you to show these at egs or other meetings id still like to write the comparisons up for journal paper ps tim are you going to be at egs i know phil willalso im hoping that one of the 3 of you can make it to the charlottesville workshop in april you and phil have both indicated you cant go i think at present keith hasnt yet confirmed it would be shame not to have him you or phil present can you suggest some sort of alternate schweingruber the europeans might invite if keith cant make it thanks i cant make it to egs as i have work to prepare for my 3 talks im giving at ncar in the first week in april for the charlottesville workshop i spoke to keith yesterday and i think he has now booked his flights so id take that as confirmation hes in touch with julie jones at gkss about it i put in good word about how pleasant charlottesville was best regards to you both tim dr timothy j osborn climatic research unit university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj uk telephone 01603 592089 fax 01603 507784 email
