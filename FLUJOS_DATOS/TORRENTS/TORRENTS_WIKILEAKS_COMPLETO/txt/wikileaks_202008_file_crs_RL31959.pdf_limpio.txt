background congress last enacted broad foreign ssistance authorization act in 1985 prior to 1985 beginning in the mid1950s it had b een the congressional practice to debate and approve general foreign aid legislation either annua lly or biennially these debates frequently evol ved into wideranging consider ation of us foreign policy that went well beyond discussions of ec onomic and military assistance programs as such the legislation was freque ntly marked by controvers internal congressional disagreements concerning international issues and disputes between the executive and legislative branches regarding presidential management of foreign policy in several years since 1985 congress considered foreign aid authorizing measures but the bills failed to reach final passage1 in the interim lawmakers have approved more narrowly focused singleissue foreign aid authorization bills such as the support for east european democracy seed act 1989 the freedom support act 1992 the international ma laria control act 2000 and the more recently enacted united states leadership against hivai ds tuberculosis nd malaria act of 2003 lack of administration support for fore ign aid bills has been continuing obstacle to enactment over the past 18 years the clinton administration submitted draft legislation in 1994 seeking to rew rite the foreign assistance act of 1961 but in most cases the executive has opposed or not encouraged consideration of broad foreign assistance measures which were pe rceived as intrusions into presidential flexibility in managing foreign policy or excessive congressional earmarkinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31959crs2 2 foreign assistance authoriza tion act fiscal year 2004 report to accompany s 1161 srept 10856 may 29 2003in the absence of

appropriation bills increasingly have expanded their scope bey ond spending issues and played major role in shaping authorizing and guid ing both executive and congressional foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives it has been largely through foreign operations appropriations that the united states has modified aid policy and resource allocation priorities since the end of the cold war legislation authorizing us participation in most multilateral development bank replenishments since the early 1980s has been incorporated into foreign operation measures the legislation and companion supplemental appropriation bills have also been the channel through which the president has utilized foreign aid as tool in the global war on terrorism since the attacks of september 11 2001 ea rlier this year the presidents new foreign aid initiative the millennium challenge corporation was authorized with the fy2004 foreign operations appr opriations act ppropriation measures have also been key

those that occurred previously in authorization debates last year the foreign relations co mmittee reported similar bill s 1161 characterizing the action as effort to reinforce the committees role in
