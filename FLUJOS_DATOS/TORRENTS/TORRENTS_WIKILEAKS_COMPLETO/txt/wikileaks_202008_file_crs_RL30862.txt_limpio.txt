american national government government and finance division the budget reconciliation process the senates byrd rule summary reconciliation is procedure under the congressional budget act of 1974 by which congress implements budget resolution policies affecting mainly permanent spending and revenue programs the principal focus in the reconciliation process has been deficit reduction but in some years reconciliation has involved revenue reduction generally and spending increases in selected areas although reconciliation is an optional procedure it has been used most years since its first use in 1980 19 reconciliation bills have been enacted into law and three have been vetoed during the first several years experience with reconciliation the legislation contained many provisions that were extraneous to the purpose of implementing budget resolution policies the reconciliation submissions of committees included such things as provisions that had budgetary effect that increased spending or reduced revenues when the reconciliation instructions called for reduced spending or increased revenues or that violated another committees jurisdiction in 1985 and 1986 the senate adopted the byrd rule named after its principal sponsor senator robert c byrd on temporary basis as means of curbing these practices the byrd rule has been extended and modified several times over the years in 1990 the byrd rule was incorporated into the congressional budget act of 1974 as section 313 and made permanent 2 usc 644 senator opposed to the inclusion of extraneous matter in reconciliation legislation may offer an amendment or motion to recommit the measure with instructions that strikes such provisions from the legislation or under the byrd rule senator may raise point of order against such matter in general point of order authorized under the byrd rule may be raised in order to strike extraneous matter already in the bill as reported or discharged or in the conference report or to prevent the incorporation of extraneous matter through the adoption of amendments or motions motion to waive the byrd rule or to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the chair on point of order raised under the byrd rule requires the affirmative vote of threefifths of the membership 60 senators if seats are vacant the byrd rule provides six definitions of what constitutes extraneous matter for purposes of the rule and several exceptions thereto but the term is generally described as covering provisions unrelated to achieving the goals of the reconciliation instructions the byrd rule has applied to 17 reconciliation measures considered by the senate from 1985 through the present there have been 53 points of order and 42 waiver motions considered and disposed of under the byrd rule largely in manner that favored those who opposed the inclusion of extraneous matter in reconciliation legislation 43 points of order were sustained in whole or in part and 33 waiver motions were rejected this report

1974 pl 93344 as amended1 the purpose of reconciliation is to change substantive law so that revenue and mandatory spending levels are brought into line with budget resolution policies reconciliation generally has been used to reduce the deficit through spending reductions or revenue increases or combination of the two in recent years however the reconciliation process also has encompassed revenue reduction generally and spending increases in selected program areas reconciliation is twostep process under the first step reconciliation instructions are included in the budget resolution directing one or more committees in each house to develop legislation that changes spending or revenues or both by the amounts specified in the budget resolution if more than one committee in each house is given instructions each instructed committee submits reconciliation legislation to its respective budget committee which incorporates all submissions without any substantive revision into single omnibus budget reconciliation measure reconciliation procedures during session usually have applied to multiple committees and involved omnibus legislation under the second step the omnibus budget reconciliation measure is considered in the house and senate under expedited procedures for example debate time in the senate on reconciliation measure is limited to 20 hours and amendments must be germane the process culminates with enactment of the measure thus putting the policies of the budget resolution into effect reconciliation which was first used by the house and senate in 1980 is an optional procedure but it has been used in most years over the period covering from 1980 to the present 19 reconciliation bills have been enacted into law and three have been vetoed during the first several years experience with reconciliation the legislation contained many provisions that were extraneous to the purpose of reducing the deficit the reconciliation submissions of committees included such things as provisions that had budgetary effect that increased spending or reduced revenues or that violated another committees jurisdiction 1 for detailed discussion of the reconciliation process see crs report rl33030 the budget reconciliation process house and senate procedures by robert keith and bill heniff jr crs2 in 1985 and 1986 the senate adopted the byrd rule named after its principal sponsor senator robert c byrd as means of curbing these practices initially the rule consisted of two components involving provision in reconciliation act and senate resolution the byrd rule has been modified several times over the years the purpose of this report is to briefly recount the legislative history of the byrd rule summarize its current features and describe its implementation from its inception through the present legislative history of the byrd rule during the first five years that the byrd rule was in effect from late 1985 until late 1990 it consisted of two separate components 1 provision in statute applying to initial senate consideration of reconciliation measures and 2 senate resolution extending application of portions of the statutory provision to conference reports and amendments between the two houses several modifications were made to the byrd rule in 1986 and 1987 including extending its expiration date from january 2 1987 to january 2 1988 and then to september 30 1992 but the two separate components of the rule were preserved in 1990 these components were merged together and made permanent when they were incorporated into the congressional budget act cba of 1974 as section 313 there have been further changes in the byrd rule since 1990 the byrd rule originated on october 24 1985 when senator robert c byrd on behalf of himself and others offered amendment 878 as modified to s 1730 the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act cobra of 19852 the senate adopted the amendment by vote of 9603 in this form the byrd rule applied to initial senate consideration of reconciliation measures senator byrd explained that the basic purposes of the amendment were to protect the effectiveness of the reconciliation process by excluding extraneous matter that often provoked controversy without aiding deficit reduction efforts and to preserve the deliberative character of the senate by excluding from consideration under expedited procedures legislative matters not central to deficit reduction that should be debated under regular procedures he opened his remarks by stating we are in the process now of seeing the pandoras box which has been opened to the abuse of the reconciliation process that process was never meant to be used as it is being used there are 122 items in the reconciliation bill that are extraneous henceforth if the majority on committee should wish to include in reconciliation recommendations to the budget committee any measure matter how controversial it can be brought to the senate under an 2 for detailed legislative

debate plus time on amendments and motions to more than 20 hours it was never foreseen that the budget reform act would be used in that way so if the budget reform process is going to be preserved and more importantly if we are going to preserve the deliberative process in this us senate which is the outstanding unique element with respect to the us senate action must be taken now to stop this abuse of the budget process4 the byrd amendment was included in modified form in cobra of 1985 pl 99272 which was not enacted into law until april 7 1986 as section 20001 100 stat 390391 the byrd rule

affecting the byrd rule first the senate adopted sres 509 by voice vote 4 see the remarks of senator robert c byrd on p s14032 of the congressional record daily ed october 24 1985 crs4 on october 16 1986 the measure offered by senator alan simpson and others modified sres 286 in technical fashion second the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1986 was enacted into law as pl 99509 on october 21 1986 section 7006 of the law made several minor changes in the byrd rule and extended its expiration date by one year until january 2 1988 further changes in the byrd rule were made in 1987 these changes were included in measure increasing the statutory limit on the public debt modifying procedures under the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 and making other budget process changes pl 100119 signed into law on september 29 see title ii budget process reform section 205 of the law added an item to the list of definitions of extraneous matter in the byrd rule and extended its expiration until september 30 1992 in 1990 congress and the president agreed to further modifications of the budget process by enacting the budget enforcement act bea of 1990 title xiii of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 section 13214 of the law made significant revisions to the byrd rule and incorporated it as permanent law into the cba of 1974 as section 313 2 usc 644 finally the budget enforcement act of 1997 title x of the balanced budget act of 1997 made minor technical changes in section 313 of the cba of 1974 to correct drafting problems with the bea of 1990 current features of the byrd rule senator opposed to the inclusion of extraneous matter in reconciliation legislation has two principal options for dealing with the problem first senator may offer an amendment or motion to recommit the measure with instructions that strikes such provisions from the legislation second under the byrd rule senator may raise point of order against extraneous matter the byrd rule is relatively complex rule5 that applies to two types of reconciliation measures considered pursuant to section 310 of the cba of 1974 reconciliation bills and reconciliation

pursuant to section 258c of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 this section which has never been invoked provides for the consideration of reconciliation legislation in the fall in order to achieve deficit reductions that would obviate the need for an expected sequester under the payasyougo paygo requirement or previously the deficit targets the paygo requirement effectively expired at the end of the 107th congress see crs report rs21378 termination of the payasyougo paygo requirement for fy2003 and later years by robert keith all of the continued crs5 be used to make changes in legislation that had passed the house and senate but had not yet been enrolled and sent to the president the practice of the house and senate has been to consider only reconciliation bills in general point of order authorized under the byrd rule may be raised in order to strike extraneous matter already in the bill as reported or discharged or in the conference report or to prevent the incorporation of extraneous matter through the adoption of amendments or motions point of order may be raised against single provision or two or more provisions as designated by title or section number or by page and line number and may be raised against single amendment or two or more amendments the chair may sustain point of order as to all of the provisions or amendments or only some of them once material has been stricken from reconciliation legislation under the byrd rule it may not be offered again as an amendment motion to waive the byrd rule or to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the chair on point of order raised under the byrd rule requires the affirmative vote of threefifths of the membership 60 senators if seats are vacant7 single waiver motion can 1 apply to the byrd rule as well as other provisions of the congressional budget act 2 involve multiple as well as single provisions or amendments 3 extend for specified language through consideration of the conference report as well as initial consideration of the measure or amendment and 4 be made prior to the raising of point of order thus making the point of order moot when reconciliation measure or conference report thereon is considered the senate budget committee must submit for the record list of potentially extraneous matter included therein8 this list is advisory however and does not bind the chair in ruling on points of order determinations of budgetary levels for purposes of enforcing the byrd rule are made by the senate budget committee definitions of extraneous matter subsection b1 of the byrd rule provides definitions of what constitutes extraneous matter for purposes of the rule 6 continued reconciliation measures considered by the senate thus far have originated pursuant to section 310 of the cba of 1974 7 in the senate many points of order under the cba of 1974 require threefifths vote of the membership to waive or to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the chair most of these threefifths waiver requirements are temporary but in the case of the byrd rule it is permanent section 503 of the fy2004 budget resolution hconres 95 108th cong adopted on april 11 2003 extended the expiration date for the temporary requirements to september 30 2008 8 for an example of such list see the remarks of senator pete domenici regarding the conference report on the balanced budget act of 1997 in the congressional record daily ed of july 31 1997 at pp s8406s8408 crs6 the senate budget committee in its report on the budget resolution for fy1994 noted extraneous is term of art broadly speaking the rule prohibits inclusion in reconciliation of matter unrelated to the deficit reduction goals of the reconciliation process9 provision is considered to be extraneous if it falls under one or more of the following six definitions it does not produce change in outlays or revenues it produces an outlay increase or revenue decrease when the instructed committee is not in compliance with its instructions it is outside of the jurisdiction of the committee that submitted the title or provision for inclusion in the reconciliation measure it produces change in outlays or revenues which is merely incidental to the nonbudgetary components of the provision it would increase the deficit for fiscal year beyond the budget window covered by the reconciliation measure10 and it recommends changes in social security the last definition complements ban in section 310g of the cba of 1974 against considering any reconciliation legislation that contains recommendations pertaining to the social security for purposes of these provisions social security is considered to include the oldage survivors and disability insurance oasdi program established under title ii of the social security act it does not include medicare or other programs established as part of that act exceptions to the definition of extraneous matter subsection b2 of the byrd rule provides that senateoriginated provision that does not produce change in outlays or revenues shall not be considered extraneous if the chairman and ranking minority members of the budget committee and the committee reporting the provision certify that 9 see the report of the senate budget committee to accompany sconres 18 concurrent resolution on the budget fy1994 srept 10319 march 12 1993 p 49 10 the budget window refers to the period covered by the budget resolution and to any reconciliation directives included therein and the resultant reconciliation legislation beginning in the late 1980s the budget resolution is required to cover at minimum the budget year the fiscal year beginning on october 1 in the session that the budget resolution is adopted and the four following fiscal years the outyears in addition budget resolutions sometimes cover the current year the fiscal year preceding the budget year and up to five additional outyears accordingly the longest budget window that has applied to budget resolution and associated reconciliation legislation covered 11 years including the current year crs7 the provision mitigates direct effects clearly attributable to provision changing outlays or revenues and both provisions together produce net reduction in the deficit or the provision will or is likely to reduce outlays or increase revenues 1 in one or more fiscal years beyond those covered by the reconciliation measure 2 on the basis of new regulations court rulings on pending legislation or relationships between economic indices and stipulated statutory triggers pertaining to the provision or 3 but reliable estimates cannot be made due to insufficient data additionally under subsection b1a provision that does not change outlays or revenues in the net but which includes outlay decreases or revenue increases that exactly offset outlay increases or revenue decreases is not considered to be extraneous the full text of the byrd rule in its current form is provided in appendix implementation of the byrd rule congress and the president considered 22 omnibus reconciliation measures as shown in table 1 between calendar year 1980 when the reconciliation process was first used and the present11 as stated previously 19 of these measures were enacted into law and three were vetoed by president clinton the byrd rule has been in effect during the consideration of the last 17 of these 22 measures covering calendar years 1985 through 2007 the byrd rule had not been established when the first five reconciliation bills were considered table 1 reconciliation measures enacted into law or vetoed 19802007 11 the senate also considered two measures linked to the reconciliation process on december 15 1975 the senate considered amended and passed hr 5559 the revenue adjustment act of 1975 which reduced revenues by about 64 billion pursuant to budget resolution instruction the measure was not regarded as reconciliation bill when it was considered by the house but it was considered under reconciliation procedures in the senate the president vetoed the measure later in the year and the house sustained his veto see the remarks of senator russell long and the presiding officer on p 40540 and the remarks of senator edmund muskie and others on pp 4054440550 in the congressional record of december 15 1975 regarding the status of hr 5559 as reconciliation bill the deficit reduction act of 1984 pl 98369 was regarded as reconciliation bill when it was considered in the house but was stripped of that classification when it was considered in the senate in april and may of 1984 the house also has considered reconciliation measures that were not considered in the senate for more information on the consideration of

bills during consideration of that bill the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act cobra of 1985 the byrd rule applied to the consideration of the conference report but not to initial consideration of the bill the 17 reconciliation bills considered and passed by the house and senate during this period stemmed from reconciliation directives in 15 different budget resolutions two budget resolutions in 1997 for fy1998 and 2005 for fy2006 led to the enactment of two reconciliation measures in each year as table 2 shows there have been 53 points of order and 42 waiver motions for total of 95 actions considered and disposed of under the byrd rule12 there is not onetoone correspondence between points of order and waiver motions point of order can be raised under the byrd rule without waiver motion being offered conversely waiver motion can be offered without point of order having been raised 12 the byrd rule is only one of many pointoforder provisions in titles iii and iv of the cba of 1974 as amended 2 usc 644 in some instances points of order or waiver motions are made under the act by general reference only such as senator raising point of order under title iii of the act rather than by specific reference to the provisions involved when only general references are made it usually is impossible to determine by reference to debate in the congressional record alone which provision of the act is involved consequently this report reflects only those instances when specific reference was made to section 313 of the act or to the byrd rule and may undercount

prepared by the congressional research service from data provided in the legislative information system crs12 on the whole the points of order and waiver motions were disposed of in manner that favored by large margin those who opposed the inclusion of extraneous matter in reconciliation legislation as discussed in more detail below13 five of the six definitions of extraneousness the exception being recommending changes in social security have been cited as bases for points of order under the byrd rule the most common basis that the provision or amendment did not change outlays or revenues was cited as the sole basis in 32 instances and as one of two bases in three other instances none of the other bases were cited in more than six instances in some instances the basis for the point of order was not cited the byrd rule has been used primarily during initial consideration of reconciliation measure it was invoked only five times twice in 1993 once in 1995 once in 1997 and once in 2005 during consideration of conference report in 1993 two points of order against matter characterized as extraneous in conference report were rejected by the chair in both instances the chairs ruling was upheld upon appeal the two motions to appeal the chairs rulings were defeated by identical votes 4357 in 1995 two sections were struck from conference report and the two chambers had to resolve the final differences with further amendment between them in 1997 section in the conference report was retained following successful vote 7822 to waive point of order finally in 2005 three provisions were struck from conference report another provision was retained necessitating action on further amendment between the two chambers as shown in table 2 points of order and waiver motions under the byrd rule have occurred more frequently in the 1990s 81 compared to the 1980s 5 or the 2000s 9 so far the middle years of the decade of the 1990s covering calendar years 1993 through 1997 was especially active in this regard accounting for 65 of the total 81 points of order and waiver motions during that decade points of order in total 53 points of order were raised and disposed of under the byrd rule points of order generally were raised successfully 43 were sustained in whole or in part enabling senators to strike extraneous matter from the legislation in 19 cases and to bar the consideration of extraneous amendments in 24 cases ten of the points of order fell either upon the adoption of waiver motion or upon the ruling of the chair one point of order was withdrawn and is not counted in table 2 in two instances point of order was not raised because waiver motion previously had been offered and approved thus making the point of order moot in many instances point of order was raised against multiple provisions sections or titles of the bill sometimes covering variety of different topics in 13 it is difficult if not impossible to accurately determine the deterrent effect of the byrd rule so this aspect is not addressed in this report crs13 few cases the chair ruled that most but not all of the provisions violated the byrd rule waiver motions total of 42 motions to waive the byrd rule to permit the inclusion of extraneous matter were offered and disposed of by the senate waiver motions generally were not offered successfully 9 were approved and 33 were rejected two other waiver motions were withdrawn and third waiver motion was changed to unanimous consent request they are not counted in table 2 eight of the nine successful motions were used to protect committeereported language in the bill or language in the conference report only one motion to protect floor amendment was successful eight of the successful waiver motions exceeded the required 60vote threshold by between two votes and 21 votes on average they exceeded the threshold by 12 votes the remaining successful waiver motion was approved by voice vote with regard to the 33 unsuccessful waiver motions 32 of them fell short of the threshold by between one vote and 43 votes on average they fell short of the threshold by 12 votes the remaining unsuccessful waiver motion was rejected by voice vote fifteen of the unsuccessful waiver motions garnered at least 51 votes table 3 at the end of this section provides more detailed information on points of order and waiver motions made under the byrd rule from 1985 through 2007 years in which the byrd rule was not invoked in five instances in 1985 1989 2001 2003 and 2006 the senate considered reconciliation legislation without taking any actions under the byrd rule points of order were raised or waiver motions offered under the byrd rule during consideration of the conference report on the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1985 which began on december 19 1985 as previously mentioned this was the first instance in which the byrd rule applied in 1989 actions involving the byrd rule occurred in large part because the senate leadership chose to use an amendment rather than the byrd rule to deal with extraneous matter in the bill on october 13 1989 during consideration of the omnibus budget reconciliation of 1989 the senate adopted mitchell amendment 1004 by voice vote the amendment struck extraneous matter from the bill its stated purpose was to strike all matter from the bill that does not reduce the deficit14 in 2001 and 2003 actions under the byrd rule were taken during consideration of two significant revenuereduction measures the economic growth 14 see the congressional record daily ed of october 13 1989 p s13349 the senate leadership used an amendment for similar purposes during consideration of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1981 crs14 and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 and the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 the potential application of the byrd rule to the measures was averted by the inclusion of sunset provisions that limited the duration of the tax cuts thereby preventing deficit increases beyond the applicable budget windows finally the senate considered two reconciliation bills in 2005 during consideration of the conference report on the spending reconciliation bill the deficit reduction act of 2005 in late 2005 point of order under the byrd rule was raised successfully the revenue reconciliation bill the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act of 2005 was initially considered in late 2005 but action on the conference report carried over into 2006 the potential application of the byrd rule in 2006 to the conference report was avoided because the tax cuts extending beyond the budget window were offset so that deficit increases occurred in that period15 byrd rule controversies although the byrd rule has advocates in the house and senate its use sometimes has engendered much controversy especially between the two houses impact on housesenate relations in 1993 and 1994 in 1993 and 1994 during the 103rd congress the stringent application of the byrd rule by the senate significantly influenced the final shape of the reconciliation act and later affected the deliberations of the joint committee on the organization of congress the house considered its version of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 hr 2264 on may 27 the senate considered its version s1134 on june 23 and june 24 after completing consideration of s 1134 the senate amended and passed hr 2264 for purposes of conference with the house senator pete domenici ranking minority member of the senate budget committee inserted list of potentially extraneous matters included in s 1134 in the congressional record of june 24 at p s798416 the list identified more than dozen sections in five titles of the bill as possibly being in violation of the byrd rule specifically section 313b1a ie producing change in outlays or revenues at the housesenate conference stage the senate leadership directed the parliamentarian and senate budget committee staff to thoroughly review the legislation to identify any provisions originating in the house or senate that might 15 senate action on the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act of 2005 is discussed in crs report rl33132 budget reconciliation legislation in 20052006 under the fy2006 budget resolution by robert keith 16 this requirement was added by section 13214 of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 consequently its first application was to consideration of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 crs15 violate the byrd rule17 as result of this review many provisions were deleted from the legislation in conference during senate consideration of the conference report senator james sasser chairman of the senate budget committee discussed this process with regard to the byrd rule we worked very hard and very faithfully over period of well over week in going over this bill to try to clarify and remove items that might be subject to the byrd rule as the distinguished ranking member indicated i think over 150 items were removed from the reconciliation instrument here because it was felt that they would be subject to the byrd rule i might say some of our house colleagues could not understand and i do not blame them because there were number of things that were pulled out of this budget reconciliation that had been voted on and passed by large majorities in both houses but simply because they violated the byrd rule we had to go to the chairmen of the appropriate house committees and tell them they had to come out they simply did not understand it i think it made them perhaps have little less high esteem for some of us here in the senatein the final analysis their leadership had to demand that some of these provisions subject to the byrd rule come out18 during house consideration of the conference report several democratic members criticized the byrd rule and discussed its impact on the legislation for example representative dan rostenkowski chairman of the house ways and means committee stated i also have to express my grave concerns regarding the other bodys socalled byrd rule as result of this procedural rule policies that would have significantly improved the medicare program could not even be considered over 80 pages of statutory language were stripped out of the medicare title staff wasted countless hours scrutinizing every line to ensure that there is nothing that would upset our friends at the other end of the capitol even more absurd is the fact that most of the items stripped were minor and technical provisions that received bipartisan support when they passed both the house and the senate last year i hope that members on both sides of the aisle share my grave concerns about how this rule has been used and its impact on reconciliation i sincerely hope 17 see the discussion of preemptive editing of the conference report in budget process law annotated

controversy over the byrd rule persisted during late 1993 and into 1994 the joint committee on the organization of congress cochaired by representative lee hamilton and senator david boren was slated to make recommendations on congressional reform including changes in the budget process in december of 1993 representative martin olav sabo chairman of the house budget committee wrote to cochair hamilton in october telling him that widespread use of the byrd rule this year was extremely destructive and bodes ill for the reconciliation process in the future further he stated that the use of mechanisms like the byrd rule greatly distorts the balance of power between the two bodies and that strict enforcement of the byrd rule requires that too much power be delegated to unelected employees of the congress20 chairman sabo attached two budget committee staff documents to his letter 1 29page listing of reconciliation provisions dropped or modified in conference in order to comply with the byrd rule and 2 threepage statement identifying specific problems caused by the rule including bar against including authorizations savings in reconciliation the forcing of piecemeal legislation incentives to use counterproductive drafting techniques to mitigate effects and bar against provisions achieving savings or promoting efficiency when the congressional budget office was unable to assign particular savings to them the senate members of the joint committee on the organization of congress recommended in their final report that provision clarifying that the byrd rule is permanent applies to conference reports requires sixty votes to waive and applies to extraneous matters be included in broad reform bill21 legislation embodying the senate recommendations s 1824 was introduced on february 3 1994 the recommendation pertaining to the byrd rule was set forth in section 312 of the bill the house members of the joint committee did not include any recommendations regarding the byrd rule in their report or legislation hr 3801 also introduced on february 3 1994 the day after the two reform bills were introduced the chairmen of 15 house committees wrote to speaker tom foley

introduced hr 4780 the bill would have amended the cba of 1974 to make the byrd rule applicable to the senate only chiefly by removing references to conference reports in section 313 of the act23 none of the three bills cited above were acted upon before the 103rd congress adjourned effects on taxcut legislation during the 106th congress the budget resolutions for fy2000 and fy2001 included reconciliation instructions directing the house ways and means and senate finance committees to develop legislation implementing substantial reductions in revenue24 the reconciliation instructions in the two budget resolutions called for total revenue reduction over five years of 142 billion and 150 billion respectively25 neither budget resolution included any instructions regarding spending this marked the first time that the house and senate had recommended substantial reductions in revenue through the reconciliation process without offsetting savings to be achieved in spending programs any resultant reconciliation legislation was expected under these budget resolutions to reduce large surpluses not to incur or worsen deficits in each of these two years there was controversy in the senate regarding the appropriateness of using reconciliation procedures under circumstances that worsened the federal governments fiscal posture some senators argued that the use of reconciliation with its procedural restrictions that sharply curtail debate time and limit the offering of amendments in comparison to the usual senate procedures could be justified only when it was necessary to reduce or eliminate deficit or to preserve or increase surplus other senators maintained that reconciliation is neutral in its orientation the language in section 310 of the cba of 1974 refers to changes in spending and revenue amounts not increases or decreases and is intended to expedite the consideration of important and potentially complex budgetary legislation 22 the letter is discussed

fy2001 budget resolution the conference report was hrept 106577 april 12 2000 the fy2001 budget resolution also included reconciliation instructions directing the house ways and means committee to develop legislation reducing the debt held by the public 25 the instructions in the fy2000 budget resolution covered 10 fiscal years while the instructions in the fy2001 budget resolution covered five fiscal years the reconciliation instructions in the fy2000 budget resolution also provided for total revenue reductions of 778 billion over 10 years crs18 against the backdrop of the larger issue of the appropriate use of reconciliation under these circumstances senators also debated in particular the impact of the byrd rule on the scope of the resultant taxcut legislation one of the determinants of extraneousness under the byrd rule is whether the legislation reduces revenues or increases spending in the net beyond the budget window ie the period to which the reconciliation instructions apply changes in tax law however often are made on permanent basis as consequence reconciliation legislation recommending permanent tax cuts may run afoul of the byrd rule during consideration of the taxpayer refund and relief act of 1999 and the marriage tax relief reconciliation act of 2000 the byrd rule was used successfully to ensure the inclusion of sunset provisions in the bills limiting the effectiveness of the tax cuts to the period covered by the reconciliation instructions26 during the first session of the 107th congress the senate again addressed these issues as it considered hr 1836 largely embodying president bushs proposal for 16 trillion tax cut27 in addition to debating the appropriateness of using the reconciliation process to expedite taxcut legislation senators argued for and against the inclusion of the 10year sunset provision necessary to achieve compliance with the byrd rule some senators maintained that permanent changes in tax law should be allowed under reconciliation procedures just as they often are customarily made in freestanding tax legislation other senators praised the value of being able to reexamine such significant modifications in budgetary policy in future years when economic circumstances may have changed materially the sunset provision was retained in the final version of the legislation as section 901 115 stat 150 of pl 10716 the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 in 2003 during the first session of the 108th congress the byrd rule influenced the form of revenue reconciliation directives in the fy2004 budget resolution hconres 9528 initially house and senate leaders indicated that they would settle on conference agreement instructing the house ways and means committee to reduce revenues through reconciliation by 550 billion or more for the period covering fy2003fy2013 and the senate finance committee to reduce revenues by 350 billion for the same period majority of senators had indicated their opposition to revenue reductions greater than 350 billion 26 proceedings under this aspect of the byrd rule in the case of the taxpayer refund and relief act of 1999 occurred on july 28 1999 see the remarks of senators roth moynihan conrad gramm and others in the congressional record daily ed of that date on pp s9478s9484 with regard to the marriage tax relief reconciliation act

beginning on p s5028 28 see hrept 10871 april 10 2003 crs19 the use of dual reconciliation instructions in the budget resolution would enable the leadership to secure passage of the budget resolution while leaving open the possibility that subsequent conference on the differing versions of the revenue reconciliation measure passed by the two houses might reach an acceptable compromise between these two amounts however it soon became apparent that if the senate initially passed revenue reconciliation measure consistent with the directive in the budget resolution ie reducing revenues by 350 billion the later consideration of conference agreement reflecting compromise level of revenue reductions greater than 350 billion could violate the byrd rule in particular section 313b1b defines as extraneous any provision reported by committee that reduces revenues or increases outlays if the net effect of all of the committees provisions is that it fails to achieve its reconciliation instructions proposing revenue reductions greater than the level of reductions set in the reconciliation instructions would be considered failure to achieve the instructions in order to resolve the problem the conference agreement on the fy2004 budget resolution instructed both the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee to reduce revenues by 550 billion over fy2003fy2013 but point of order barred the initial consideration in the senate of reconciliation measure as distinct from conference report containing revenue reductions in excess of 350 billion for this period29 the fy2004 budget resolution further provided that the senate point of order could be waived only by the affirmative vote of threefifths of the members duly chosen and sworn ie 60 senators if seats are vacant this procedural formulation strengthened the position of those who favored initial senate passage of reconciliation measure limited to 350 billion in revenue reductions but removed the potential byrd rule hurdle should majority of senators later choose to support conference agreement providing as much as 550 billion in revenue reductions30 senator max baucus the ranking minority member of the senate finance committee questioned whether the directive to the committee should be regarded as 29 the reconciliation directives are set forth in section 201 of hconres 95 the senate point of order is set forth in section 202 portion of the reconciled amounts is set forth as outlay increases in order to accommodate changes in tax programs eg refundable tax credits that are scored as outlays consequently the aggregate instruction of 550 billion is actually 535 billion in revenue reductions and 15 billion in outlay increases in the house and 522524 billion in revenue reductions and 27476 billion in outlay increases in the senate 30 for further discussion of this matter see crs report rl31902 revenue reconciliation directives in the fy2004 budget resolution by robert keith

reached agreement with other senators to adhere to the 350 billion level in the conference on the reconciliation measure notwithstanding the fact that the limitation in section 202 of the budget resolution only applied to initial consideration of the measure32 the resultant reconciliation measure hr 2 according to final estimates of the congressional budget office and joint tax committee contained 3497 billion in revenue reductions and related outlay changes33 the bill which became pl 10827 the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 on may 28 2003 included sunset provisions in section 107 117 stat 755756 and section 303 117 stat 764 during the 109th congress the house and senate considered separate revenue and spending reconciliation bills pursuant to the fy2006 budget resolution the budget resolution provided for revenue reconciliation bill that reduced revenues by up to 70 billion over the fiveyear budget window fy2006fy2010 used in the budget resolution the conference agreement on the revenue reconciliation bill hr 4297 recommended significant revenue reduction beyond the budget window principally with respect to extensions of current capital gains and dividends provisions through december 31 201034 instead of incorporating sunset provisions in order to comply with the byrd rule as had been done in the past the conferees included offsets of the revenue losses the jct estimated the total revenue loss over ten years fy2006fy2015 at 69084 billion an amount nearly 900 million smaller than the fiveyear revenue loss the measure

of hres 6 requiring that changes in legislation affecting direct spending or revenues be deficit neutral shortly thereafter the senate revised its longstanding paygo in manner that conforms closely to the new house rule35 both rules enforce the paygo requirement over the sixyear and 11 year periods used in the new reconciliation rules described above finally the senate established point of order in the fy2008 budget resolution section 203 of sconres 21 against legislation that would increase the deficit by more than 5 billion in any of the four consecutive 10year intervals beginning with fy2018 in the pending budget resolution for fy2009 the senate proposes to revise the point of order so that it applies to legislation making any increase in the deficit ie without regard to threshold in any of the four consecutive 10year intervals beginning with fy2019 section 201 of sconres 70 the recent rules changes pertaining to deficit control presumably make it much less likely that the senate would consider reconciliation legislation potentially in violation of the byrd rules prohibition against deficit increases beyond the budget window 35 the house paygo rule is discussed in crs report

amended 2 usc 644 there are many pointoforder provisions in titles iii and iv of the act in some instances points of order or waiver motions are made under the act by general reference only such as senator raising point of order under title iii of the act rather than by specific reference to the provisions involved when only general references are made it usually is impossible to determine by reference to debate in the congressional record alone which provision of the act is involved consequently this table reflects only those instances when specific reference was made to section 313 of the act or to the crs39 byrd rule the object of point of order under the byrd rule may be to strike one or more provisions as designated by title or section number or by page and line number in reconciliation measure or conference report thereon or to bar consideration of one or more amendments thereto b provision is regarded as extraneous under the byrd rule if it 1 does not produce change in outlays or revenues 2 produces an outlay increase or revenue decrease when the instructed committee is not in compliance with its instructions 3 is outside of the jurisdiction of the committee that submitted the title or provision for inclusion in the reconciliation measure 4 produces change in outlays or revenues which is merely incidental to the nonbudgetary components of the provision 5 would increase the deficit for fiscal year beyond those covered by the reconciliation measure or 6 recommends changes in social security the byrd rule sets forth specific exceptions to the criteria to determine extraneousness c under the byrd rule successful waiver motion requires the affirmative vote of threefifths of the membership 60 senators if seats are vacant single waiver motion can 1 apply to the byrd rule as well as other provisions of the cba of 1974 2 involve multiple as well as single provisions or amendments 3 extend for specified language through consideration of the conference report as well as initial consideration of the measure or amendment and 4 be made prior to the raising of point of order thus making the point of order moot d on october 24 1985 senator robert c byrd offered an amendment containing the byrd rule to the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act cobra of 1985 which the senate adopted in this form the byrd rule applied to initial senate consideration of reconciliation measures on december 19 1985 the senate adopted sres 286 which extended the application of portions of the provision in cobra of 1985 to conference reports and amendments between the two houses because the enactment of cobra of 1985 was delayed until early 1986 the portion of the byrd rule dealing with conference reports became effective first senate consideration of the conference report on cobra of 1985 and amendments between the two houses thereon occurred beginning on december 19 1985 therefore only the portion of the byrd rule dealing with conference reports and amendments between the two houses applied during the consideration of cobra of 1985 actions were taken under the rule on october 13 1989 during consideration of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1989 the senate adopted mitchell amendment 1004 by voice vote the amendment struck extraneous matter from the bill its stated purpose was to strike all matter from the bill that does not reduce the deficit see the congressional record daily ed of oct 13 1989 p s13349 f the point of order was not sustained against that part of section 7803a proposing new section 2106 of the social security act crs40 appendix text of the byrd rule section 313 of the congressional budget act of 1974 extraneous matter in reconciliation legislation sec 313 in general when the senate is considering reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution pursuant to section 310 whether that bill or resolution originated in the senate or the house or section 258c of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 upon point of order being made by any senator against material extraneous to the instructions to committee which is contained in any title or provision of the bill or resolution or offered as an amendment to the bill or resolution and the point of order is sustained by the chair any part of said title or provision that contains material extraneous to the instructions to said committee as defined in subsection b shall be deemed stricken from the bill and may not be offered as an amendment from the floor b extraneous provisions 1 except as provided in paragraph 2 provision of reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution considered pursuant to section 310 shall be considered extraneous if such provision does not produce change in outlays or revenues including changes in outlays and revenues brought about by changes in the terms and conditions under which outlays are made or revenues are required to be collected but provision in which outlay decreases or revenue increases exactly offset outlay increases or revenue decreases shall not be considered extraneous by virtue of this subparagraph b any provision producing an increase in outlays or decrease in revenues shall be considered extraneous if the net effect of provisions reported by the committee reporting the title containing the provision is that the committee fails to achieve its reconciliation instructions c provision that is not in the jurisdiction of the committee with jurisdiction over said title or provision shall be considered extraneous d provision shall be considered extraneous if it produces changes in outlays or revenues which are merely incidental to the nonbudgetary components of the provision provision shall be considered to be extraneous if it increases or would increase net outlays or if it decreases or would decrease revenues during fiscal year after the fiscal years covered by such reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution and such increases or decreases are greater than outlay reductions or revenue increases resulting from other provisions in such title in such year and f provision shall be considered extraneous if it violates section 310g crs41 2 senateoriginated provision shall not be considered extraneous under paragraph 1a if the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on the budget and the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee which reported the provision certify that the provision mitigates direct effects clearly attributable to provision changing outlays or revenues and both provisions together produce net reduction in the deficit b the provision will result in substantial reduction in outlays or substantial increase in revenues during fiscal years after the fiscal years covered by the reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution c reduction of outlays or an increase in revenues is likely to occur as result of the provision in the event of new regulations authorized by the provision or likely to be proposed court rulings on pending litigation or relationships between economic indices and stipulated statutory triggers pertaining to the provision other than the regulations court rulings or relationships currently projected by the congressional budget office for scorekeeping purposes or d such provisions will be likely to produce significant reduction in outlays or increases in revenues but due to insufficient data such reduction or increase cannot be reliably estimated 3 provision reported by committee shall not be considered extraneous under paragraph 1c if the provision is an integral part of provision or title which if introduced as bill or resolution would be referred to such committee and the provision sets forth the procedure to carry out or implement the substantive provisions that were reported and which fall within the jurisdiction of such committee or b the provision states an exception to or special application of the general provision or title of which it is part and such general provision or title if introduced as bill or resolution would be referred to such committee c extraneous materials upon the reporting or discharge of reconciliation bill or resolution pursuant to section 310 in the senate and again upon the submission of conference report on such reconciliation bill or resolution the committee on the budget of the senate shall submit for the record list of material considered to be extraneous under subsections b1a b1b and b1e of this section to the instructions of committee as provided in this section the inclusion or exclusion of provision shall not constitute determination of extraneousness by the presiding officer of the senate crs42 d conference reports when the senate is considering conference report on or an amendment between the houses in relation to reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution pursuant to section 310 upon 1 point of order being made by an senator against extraneous material meeting the definition of subsections b1a b1b b1d b1e or b1f and 2 such point of order being sustained such material contained in such conference report or amendment shall be deemed stricken and the senate shall proceed without intervening action or motion to consider the question of whether the senate shall recede from its amendment and concur with further amendment or concur in the house amendment with further amendment as the case may be which further amendment shall consist of only that portion of the conference report or house amendment as the case may be not so stricken any such motion in the senate shall be debatable for 2 hours in any case in which such point of order is sustained against conference report or senate amendment derived from such conference report by operation of this subsection further amendment shall be in order general point of order notwithstanding any other law or rule of the senate it shall be in order for senator to raise single point of order that several provisions of bill resolution amendment motion or conference report violate this section the presiding officer may sustain the point of order as to some or all of the provisions against which the senator raised the point of order if the presiding officer so sustains the point of order as to some of the provisions including provisions of an amendment motion or conference report against which the senator raised the point of order then only those provisions including provisions of an amendment motion or conference report against which the presiding officer sustains the point or order shall be deemed stricken pursuant to this section before the presiding officer rules on such point of order any senator may move to waive such point of order as it applies to some or all of the provisions against which the point of order was raised such motion to waive is amendable in accordance with the rules and precedents of the senate after the presiding officer rules on such point of order any senator may appeal the ruling of the presiding officer on such point of order as it applies to some or all of the provisions on which the presiding officer ruled for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30862
