determinations and notwithsta nding the strong congressional support enjoyed by the cdsoa in both chambers3 several efforts to repeal or amend the measure were introduced in the 109th congress first session most recently repeal of the cdsoa was included in s 1932 the deficit reduction act of 2005 which was passed by the senate on november 3 2005 and by the house on november 18 in conference language was negotiated that would repeal the cdsoa as of the date of enactment of the defic it reduction act while allowi ng distribution of duties on all subject merchandise ente red before october 1 2007 the conference report with the cdsoa language included subsequently passed the house on december 19 2005 and the senate on december 21 point of order upheld in the senate against inclusion of medicare and medicaid lang uage in budget bill caused slightly different version of the conf erence report to be passed in the senate therefore the house will need to consider the measure once again

considered later in 2006 in congress the controversy over the by rd amendment is one component of larger debate over the futu re direction of us trad policy although many in congress acknowledge that benefits are recei ved through liberalizing trade there is sometimes disagreement over the proper balance between these benefits and the costs incurred to domestic industries firms and workers by the resulting increase in global competition especially if unfair fo reign competition is perceived or f ound to be the cause of job losses and plant closings an overall assessment of the united states wto membership including issues of us compliance with certain wto dispute settlement rulings deemed controversial by some has already received significant attention in the 109th congress this report discusses the c ontroversy over the cdsoa in three parts first it covers briefly the background of the law its effects and the wto dispute settlement case second it discusses the congressional debate on the pr and cons of repealing the measure third options for congress are discussed background antidumping ad and countervailing duty cvd investigations are triggered by petition filed by an interested party on behalf of an industry4 alleging that the industry is injured or threatened with mate rial injury by reason of imports that are respectively sold in the us market at less than fair value dumped or subsidized in order for the industry to obtain relief tw things must happen 1 the international trade administration ita an agency of the department of commerce must find dumping or subsidization and 2 the international trade commission itc must find that the domestic industry is materially injured or threatened with material injury due to the dumped or subsidized imports these agencies conduct preliminary and final investigations in detailed administrative process with specific time lines5 according to the findings in the cdsoa the legislative intent of the act is to address the issue of foreign products which continue to be dumped or subsidizedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33045crs3 6 19 usc 1675c note 7 149 cong rec s8234 daily ed june 19 2003remarks of sen snowe 8

9 19 usc 1675cb1sales to the us market after an ad or cv duty has already been assessed and in so doing to strengthen the remedial pur pose of antidumping and countervailing duty laws one of the findings underlying th law stated that continued dumping or actionable subsidies can frustrate the remedial purpose of the trade remedy laws by preventing market prices from returning to fair levels which can lead to domestic producers reluctance to rehire employees or otherwise invest in the business in order to remain competitive6 the cdsoa is also somewhat unique as trade policy concept because it holds that the revenue from unfair trade should be used to help those hurt by trade7 prior to its enactment revenue collected as result of ad or cvd orders was deposited in the general fund of the us treasury instead the cdsoa directs the bureau of customs and border protection of the department of home land security cbp to disburse these duties directly to petitioners and interested parties in the investigations that resulted in the orde rs many find the measure controversial therefore because they believe that it adds level of protection on subject us products in addition to the ameliorative action afforded by trade remedies some also find the measure controve rsial because it was enacted without committee or floor amendment in either house the measure was inserted into the agriculture rural development food and drug administr ation and related agencies appropriations act 2001 pl 106387 by senator robert byrd conferee to the appropriations bill similar legi slation had been intr oduced in the 105th congress hr 2509 regula s 2281 dewine and the 106th congress hr 842 regula s 61 dewine but these bills died in committee when president clinton signed the appropriations measure he noted the insertion of the amendment saying this bill will provide select us industries with subs idy above and beyond the protection level needed to counteract foreign subsidies and called on congress to repeal or amend the provision8 cdsoa procedure the cdsoa requires cbp to distribute all duties collected pursuant to ad or cvd orders to affected domestic producers defined in the act as any manufacturer producer farmer rancher or worker repres entative including associations of these individuals that was 1 petitioner or in terested party in support of petition that resulted in an ad or cvd order and 2 remains in operation9 distributions under the act may be used to offset qualifying expenditures within the following categories that the domestic producer incurred between the

the cdsoa distribution process the international trade commission sends list to cbp of petitione rs and interested parties in support of each investigation generally indicated by letter of support for ad or cvd petitions or through affirmative responses to itc stionnaires cbp then publishes notice of intent to distribute the offset along with list of affected domestic producers eligible for distributions and the estimate d amount available to them at least 30 days prior to the offset distribution date11 in order to receive payment each company on the list must demonstrate that it is eligible to receive an offset disbursement and must certify that it has qualifying expenditu res incurred for which distributions have not yet been paid12 cbp places all estimated antidumping and countervailing duties that are deposited with cpb directly into cl earing accounts an account is assigned individually to each antidumping or count ervailing duty order unde r which duties are collected13 when the goods are liquidated and th duty is finally paid the funds are distributed into special accounts also identified by the individual ad or cvd orders from which offset payment to indi vidual claimants are paid the total amount of offset payments disbursed is limited by the total amount of duties in the special account for each case14 as consequence of th is limitation the actual payments made often cover only minimal portion of each claim involved for example in fy2004 more than 19 trillion in claims from certified intere sted parties were received while 284 million or

antidumping duties could be imposed was rejected by the us court of appeals for the federal circuit in march 200323 in july 2004 the federal circuit held that company that opposed an antidumping investigation ma not make cdsoa claims on behalf of an otherwise qualified producer that th company has acquired24 at issue was 19 usc 1675cb1 which provides that companie s businesses or persons who have been acquired by company or business that is related to company that opposed the investigation shall not be an affected domestic producer characterizing the provision as hardly model of clarity25 the court nonetheless found that the purpose of the law was quite clear to bar opposers of antidumping investigations from securing payments either directly or through the acquisition of supporting parties26 as result the court concluded th at the provision should be interpreted to bar claims on behalf of company that was acquired by company that opposed the investigation or broadly company ac quired by any busine ss related to such company27 in march 2005 the federal ci rcuit held that the cdsoa did not supersede the confidentiality provisions of 777 of the tariff act of 1930 19 usc 1677f

commodityagainst dumping and subsidization as the case may be except for action taken in accordance with the gatt 1994 as interpreted by the respective agreement34 the complainants also argued that the payments provided strong incentive to the domestic producers to file or support pe titions for antidumping or antisubsidy measures thereby distorting the applicati on of the standing requirements in the antidumping and scm agreements35 these provisions requi re specified level of domestic industry support for an antidumpi ng or countervailin g petition before an investigation may be initiated complainants further argued that the cdsoa makes it more difficult for exporters subject to an antidumping or countervailing duty order to secure an undertaking with the compet ent authorities ie suspension agreement since the affected domestic producers will have vested interest in opposing such undertakings in favor of the collection of antidumping or countervailing duties36 in addition to the arguments just descri bed mexico also challenged the statute as such claiming that the payments di stributed under the act constituted specific subsidies as defined in article 1 of the scm agreement which may cause adverse effects to mexicos interests in the form of nullification and impairment of benefits37 article 5 of the scm agreement allows wto members to challenge so called actionable subsidies that is subs idies other than those prohibited under the agreement where the subsidy is shown to be specific to an industry and causes the type of adverse effects specified in the

the panels finding that the statute created specific action against dumping and subsidization not allowed under wto agreements but reversed the panel on its conclusion regard ing industr support requirements40 the appellate body concluded that specific action against dumping and subsidization existed for pur poses of article 181 of the antidumping agreement and article 321 of the scm agr eement because the statute fulfilled two basic elements of the above quoted phrase first th cdsoa constituted specific action because offset payments were found to be inextricably linked to and strongly correlated with determination of dumping or determination of subsidy or as alternatively characterized by the ab the payments can be made only following determination that the constituent elem ents of dumping or subsidization are present41 second the ab stated th at measure would be cons idered to be an action against dumping or subsidization if it has the effect of dissuading the practice of dumping or the practice of subsidization or creates an incentive to terminate such practices42 the ab found that given its design and structure the cdsoa effects transfer of financial resources from the producersexporters to their domestic competitors and as result the requisite incentives are created43 since the cdsoa did not take the form of the respons to dumping or s ubsidization permitted under wto agreements the ab concluded th at the statute fell within the scope of the prohibitions in abovecited articles44 the appellate body recommended only that the united

the united states see crs report rl32014 wto dispute settlement status of us compliance in pending cases by jeanne j grimmettto ensure that global trade flows more easily predictably and freely the wto serves as forum for multilateral trade negotiations and the settlement of disputes96 questions may arise as to the overall benefit of wto dispute settlement which theunited states has used to ensure that us exporters receive open access and fair treatment in foreign markets 97 but which has also resulted in rulings that various us laws regulations and regulatory actions particularly in the trade remedy area are violative of wto agreements98 us trade policy is also inextricably related to us foreign policy interests some observers are concerned that us leadership in this arena could be compromised by us noncompliance with certain wto obligations and may cause strains in us relations with nations that are essential for achieving other foreign policy objectives this section provides an analysis of issu congress is likely to consider as it debates the pros and cons of repealing the cdsoa from these perspectives economic considerations trade remedy actions in general are source of controversy among economists and other policy makers some believe that the cdsoa increases the level of economic inefficiency brought about by thes actions while others assert that the small amount of inefficiency brought about by the measure is worth the cost of preserving us industries nd jobs adversely affected by unfair trading practices what follows is an analysis of the economic arguments by both supporters and opponents of the cdsoa opposing viewpoints most economists support the most efficient allocation of resources in an economy therefore they believe that trade liberalization provides for optimal domestic and global economic welfare because nations are able to specialize in the pr oduction and export of pr oducts in which they have comparative advantage in terms of costs and resources and buy or import products for which they do not have an dvantage economic theory indicates that these benefits accrue even if country unila terally lowers its barriers to trade

how we can make our trade laws work for americas small businesses remarks of mr wallace smith manufacturing company incthat countries that impose trade barrier s are the ones that are harmed the most economically99 therefore most economists believe that trade remedy actions the vast majority of which are ad or cvd cases in and of themselves introduce inefficiencies in both domestic and international economies that result in decreased economic welfare some economists hold that if other countries and firms decide to subsidize or dump goods at lower cost in the us market it amounts to an additional benefit to the us economy in the long run especially if the practice continues over time most analysts however acknowledge that allowances for certain amount of inefficiency resulting from trade remedies mu st be made in orde r to maintain public support for trade liberalizati on others argue that effi ciency is secondary when preserving industries considered critical to us national and economic security interests however opponent s of the cdsoa assert that the measure provides type of doubl remedy to domestic producers thus enhancing the economic inefficiency of ad and cvd actions injury to downstream industries trade remedy actions often lead to price increases on targeted goods many of which are industrial inputs used by other domestic industries to the extent that the cdsoa encourages domestic producers to file additional ad or cvd claims the measure also contributes to these price increases downstream industries for example the auto mobile nd housing industries which use steel and lumber to manufacture their products bear the cost of trade remedies in the form of highercost inputs for their products as result these industries may have to raise the price of their goods at recent house small business committee hearing for example manufacturer of specialty automotive parts complained that inflated prices for steel inputs broug ht about in part by trade remedy actions caused unintended colla teral damage which threatened his business100 in addition since the eu and canada ve already begun retaliating against us exports products targeted for increased du ties may also become uncompetitive in the receiving market therefore many ec onomists contend that the cdsoa while providing benefit to many domestic firm s injured by dumping or subsidies may in turn cause injury to us downstream producers exporters and ultimately consumers distribution of benefits according to congressional budget office cbo memorandum on the cdsoa the stat ute may lead to unequal distribution ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33045crs25 101 economic analysis of the conti nued dumping and subsidy act of 2000 congressional budget office march 2 2004 http

industry that could gi ve some firms an advantage over domestic as well as global competitors101 first according to the cdsoa only the firms in support of an ad or cvd petition resulting in an ad or cv duty order are eligible to r eceive disbursements therefore even though all companies in an industry that producing the targeted product may benefit from the re medial effect of trade re medy action companies are only eligible for cdsoa payments if they are able to certify that they supported the initial investigation those producers within the industry who decide not to support the trade remedy action could be placed at disadvantage vis vis their domestic competitors102 additionally due to the considerable tr ansaction costs involved in filing and supporting trade remedy petitions estima ted to range from 500000 for the simplest case to millions of dollars for more complex ones it is possible that more efficient firms in an industry might be less likely to support trade remedy petition thus opponents argue the cdsoa mechanism could adversely affect the more efficient firms in domestic industry while more inefficient firms receive benefit103 for these reasons the decisions of u s manufacturers in some industries to pursue ad or cvd investigations have cause d intense and vocal debate within the domestic industry as whole for example when some us furniture makers and worker unions decided to file petiti on on wooden bedroom furniture from china many larger furniture retailers strongly object ed saying that they would lose jobs and business on the retail side if the petition went forwar d while producers maintained that far more manufacturing jobs were being lost than would be lost on the retail side of the business104 in this particular case many us furniture manufacturers in support of the investigation speculated that the cost of lost business from us retailers in retaliation for their support may well exceed the combined benefit of the ad order and cdsoa disbursements105 according to the cbo cdsoa payments may also reduce the receiving industrys incentive to take the necessary steps to remain competitive such as changing the product mix or developing mo re efficient methods of production since the affected industry only qualifies for dis bursements as long as it manufactures particular product fi rms may decide to produce the good longer than it is efficient to do so rather than allocating resources to producing alternativ products that couldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33045crs26 106 economic analysis of the conti nued

competitiveness106 because cdsoa payments are also linked to production costs firms may be encour aged to increase output beyond the levels signaled by market incentives ultimately driving down the cost of the product107 supporting viewpoints many members have w itnessed the substantial benefits that the cdsoa has conferred on industries and wo rkers in their states and congressional districts in february 2005 hearing before the us china economic and security review commi ssion some members testifie d that the cdsoa enabled us firms many of them small familyrun companies to purchase new machinery hire more workers and compete headtohead with unfairly traded imports from china108 supporters of the cdsoa believe that us producers are facing an uneven playing field due to price discrimination and artificial competitive advantage brought about by unfairly dumped or subsidized im ports continued dumping of the targeted merchandise causes us produc ts to remain less comp etitive despite additional duties assessed therefore supporters believe that the cdsoa creates an additional disincentive for foreign exporters to c ontinue dumping and compensates domestic producers with financial resources that can be used to maintain competitiveness proponents of this view belie ve that trade remedies combined with the added benefit provided by the cdsoa are wort h the cost of the economic inefficiency because they promote trade fairness re store competitive balance and preserve critical us industries and jobs supporte rs believe that many countries limit outside competition in their ec onomies by creating sanctuary markets limiting both domestic and international competition thus enabling chosen firms to charge higher prices for goods at home to offset the lower pri ces charged in the foreign market at the expense of industrie s abroad that produce similar merchandise therefore some supporters believe that trade remedy actions combined with the cdsoa may actually encourage international trade by providing an interface mechanism between two radica lly different economic systems109 some recent economic research also suggests that the cdsoa could actually lead to higher welfare for the domestic economy as well as lower overall antidumping duties if the goal of adminis trative authorities is to provide affected domestic industries with high er cdsoa payments according to this theory since the cdsoa gives the duty revenue to the dom estic industry the affected industry is interested in receiving the proceeds from ad or cvd action as well as profits if administrative authorities nd policy makers are in turn concerned about thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33045crs27 110 collie david r and vandenbussche hylke antidumping duties and the byrd

greater revenues could be collected by the industry and lower tr ade remedy duties could reduce the overall economic inefficiency of the actions110 however since the congressional intent of the cdsoa and trade remedy actions in general seems to be to discourage rather than encourage continued dumping of s ubject merchandise modifications to the existing statutes would be required if increased duty proceeds were desired wto and other trade concerns many policymakers believe that multilateral rulesbased trading system that enhances predictability and progressively reduces barriers to trade is desirable many also believe that the wto dispute settlement mechanism of which the united states was primary architect is unique and effective means toward achieving that end because it helps ensure that wto members trade practices are consistent with their gattwto commitments those who share this view believe that us compliance with wto rulings is an important demonstration of us credibility and leadership in the global economy and w ill in turn generate increased confidence in the multilateral trading system dispute panels overreached although cdsoa supporters do not necessarily disagree with the value of th wto or its dispute settlement mechanism some believe that in the cdsoa ruling wto panels overreached by creating obligations for the united states beyond those agreed to according to this view the panels violated article 32 of the wto dispute settlement u nderstanding dsu which states that recommendations and rulings of the dispute settlement body cannot add to or diminish rights and obliga tions in the covered agreements these supporters believe that the wto panels infringed on us sovereignty by mandating an uncalledfor change to us laws and in addition encroached on the constitutional authority of the us congress to d ecide how government revenues should be spent111 moreover supporters argue that ce the complaining parties were unable to demonstrate sufficiently that their economies suffered nullification or impairment through cdsoa implementation the measur should have been found to be in compliance with wto obligations112 those who favor cdsoa repeal respond that the united states along with other wto members agreed voluntarily to limit the means by which they would shield affected industries from the effect s of import competition including unfair trade when they agreed to join the wto furthermore as the appellate body report states the dsu provides th at where violation of any wto agreement is foundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33045crs28 113 cdsoa appellate body report supra note 40 at 104 cd soa panel report supra note 39 81 84 see dsu art 38 which states in cases where there is an infringement of the obligations assumed under

httpiaitadocgovstatssuspensionsindexhtml 116 cdsoa panel report supra note 39 at 318there is normally presumption that the violation has an adverse impact on other parties to the agreement thus they sa the panel properly found that the cdsoa nullifies or impairs benefits accruing to the complaining parties even if they could not demonstrate actual economic impairment113 discourages suspension agreements some who favor cdsoa repeal also believe that the law may discourage administrative authorities from accepting alternative arrangements to trade remedy actions such as mutually agreedupon suspension agreements or quantitative restrictions also called price undertakings in the wto agreements these observers belie ve that if the aff ected industry expects to receive cdsoa disburseme nts petitioners might put pressure on administrative authorities not to negotiate or accept suspension agreements such alternative arrangements are favored by many wto members because they seem to inflict lesser amount of econo mic damage on the exporting industry and by many economists because they ma reduce the overall level of economic inefficiency in the global trading system114 the united states for example has in force ten such agreements known in us law as suspension agreements including alternative measures on hotrolled steel imports from brazil and russia cuttolength carbon steel plate from russia and ukraine and tomatoes imported from mexico115 some of the complaining parties in th wto dispute argued that the united states violated this provision in the wto agreements however the dispute settlement panel rejected their arguments on the grounds that both the antidumping and scm agreements stipulate that member countries acceptance of such alternative measures is strictly voluntary additi onally wto panels found that us law requires the consideration of the intere sts of all parties including downstream industries and consumers befo re accepting such an agreement116 concern of emulation when the cdsoa was enacted some supporters of trade liberalization predicted that the availability of cdsoa disbursements would provide direct incentive for us import competing industries to file ad and cvdhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33045crs29 117 economic analysis of the conti nued dumping and subsidy act of 2000 congressional budget office march 2 2004 http wwwcbogov p 5 118

remedy action httpwwwwtoorgenglishtratop_eadp_eadp_ehtmstatisticspetitions in country that was already one of the most aggressive users of trade remedies117 initially it seemed as if this pr ediction might be accurate as us ad and cvd initiations jumped from 54 in 2000 to 94 in 2001 however us initiations actually dropped in 2002 to 39 nd the number was only slightly higher in 2003 with 41 initiations118 therefore there is little evidence to suggest that the cdsoa in itself has led to an escalation of total us ad or cvd petitions one reason that the number of us trade remedy initiations has not increased may be that for most industries the tran saction costs involved in filing ad and cvd petitions far outweigh the add itional benefits received even if cdsoa payments are factored in although few businesses ve received millions of dollars in annual payments including the roller bearin gs steel seafood pineapple and candle industries the vast percentage of compan ies received much less for example of the more than 500 companies that recei ved cdsoa payments in fy2004 only about 100 received more than 100000 few compan ies that filed fo r disbursements in fy2004 found that they had been overpaid in previous years and were liable to pay back the difference some observers have also expressed c oncern that other countries might follow the us example and establish similar ws thus exacerbating an already apparent increase in trade remedy actions worldwide prior to 2001 in this view such increases could be harmful to us exports and increase the decline in international economic welfare already brought about by trade reme dy actions however to date other wto member has adopted similar laws nd ad and cvd initiations have declined worldwide from total of 393 in 2001 to 319 in 2002 and to 246 in 2003119 some observers believe that the decline in trade remedy actions is only temporary however and attribute it to international restraint pending talks on trade remedies in the doha round doha development ag enda negotiations some believe that it may be in the us interest to comply with the byrd amendment ruling in view of larger us goals in the ongoing doha round of wto mu ltilateral negotiations especially if the united states seeks to fend off major m odifications to the antidumping or scm agreements since many countries regard trade remedy reform as make or break issue in terms of their acceptance of any final doha deve lopment agenda dda agreement some observers believe that lack of action on cdsoa repeal could weaken the us position in the ongoing trade remedy negotiations this could be problematic because the gap in negotiatin g positions between the united states and other wto countries on trade remedies is large and may be difficult to

believe that the ustr did not expend very much effort in attempting to keep trade remedy ne gotiations off the table in the dda120 this perception combined with the bush adminis trations repeatedly declared support for cdsoa repeal may have contributed to increased resistance in of some in congress toward wto rulings and proposals that might weaken us trade remedy laws in general and repeal of the cdsoa in particular many cdsoa supporters favor seeking negotiated change to the antidumping agreement in dda talks that would per mit all wto members to distribute duties collected pursuant to ad or cvd action121 this is the approach congress instructed the bush administration to take as part of the 2004 and 2005 omnibus appropriations many cdsoa supporters believe that th is is the proper approach to follow if there is genuine concern that dispute settlement panels created additional obligations for the united states in the cdsoa ruling other trade agreements and issues the united states has entered into free trade agreements ftas with four of the complaining parties in the cdsoa dispute canada mexico australia and chile and is actively pursuing trade agreements with others including thailand us trade remedy policy in general and the cdsoa in particular might dampen the economic welfare effects accruing to us businesses investors and consumers from these ftas due to higher costs brought about by the measure and eventual retaliation even as these ftas have led to significant tariff reductions on both sides with respect to canada the possible availability for disbursement to us lumb er producers of several billion dollars in antidumping and countervailing duties on canadian softwood lumber has added complexities to the resolution of the ongoing dispute between the united states and canada over lumber trade secondly the bush administration has of ten used access to the us market in general and trade agreements in par ticular to promote economic growth and development in lesser devel oped countries preferentia l market access is provided to many countries including some of the complaining parties in the cdsoa dispute through the generalized system of prefer ences gsp and other programs with view toward fostering economic and govern mental stability for example indonesia and thailand both complainants in the cds oa dispute are also countries that the 911 commission identified as vulnerable to penetration by antiamerican islamic terrorist groups122 although it is unclear that thes or other nations have actually suffered monetary nullification or impairment as result of the cdsoa the act is seen by some as potentially counter productive to us economic development goals in some developing nations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33045crs31 123 for further discussion see crs report rs22154 wto decisions and their effect in us law by jeanne j grimmett conclusion and options for congress the adoption of wto panel and appellate body repor ts by the wto dispute settlement body cannot in itself effect change in us law123 in this case statute has been found to be in violation of wt agreements since the executive branch cannot amend or remove the measur under existing statutory authorities congressional action would be needed to do so under wto rules withdrawal of violative measure is ordinarily the ma in objective of wto dispute settlement proceeding nevertheless defending mber may choose to seek other avenues of resolving dispute if the member doe s not comply by the end of an established compliance period however it may also become subject to sanctions until the measure is removed according to wto rules however any retaliation must be temporary lasting only as long as member is not in compliance or until mutually satisfactory arrangement is reached if the cdsoa remains in force in its current form it will continue to be part of us trade remedy law and import competing industries that are parties to successful ad and cvd petitions will conti nue to receive benefits under the act however since two of the complaining parties accounting for large percentage of us exports have already taken steps towa rd retaliation us ex porters could begin to experience the effects of retaliation in midtolate 2005 these exporters may then begin to lobby congress for cdsoa repeal were the statute to be repealed the united states would be in compliance with the wto rulings and any retaliation that has begun would need to cease at the same time cdsoa repeal could lead to additional if temporary instability to import competing industries already identified as vulnerable because they may have become dependent on cdsoa disburse ments to some degree were congress to consider gradual reduction of benefits over time complaining parties may still view the remaining benefits as wtoinconsistent and may continue to retaliate as long as the amended measure remains in place however the administration might be able to negotiate mutually satisfactory arrangemen t with the complaining parties provided full repeal of the measure were assured at the end of the process repeal of the cdsoa itself would do nothing to affect other us ad or cvd laws procedures or actions and domestic indus tries would continue to be nefit from these measures in the event the cdsoa were repealed congress might at the same time establish another program in its place that would deal in some other way with the adverse effects of international trade on firms workers and communities in way that might be considered wtocompliant s 1299 snowe the trade for americas communities act introduced in th 108th congress sought to repeal the cdsoa and deposit the duties instead into community trade readjustment and development enhancement trust fund th at would assist communities adversely affected by unfair trade many cdsoa s upporters maintained that this approach along with similar proposals to expand tr

dislocation after damage had occurred as evident in recent appropriations legislation congress has also favored negotiations leading to recognition of the existing right of wto members to distribute collected ad and cv duties in manner similar to the cdsoa this course of action is favor ed by many importcompeting business associations according to industry sources124 if wto members agreed the united states along with all other members w ould have the option expressly supported by the wto of disbursing ad or cv duties to affected co mpanies or earmarking them for other uses many economists are concerned however that replication of the measure by other countries could lead to multiplicati on of inefficient trade remedy actions worldwide
