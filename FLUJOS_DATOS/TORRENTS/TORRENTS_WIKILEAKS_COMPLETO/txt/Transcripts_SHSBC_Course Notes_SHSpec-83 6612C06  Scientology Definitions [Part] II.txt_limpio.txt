6612c06 shspec83 scientology definitions part ii for the first time in known history there is ethics you cant lie to do people in and get away with it in scientology people who protest ethics say who determines who is suppressive that is easy suppressives have definite characteristics this universe got formed and is going to pieces on suppression an organized minority is all that has been making this universe mess it could have been good universe but ethics would have had to go in early and because thetans were acting as individuals and suppression was organized all we have to do is reverse it so that thetans without forgoing independence can organize the other side just little bit we are eventually going to become an organized majority we already have numerical superiority also they cant think straight we have overt intentions towards suppressives we are just trying to go about our business but you yourself should not go out of your way to obtain amusement by the torturing of sps simply because their valence is there to slip into the mocking up of suns is far more fun but when you do it do good job analytical mind this could be anything that thetan set up which collected data and used it to resolve problems the basic purpose of the mind is the resolution of problems relating to survival now if thetan does this you could say he is mind an analytical mind cannot exist independent of thetan man has been so caved in on the subject of the reactive mind which he knew not wot of of which he was not aware that he now discredits the whole idea of mind he says ill just do it all myself reactive mind reactive mind is an unwanted unknowing series of computations which bring about an effect on the individual and those around him it contains things like the computation all horses sleep in beds it is an obsessive stratum of unknown unseen uninspected data that is forcing solutions unknown and unsuspected on the person it is subawareness activity an analytical mind could be of use to an operating thetan it could exist if it was knowing and willing mechanism for instance much of dianetics and scientology was resolved by the construction of philosophical machines something you would draw up which would give some data that you could then combine with some other data and get some answer but you are setting down and lining up the data you are just doing think which is recorded so that you can knowingly observe relationship of data and get an answer so an analytical mind is knowing and willing resolution of problems related to survival this can get you in trouble when it is of lasting duration when it is set up to run forever without inspection and observation an analytical mind cannot exist without inspection and observation an astronomical computer being operated by competent scientist could be likened to the analytical mind but without inspection and observation an analytical mind would become reactive the reactive mind is like the opposite of the analytical mind it is like computer that uninspected picks up the data to resolve problems that had not been suspected and turns out answers that uninspected then by law become total effect upon population ie to avoid reactivity you must retain the option of total monitoring total circuit like an automatic elevator may still be analytical if it can be inspected the human body falls into the class of machines that operate without understanding such machine where thetan does not know how or why it operates is reactive the fellow who is there doesnt know when it is going to get sick or quit the body line is running uninspected and it is aberrative it has reactions and effects upon the thetan that he cannot predict it is an aberrative machine because it is running uninspected it has instruction book this is major omission beware of buying bodies without directions in them so willingness and inspection is what makes the difference between the analytical and the reactive minds the difference between dianetics and scientology is that one scientology increases the awareness of the thetan and the other dianetics just erases the bank the trouble you run into in disseminating comes from peoples lack of awareness of the reactive mind you have to show it to them if you handle persons reactive mind directly you get the situation where the person was not aware that he had lumbosis and is not now aware that it is gone the way you handle reactive mind is to increase the thetans awareness of it so he can control it it ceases to be reactive when you are talking about the analytical and the reactive mind you are talking about the awareness level of the individual only the reactive mind is opposed to the thetan the analytical mind is mind that is temporarily set up willingly and knowingly to assist in the resolution of problems problems inevitably relate to survival and anything hes set up to do this of which he was aware and which was inspected would be included under the rubric of analytical mind committee set up to get data and to coordinate the activities of another area or body of factory or something like that would be the mind of that factory even though they are thetans doing it in fact they would have to be thetans doing it for it to be analytical one of the reasons why you should know policy is that otherwise the solutions and combinations unknown to you make it have an effect on you because it is somewhat reactive if policy isnt inspected and reformed to meet the condition of operation it too would become reactive mind as with us government law from the point of view of the society scientology is somewhat reactive mind to the degree that they are not aware of our existence or our effect if scientology had evil intentions it would be very easy to operate on subrosa level however it would be bad for the planet on the whole it is hard anyway for society at its low awareness level to be aware of scientology it is likewise hard for them to be aware of thetan thetan should probably go by the rule never explain dont feel that you need to explain your motives to others when you dont intend to hide them their level of awareness of you is already so low that explaining wont help at all after all they cant tell your motives be as obvious plain and straightforward as you like but if the ordinary evidences which lie around them dont justify your actions then theres sense in explaining it to the person whos challenging them he wouldnt be able to understand them anyway any analytical mind can become reactive mind so setting up an analytical mind is always dangerous to some degree power the amount of force that can be applied in unit of time actually the physical definition states that power is the amount of work that can be accomplished in unit of time power has the connotation of being potential unlike force which is actual power doesnt necessarily mean the use of force power is not exerted whereas force tends to be therefore person is powerful when he is able to use force not when he is or isnt using force but if he is forceful he is using force right now the smarter person gets the less he employs force to get others to change their opinions etc implant unwilling unknowing receipt of think an implant is an intentional wreck of somebodys ability to make pictures perceive and remember its intentional an intentional installation of fixed ideas contrasurvival to the thetan in an implant someone is intentionally giving the thetan perceptions and ideas all hypnotism is is restimulation of past implants engram those perceptions unknowingly contained in the force duress pain and unconsciousness of an incident this is not the same as an implant because it is not necessarily intentional for one thing intent is the difference the person makes mental image picture by his reaction to an experience he goes out stop it in the process of doing this hes made sort of stuck wave because he didnt prevent it and just as you would make an embossed impression of something he embosses the environment if you were to press your hand against brick for split second you would have picture of the brick and moment or so later you would have the indentations of the brick because you pushed something at the brick similarly if you pull on rope you make an impression this would be analogous to secondary the thetan pushes back against what is pushing him or he pulls in against what is leaving him it is at the point where he resisted the motion most that he gets stuck thetan can make and exert energy when he tries to fend something off or hold something in he pushes or pulls back against something he gets picture of the moment when his resistance was great that could be an engram secondary lock or implant problem intention counterintention goal countergoal or purpose counterpurpose goals problem mass the gpm is so named because when there are two intentions counteropposed one has problem and the opposed forces or goals tend to produce mass the russians statement of this is dialectic materialism that all ideas are born out of the meeting of two forces that is backwards when two ideas oppose each other they create force that shows you where they are on the tone scale if you hit guy hard enough hell think gpms consist of pairs of opposing ideas two opposing ideas produce mass the thetan cannot asis either side hence the mass remains the mass of gpm is mental energy mass but it can be in the physical universe too pandeterminism and selfdeterminism pandeterminism is the ability to see or asis both sides of conflict or problem if one is totally pandetermined he has mental mass because hes seen both sides of everything he can see two ideas at once even though they are opposed selfdeterminism is laudable because it is rare but it is not as good as pandeterminism if guy justifies what he does you know immediately that he is selfdetermined not pandetermined this is the quickest test there is wholly reactive person will oppose any idea put to him conservative or reactionary tends to be against everything you propose so if you give him his own ideas you give him problem because his first impulse is to be against them cf symptom prescription and the interpersonalists this is such horrible thing to do that it is normally looked upon as fightin words like you think youre pretty good dont you you have made the guy resist his own ideas the above type of person is on lowerscale mockery of pandeterminism he can carry out raging argument with second person that doesnt say word the whole time like well youre going to say and you think but there is ability of thetan that doesnt have lowerscale mockery or exaggeration emotion response by wavelength affecting as individual or another which produces sensation and state of mind intention something which one wishes or intends to do it is an impulse towards something it is an idea that one is going to accomplish something he means to do it affinity affinity has nothing to do with emotion its the ability to occupy the space of or be like or similar to or to express willingness to be something i like you means i would just as soon be you i would just as soon occupy your space when two individuals dont like each other they wont occupy each others space or viewpoint they dont want to be like the other person etc dissimilarity must exist when this becomes sufficiently strong person enforcedly becomes like the other fellow which is an overwhelm home universe the universe thetan made for himself here we find the rock which we audited for and assessed out meaning shape of something on which we could then run process we had in the past theory that it was the first object on the track that the fellow had made we would run fiveway help on it and make fast stable release of very high order religion religion means basically the search for truth deddedex deduced something or other it means that the overtmotivator sequence went backwards deddedex is the overtmotivator sequence wrongway to so that you hit joe and then he hits you thats deddedex the original connotation was that although it went this way you had it figured out that he must have hit you first so you invented something that he did to you to motivate your hitting him its phony overtmotivator sequence it is what guy does to justify an unmotivated overt it means the overt act explained the fact of having hit someone without provocation plus means of explaining having hit him is the deddedex after you commit the first action you invent something to explain it deddedex deeddeed explained somatic mind this idea was added to the first book by donald h rogers john w campbell and the publisher i found it in the glossary so there it is its the mind that runs the body independent of the body and the reactive mind it is physical coordination switchboard system in view of the fact that we dont know how it runs we really have business declaring the existence of mind that we dont really know about the early introduction to dmsmh with the part about the wheel and the arch describes the book its first line was written by walter winchell and the rest was written by the publisher anchor point something the thetan put out to make space buttered all over the universe very badly disoriented and dispersed when someone in this case condition is asked to spot spots where he is an improper process the proper process is to have him spot spots where he is not he will point all over the universe this is the reaction of this very dispersed case to this question from which this term is taken he will think that he is everywhere it is an im over there case perhaps this condition comes from leaving anchor points all over the place and appearing in one or another of these points tiger drill one of the drills that has been adequately discussed in bulletins it uses tiger as nonreactive word see pp 295295a above computation to figure out 2 x 2 4 computing psychosis one who from his psychosis figurefigures hes inconstant in his conduct hes computive hes got crazy explanation hes obsessively solving problem that doesnt exist dramatizing psychotic one patterned action which is insane and which the person runs over and over when he is not doing that particular action the dramatizing psychotic is remarkably sane he is consistent in his conduct arbitrary something introduced into the situation without regard to the data of the situation arbitrary means stand alone someone says x must be done or x is true if that is introduced without observation without any refutation of what was there previously into formula situation admin action of line it will cause ripple this ripple then needs to be solved so someone else will introduce an arbitrary solution to the introduced arbitrary it leads to further arbitraries being introduced to handle resultant outnesses this is the stuck five held down five phenomenon an urgent action may be an arbitrary as in the tech of handling an urgent directive see p 785 above this must be replaced by something based on observed fact it is only in force until data can be gotten an example of an arbitrary would be an education that boy never understood like an education without purpose harmonics any wavelength action or scale has reverberations up and down by doubles or halves in the field of art it means agreement with in scientology upper harmonics refers to welloff cases in scientology it means similarity or repetition of something at higher or lower point on scale lower harmonic is lower similarity which is nutty related to higher harmonic this is based on the tendency of wavelength to repeat itself the lower you go in terms of awareness the more weird the repetition is in music it means coaction or similar action like resonating strings for instance lower harmonic of figuring out math table is doodling it is similar action but less aware therefore harmonics apply to the awareness scale the term lowerscale mockery expresses the idea of harmonics more usefully for our purposes ridicule is based on this you can feel that your ideas are crazy even if they are not if you hear them expressed or mocked by nut or true believer like caricature i was trying to figure out what to do with the org i was trying to figure out what england would do by trying to figure out what she should do to straighten things out politically i was trying to figure out which way this was going to go to figure out if i should expand the organization or whether to enter dollars into the country or hold them out and i ran into guy outside the door who said that he was disraeli and was going to help england
