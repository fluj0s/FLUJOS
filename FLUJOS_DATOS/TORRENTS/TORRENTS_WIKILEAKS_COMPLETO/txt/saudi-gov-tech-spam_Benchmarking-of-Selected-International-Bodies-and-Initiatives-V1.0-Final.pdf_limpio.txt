messaging exemptions or restrictions address harvesting and dictionary attacks 232 enforcement while having the appropriate legislation is indeed necessary implementation and application of the law is fundamental particular attention in the context of spam should be given to national coordination sanctions empowerment of enforcemen t authorities and crossborder enforcement cooperation 233 industry

their implementation method w ill be entirely successful in isolation when number of antispam technologies are effectively used in collaboration with one another the effect can be to drastically reduce the level of sp am impacting system 235 education and awareness comprehensive antispam strategy must ensure that the enduser who is the final recipient of spam the possible victim of viruses and scams and at the same time the person who has control over their computer and personal informatio n is sufficiently educated and aware of how to deal with spam and other online threats educati on and awareness raising activities are needed in large enterprises small and medium enter prises for residential users and in education establishments they must aim to create culture f security and

page 14 of 104 confidential internal use only 3 executive summary spam represents major annoyance and threat to ict applications users and is spreading into all means of communications like mobile phones facsimi transmissions and spammers are always on highalert to exploit any new technology in order f or them to achieve their goals many countries regional and international organiza tions bodies and working groups have taken steps to deal with the issue of spam antispam policy fr ameworks have been used in number of countries to combat spam and many other countries re considering developing such frameworks as saudi arabia is willing to develop an antispam framework and besides benchmarking against other countries it was necessary to identify the w ellknown international bodies involved in the figh t against spam reviewing and analyzing their outstan ding practices and guidelines and ultimately adapting and using this information as base to he lp in developing the antispam framework in the kingdom of saudi arabia examples of those internat ional bodies are the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd the internatio nal telecommunication union itu the anti phishing working group apwg the messaging antia buse working group maawg and others the review was structured according to oecd recomme ndations thus this document reviews examines and extracts the best practices developed by the various international bodies in the followin g areas regulatory approach enforcement cooperation industry driven initiatives technical solutions education and awareness initiatives spam measurement and international cooperation and exchange leading practices and recommendations released by t hose international bodies where applicable have been summarized below regulatory the development of antispam legislation that tackl spam is fundamental legislation sets clear directions on what is allowed and what is not allow ed since spam horizontally spans multiple areas it touches upon telecommunication services consumer protection security and privacy at national and crossborder levels the antispam regulatory framework has multiple sub components and according to oecd it is recommended that the antispam regulatory framework is broken down into elements which should be considered as far as possible taking int account each countrys institutional and legal framework these elements are technical elements consent privacy commercial elements bulk content fair trade criminal or pornographic conte nt damage requirements for legitimate messaging exemptions or restrictions and address harvesting and dictionary attacks even with these almost agreedon elements in place typically we find zones of divergence in legal approaches to spam these differences often derive from diverg ing views on what constitutes permissible communication or the most efficient way to achieve enforcement examples of points of divergence are the consent requirements shall the consent be obtained prior to sending message is one benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 15 of 104 confidential internal use only message considered as spam or only if sent in bulk enforcement that is who is permitted to recover for or prosecute violations of the law and in particular whether private entities such as isps and spam recipients may recover damages unfortunately there is common definition for sp am and according to itu and oecd there are widespread typical features distinguishing spam m essage namely an electronic message with false or hidden origins having non valid unsubscri be option carrying illegal or offensive content utilising of addresses without the owners consent and sent in bulk or repetitively what outcomes should be achieved by the antispam l egislation and what are the characteristics of successful antispam legislation according to oecd an antispam legislation should preserve the benefits of electronic communication prohibit and take action against spa mmers and reduce the amount of spam moreover it should conform to four general princip simplicity effective enforcement having appropriate international linkages and providing clear policy direction where the main objectives of the national and international antispam policy are outlined at an earlier stage and need to underline the entire governmental strategy in conjunction with oecd recommendations itu advis that antispam law should focus on content with commercial nature ban fraudulent or misleading messages prohibit concealing of falsifying messages sende r advertiser or routing information draft regulations covering internet communication g enerally rather than specifying applications such as email require senders to provide recipients with unsubscr ibe facility respect the recipients requests and prevent senders from exch anging or selling addresses or recipients who unsubscribe prohibit address harvesting and dictionary attacks along with software tools specifically tailored to these purposes and seek to standardise labelling requirements enforcement according to oecd enforcement is fundamental iss ue which if not dealt with appropriately can make good piece of legislation useless for this reason it is recommended by oecd to put in place an effective sanction regime and appropriate standards of proof in addition appropriate powers and resources need to be allocated for enfor cement authorities itu and oecd recommend that countries should establ ish spam enforcement authorities mainly one agency should be assigned as the nodal enforcem ent agency and serves as coordinator at the national level among other national enforcement age ncies if existing and as contact point for foreign authorities to facilitate cross border coo peration spam enforcement authorities should have the necessary authority and investigative powe r to obtain evidence sufficient to investigate and take action in timely manner against violations f laws targeting the senders of spam and the individuals or companies that profit from the sendi ng of such communications cooperation with relevant private sector is essential as well as proactive approach countries should review pe riodically their own domestic frameworks and take steps to ensure their effectiveness for cross border cooperation in the enforcement of benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 16 of 104 confidential internal use only applicable laws in fact cooperation at the natio nal level would be particularly important to avoid duplication of activities and allow the optimizati on of resources and the exploitation of synergies between the different players in this regard nati onal legislation could facilitate information shari ng and mutual assistance between competent authorities in different countries through bilateral andor multilateral agreements and by participating in int ernational bodies and enforcement cooperation initiatives such as london action plan lap oecd and itu industry driven initiatives industry driven initiatives or self regulatory act ivities are activities initiated by the industry either being imposed by the local enforcement authorities or when there is need for the industry to take some action against spamming activities private ctor players such as isps telecommunications operators and direct marketers play critical ro in the fight against spam in fact all the countries involved in the battle against spam have coupled their antispam laws with self regulatory initiatives mainly through the developme nt of codes of conduct for isps and emarketers and making these codes either binding or voluntary other form of industry assistance is reflected in awareness programs software products sharing info rmation etc in this context oecd and itu urge industries including service providers direc t marketers and software makers to adopt best practices in order to combat spam in particular g overnments and regulators should support the development of codes of practice for electronic mar keting and isps moreover improved cooperation on enforcement between industry and enf orcement authorities should also be promoted for instance in the usa isps include antispam cl auses in their acceptable use policy aup another example is the gsm association gsma and t he mobile marketing association mma which developed mobile spam code of practice wher mobile operators commit to include anti spam conditions with all new contracts and provide mechanism to ensure appropriate customer consent and control with respect to mobile operator s own marketing communications technical solutions although legislation government action and industr assistance are fundamental solutions to eliminating spam need to be supported by appropriat technical measures antispam tools that operate at different levels together with the prop er administration and monitoring make up the technical solutions to spam in this regard oecd believes that judicious applic ation of technology should be the backbone of any approach that aims to defeat spam indeed none of the technologies acts as silver bullet or onestop solution to the problems created by spam instead all of the technologies are complementary and will be most effective when imple mented in conjunction with each other it is recommended that internet service providers nd other network operators should constantly improve their knowledge and operating practices an d update their technical best practices in order to face new challenges and technological evolution and promote the implementation and sharing of available technical solutions among providers there are different antispam technologies that are used to fight spam typically antispam technologies can be based on filters authenticatio n and blacklistswhite lists which might be augmented to filters these technologies can be dep loyed at the client side or the gateway according to itu and oecd each of the available chnologies has its weaknesses and strengths and the integration of number of technologies is crucial to reduce the impact of spam education and awareness increasing education and awareness is crucial par t of comprehensive antispam strategy simply one of the reasons why spammers are success ful is that some email recipients are still responding to spam and purchasing advertised produc ts or services visiting websites advertised benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 17 of 104 confidential internal use only by spammers or being tricked into responding to re quests for personal information from phishing scams spam awareness programs might be sponsored by diffe rent entities such as spam law enforcement agencies governmental and nongovernme ntal organizations they should target different stakeholders such as end users isps and emarketers moreover it might take different forms such as creating web sites hosting spamrela ted conferences releasing guidelines and best practices and others according to oecd spam awareness and education sho uld target students children individuals internet service providers isps and email service providers esps business entities especially small and medium enterprises smes and recommends that governments direct marketers users groups large companies and smes and industry corp orations should launch awareness programs governments as per itu recommendations should mak sure that consumers are aware of where they can complain what will be investigated what action may be taken and what information they need for authorities to launch an investigation spam measurement spam measurements are the ways used to report the ffectiveness of the spam solutions being deployed to combat spam measurement is very critic to evaluating the evolution of spam and the efficacy of antispam solutions and educational efforts to be able to determine if strategy is effective and eventually what changes are needed i n policy regulatory and technical frameworks in this regard oecd mentions that governments and private sector players should monit or the impact of anti spam measures to assess their effectiveness isps other network operators and national antisp am agencies should to the extent possible share information and data on the intensity and scope of spam and its evolution measuring methods should be detailed and documented in order to improve the legibility of the results obtained ideally government and private sector monitor the impact of antispam measures several firms provide mechanisms to collect statistics which is u sed ultimately to describe spam such as the messaging antiabuse working group maawg email trics program which is used by the authorities in different countries international cooperation and exchange global cooperation is fundamental to promote appro priate domestic frameworks to counter spam in all countries and to encourage cooperation amo ng governments private sector civil society and other stakeholders in order to ensure the harmoniz ed and widespread application of technical measures and the effective enforcement of applicabl rules countries involved in the battle against spam consider international cooperation as one of t he pillars of the antispam framework it contributes significantly in the fields of laws and regulations enforcement education and awareness and industry cooperation the international cooperation takes different forms through cooperating with regional and international entities signing agreements enterin g into mous belonging to international bodies fighting against spam sharing knowledge and raisin g awareness and developing international industry codes and guidelines in fact and due to its importance of the global cooperation in the battle against spam oecd recommends that benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 18 of 104 confidential internal use only national coordination should be first priority crossborder enforcement against spam requires gl obal strategy to reach effectiveness there has to be strategy in place that handles and organizes spam matters from around the world global outreach should be the objective action must be taken against spammers matter whe re they are and hence reach out to the broadest possible coalition of enf orcement agencies worldwide is needed adequate mechanisms for information gathering and s haring are needed for enforcement agencies to be able to investigate pre serve and obtain information and evidence and share that information with foreig n counterparts in appropriate circumstances and while informal frameworks bilateral mous multilat eral or model mous networks such as the london action plan do indeed improve communication and workinglevel collaboration formal framework may be more appropriate to create common stable and effective mechanism t global level other international bodies have participated in the international cooperation by making proposals for action as appropriate on the governance of in ternet as with the working group on internet governance wgig or by developing set of character istics to be considered in code of conduct as an international initiative for all messaging pr oviders as with the messaging antiabuse working group maawg the problem of spam is complex and multistakeho lder and multipronged strategy is fundamental developing an antispam framework is multifaceted battle that spans law enforcement industry assistance technology educa tion and awareness spam measurement and international cooperation the antispam framework must take into consideratio n the legal cultural and environmental aspects be reviewed periodically and should seek harmonisation with the international trends in

the selected international bodies and initiatives using the pol icy framework components as the basis for the review 41 regulatory approach 411 oecd6 according to oecd while different countries define spam in manner that is most relevant to their local environment there are common character istics that countries have recognized in their spam definitions electronic message spam messages are sent electron ically while email is by far the most significant channel for spam other livery channels are also considered in number of countries mobile spam s uch as sms and mms spam over ip etc hidden or false message origins spam messages are often sent in manner that disguises the originator by using false header info rmation spammers frequently use unauthorized thirdparty email serv ers spam does not offer valid and functional address to which recipients may send messages opting out of receiving further unsol icited messages illegal or offensive content spam is frequently vehicle for fraudulent or deceptive content viruses etc other spam include s adult or offensive content which may be illegal in some countries especially if it is sent to minors utilization of addresses without the owners consen t spammers often use mail addresses that have been collected without the owners explicit consent this is frequently done through software programmer s which gather addresses from the web or create email addresses harvesting and dictionary attacks bulk and repetitive spam messages are typically nt in bulk in an indiscriminate manner without any knowledge about the recipient other than the email address technical elements oecd advises that legislative definitions of spam f ocus on square6 particular messaging medium email instant mess aging short message service sms etc or square6 attempt to provide technologyneutral approach th at provides an overarching statement of principles that is more broadly applic able in this approach it is worthwhile to evaluate which particular messaging m edia are being misused or causing problems within the jurisdiction which med ia have strong potential to 6 source the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd on wwwoecdantispamorg benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 20 of 104 confidential internal use only be misused in the future and which are unlikely to be misused within the jurisdiction consent oecd describes7 the pros and cons of the different types of consen t as follows consent8 pros cons optin express consent protect users privacy providing more control on personal data it can result in much higher response rate for legitimate online marketers as the messages are from known or trusted senders and therefore are much more likely to be read and relevant to the recipient the burden of proving that consent has been given lies with the sender of the message not with the recipient difficulty in keeping records of received consent by business the absence of such records may significantly restrict the potential pool of recipients who can be targeted for otherwise legitimate messaging restricts commercial free speech could result in devoting enforcement resources in areas where consumers are not financially9 harmed inferred and implicit consent more flexible it may be difficult to define when message can be related to an existing business relationship 7 this table is taken from oecd resources as is further analysis will be done in separate reports w here appropriate 8 expressed form of consent where an individual or organisation has actively given their permission to particular action or activity optin inferredimplicit consent which generally can be i nferred from the conduct andor other business rela tionships of the recipient assumed consent there is presumption of consent until it is removed by the recipient for example b unsubscribing opt out 9 assuming that spam is commercial in nature benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 21 of 104 confidential internal use only consent8 pros cons assumed consent less constrictive to the operation of online commerce minimal risk of inadvertently proscribing legitimate messaging does not restrict choice of email recipients who want to receive commercial messages it transfers the burden of effort and cost to the consumer in order to unsubscribe the email must be opened and responded to which is contrary to good esecurity practice unless the email is from known and trusted source unsubscribe links are often non functional it places the evidentiary burden upon the recipient of the message blended approaches to consent commercial elements oecd states that the majority of spam is sent in rder to achieve profit10 through the sale of goods of services or through some sort of fraud arguably one of the better ways of reducing spam is to reduce the economic benefits th at the spammer receives from sending spam messages for this reason many legisl ative definitions of spam stress the commercial nature of spam that spam is sent for m arketing purposes or to achieve financial gain if there are concerns that regulato ry efforts against spam could have negative impacts on freedom of speech11 or expression then focus on commercial messages would clarify that personal political re ligious or ideological messages would not be restricted by antispam activities bulk according to oecd square6 bulk email usually over 50100 over 24 hours square6 one of the most significant problems with the bulk approach is its arbitrary nature not all bulk email is spam 10 obviously there are other kinds of spam messages having different nature that shall be considered as well 11 the scope of the right to free speech is subject t each countrys restrictions and exemptions the m eaning of freedom of speech is customised according to the national c ultural political and religious values and intere sts benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 22 of 104 confidential internal use only damage legislative approaches to quantifying damages part icularly where damage amount operates as threshold to initiating civil or cr iminal enforcement action could include 1 assigning set monetary damage amount to each piec of spam sent or received eg euro 1 gbp 1 or usd 1 2 measuring damage based on the number of affected re cipients eg an enforcement action could be initiated when at least 50 users within jurisdiction are affected or 3 measuring damage based on the number of spam messag received by single entity without requirement to demonstrate an actual monetary damage amount eg an enforcement action could be initiated when single user received more than 50 spam messages from the s ame entity within defined time period requirements for legitimate messaging the recipient of electronic messages should always be able to unsubscribe from the mailing list requesting that such

any additional cost in some c ases postal address should also be provided12 square6 the sender is given period of time for example 1 0 days to comply and cease the transmission square6 any transmission of messages after the recipient op tedout is not permitted oecd mentioned that square6 labelling of emails as spam can be useful tool i n the fight against spam it has get weaknesses as well as depicted in the table below square6 labelling is the use of standard words in the messa ge header or subject line that clearly identifies the content of the message for example the use of adv for advertising and adlt for adult content square6 oecd outlines the advantages and disadvantages of labelling as follows advantages disadvantages recipients are able to distinguish between advertising material and other email traffic variations on labelling may result in the evasion f filtering systems for example adv or d v instead of adv 12 this is to ensure that the sender is known and the receiver can always contact the sender to opt out according to the usa can spam act it is unlawful for any person to initi ate the transmission of any commercial electronic m ail message to protected computer unless the message among other requirements provides valid physical postal add ress of the sender benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 23

to prevent problems emerging in relation to linguistic or alph abet differences between countries enable the more efficient and effective use of filtering systems spam offenders especially those that obscure their identity and do not provide accurate contact detail s are unlikely to comply with such requirement exemptions or restrictions according to oecd the extent to which certain type s of electronic messaging may be exempted from antispam regulation will depend on h ow spam is defined for the primary purpose of the regulation for example square6 if spam is defined as commercial messaging then exemptions may be appropriate for messages which have commercial ement but which are primarily noncommercial and which government believes shou ld not be prohibited square6 if spam is defined as bulk messaging then exempt ions may be appropriate for largescale messaging which government believes i s in the public interest possible exemptions square6 government bodies messaging from government bodies may be appropriate to enable dissemination of information in the public i nterest square6 charities legitimate charities may reasonably wish to use electronic messaging for fundraising and other purposes square6 political parties messaging from political parties may be seen as legitimate expression of free speech address harvesting and dictionary attacks oecd states that legislation may include specific provisions to levy additional sanctions if harvesting software and harvested address lists dic tionary attacks are used to aid the sending of spam in contravention of the jurisdictio ns spam legislation the act of selling acquiring or using harvesting software or harvested address lists or the automatic generation of recipients addresses may be sanction ed criminal or pornographic content according to oecd legislation may be drafted to pa rticularly target criminal or pornographic messages whether by making it part of the jurisdictions definition of spam associating additional penalties to messages contai ning these elements or in the case of pornography requiring additional measures of compl iance such as labelling benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 24 of 104 confidential internal use only in breach of fair trade oecd advises that spam legislation may be drafted to require that goods and services advertised andor offered in messages must be legal accurately described and commercially responsible this may be useful in jurisdictions wh ere the coverage of existing domestic consumer protection laws and laws relating to misle ading and fraudulent conduct in respect of online or electronic messages is not clearly dra wn out focus on whether the content of message is misleading or fraudulent leaves aside many of the systemic concerns of spam privacy according to oecd the regulation of spam may entai l significant overlap with privacy legislation and policies and builds upon the idea that the use of personal data should be subject to acceptable frequently legislatively det ermined norms thus the sender of messages may be required to comply with such requir ements however it is worth noting that where such protection is available it is only available to natural persons and not legal persons as privacy rights generally only attach to the former data protection regimes aim to regulate the use and abuse of personal data to the extent that email addresses are personal data then use exchange or selling of these may be seen as illegitimate invasions on the privacy of the add ressee oecd general spam related legal recommendations national antispam regulation should attempt to square6 preserve the benefits of electronic communications by increasing user trust in the internet and electronic messaging media and improve the availability reliability and efficiency of services as well as the performa nce of global communication networks square6 prohibit and take action against the act of spammin g as defined by national law legislation alone may not stop potential spammers f rom taking advantage of this marketing technique however laws and regulations c an have an impact by sanctioning against those individuals and organizat ions that choose to make use of spam and profit from it the value of legislation w ill depend on sanctions in particular in the certainty of their application square6 reduce the amount of spam to prevent spam from bei ng sent activities need to be targeted at different stages in order to reduce the volume of spam traversing networks and reduce the number of spam received by endusers to achieve these goals legislation should conform to four general principles square6 policy direction the legislation should provide clear policy direction the main lines and objectives of national and international antispam policy should be outlined at an earlier stage and need to underlie t he entire governmental strategy square6 regulatory simplicity the legislation should be sh ort and simple square6 enforcement effectiveness enforcement is fundame ntal issue which if not dealt with appropriately can make good piece of legisl ation useless for this reason it is important to put in place an effective sanction regime and appropriate standards of proof in addition appropriate powers and resou rces need to be allocated for enforcement authorities benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 25 of 104 confidential internal use only square6 international linkages as spam is crossborder i ssue legislation should foresee appropriate international linkages and provide nat ional authorities with the possibility to cooperate in investigations and exc hange information with foreign authorities the role of internet service providers and email s ervice providers is also important and could be considered in legislation in particular governments and regulators should support the development of isp codes of practice that compl ement and are consistent with legislation governments should encourage industry associations to develop such codes and adopt best practices where they are in the public i nterest and do not impose undue financial and administrative burdens on participants legislation could also provide comprehensxive fra mework to support the activities of isps to block or limit the circulation of spam ema il isps should be able to take appropriate and balanced defensive measures to prot ect their networks and should be allowed to take legal action against spammers13 similar results could be achieved through appropriate contractual provisions between isps and users 412 itu14 the information of this section has been gathered b ased on itu analysis of existing spam laws according to itu analysis precise definition of spam does not exist but there is fairly widespread agreement that spam exhibits the followi ng general characteristics spam is an electronic message for most purposes this may be restricted to mail but other methods of delivering spam do exist including the short messaging service or sms etc spam is unsolicited15 if the recipient has agreed to accept message it is not spam however how and when such consent is given m ay not be clear especially when preexisting relationship exists between the sender and recipient spam is sent in bulk this implies that the sender distributes large number of essentially identical messages and that recipients are chosen indiscriminately these three traits define unsolicited bulk email ube if fourth is added that spam must be of commercial nature the resulting class of messages is referred to as unsolicited commercial email uce furthermore itu states that creating spam specific law can help focus enforcement efforts strengthen norms against this behaviour and close loopholes or uncertainties in existing laws that also apply to spam 13 this might differ according to the enforcement reg ime in other words is the private right of action available to individuals andor corporations for instance under can spam in the usa there is private right of action for individuals but for isps typically isps are not hold liable for spamm ers actions unless there is evidence that they are involved in helping facilitating commissioning or assisting in the spa m isps can take legal actions for the harm they ffered and if the private right of action is not available to individ uals then isps can sue spammers on behalf of their customers to facilitate restitution of costs to damaged parties 14 source the international telecommunication unions itu on wwwituintspam 15 even with an optout regime the assumption is tha t there is an assumed consent from the receiver and the message becomes unsolicited once the receiver opts out from receiving such messages benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 26 of 104 confidential internal use only technical elements the itu suggests drafting regulations covering inte rnet communication generally rather than specifying applications such as email itu further recommends that the legislation to be t echnology neutral in order to cater for the different media whether wireless or wired thr ough which spam can originate consent according to itu optin regimes focus on the means of obtaining rec ording and revoking consent while optout regimes concentrate upon methods for indica ting that one does not wish to receive messages requirements for storing such preferences and methods of enforcing this choice any antispam regime with an optin system at its c ore is almost certain to be more aggressive antispam regime than an optout system the lesson is that the strength of the sentiment in the law bears little correlation to the successful enforcement of that law choosing an opt in versus an optout approach is not what matters if your end goal is to stop spam the most effective antispam laws are action laws that focus on the problems prosecutors face and work to resolve them most legal regimes regardless of how they configur spam laws prohibit messages that contain fraudulent deceptive or misleading inform ation such bans typically target one or more of square6 the senders identity email address or affiliati on square6 the optout address used to refuse further communic ations square6 the material advertising or offering goods or servi ces square6 the purpose of the message square6 the routing path of the message including message headers square6 the message subject line commercial elements according to itu square6 the initial decision for regulators in assessing sp am is whether to differentiate among messages based on their content or purpose16 16 many laws focus on messages that have commercial n ature for example australia usa while other pro posals seek to classify spam as any message commercial and non co mmercial such as malaysia transmitted to recipient s who have not requested it focusing on the unsolicited nature of the message gives the regime more control over all types of ssages being transmitted moreover such decision targets the d users as it seeks to offer them more protection on the other hand defining spam strictly as any ssage with commercial nature will allow spammers to send all kinds of non commercial messages causing annoyance and sses to various kinds of stakeholders without any f ear being prosecuted or sanctioned an important aspect here is the legal context as we ll for instance the freedom of speech and the r ights afforded to political speech in some countries limit the ability of regul ators to address messages of non commercial nature such as political and religious the profit motivation for unsolicited co mmercial messages is often cited as rational for focusing on this type of messages benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 27 of 104 confidential internal use only square6 commonly accepted definition for the term unsolic ited commercial communications or messages is shown below adapted from australian and eu definitions unsolicited commercial communication s or spam can thus be defined as unsolicited electronic communications nt in bulk over email mobile sms mms and instant messaging services usually with the objective of marketing commercial products or services bulk the itu refers to the term bulk as when the sender distributes large number of essentially identical messages and those recipients are chosen indiscriminately there are recommendations regarding the number of messages co nsidered as bulk itu recommends considering the following elements t determine the characteristics of the bulk messages square6 is the communication sent only to small number of recipients particularly those previously known to the sender or to large numbe r of recipients square6 does the list of recipients include fictitious or r andomly generated addresses damage the penalties for violating the dictates of regulat ions on spam generally fall under one of three categories administrative penalties imposed by an enforcement entity civil damages actual or statutory imposed by an adjudicating co urt or criminal penalties imposed by court in criminal prosecution the level and type of penalties imposed in spam law s must reflect both subjective judgment about the relative gravity of the harm in question and more objective calculus about how to enforce effectively the relevant law administrative penalties may be particularly useful as spam sanctions administrative agencies often use less formal and more rapid adjud ication measures than court systems do this reduction in the cost of enforcement can help improve compliance assuming it is not offset by corresponding increase in error rates i n decision making in addition an agency with scope limited to data protection or consumer p rotection issues may be more focused and better equipped to deal with problem like spa m than an entity with broad law enforcement responsibilities requirements for legitimate messaging itu advises that using labelling of commercial ema ils such as adv in the subject line of the message would make it easier for spam filte ring software to identify commercial mail and eliminate it additionally according to itu analysis of existing spam laws square6 unsubscribe requirements are particularly important for optout regimes since they provide the means by which recipients control wheth er they receive commercial messages this method though is also useful for ptin systems since it allows recipients to change their minds by revoking permis sion to communicate with senders square6 most advice on spam cautions users against employin g unsubscribe functions due to fears that senders will not comply with these re quests and that attempting to unsubscribe will confirm that the recipient has rec eived and read the message benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 28 of 104 confidential internal use only square6 since there is thriving market for email address of recipients who actually open and respond to spam messages unsubscribe re quirements becomes more effective in optin schemes than in optout schemes users are more likely to remember which senders they permit to transmit mess ages to them and thus can employ unsubscribe features for these senders while ignoring optout options from noncompliant senders exemptions or restrictions jurisdictional elements in spam legislation define the conditions under which the law applies to an electronic message at minimum the s tates where the sender and the recipient are located would likely assert jurisdictional in terest in the message additional jurisdictions might be implicated based on the loca tion of square6 the messaging service providers and internet servic providers involved square6 the computer used to transmit or to access the mess age square6 the entities responsible for or deriving benefit fr om the messages contents square6 the organizations supervising or employing sender r recipient and square6 the developers of the software used to effect the c ommunication address harvesting and dictionary attacks itu recommends that drafters of model of spam law ought to prohibit address harvesting and dictionary attacks along with softw are tools specifically tailored to these purposes criminal or pornographic content according to itu spam holds the potential to fall under number of different rubrics in terms of legal control from computer misuse to fal advertising to data protection to criminal fraud legal systems that implement spam l egislation must consider and hopefully specify how these different elements wil l interact in breach of fair trade as mentioned in 3129 privacy itu states that regulators must resolve questions f responsibility and competence within their own borders with regulators of related issues such as criminal fraud data protection personal privacy and computer misuse itu general spam related legal recommendations according to itu analysis of existing spam laws th laws show considerable unity in defining the content they proscribe despite the th orny challenge of widely divergent views about what constitutes prohibited expression antispam laws around the world square6 concentrate on content with commercial forprofi t purpose square6 prohibit communications that seek to defraud or lead the recipient that conceal the identity of the sender or the advertiser on who behalf the message is transmitted or that disguise information about the path that the message took in reaching user benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 29 of 104 confidential internal use only square6 there is variation in whether laws apply only to on specific application such as mail or to online communication more generally review of existing antispam laws suggests the fo llowing likely elements in model law square6 focus primarily on commercial content square6 ban fraudulent or misleading messages square6 prohibit concealing or falsifying messages sende r advertiser or routing information square6 draft regulations covering internet communication g enerally rather than specifying applications such as email in march 2006 the itu concluded that although all n ations need antispam legislation so that spammers have nowhere to hide more effect ive approach would be to mandate establishment of enforceable codes of conduct by in ternet service providers which would be held responsible for spam from their customers those codes would require isps to prohibit their customers from spamming and not to nter into peering arrangements with isps that do not accept similar codes of conduct regulation of spam frequently overlaps with existin g laws governing aspects of electronic communication or the content often found in spam r egulators must decide how to align spam regulation with the following approaches square6 one law or many should the legal system adopt leg islation specific to spam or rely on regulation that addresses piecemeal the var ious aspects of its problems or can laws of general applicability such as those th at prohibit various forms of fraud or abuses of consumers

antispam t echnical solutions provided by oecd include judicious application of technology should be the b ackbone of any approach that aims to defeat spam one should be aware that none of the technologies d iscussed in the following will act as silver bullet or onestop solution to the problems created by spam instead it should be recognized that all of the technologies are complementary and will be most effective when imple mented in conjunction with each other the integration of number of technologies is nece ssary to reduce the harmful impact of spam on system internet service

receiving but directly the sending of spam messages on the operational si they are in the position to implement code of conduct for isps and to impo on their customers acceptable use policy aups forbidding spam given the link between spam and network security p roviders besides using filters to block the reception of spam should also improve security on their network to avoid becoming source of spam many p roviders hold the view that the problem of botnets and zombies can be solv ed or at least limited by implementing security best practices applying aups and educating users to employ available tools to protect their computers the antispam technical alliance asta collabor ative effort between some of the leading internet providers and the inte rnet community active until 2004 was created to establish technical and nonte chnical solutions for handling unsolicited commercial email the alliance created technology and policy proposal which was issued in june 2004 and inclu ded series of best practices and technical approaches that isps should adopt in order to control abusive traffic thus reducing the chances for spammer to misuse their servers to send unsolicited messages these techniques are bas ed on good neighbour policies ie isps are responsible for controlling the traffic they originate the asta technology and policy proposal included series of best practices and technologies that isps should implement to help secure the email infrastructure and bring about increased accountabi lity22 however the document recognises that technical sol utions are not the solution to the spam problem and acknowledges that provisions must be f lexible and ready to change to adapt to the rapidly evolving internet environment and its vulne rabilities for this reason governments are refraining from imposing technological solutions on isps and isps associations and alliances prefer to concentrate more generally on agreeing on best practices and objectives rather than 22 the code of conduct can be accessed at httpdocsyahoocomdocsprpdfasta_soipdf benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 41 of 104 confidential internal use

monitoring and fixing c ompromised computers in their networks antispam technologies the following are types of antispam technologies t hat are designed to fight spam while some of them aim to prevent certain types of behavi our which pose threat to security and fail to respect the resources of the platform to wh ich mail is sent or simply do not comply with the accepted rules for sending electronic mess ages and some of them are depended on the location of the rule in the following two sections both the ones which do not comply with accepted rules for sending messages and the ones which are depended on the accepted rules for sending messages will be described antispam techniques that do not comply with rules for sending messages 1 authentication of electronic mail the first comment that needs to be made is that mai l authentication methods fall into the category of rules which although they he lp in the fight against spam do not constitute specific antispam technologies 2 spf andor senderid oecd toolkit mentioned that spf and senderid can b used to test whether an email server is authorized to send on behalf of given domain this is done by publishing record in the domain name system dns which lists the authorized email servers for domain the two tec hniques primarily differ in the choice of the identity tested 23 the maawg code of conduct can be accessed at httpwwwmaawgorgaboutcodeofconductpdf benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 42 of 104 confidential internal use only 3 dkim or meta dkim and message enhancements for transmission auth orization meta are used to authenticate the sender domain by means of cryptographic signature automatically added by the email server at presen t the immediate practical benefits are very low since few domains sign their messages furthermore administrators will note that these three technique s are not yet based on stable standard 4 existence of the senders domain and eliciting re sponse many spammers send mail with nonexistent sender s address rule can be used to refuse these messages such as the postfix directive reject_unknown_sender_domain or the jchkmail direc tive badmx another possibility is to verify the validity of the record for the incoming server mx for the domain given in the from field of the message 5 existence of pointer record ptr ptr record of the dns can be used to translate th ip address of the senders server into name although without necessarily ch ecking that this name is consistent with the senders domain 6 blacklistswhitelists traditional filtering as well as tracking complaint s across user communities can ultimately lead to whitelists of acceptable senders and blacklists of suspected spammers the whitelistblacklist approach is often too drastic solution to be acceptable by most users whitelists are timeconsu ming to create and will require continual updating blacklists require similar moni toring all lists need mechanisms and procedures for updating to address f alse positives and fraudulent complaints to listing spoofing and open relays c an also create issues related to the appearance that mail has originated from sour ce 7 address of the sending server treated as either dyn amic or residential this is particular form of blacklist in which the criterion for addition to the list is the fact that the ip address being blocked corre sponds to the machine of an individual subscriber to an isp and not to the mail server of an organisation the idea is that an ordinary subscriber does not send m ail directly in smtp but passes through the pta of his provider this typically mea ns the machine being blocked is directly sending spam messages from spammer r more commonly that the messages are being sent without the owners kno wledge ie the machine has been compromised and turned into zombie in order to send the messages the lists of such addresses are not always reliable since most of them have been compiled using heuristics such as the presence of adsl in the name of the machine managing such lists is also resource inten sive in contrast some of these lists notably those com piled by the server using them can be used to distinguish between servers authoris ed for domain and the residential lists moreover some domains publish t he ranges of residential addresses for their domain this test can be seen as discriminating between pur consumers and providers the latter consider legitimate the policy by which the owner of domain refuses benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 43 of 104 confidential internal use only to connect his machines to residential addresses s these are currently the main source of spam consumers however argue that spam xists and the freedom to use email must be protected 8 filtering filtering is the most common technical antispam chnology the main benefits of filters are the ease of implementation and the f lexibility that users have in deciding which messages should be treated as spam the following are types filters for combating spam heuristic filters these filters are based on the principle of testing for the presence in the message of certain typical features of spam such s the exclusive use of html or the type of customer to whom the mail is nt the test is weighted through learning process based on set of known spam mails and set of mails known to be legitimate b keyword filters these are binary filters that search for keyword viagra etc the risk of false positives is very high and the ability to avo id these by spacing alternate characters and misspelling is also substantial c summary or fingerprint filters fingerprint filters such as razor construct fin gerprint of the message submitted to them and indicate whether it has alrea dy been identified as spam there are many false negatives because numb er of types of spam mail are not identified even when the server scans them with razor furthermore the message sometimes varies sufficien tly for it to generate different fingerprint one solution to this problem is to delay the mail as greylisting does they generate few false positive s d bayesian filters the principle on which the bayesian filter works is to prime its engine by examining set of known spam emails and set of emails known to be legitimate then after teaching itself the vocabula ry used by spammers from this known list it will use bayesian probabilities to calculate whether message is spam in the case of group filter the learning is usually conducted by the system administrator benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 44 of 104 confidential internal use only behavioural filters this type of filter examines the behaviour of the r emote server such as the number of mails sent by unit of time rate limiting is one example of this type of filtering the idea is that ordinary mails are nly sent individually or in very small numbers and spam mails are sent in very large batches24 9 helocsv sending computer identifies itself by name to r eceiving computer at the beginning of each smtp transaction the smtp comman d the sending computer uses to identify itself by this name to the receivi ng computer is called the ehlo or helo command certified server validation csv is service that provides mechanism for mailreceiving server to assess mailsending server it builds upon the existing practice of service pro viders that accredit the networks from which sending systems are connecting 10 greylisting this is the deliberate sending of an smtp 4xx error code temporary error as opposed to 5xx definitive error see rfc 2821 wh encountering new sender the latter if it is normal mta will try again later usually 15 minutes later and its message will then be accepted most spam software programs do not make multiple send attempts this technique is highly effective and blocks all spam mails that are not sent through an open relay or by the mta of provider it prevents receipt of certain messages from poorly configured servers and lends itself particularly well to be used in conjunction with whitelist 11 tokenspasswords the aim of these techniques is to include passwor d in the address to which the email is sent or to use challengeresponse syste m such as the turing test the spammers software will not know this password and will be unable to pass the test 12 other techniques there are various techniques that mostly are experi mental and insufficiently tested and they are envelope tests batv ses ce rtification of bulk mails micro payment system pgp signature system configu ration antispam tools and antispyware tools for more explanation on th toolstechnologies please refer to the oecd toolkit 24 for ocr optical character recognition the gibberish or nonsense text included with image spam very qui ckly becomes redflag text by bayesian filter an image with little or accompanying text is also red flag because almost all legitimate mail that contains images also includes reasonable amount of body text normal connection level techniques such as greylisting and dnsbased rbls continue to be effective against image spam as well resorting to using ocr tools to extract the text from an image spam for analysis was met with limited success the stateoftheart in ocr is not very advanced furthermore ocr tools are not designed to extract text from an image that is actively being m anipulated by an adversary spammers have reacted to ocr tools by obfu scating the text in the images they send the obfus cated text is still relatively easy for humans to recognize but very d ifficult for ocr tools to extract in addition to th accuracy problem ocr is very computeintensive and can greatly slow down content filter benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 45 of 104 confidential internal use only overall the utility of any tools will be depende nt on the needs technical ability and the infrastructure of the user of the same tool tools are meant to be deployed at different parts across the system and for differ ing purposes users will have to consider their needs and strategies of defense in d epth as they choose and deploy antispam tools tools themselves vary in maturity efficacy reliability and deployment some tools are more prone to false posi tives some are more effective in certain areas and some have greater overhead in terms of cost infrastructure bandwidthcapacity and needed technical expertise number of these factors have been listed for consideration but user will h ave to gauge tools in the specific context of their contemplated application antispam techniques that are depended on the accep ted rules for sending messages 1 rejection in the smtp session the interest in such rejection lies in not taking c harge of the electronic message whose distribution remains the responsibility of th remote server which has been advised of the situation in addition it saves band width capacity firstly because the message is not received and secondly because th remote server will not have to send dsns delivery status notification the mes sage generated in response to rejection see rfc 3461 that the message might g enerate the task of issuing such nondelivery message is transferred to the s ender 2 silent rejection this method often confounds regular users who expec t their email to be delivered or at least to be told that it has been rejected t he deliver or advice alternative is cardinal principle of emailing but one which wi ll probably have to be abandoned due to the number of joejobs25 3 rejection by sending dsn delivery status not ification or bouncing this is the method traditionally used in internet mailing however due to the presence of joejobs there is risk of penalizin g innocent senders as may be seen with the antivirus programs which mistakenly send dsns 4 delivery to spam box when few messages are blocked on entry to the platf orm the spam box can contain very large volumes of messages which can d iscourage users from reading it the message is not destroyed but the user is g iven an opportunity to remedy false positives 5 marking the server takes decision but simply places on the email this technique gives the user full control but will als force the user to download spam mail note that an email service provider can offer the user the choice of simply marking the email or delivering it to the s pam box it is relatively simple to manage 25 spam attack using spoofed sender data and aimed at tarnishing the reputation of the apparent sender andor induce the recipients to take action against him benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 46 of 104 confidential internal use only overall view overall the previous discussion was about various antispam technologies and their capabilities presently available as well as of the methods to be employed when spam is received any attempt to combat spam effectively mu st involve the sensible administration of number of these technologies in concert none of the above methods will be entirely successful in isolation when nu mber of antispam technologies are effectively used in collaboration with one another the effect can to drastically reduce the level of spam impacting system benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 47 of 104 confidential internal use only 442 itu technical measures to succeed in controlling spam regulatory efforts through legislation and rulemaking must be accompanied by or at least coordinated wi th technological reform measures that reduce the incidence of these unwanted message s while minimizing the impact on legitimate messages these technical methods fall r oughly into four categories filters cost shifting authentication and security filters filtering attempts to detect and block or quarantin spam messages filters can be installed at many layers of the network for instan ce by email service providers internet service providers and individual users f ilters search messages for characteristics that indicate spam such as ficti tious domain in the messages return address or the presence of keywords such as viagra or close variants such as vigra in its body more sophisticated filters mploy techniques such as bayesian statistical analysis that use probabilistic assessm ent of words in message and that are capable of refinement with increased accuracy over time filtering can prevent end users from even seeing spam messages and by reduci ng the risk that they or their children might be exposed to offensive content suc h as graphic advertisements for pornography filters are widely used both by isps nd by individuals at the client level to reduce email spam while most filters are produced by private companies or developers spam regulators may be authorized to contribute to or to support such tools filters can be augmented using two additional tools blacklists and whitelists blacklists compile data about known spam sources an d senders this enables service providers to scrutinize or block email traffic fro m these sources blacklists are generally compiled and maintained by private compan ies or organizations though blacklists can be valuable in blocking defined sour ces of spam their use implicates questions about standards for being added to and re moved from list the speed of updates and the power such lists confer on the com piler in addition spammers have begun to adopt new techniques such as routing mess ages through isp servers that reduce blacklists effectiveness whitelists perform the opposite role as they valida certain senders as sources of legitimate messages therefore messages from these senders either bypass filtering entirely or are scrutinized at much reduced level simple whitelist techniques for example allow senders listed in users address b ook to bypass filters installed by that end user more advanced methods such as bond ed sender or payment at risk programs incorporate monetary guarantees by sender s payment at risk penalizes sender financially if message is spam or if the r ecipient is dissatisfied with it bonded sender programs require senders to post mo netary guarantee of their email advertising before they are permitted to bypass spa m filters whitelists simplify filtering by classifying certain messages as low r isk meaning that its highly unlikely they are spam however whitelists impose costs on senders that may have negative distributional consequences and require th participation of filtering entities to be effective whitelists are also ineffective if message falsely purports to be sent by sender in the whitelist or is sent from hija cked computer in the whitelist benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 48 of 104 confidential internal use only while filtering is an important tool in addressing spam it suffers from three primary drawbacks overblocking underblocking and reduced control overblocking by filters removes legitimate messages as well as spam the vel of overblocking depends both on the filter used and its implementation s tudy by email marketing firm return path found that seventeen per cent of permis sionbased messages whose recipients consent in advance to receive the email were blocked by spam filters this overinclusiveness can also occur when users ttempt to send messages if their service provider implements outbound spam filtering overblocking is harmful because it prevents recipients from accessing or s ending desired legitimate messages and because it undermines their confidence in the reliability of email as communications medium underblocking occurs when filters fail to detect or to remove messages that are spam this underinclusiveness results both from th arms race between spammers and filters for example spammers have begun incl uding unusual but innocuous words in messages to evade bayesian filters and f rom the difficulties inherent in analyzing the content and intent of email underbl ocking demonstrates that technical methods are only partial solution to spam finally spam filters implicate important questions of control over receiving and sending content filters implemented at the service provider level decrease the control that end users have over what types of messages the receive for example an individual user might prefer to receive certain uns olicited messages such as messages advertising credit card offers and such messages m ay be blocked as spam from his isp alternately user might decide the risk of n ot receiving even single incorrectly blocked message is unacceptable conversely filter ing implemented by end users may be updated less frequently and configured less skil lfully if users are not technologically savvy this is particularly importa nt regarding spam that contains viruses worms or bots costshifting costshifting proposals seek to reduce the volume f spam by increasing the senders costs either in money or in computing tim to transmit each message the goal is to alter the unusual economics of spam in which the sender incurs almost cost to send messages while the costs to transport the message store it and delete it are borne by the recipient and third parties such s isps in addition senders can often transmit single message that is delivered to many recipients thus since the advertising item itself does not need to be printed and distributed as separate piece for each recipient sending large numbers of solici tations does not incur increasing costs the result is that fractional response rates that would be disaster in traditional direct marketing become profitable on the internet estamp solutions propose to modify the electronic mail infrastructure to either allow or require monetary payment for each message sent even tiny increase in the costs of sending an individual message would make mass ma ilings of tens of millions of messages economically unfeasible commercial mass m arketers accustomed to traditional response rates in other media should t be deterred by small charge to send marketing material in addition many estamp proposals provide base daily level of free messages such as hundred per day t charge to individual users so few senders would incur any additional cost benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 49 of 104 confidential internal use only however estamp proposals suffer from number of drawbacks as many observers have noted such an increase in cost would prove cr ippling to many developing nations that are in the early stages of adopting ne w information and communications technologies infrastructures all of these proposal s not only require major changes to the existing electronic mail infrastructure but so penalize everyone who sends mail not just spammers since any additional cost imposed on each message cost must be fixed relatively small amount this form of costshifting is unlikely to deter the most harmful forms of spam those seeking to defraud the recipient that offer the sender relatively large rewards in addition w hile penny per message charge may be negligible to large developedcountry corp oration it may be significant amount of money in the developing world in which c ase paytosend system could worsen the digital divide developing and deployin g the infrastructure for every mail server and client in the world to handle micropaym ents in world currency appears daunting at best and impossible in any nearterm frame finally even at small permessage amounts the huge amount of daily emai l traffic implicates dollar amounts that create sizeable opportunity for frau d and electronic theft from any system of cash epostage as an alternative to requiring cash payment for ach message several antispam proposals would require the sending computer to com pute complicated numerical puzzle and return the correct answer to the recipie nt before the recipient would accept the message this creates small delay in sending each message while invisible to most users such methods would make it impossible f or spammer to send tens or hundreds of millions of messages day from few c omputers connected to the internet because computing solutions do not involv money transfers the issues of currency conversion fraud and relative value plag uing estamp solutions are minimized however computing solutions still require major ch anges to the email infrastructure and burden all senders not just undesirable ones much of the value of email derives from its low cost many legitimate senders includi ng businesses government agencies private organizations and independent ne wsletter authors send large quantities of electronic mail much of this traffic is not incomegenerating but informational for example the low cost of sending email has enabled incremental package tracking frequent government informational updates and host of special interest electronic newsletters from noncommercial and nonprofit entities changing the economics of bulk email could drastically curt ail the free flow of information that characterizes the internet finally much of the cu rrent spam problem originates from computers that have been hijacked by spammers if spammers can employ other users resources to transmit messages comput ing cost solutions are unlikely to deter unwanted messages while placing severe burd on legitimate senders authentication any legal solution to regulating spam even one wel lharmonized among different regimes is challenged by the difficulty of holding violators accountable the simple mail transport protocol smtp used to transmit int ernet email does not authenticate senders allowing violators of messagi ng regulations to hide their identities behind false header information hijacke d zombie drones open relays and proxies the result is that laws regulating commerc ial message content or form often constrain legitimate businesses but are ignored by illegal or fringe operators benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 50 of 104 confidential internal use only authentication seeks to allow recipient to verify who sent message authenticated email offers several benefits first the recipien t can decide either manually or automatically to accept the message based on the ctual senders identity much spam is currently spoofed by listing false or n onexistent sender having authenticated sender information allows filters and whitelists to operate more efficiently and accurately and makes evading black lists of known violators more difficult authentication also makes enforcement ea sier and cheaper if senders cannot hide their identities law enforcement need not exp end significant resources tracking down and proving who violators are finally authen tication may deter spammers from violations since they can expect their identit ies to be revealed cryptographic solutions to combat spam also appear promising yahoos domainkeys proposal ciscos identified internet ma il iim method and bounce address tag validation batv all attempt to preven t falsification of senders addresses by requiring messages originator to crypt at least part of the message with private cryptographic key known only to the legitimate holder of the senders address or domain the recipient then uses public lyavailable cryptographic key provided by the holder of the domain or address cl aimed as the sender to decrypt the message if the message can be decrypted it origin ated with someone with access to the private key thus the recipient can treat the message as legitimate these methods generally propose to distribute the p ublic key information necessary to decrypt received message through the domain name server dns system currently used to map domain names to internet protocol ip addresses the proposals simplify implementation by allowing individual domain owners to manage their cryptographic keys avoiding the need for single overarching ke authority the current dns system can store and retrieve cryptographic keys wi th modification however each endtoend scheme requires significant changes to b oth email clients sending messages and the servers attempting to authenticate them since there are over thirty million internet domains any change to how email works will certainly be adopted gradually and many servers may never upgrade ther efore any authentication scheme will have to deal indefinitely with signif icant volume of legitimate email which does not support authentication microsoft and developer meng wong independently pro posed authentication solutions that authenticate only the most recent co nnection that transferred message rather than authenticating the entire chain of tran sfer from the messages originator to the recipient these proposals have been merged int single proposal sender id for email sender id only authenticates the domai n of the most recent message transferor unlike endtoend solutions it cannot be extended to individual senders the primary advantage to lasthop solutions is that they do not require modification of the senders mail server thus domains can be made compatible with sender id even if their mail server cannot be modified domain c an implement sender id for its outgoing messages with little time or effort by add ing new sender policy framework spf record to its dns entry although s ender id does not require modification of the sending server the receiving m ail server or the recipients mail client must be modified to support sender id to au thenticate the message thus lasthop solution provides an immediate method of s upplying authentication information for messages that can be easily adopted by every sender only recipients who want to verify senders information need modify their existing email software benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 51 of 104 confidential internal use only since enforcement of spam regulations requires iden tifying violators legal systems have an interest in encouraging or mandating authen tication for example the federal trade commission the agency responsible for enforc ing the federal us antispam act has indicated that it may mandate an authentic ation protocol if market forces fail to supply consensus choice however unless all s ystems adopt compatible method authentication is unlikely to simplify the difficult task of crossjurisdictional enforcement in addition the economic costs and ph ysical impossibility of universal adoption limit the extent to which states can manda rather than encourage authentication itu believes it is worthwhile for s tates to discuss authentication technologies to increase the probability that gle technology amenable to the varying needs of different systems will be adopted neither lasthop nor endtoend authentication can distinguish legitimate messages from illegal messages sent by hijacked computers i f an authentication scheme is adopted that makes it impossible for messages to be sent anonymously violators will increase efforts to compromise and use others equi pment to send their messages states may need to create liability for third parti who do not take reasonable steps to prevent their equipment for being used for illegal purposes for example an isp who failed to secure mail server could be held liable if that server were used to send spam in addition universal adoption of any authen tication method is unlikely given the large number of mail servers worldwide this ma make mandated authentication impossible thus legal regimes may instead move to provide incentives to entities such as service providers who voluntarily adopt so lutions that make identifying violators easier security spam is intimately linked to computer and network s ecurity increasingly spammers use distributed mechanism to transmit ssages from multiple sources this method involves compromising the security of n umerous computers with high speed internet access through viruses or worms that exploit flaws in operating systems or users failure to install and maintain firewal l and antivirus software once compromised these zombie computers send messages on behalf of the spammer this disguises the sender evades isp limits on the number of messages one source can transmit and reduces the spammers hardware an d bandwidth costs computer security company symantec estimates that thirty tho usand computers become zombies each day groups of these zombie computers known s botnets are sold or rented for malicious purposes ranging from denial of servi ce attacks to mass transmissions of spam thus maintaining proper security even for home computers is vital to the success of efforts against spam intermediaries such as isps and messaging service p roviders can and do take measures to improve security and to decrease the vu lnerability of users and of networks for example googles gmail free email s ervice removes hyperlinks from messages that the service believes to be phishing attempts isp earthlink requires all email messages to route through its mail serve rs to reduce the impact of zombie networks and mandates that users email programs s ubmit passwords to transmit messages while these methods can reduce the burden of spam it is important to recognize that end users must also exercise signifi cant responsibility for maintaining secure safe computing environment users who do t update virus software and operating systems automatically or regularly or wh download programs that contain benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 52 of 104 confidential internal use only malware and spyware that compromise their compu ter pose risk not only to themselves but to other users worldwide thus secu rity measures must operate in conjunction with user education campaigns itu email technical solutions overview there are three different stages in the email syst em where we can implement technical measures to curb spam at the source where the ema il is being sent out at the destination where the email is received and finally at the dusers email client itself the figure below provides an overview of the various technical measures available at each stage source email server at the source email server there are four technical measures to curb spam they are listed as follows 1 blocking port 25 to prevent users from sending outgoing mail via any thirdparty mailhosting services it is advices to block port 25 it has been estimated that over 40 per cent of all spam is being sent out through zombie machines9 blocking port 25 will compel the sender to route his email via his isps mail server such email is then subj ect to the other antispam measures implemented by the senders isp eg rate limiting blocking port 25 can be an effective spam countermeasure some isps implement the port 25 blocking selectively for example just on addresse s that appear to be sending out large quantities of spam other isps have gone as f ar as to adopt the tactic for all customers there is disadvantage when blocking port 25 bloc king port 25 can create problems by blocking legitimate email as well as s pam there are some users who need to run their own mail server or communicat with mail server on remote network to submit email such as web host ing company isps should identify and not block port 25 for such customers one solution might be to require new subscribers to check box in the service application indicating that they wish port 25 to re main unblocked this will result in default block of port 25 for the vast majority of home users who have never heard of and have particular use for port 25 ch selective approach can significantly cut down on spam entering our network s without stopping benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 53 of 104 confidential internal use only legitimate uses of port 25 imposing rate limits on email usage is already fairly common practice among internet service providers or isps as way to stop bulk messages from leaving their email server 2 rate limiting rate limiting is to set control on how many em ails can be sent from the source email server within given timeframe by setting limit that is high enough not to undul restrict usage by legitimate users yet low enough to curb the activities of spam mers it is possible to cut down on spam originating from the source email ser ver by significant amount the rate limiting measure is very attractive becaus most email server software today can already be configured to implement this s olution 3 authentication authentication is to provide mechanism for the stination email server or end users email client to verify that the email is i ndeed sent out by the source email server one significant weakness is that it curren tly allows any email client to assert any identityyou can be whoever you claim to be the following is an illustration of how such authen tication mechanism is used to prevent forgery head2right when the destination email server receives an ema il coming from certain ip address the email claims to be from certain sender but we need way to find out if this is genuine head2right the authentication system will tell us one of three things the sender is good the sender has previously anno unced that they do send mail from that ip address b the sender is bad the purported sender has publis hed list of ip addresses they send mail from and the incoming ip isnt one of them c the sender is unknown there is insufficient infor mation to decide one way or the other the source server mail authentication system cannot stop spam by itself but is rather intended to complement other antispam syste ms technically it makes approaches such as domainname blacklists and fine grained reputation systems viable legally it makes it easier to identify and take enforcement action against spammers eg for use of false header information 4 payment payment approach is to provide mechanism to cha rge the user for sending out email via the source email server such payment c ould be of monetary value or just computational resource cycles benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 54 of 104 confidential internal use only perhaps the ultimate endall solution to spam is t start charging for every mail26 as with the rate limiting solution the price to send each email should be low enough to be affordable to an average email us er yet high enough to make it prohibitively expensive for spammers to send millio ns of emails day the monetary approach known as sender pays has diff erent variations and is currently being explored by several antispam compa nies one company that advocates such an approach is silicon valley star tup called goodmail understandably isps are interested in exploring th is idea as it helps them defray the soaring costs of handling email destination email server at the destination email server there are three tec hnical measures to curb spam they are listed as follows head2right rate limiting head2right reputation system and head2right checksum this is the most difficult place to implement any t echnical measures as one persons junk email is source of useful information to an other it can be extremely challenging to implement any filtering mechanism at the destination email server that can satisfy the majority of its users implementing some antispam measures at the destination server will prove to be beneficial beca use head2right endusers mailbox storage space is limited27 and the email inbox gets flooded with spam head2right endusers bandwidth is limited and costly to some users although end users can implement aggressive antispam measur on their desktop they will still need to spend the time and bandwidth to download all the emails to their desktop to proces s them for spam 1 rate limiting conceptually it provides to set control on how m any emails can be received by the destination email server within given timefr ame as with rate limiting at the source email server throttling the amount of emails that can be received by the destination email serv er within given timeframe is simple yet effective solution against spam 2 reputation sy stem conceptually it provides mechanism for destinati on email server to determine if it should receive the incoming email based on t he known reputation of the source email server 26 considering at the same time the drawbacks mentione d before such as the increase in cost would prove c rippling to many developing nations that are in the early stages of adopting new information and communications technol ogies infrastructures and the major changes required to the existing ele ctronic mail infrastructure 27 even with the wide spread of terabyte storage hardw are typically there is an email inbox quota which defines storage limit benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 55 of 104 confidential internal use only the reputation system is perhaps the most controver sial antispam approach on the serverend essentially it is system where t he destination email server decides what is spam and what is not based on the k nown past reputation of the source email server 3 checksum conceptually it provides mechanism for the desti nation email server to determine if an incoming email is of bulk nature ie spam by comparing the incoming email against all the emails previously received by the destination mail server an email that is sent to large numb er of recipients has high likelihood of being spam an email server receives lots of different emails everyday it is usually difficult for the server or even the server admin to determ ine if particular incoming mail is spam or nonspam because every email user has his own email preferences and spam tolerance level enduser email client at the end user email client there are three techn ical measures to curb spam they are listed as follows head2right static filtering head2right adaptive filtering and head2right reputation system enduser side solutions can be far more aggressive because users exercise very high degree of control over their incoming emails and b ecause any action taken by users to tackle spam will affect only their own individual m ailboxes by combining all these approaches in an enduser mail client it is possible to achieve astonishing results in spam reduction on th enduser desktop mailbox 1 static filtering approach conceptually it provides mechanism through the ndusers email client to screen incoming emails by comparing the various at tributes of the incoming mail for example scanning the body of the email to search for the word sex the static filtering approach is the most fundament antispam mechanism it has been incorporated in most modern email clients and services 2 adaptive filtering approach conceptually it provides mechanism through the ndusers email client to screen incoming emails using statistical approac h the enduser will need to train the system so that it can learn to adapt in t he email screening process the major shortfall with static filtering approache s is that it is difficult to be exhaustive in the generation of filtering rules 3 reputation system enduser client conceptually it provide mechanism through the dusers email client to determine if it should receive the incoming email based on the known reputation of the sender benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version

practices for isps and mail box providers these best practices re shown in document called maawg antiphishing best practices this section of the document has been divided in two sections antiphishing techniques and antiphi shing best practices anti phishing techniques head2right inbound filtration of protection message head2right outbound protection schemes head2right web travel filtration inbound filtration of phishing messages inbound filtration of fishing messages has seven di fferent techniques to combat spam they are listed as follows head2right filtration of phishing messages head2right policy considerations head2right end point or client side filtration head2right forgery detection with sender authentication head2right conceal images from untrusted sources head2right disable hyperlinks from untrusted sources head2right visual signals on message legitimacy the following are description of these techniques 1 filtration of phishing messages the most common frontline defense against phishing emails is the use of anti phishingantispam filtration technology at the out ermost border mail transport agent mta or email server this is usually done using the same antispam software that the isp already has in place to detec t and filter spam the following are techniques that have been develop ed and currently they are in use in order to filter spam head2right bayesian content filters head2right ip address blacklists head2right heuristics and fingerprinting schemes benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 58 of 104 confidential internal use only head2right urlbased filters while all of these techniques are effective to vary ing degrees against spam only some perform well against phishing bayesian filters bayesian classifiers filter spam based on their sem antic difference from legitimate communications bayesian filters are in wide use particularly in enduser antispam products most of the bayesian f ilters in use today have been trained to detect spam as such it is rather difficult to detect phishing messages using bayesian classifiers trained to dete ct spam however bayesian classifier specifically trained to detect phishing messages may do better isps that deploy bayesian filters should ca refully measure the effectiveness of their filters against phishing mes sages b ip address blacklists ip addressbased sourcebased filters created to detect spam are particularly poor at detecting phishing messages be cause phishing messages often originate from otherwise good hosts as wit h bayesian filters isps should carefully evaluate the efficacy of their sou rcebased blacklist solutions for recognizing and filtering phishing messages c heuristics and fingerprint schemes rulesbased problemsolving technique heuristic based antispam and antiphishing filters look for telltale signs in mail messages that indicate the message is spam or phishing heuristic solutions ok for specific techniques used by phishers such as encoding the n ame of financial institution in the local part of url and using ip addresses as the host part of the url fingerprinting schemes work by comparing k nown samples of phishing messages against incoming email d urlbased filters some urlbased filters look for specific ip address domains or urls where known phishing web pages are hosted urlbase d filters are fairly effective but based as they are on limited reporti ng can represent only small sample of phishing activity at any given mome nt further it maawg and apwg state that isps should c onduct comprehensive field trials specifically targeted at phishing security before deploying an antiphishing filtration solution ide ally isps should compare multiple solutions to determine their efficacy at s topping phishing attacks 2 policy considerations in many messaging security systems spam is often m arked but then delivered to either users inbox or to special spam fol der which allows users to review message and personally determine whether i t is spam or legitimate mail with phishing messages rather than deliverin g distinguished phishing message to users it is advised that the isp reduce the message or reject it at the smtp level because phishing messages are designed to impersonate legitimate messages many users cannot accurately assess the m essage as phishing attempt additionally it is recommended that benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 59 of 104 confidential internal use only head2right denyreject phishing messages where possible head2right when it is not possible to drop messages due to us er request isp policy or legislative requirements isps should i ndicate to the user that they are phishing messages and although they might look legitimate they are dangerous and should be ignored 3 end point or client side filtration there are several free and commercial endpoint sec urity solutions on the market that plug in to users email software and filter p hishing messages from incoming mail in instances where an isp is unable to provid serverlevel phishing filtration these solutions can be effective endp oint solutions are also recommended so that users can be protected when the are accessing email from multiple accounts some of which may not reside on the isp infrastructure maawg and apwg say that isps should encourage their users to employ end point security solutions to combat phishing 4 forgery detection with sender authentication email authentication is becoming widely adopted mong other things email authentication can be used to determine if the send er has forged the sender identity phishers often try to forge the informati on in the headers to make it appear as if the message originated from legitima institution sender authentication where available can often be used to detect this moreover maawg and apwg states that isps should filter or re ject email if they can unequivocally determine that the senders identity is forged 5 conceal images from untrusted sources email providers long ago disabled javascript and other executables for all incoming email messages there is now positive t rend to disable images by default and to display images only when embedded i n trusted messages further it is recommended by maawg and apwg that i sps should consider turning off images for all messages for which the i dentity and reputation of the sender cannot be established and provide the user the ability to enable those images 6 disable hyperlinks from untrusted sources another method of improving the threat of phishing is to halt hyperlinks in trusted email this makes it more difficult for ph ishers to trick users into clicking through to fraudulent site isps should disable ll hyperlinks in email from trusted sources isps also should remove hyperlinks from suspected phishing mails isps are recommended also to consider turnin g off images for all messages for which the identity and reputation of the sender cannot be established and provide the user the ability to enable those images 7 visual signals on message legitimacy in parallel with their continued effort to block ph ishing messages some mailbox providers also support mechanism that conveys the authenticity of legitimate messages to their users within their email interfa ce although it has been suggested to allow senders to include images inside of the message itself those images are easily faked instead our recommendatio n is that these visual cues should appear in an area of the user interface ui that cannot be altered or benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 60 of 104 confidential internal use only spoofed this may require changes to the email cli ent or webbased email interface benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 61 of 104 confidential internal use only recommendations head2right isps should consider providing their users visual c ues an icon in the message list view andor in the message view highl ighting messages known to be legitimate and from trusted sources head2right each isp should determine to what level they are co mfortable endorsing presumed or known to be legitimate messages and co nvey this endorsement level to users the endorsement level d epends on the isps confidence in the underlying vetting technology and processes head2right this recommendation applies to situations in which the isp controls the user interface webmail proprietary mua plugin f or offtheshelf mua outbound protection scheme phishers often launch their attacks from compromise d servers without the knowledge of the owner of the server or the surrounding netwo rk often these unsuspecting carriers are enduser machines connected to an isp via dialup dsl or cable modem isps should consider outbound content filters when considering an inbound filter isps should also evaluate the outbound capabilities of the solution general recommendations for the isps head2right isps should ensure that their dns architecture is u ptodate old software or systems are more likely to be vulnerabl to attacks and can lead to the compromise of dns server thus puttin g all users of that server at risk for pharming attacks30 head2right isps should remember that phishing and spam are not synonymous train your support representatives to recognize the difference head2right if user reports suspicious email asking for pers onal information the isp should inform the user of the dangers of phishi ng attacks and warn him or her against giving out personal information online the user should be further advised to send copy of the em ail to the isp so it can be used to update filters head2right if the user believes that he or she has been scamme d the user should be urged to file complaint with the appropriate anti fraud organization such as the federal trade commission ftc head2right customer support processes should be in place for q uick remediation in cases where suspected phishing email or site is sent from or hosted by the isp itself head2right customer support should also direct users to consum er education resources that enables them to understand the natur and scope of these threats and which describe measures the isp is tak ing to protect users 30

are several free and commercial effort s underway that provide lists of known phishing urls to organizations that wish to l imit access to these urls isps should enable shortlived blocks on confirmed phish ing sites using firewalls andor webfiltration products recommendations head2right where possible isps should enable shortlived bloc ks on confirmed phishing sites using firewalls andor webfiltratio n products head2right isps should bundle distribute or encourage their users to download web browser plugins that detect and restrict access to known or suspected phishing sites based on phishing url feeds andor p redictive heuristic technologies certain plugins also authenticates l egitimate websites and instill confidence in users about the safety of the ir web experience b anti

immediate action and results the industry f aces increased scrutiny and regulation therefore the maawg recommends the fol lowing set of email transmission best practices for internet and email service providers espsisps head2right should provide email submission services on port 58 731 head2right should require authentication for email submission head2right should abstain from interfering with outbound conne ctivity to port 587 head2right should configure email client software to use port 587 and authentication for email submission head2right should block access to port 25 from all hosts on th eir network other than those that you explicitly authorize to perform smtp relay functions such hosts will certainly include your wn email submission servers and may also include the legitimate

messages rec eived on this port are defined to be submissions t he protocol used is esmtp smtpmta esmtp with additional restrictio ns as specified here while most email clients and servers can be configured to use port 587 instead of 25 there are cases where this is not possible or convenient benchmarking of selected international bodies and initiatives final version page 63 of 104 confidential internal use only head2right should block incoming traffic to their network from port 25 this prevents potential abuse from spammers using asymme tric routing and spoofing ip addresses on their network head2right these practices have been adopted by providers of ll sizes including many of the most popular service providers in the w orld and many maawg members without any appreciable reduction in customer base benefits of adoption requiring authentication and aggregating email tran smission traffic through smtp relays provides an isp with many valuable benefits these measures enable the isp to head2right identify the party responsible for submitted messag head2right filter out spam viruses and other abusive message payloads head2right monitor and limit per customer andor in aggregate transmission rates head2right enforce acceptable use policies and terms of servic for email submission head2right additionally the isp gains the following competiti ve advantages head2right improved deliverability for legitimate email messag because of reduced risk of being blacklisted by receiving inte rnet and email service providers head2right reduced costs for abuse help desk customer support and network operations centres head2right ability to offer premium tiers of service to custom ers who have legitimate need to operate email servers with direc t access to port 25

element p articularly important for the success of antispam legislation increasing awareness of users of the risk of leavin g email addresses on numerous websites is first step to prevent addres s harvesting at the same time that would make it harder and more costly for spamm ers to obtain those addresses the effects of consumers awareness are not limited to spam coming from particular country if people are more careful abou t their email addresses that would also give them certain protection against s pammers from third countries governments make sure that consumers are aware of w here they can complain what will be investigated what action may be taken and what information they need for authorities to launch an investigation while it is important to act at the local levelby

evolving although there are many different sources providing data on the amount of mail categorized as spam the percentage of viruses and the number of phishing scams sent through electronic messages the information is not easily comparable and diverging results are reported this is due to lack of common internati onal definition of spam and to the different methodologies used to measure the amount of spam w hich depend on the various filtering technologies employed most of the data on spam originates from industry in particular from antispam solution providers but also by internet service providers although the latter data are not usually available to the public data gathered by these pl ayers are difficult to compare as they relate to different user base and are founded on different pa rameters this raises number of questions about the completeness of data what is being measu red and if industry should be encouraged to develop single methodology for data collection i n addition internet service providers are often unwilling to disclose information which is nsitive for the company and may damage their competitiveness filtering companies and isps using filters collec t data from their customers that provide measures on the amount of spam detected by the filt ers these data provide an indication of the growth of spam relative to the total volume of ma il the

developed an email metrics program and agreed on series of isps spam indicators to measure the total number of dropped connections resulting f rom ip blocking while this parameter may be imprecise it gives sense of the magnitude of the amount of messages which are not penetrating the networks the total number of blocked or tagged inbound emai ls and percentage of mails going through the isps excluding blocked nections that are identified as spam the focus is therefore on unwanted email so tha t the difficulty of defining spam will be avoided isps data can be compared with measurements of

47 international cooperation and exchange 471 oecd oecd recommends the following national coordination should be first priority multiple authorities have responsibility over inves tigation andor enforcement of the various laws that can be violated by spammers and d not in most cases coordinate to fully exploit synergies means and resources some countries already have coordination mechanism in place for example in australia four agencies have an agreement to cooperate on spamrelated matters the united state s has central contact point to facilitate communication among agencies responsible for spam at federal and state level other countries also need to further efforts to str engthen domestic interagency co operation and to designate one agency as contact point for foreign authorities would facilitate cross border cooperation crossborder enforcement against spam requires gl obal strategy to reach effectiveness if national coordination is prerequisite for int ernational cooperation enforcement action across borders would still benefit from global st rategy to overcome number of challenges to information gathering and sharing to identify enforcement priorities and to develop an effective international enforcement fram ework adequate mechanisms for information gathering and s haring are needed for enforcement agencies to be able to investigate preserve and ob tain information and evidence and share that information with foreign counterparts in appro priate circumstances it may be that cross border cooperation would have its greatest p otential for success when authorities in the country of origin respond to the request of an authority in the recipient country because authorities in the country where spammer is locat ed are generally in better position to identify the person behind an account from which sp am was sent if so enforcement agencies in countries where spam is received should endeavor to locate the spammers and provide evidence enabling the authority in the country where the spam originates to exercise its powers and for example compel produ ction of information as country can be expected to investigate and ta ke action in response to every request from foreign authority it may be appropriate to establish priorities regarding what types of complaints are most appropriate for cross border cooperation despite the differing approaches to legislating against spam and in part icular the optin vs optout it appears that considerable volume of spam would be illegal under most of the current legal frameworks the real challenge is to move tow ards common approach to prioritising38 which cases are worthy of the considerable effort required to bring actions in crossborder cases 38 there are many possible different grounds for gran ting priority to spam compliant multiple factors might be considered in the scene such as the content of the message th degree of damage the false or deceptive claims i n the message etc the most commonly used criteria by oecd countries are ba sed on the type of damage the message may cause g risk to the financial or health interests of consumers user pr ivacy and damage to networks and property the type of spam most commonly identified as being an appropriate priorit for crossborder cooperation is email containin g false or deceptive claims causing damage to the recipient benchmarking of

for international cooperation would b important the range of options is wide further informal frameworks such as bilateral mous39 multilateral or model mous networks such as the london action plan formal fra meworks such as the oecd guidelines on crossborder fraud or binding legal instruments such as the council of europe cybercrime convention while informal framew orks do indeed improve communication and workinglevel collaboration fo rmal framework may be more appropriate in the future to create common stable and effective mechanism at global level such framework would not need to be all inclusive but could constitute the basis for furtherenlarged arrangements among interested play ers and be platform for the various initiatives currently planned or developed global outreach should be the objective one of the major risks to effective enforcement of antispam laws is the ease with which spammers may setup their operations and move to ju risdictions where there is anti spam law where the enforcement capacity is weak an d international cooperation is laden with conditions such jurisdictions may be the weak est link to avoid the creation of spam havens efforts to strengthen capacity to take action against spammers should reach out to the broadest possible coalition of enforceme nt agencies worldwide 472 itu during the 2003 global symposium for regulators r
