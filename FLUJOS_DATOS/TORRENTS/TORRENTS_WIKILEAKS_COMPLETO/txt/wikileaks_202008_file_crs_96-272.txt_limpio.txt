sanctions summary the use of sanctions as foreign policy tool to bring states into conformity with certain international norms whether on human rights nonproliferation aggression or number of other issues plays central and controversial part in current us foreign policy debates much of the authority to impose waive or lift sanctions rests with the president in the case of the peoples republic of china however congress has played an active part in constructing the us sanction regime and given current tensions will probably examine the issue of uschina relations in the coming months to provide context for such debate this paper presents postworld war ii history of us economic sanctions imposed against the peoples republic of china it highlights sanctions currently active and lists occasions

war continued until the communists were victorious in the fall of 1949 while the united states strongly supported the nationalist government of chiang kaishek in the immediate postworld war ii period this crs2 support was considerably lessened by the time of the communist victory the united states did not extend diplomatic recognition to the new government of the peoples republic of china in june 1950 the north korean army invaded south korea and in october 1950 large numbers of chinese volunteers entered the korean war to fight alongside the north koreans us relations with the peoples republic of china remained extremely hostile until july 1969 when the nixon administration began gradual process of improvement1 in may 1973 us liaison office was established in beijing2 n january 1 1979 fullscale diplomatic relations were established with the peoples republic of china further improvements in uschina relations followed in 1979 with settlement on may 11 of financial claims and an agreement on trade relations on july 73 the next decade of uschina relations was marked by increasing cooperation and trade political and economic reforms implemented by deng xiaoping were welcomed and supported by the united states in april 1989 students in beijing held peaceful demonstrations in tiananmen square calling for political liberalization and dialogue with the leadership by early may the demonstrations had spread to other cities and the numbers enlarged by popular support having declared martial law on may 1 1989 president yang shangkun ordered troops to beijing to restore order and on june 3 peoples liberation army troops were deployed in the square under orders to regain the capital in the course of the crackdown that ensued hundreds and perhaps thousands of people were killed or wounded massive arrests executions and the summary imprisonment of demonstrators and sympathizers followed the leadup to the events in tiananmen square and the violent aftermath of the peaceful demonstrations were given extensive coverage by the international press calls for us sanctions against the hardline regime in beijing and review of us policy were immediate to express us condemnation of the crackdown president bush suspended all arms trade military exchanges highlevel government exchanges and sought postponement of multilateral development bank loans congress followed that action with legislation restricting export licenses to china for satellites conditionally withholding international development association funding and conditionally prohibiting exportimport bank support of projects in china in february 1990 congress passed and the president signed into law extensive restrictions on us aid and export licenses to china in the biennial foreign relations authorization act in the years since however these restrictions have been substantially modified and weakened since the incidents at tiananmen square two issues in particularthe transfer of nuclear material and missile proliferationhave attracted us attention and in some cases have led to the imposition of sanctions in the 1980s and early 1990s china supplied nuclear material equipment technology and the design for an atomic bomb to pakistan and also provided nuclear assistance to iran iraq algeria syria and russia4 after years of us encouragement and increasing economic pressures china acceded to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt on march 9 1992 the central intelligence agency reportedly discovered in late 1995 however that crs3 china had recently exported ring magnets to pakistan for use in uranium enrichment such an export apparently violates the npt5 in the early 1990s nonproliferation became the paramount issue in uschina relations in june 1991 the united states accused corporations run by the government of china of exporting m11 missile technology to pakistan and imposed mandatory sanctions in november 1991 the chinese foreign minister verbally agreed to abide by the missile technology control regime mtcr and in february 1992 he sent the united states letter reportedly confirming chinas intent to abide by the export constraints of the sanctions were subsequently lifted on march 23 1992 concern remained however about the transparency of chinas arms and technology export programs the list of missiles covered by the mtcr was expanded in january 1993 to include all those capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction changes china has not explicitly endorsed on august 24 1993 the united states again found china to have shipped m11 missile equipment to pakistan and again imposed sanctions those sanctions were lifted on october 4 1994 after the chinese foreign minister signed pledge not to export particular missiles new intelligence reports surfaced in june 1996 that pakistan has m11 nuclearcapable missiles that are operational due to chinas shipments6 reports of chinese missile technology cooperation and transfers to iran emerged in the mid1980s and did not recede other reports have china making transfers prohibited by mtcr guidelines to iran throughout the 1990s and indicate that shipments may have included ingredients for chemical weapons and scud missile fuel still other reports state that china may have transferred prohibited technology and goods to north korea since 1989 uschina relations have
