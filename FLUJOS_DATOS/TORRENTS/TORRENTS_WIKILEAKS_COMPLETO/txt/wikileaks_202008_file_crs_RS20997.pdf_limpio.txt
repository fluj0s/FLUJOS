has been used to the limits of the uraa market promotion programs like map the f ood aid programs and export credits gsm are not considered to be trade distorting under the current uraa and therefore are not subject to spending disciplines however fo reign trading partners argue that the united states has utilized food aid and export credits as ways to dispose of heavily subsidizedfarm surpluses thereby distorting trade and want such programs to be disciplined in the new round of negotiations 2 some have questioned whether export subsidy and promotion activities actually increase overseas sales or simply displace commercial sales even if sales increase dothey translate into higher farm prices and inco mes or might direct farm subsidies be more costeffective some critics claim that th programs benefit primarily large food and export companies who can afford to pay for promotion activities themselves or foreign buyers more than us producers defenders cite studies claiming positive outcomes fromsuch spending similar questions arise with regard to foreign food aid congressional action the conference version of omnibus farm legislation was approved by the house and senate on may 2

budget plan changes in the programs that effectively would eliminate use ofccc resources under section 416b and result in less overall food aid tonnage next year the administration proposal also calls

legislation exte nds this program first authorized in 1990 to assist emerging democracies trade compliance circuit breaker some critics believe that the laws expanded farm support increases the likelihood that the united states will exceed its ur aa limits 191 billion per year in trade distorting subsidies to allay such concerns the laws drafters included in title i the commodity title requirement that the secr etary of agriculture to the maximum extent practicable make adjustments in domestic farm support to ensure that subsidies do notexceed the limits some have questioned the feasibility of implementing this provision the socalled circuit breaker and how it could be applied equitably among programs and producers also the laws expanded farm supports have caused some critics here and abroad to question the sincerity of the us proposal in ongoing global trade negotiations to further reduce all countries tradedistorting farm policies defenders counter that the unitedstates has remained within its uraa limits and is not likely to exceed them in the future and furthermore that so long as the european union and others heavily subsidize theirfarmers the united states should not unilaterally cut back on aid see crs reportrl30612 farm support programs and world trade commitments
