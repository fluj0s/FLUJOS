ng which is indicated in the manual as feature and cid its primary functions are to relay telephone calls to and from handset and to be in direct communication with handset via the page functions u this type of high power cordless phone is referred to as the 6150 because of the handsets striking resemblance to the european nokia cellular phone model 6150 however this phone is not cellular phone

mhz u iridium sat phones the iridium system requires 66 active satellites in orbit to complete its constellation with spare satellites in orbit to fill in case of failure satellites are in low earth orbit at height of approximately 485 miles 780 km and inclination of 864 satellites communicate with neighbouring satellites via intersatellite links each satellite can have four intersatellite links two to neighbors fore and aft in the same orbital plane and two to satellites in neighboring planes to either side the satellites orbit from pole to pole with an orbit of roughly 100 minutes this design means that there is excellent satellite visibility and service coverage at the north and south poles where there are few customers because satellites use an overthepole orbital constellation design there is seam where satellites in counterrotating planes next to one another are travelling in opposite directions crossseam intersatellitelink handoffs would have to happen very rapidly and cope with large doppler shifts iridium only supports intersatellite links between satellites orbiting in the same direction the cellular lookdown antenna has 48 spot beams arranged as 16 beams in three sectors the four intersatellite cross links on each satellite operate at 10 mbits the cross links were originally envisioned to be optical and future satellites may be equipped with optical links such crosslinks are unique in the satellite telephone industry as other providers such as globalstar depend on local base stations and do not relay data between satellites iridiums use of crosslinks means that calls between satellite phones are cheaper as many such calls never get passed through groundbased repeater stationthe constellation the satellitesthe existing constellation of 66 satellites is expected to remain operational until at least 2014 with many satellites expecte d to remain in service until the 2020s iridium is planning new generation of satellites with improved bandwidth to be operational by 2016 this system will be backward compatible with the current system the satellites each contain seven motorolafreescale powerpc 603e processors running at roughly 200 mhz processors are connected by custom backplane network one processor is dedicated to each crosslink antenna hvarc and two processors svarcs are dedicated to satellite controlone being spare late in the project an extra processor sac was added to perform resource management and phone call processing unclassifiedfor official use onlyunclassifiedfor official use only communication between satellites and handsets is done using tdma and fdma based system using lband spectrum between 1616 and 16265 mhz however iridium exclusively controls 7775mhz of this and shares further 095mhz in 1999 iridium agreed to timeshare portion of spectrum allowing radio astronomers to observe hydroxyl emissions but the amount of shared spectrum was recently reduced from 2625mhz 78air interface the type of modulation used is qpsk9 and each timeslot is 828ms long and sits in 90ms frame within each fdma channel there are four tdma channels in each direction the tdma frame starts off with 2032ms period used for simplex messaging to devices such as pagers and to alert iridium phones of an incoming call followed by the four upstream slots and four downstream slots small guard periods are used in between timeslots channels are spaced at 41666khz and each channel occupies bandwidth of 315khz this allows space for doppler shifts 10 iridium routes phone calls through space there are four earth stations and the spacebased backhaul routes phone call packets through space to one of the downlinks feeder links stationtostation calls can be routed directly through space with downlink as satellites leave the area of an earth base station the routing tables change and frames are forwarded to the next satellite just coming into view of the earth base stationthe original design envisioned completely static 1960s dumb satellite with set of control messages and timetriggers for an entire orbit that would be uploaded as the satellite passed over the poles it was found that this design did not have enough bandwidth in the spacebased backhaul to upload each satellite quickly and reliably over the poles therefore the design was scrapped in favor of design that performed dynamic control of routing and channel selection late in the project resulting in one year delay in system delivery each satellite can support up to 1100 concurrent phone calls 5 and weighs about 700kg6 earth
