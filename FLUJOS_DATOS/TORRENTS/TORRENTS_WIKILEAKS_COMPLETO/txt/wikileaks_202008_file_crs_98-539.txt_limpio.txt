summary this report tracks legislation and issues pertaining to implementation of two new surrogate broadcasting entities radio free iraq and radio free iran since the end of the cold war the us government has continued to apply foreign policy tools that had helped promote the overthrow of communism to current targeted situations such as the threat posed by radical antiamerican regimes in iraq and iran one such tool is surrogate broadcasting after the 19971998 confrontations over access to suspected weapons sites in iraq congress began considering various nonmilitary ways to remove saddam hussein from power primarily by supporting the iraqi opposition one course of action included establishing objective broadcasting in iraq and adding surrogate broadcasting to the existing general broadcasting into iran while congress supported these actions the administration showed less enthusiasm particularly for surrogate service to iran many us officials believed that relations with the new iranian government could improve and feared us surrogate service to iran would impede progress the 105th congress considered number of measures relating to broadcasting into iran and iraq in november 1997 within the context of the us information agencys fy1998 appropriation congress required the creation of surrogate broadcasting referred to as the persian or farsi service to iran

ambassador from prague and vowed to restrict trade ties with the czech republic similarly iraq officials also made clear its opposition to the broadcasts and said this would hurt economic ties with the czech republic1 1 reuters november 3 1998 contents background 1 broadcasting to the middle east 2 congressional actions 3 broadcasting issues 4 foreign policy issues 6 radio free iraq and radio

secretary of state albright credit radio free europeradio libertys rferl broadcasting during the cold war with helping end communism in the soviet union and eastern europe the administration and congress have agreed on using broadcasting once again to help blunt the strategic threats to the united states this time posed by iraq and iran though important issues remain unresolved us governmentsponsored international information and propaganda programs date back to world war i the use of radio for this purpose began in earnest during world war ii when president roosevelt established and operated for short time without the authorization of congress an agency for foreign intelligence and propaganda since world war ii international broadcasting has become an important element of us public diplomacy throughout the world2 the voice of america voa the oldest and largest of the government broadcasting systems was established during world war ii under the us information agency voa provides general broadcasting 24 hours per day in 52 languages around the world it provides over 900 hours of programming each week and employs about 1200 people under its authorizing act voa has three missions 1 to provide consistently reliable and authoritative source of news 2 to represent all of america and present balanced and comprehensive projection of significant american thought and institutions and 3 to present the policies of the united states clearly and effectively and to present responsible discussion and opinion on these policies3 2 us international broadcasting consists of surrogate and general broadcasting surrogate broadcasting provides independent uncensored and accurate news and information of events in the targeted country often closed society as well as cultural programs of that country surrogate broadcasting includes radio free europeradio liberty inc cuba broadcasting and radio free asia in contrast general broadcasting carried out by the voice of america presents reliable source of international news us policies and american culture to listeners overseas 3 22 usc1463 crs2 radio free europeradio liberty is the best known example of us surrogate broadcasting cuba broadcasting and radio free asia are other surrogate services rferl began broadcasting in the early 1950s under the auspices of the central intelligence agency today rferl is private nonprofit broadcaster funded by grants from usias broadcasting board of governors bbg rferl broadcasts approximately 700 hours of programming weekly in 23 languages it employs some 250 staff journalists in prague and about 1000 freelance contributors around the world section 312 of the us international broadcasting act of 1994 pl 103236 states that it is the sense of congress that rferl funding should be privatized by december 31 1999 the fy1998 omnibus appropriations act requires rferl to report before march 1st each year on steps taken to privatize and provide an assessment of whether government funding for surrogate broadcasting is appropriate for fy2000 and beyond broadcasting to the middle east the voice of america currently provides us governmentsupported broadcasting into iraq and iran voa broadcasts seven hours per day of farsi on shortwaves into iran one hour per day of kurdish language broadcasting into northern iraq and seven hours per day of arabic accessible to the entire region including iraq voa provides eight weekly feeds to 12 local fm stations in six arabic countries in addition voa has contingency plans to expand arabic broadcasting by two hours per day the expansion can be accomplished within one or two weeks voa arabic tv is on the air for 30 minutes once each week additionally voa is on the air ten hours per day in english programming to the middle east voa correspondents in the middle east feed reports to fm stations in amman ramallah and tunis radio rabat receives two feeds per week as does palestinian radio voa also maintains an arabic dialin recorded news service with regularly updated news reports begun during the gulf war this service has been used extensively prior to october 30 1998 rferl did not broadcast specifically into iraq iran nor other persian gulf countries it did broadcast into armenia azerbaijan turkmenistan and tajikistan some of which could be heard in iran and iraq rferl had arabic farsi or kurdish language capability for broadcasting into the region although it did have broad authority to establish new surrogate services there if deemed important other outside information in iraq and iran comes from number of sources the british broadcasting corporation bbc provides general news service similar to voa for both iraq and iran as does radio france and deutchewelle from the netherlands several dissident organizations broadcast in iraq but many believe that they have little credibility israel provides surrogate broadcast service in iraq which also reportedly has little credibility since most iraqis continue to regard israel as sworn enemy cnn broadcasts television programs into iraq and iran although it is questionable how many citizens see it satellite dish required for cnn reception is something most iraqis cannot afford and is illegal to own both in iraq and iran although somewhat tolerated in both countries in addition the cnn crs3 broadcasts are primarily to large hotels in key cities and are entirely in english making them incomprehensible to most local people in contrast to information via airwaves print media is the most censored information in iraq only arabic newspapers and magazines are tolerated and even those are heavily edited iranians on the other hand have access to wider range of foreign media and the press there is relatively free compared with iraq congressional actions the 105th congress considered number of measures expanding broadcasting into iraq and iran in november 1997 congress added an amendment to the state department and related agencies appropriations legislation hr 2267pl 105 119 requiring in fy1998 that 4 million of rferls appropriation be used for surrogate us broadcasting in farsi into iran congress provided new funds however rferl with capped appropriations of 75 million established new farsi language service at february 1998 congressional hearing within the context of the us information agency usia appropriations and hearings on iraq administration officials and members of congress began exploring the option of using broadcasting to assist iraqi opposition forces in overthrowing iraqs president saddam hussein david burke chairman of the usias broadcasting board of governors bbg responded to question on establishing new surrogate broadcast service for iraq the population of iraq are prisoners and they deserve the fresh air of truth and honesty and objectivity coming their way and we should be allocating resources to that right away4 on march 10 1998 congress filed conference report hrept 105432 on the foreign relations authorization legislation hr 1757 the house of representatives passed the bill by voice vote on march 26 the senate passed the legislation on april 28 1998 the president vetoed the bill on october 21 1998 because of unrelated international family planning measures section 1813b of hr 1757 would have provided in addition to 10 million for aid to the iraqi democratic opposition authority for 5 million for rferl to establish surrogate radio broadcasting to iraq referred to as radio free iraq with year specified for spending additionally section 1418 of the same legislation would have authorized 2 million in grants for each fy1998 and fy1999 to go only to rferl developing radio free iran broadcasting service on may 1 1998 the president signed fy1998 supplemental appropriations s 1768hr 3579 pl 105174 into law this law provided 5 million to rferl for surrogate broadcasting to iraq and required the bbg to submit plan within 30 4 hearing house appropriations subcommittee on commerce justice state testimony by david burke chairman of the broadcasting board of governors usia february 26 1998 crs4 days of enactment on establishing the surrogate service5 the funds are to be available until sept 30 1999 and the broadcasting service must be called radio free iraq with passage of the bill senator lott had stated this is bipartisan amendmenta start to political approach to changing the regime in iraq6 just prior to ending the second session of the 105th congress voted on measures relevant to us surrogate broadcasting into the middle east on october 20 1998 congress passed hr 4328 popularly referred to as the omnibus appropriations act it authorizes rferl to establish surrogate broadcasting to the iranian people in the farsi language and to be referred to as radio free iran it also requires the bbg to report to congress within 60 days after enactment of the provision which would be about december 20 1998 on the costs and implementation of the surrogate service to iran the president signed the bill on october 21 1998 pl 105277 also in october 1998 congress passed the iraq liberation act of 1998 hr 4655 it authorized 2 million to be appropriated to the usia for fy1999 for radio and television broadcasting by iraqi opposition organizations the measure became law pl 105338 on october 31 1998 although these funds were not appropriated broadcasting issues the broadcasting board of governors and rferl considered number of broadcasting issues in the process of establishing radio free iraq and radio free iran which transmitters to use possible jamming by the local governments the hiring of staff and where the staff should be located an additional concern is rferl privatization due to occur by december 1999 both radio free iraq and radio free iran farsi or persian language service of rferl began broadcasting on october 30 1998 the two surrogate services offer 24hour on line new service over the internet radio free iran airs 45 minutes soon to be increased to one hour of news interviews commentary and callins on shortwave broadcasts which it repeats with updates once each day radio free iraq shortwave broadcasts consist of 1 hour of news commentary and interviews with outsiders which is also repeated once each day with updates the goal by the summer of 1999 is to have each service broadcast 3 hours of original programming each day with 1 repeat for total of 6 hours in each country the transmitters for the broadcasts are in various countries within the region ibb overseas the use of all the broadcasting facilities the transmitters used for the new surrogates may change from timetotime depending on transmitter availability as voa is also using them according to rferl ongoing transmitter issues include increasing transmitter capability particularly in kuwait if expanded surrogate broadcasting is to occur rferl is also seeking adequate mediumwave 5 the bbg sent its report to the relevant house and senate authorizing and appropriations committees on june 4 1998 6 congressional record march 23 1998 p s2408 crs5 transmitter capability for broadcasting in this region both types of transmitter expansions will require an increase in funds they say7 rferl is authorized to fill total of 12 or 14 staff positions to work directly with each of the two new surrogates as of december 1998 rferl has hired between 8 and 10 people for each service although as many as 43 employees including regional specialists interpreters and broadcasting monitors are providing indirect support for these new broadcast services generally the staff for radio free iran and radio free iraq are located predominately in prague but few will be in washington new york and london establishing these new surrogates has taken time newlyhired rferl journalists researchers and broadcasters for radio free iran and iraq are learning as they go on how to report in closed society for the most part the staff reporting into iraqiran now were not with rferl in its early days of reporting into russia when it was closed therefore there is certain amount of inexperience and re inventing the wheel in operating radio free iraq and radio free iran another difficulty for the new staff perhaps hindering their effectiveness has been that they are navigating between two entirely different foreign policy situations broadcasting into iraq vs into iran about midyear appointment of the directors for the new broadcast entities occurred on july 30 1998 rferl announced the appointment of dr stephen c fairbanks formerly with the state department the foreign broadcast information service and the peace corps to director of rferls farsi language service month later rferl announced the appointment of ambassador david newton formerly ambassador to iraq from 19841988 ambassador to yemen from 1994 1997 and middle east expert with the department of state the potential audience for these surrogate broadcasts is expected to be low at first but may gradually increase over time according to experts on iraq in particular the people are starved for objective information about what is going on inside their own country iraqis may not trust the surrogate radio broadcasts at first because they will likely attribute antiregime news or cultural information to us propaganda over time however when the iraqis are able to verify accounts to be true the audience of radio free iraq will likely gain in popularity according to proponents8 nevertheless iraqi authorities have said that they will not even bother to jam radio free iraq broadcasts saying we believe our people are immune to hostile propaganda9 iranians on the other hand already have access to wide range of foreign media therefore radio free iran might have even more difficulty competing and establishing following 7 conversation with paul goble rferl december 12 1998 8 telephone conversation with dr adeed dawisha professor of politics george mason university april 30 1998 9 iraq says it wont bother to jam broadcasts by usbacked radio by leon barkho associated press december 1 1998 crs6 according to rferl interviews of people leaving iraq indicate people are tuning in to radio free iraq out of curiosity in iran on the ground interviews indicate an audience for radio free iran as well in both cases however there is indication of whether people are believing what the broadcasts are relaying foreign policy issues some members of congress perceived the foreign policy objectives for establishing radio free iran and radio free iraq as being comparable according to senator brownback key sponsor of creating surrogate broadcasting service to iran the recent elections in iran illustrate the will and desire of the people of iran for freedom democratic institutions and lifestyles now is the time to give them one more tool to support this desire the iranian people are among the most oppressed people in the world they have very little access to outside information to diverse political civil and religious thought radio free iran is just one part of multi faceted approach to the problem iran poses to the security of the united states and to our friends and allies in the region similarly surrogate broadcasting into iraq is part of broader strategy consisting of wide array of actions to address saddam hussein as threat to us security that broader strategy according to an open letter to the president from 28 prominent foreign policy experts might include recognizing provisional government in iraq restoring safe haven in northern iraq in which the provisional government would have authority lifting sanctions in liberated areas of the country and releasing frozen assets to the control of the provisional government in iraq10 in contrast to congressional views the clinton administration was reluctant to embrace either new surrogate service but especially radio free iran while the administration supported increased farsilanguage broadcasting by voa it did not support surrogate service for iran at time when there has been change in the iranian government and potential for improvement in usiranian relations state department officials voiced their position on the congressionallymandated creation of radio free iran saying that one should misinterpret radio free iran as an attempt to undermine the iranian government or in any way diluting the very clear position we have that we are encouraged by the developments in iran that we believe that the best way to overcome the differences between our two countries is to have an authorized and acknowledged dialogue improvement in the breadth and diversity of information in the public media will add to the political debate which we note is already taking place in iran whatever happens with this radio broadcasting we think it will enrich what is already lively political debate in iran11 10 open letter to the president from the committee for peace and security in the gulf congressional record march 2 1998 p s1179 11 state department briefing april 15 1998 crs7 while the administration was more supportive of establishing radio free iraq most foreign policy officials believe that it is small foreign policy tool with very longrun perspective that can only contribute to accomplishing us foreign policy objectives and support the iraqi opposition if used in concert with policy options12 many in congress supported establishing surrogates in iraq and iran as lowcost lowrisk efforts to support freedom but others claimed that the effects of the broadcasting would be too slow with unmeasurable results the cost is relatively low at the present time 5 million for radio free iraq comparable to the initial funding for radio free asia and 4 million for radio free iran if audiences in these countries never become established however or if the target country governments are successful in jamming the broadcasts then the value of surrogate broadcasting into these countries and the corresponding 9 million may be questioned the administrations fears of antagonizing the new iranian government were confirmed when three days after rferls first farsi broadcast iran withdrew its ambassador from prague and vowed to restrict trade ties with the czech republic similarly iraq officials also made clear its opposition to the broadcasts and said they would hurt economic ties with the czech republic13 in december 1998 at the time of the us attacks on baghdad czech officials increased security around the broadcasting headquarters in prague radio free iraq director david newton stated that rferl expanded its broadcasts into iraq to two 2hour broadcasts daily following the december air strikes on baghdad the original daily 2 hours was live with one repeat daily while the us government funds radio free iraq it does not influence its content newton stated however that we share the same goals of democracy and human rights we are using truth and objectivity to get through the totalitarian wall we reported reaction from around the worldpositive and negative and from the middle east positive and negative14 12 see crs report iraq us policy options by kenneth katzman 98393f 13 reuters november 3 1998 14 reuters usbacked radio free
