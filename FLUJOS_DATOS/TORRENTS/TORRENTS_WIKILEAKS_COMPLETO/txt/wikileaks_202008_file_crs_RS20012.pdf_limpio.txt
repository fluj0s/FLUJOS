legislative attorney american law division summary two recent court decisions have called into question the viability of environmental citizen suits in steel co the supreme court denied plaintiff standing in citizen suit where the defend ant came into compliance after plaintiff sent its notice of intent to sue but before it filed the complaint subsequently the fourth circuit in laidlaw invoked mootness doctrine to extend steel co to where the citizensuit defendant achieve s compliance after the complaint is filed but before entry of final judgment to be sure both suits resulted in compliance but they also allow defendants to foreclose civi l penalties by coming into compliance eliminating much of the incentive citizen suit s create for adva nce compliance in addition the possibility of case dismissal and denial of litigation costs when the defendant cures its transgression in time may make citizen suits unattractive to the many citizen enforcers who depend on s uch cost awards should congress find it appropriate to address this situation the citizen suit concept has it s detractors as well as supporters steel co and laidlaw arguably could be negated by various amendments to current citizen suit provisions backgroundhistory in enacting the clean air act caa of 1970 congress create d the first citizen suit provision in federal law the caa provision allows persons to file suit on their ow n1 behalf to compel compliance with th act if neither federal nor state enforcers do so as well citizenplaintiffs are invited to use the courts to compel epa

lacks citizen suit provision is the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide actin the years that followed congress added citizensuit language to roughly twenty statutes including most all federal environmental statutes of regulatory bent these2 provisions generally track the caa prototype for example suit typically can only b brought for regulatory violations 60 days or more after plaintiff has given notice of th violatio n to the relevant federal agency the state and the alleged violator and only i f neither the united states nor the st ate is diligently prosecuting civil or criminal action in court to require compliance one key addition to t he caa model in the caa clean water act and elsewh ere was new remedy citizensuit plaintiffs could ask courts to impose on violators not just injunctive orders but civil money penalties as well insertion of the c itizen suit provision in the 1970 caa was vigorously debated and even later enactments adopted the device with expressions of congressional caution that it be properly limited more pertinent here some observers questioned whether citizen suits by incorporating broad grants of standing t sue might be on collision course with increasingly restrictive supreme court notions as to what the constitution demands for standing standing doctrine seeks to limit who can invo ke the jurisdiction of the federal article iii courts district courts courts of appeals and the supreme court by insisting that plaintiffs have concrete stake in the outcome of the suit the doctrine seeks to ensure that such courts will have the benefit of vi gorous case preparation and argument by all parties standing prerequisites are textually rooted in article iiis statement that courts create d under that constitutional provision may only hear cases and controversies today the article iiiderived standing test has three components injury in fact causation and redres sability first plaintiff must allege and ultimately prove an injury in fact concrete harm that has been or imminently will be suffered by him or her second there must be causation that is connection between the plaintiffs injury and the complainedof conduct of the defendant and third there must be redressability likelihood that the requested relief will redress the injury because these conditions ar constitutionally based congress may not eliminate them by statutehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20012crs3 and indeed has see eg bennett v spear 520 us 1154 1997 citizen suit provision i n3 endangere d species act negated zone of interests test by

supreme cour t holds that plaintiffs must satisfy certain prudential conditions imposed by the courts to insure the efficient administration of justice in particular the court has refrained fro m adjudicating generalized grievances ie injuries shared by broad segment of th public and has require d that the plaintiffs injury fall within the zone of interests to be protected by the statute in question because they are not constitutionally based congress may legislate away these standing prerequisites3 we now turn to our focus here two recent environmen tal court decisions that denied standing to citizensuit plaintiffs seeking to compel regulatory compliance with federa l environmental laws or punish past noncompliance two recent environmental decisions steel company compliance achieved before complaint filed in steel company v citizens for better environment the supreme court sought4 to resolve circuit split as to whether the citizensuit provision of the emergency planning and community righttoknow act epcra uthorizes suit for wholly past violations5 following the environmental grou ps mailing of the requisite 60day notice the defendant company had corrected the noncompliance failure to file epcrarequired chemica l inventory and release forms before the actual complaint was filed the court failed to reach the merits h owever because the environmental group was found to lack st anding assuming that failure to file the forms was an injury in fact for standing purposes the cou rt held that the relief requested in the complaint failed to meet the redressabili ty prong of standing first the civil penalties sought by plaintiff were not payable to it but rather went to the us treasury thus they c ould not redress any injury incurred by the plaintiff nor said the court does plaintiffs possible satisfaction in seeing defendant get its just desserts and the rule of law vindicated constitute an article iii injury second plaintiff sought recovery of its investigation and prosecution costs to the extent that these costs were the result f the litigation however they failed to support standing obviously said the court plaintiff cannot achieve standing to litigate substantive issue by bringing suit for the co st of bringing suit in contrast investigation6 costs incurred prior to the litigation ie unrelated to the litigation assuredly did support article iii standing problem was the pcra citizen suit provision authorized7 the recovery of only costs of litigation httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20012crs4 id at 10208 484 us 49 19879 149 f3d 303 4th cir 1998 petition for cert filed 67 uslw 3364 nov 9 1998 9810 82 149 f3d at 30611 presteel co decision of the fourth circuit had held t the contrary in sierra club v simkins12 industries inc 847 f2d 1109 1113 4th cir 1988 the court concluded that because penalties can be an important deterrent against future violations they could redress private plaintiffs injury from regulatory violations even thou gh the penalties are not paid to the plaintiff of course steel co required the fourth circuit to abandon this position in laidlaw the pre steel co fourth circuit view appears to have been the dominant view at the time writing in 1993 one commentator noted that the maj ority rule is that in cases where defendant achieves compliance only after citizen suit complaint has been filed civil penalties claims survive the mooting of injunctive relief timothy wilkins mootness doctrine and the post compliance pursuit of civil penalties in environmental citizen suits 17 harv envtl l rev 389 390 1993finally the environmental group sought injunctive relief eg enabling it to inspect the companys facility and records injunctive relief is only warranted however to deter the real possibility of futu re injury and the environmental group had not alleged any such threat the court further rejected the argument of amicus united states that there is presumption of future injury when the defendant voluntarily ceases an illegal activity as the result of litigation an allegation of injury sufficient to support standing said the court must be particular and concrete thus it concluded injunctive relief would not redress8 the groups injury one effect of steel co is to constitutionalize the courts earlier ruling in gwaltney of smithfield ltd v chesapeake bay foundation inc gwaltney held on purel y9 statutor grounds that the clean water act did not allow citizen suits for wholly pas t violations laidlaw compliance achieved after complaint filed in friends of the earth v laidlaw environmental services inc environmenta l10 groups filed c itizen suit that unlike steel co alleged regulatory infractions ongoing at the time of filing in this case violati ons of clean water act permit the district court imposed 405800 civil penalty but noting that laidlaw had achieved substantia l compliance during the suit ruled that injunctive relief was unnecessary on appeal the fourth circuit dismissed the entire case as mo ot mootness arises the court began when the article iii standing components do not continue to exist at every stage of revi ew not merely at the time of the filing here as in steel co the11 redressability component was held not to tinue to exist the courts argument was that because plaintiffs did not appeal the denial of injunctive relief the only possibl redress for their claimed injurie s was the civil penalties however the steel co decision instructed that because such penalties are paid to the us treasury they cannot redress any injury suffered by citizen plaintiff nor did any satisfaction plaintiff might derive12 from seeing wrongdoer punished constitute an article iii injury in facthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20012crs5 33 usc

1126 oct 2 1998 richard lazarus rise and demise of the citizen suit 15 envtl forum 5 at 8 septoct 1998important here the co urt also barred recovery of plaintiffs attorneys fees and other litigation costs under the terms of the clean water acts citizen suit provision it noted such recovery is available only to prevailing or substantially prevailing party the13 court acknowledged gwaltney s citation of clean water act legislative history for th proposition that cos ts could be awarded when case becomes moot because defendant voluntarily comes into compliance it disregarded gwaltney however on the groun d14 that the court there did not discuss the 1987 clean water act amendment adding th prevailing party language to disreg ard supreme court opinion because of assumed or actual defects in its logic is questionable judicial practice analysis the impact of steel co alone is unclear prospective citizensuit plaintiffs coul d search for ins tances of noncompliance that are unlikely to be remedied within the 60day period followi ng notice of intent to sue compliance within 60 days may be difficult for example where it involves great expense and extensive cha nges in plant operations even if defendant c ures the noncompliance before the complaint is filed plaintiffs costs at this early stage may be manageable so nonrecovery of such costs from defendant may be an acceptab risk and after all compliance was achieved thus the possibility of pre complaint compliance may not deter the sending of 60day notice letters if the laidlaw holding is widely adopted however reduction in the number f citizen suits seems very likely the strategy suggested by steel co will be foreclosed15 since coming into compliance after the filing of the citizen suit but before final judgment will be sufficient to defeat the claim and bar any award of costs and at this later stage in the proceedi ngs possibly after years of effort and expense denial of costs takes bigger bite arguably steel co and particularly laidlaw may have second impact the civil penalties imposed under citizen suits sup plement the threat of government enforcement as an incentive for regulated entities to conform to the law in adv ance of enforcement efforts if citizen enforcers are unable to secure civil penalties and only bring about voluntar compliance there is economic benefit to companys coming into compliance until citizen suit is filed at least not based on citi zen suits only the possibility of government pursuit of civil penalties and perhaps tort liability makes compliance rational pre enforcement strategy of course the citizen suit conc ept has its detractors as well as supporters for its supporters citizen suits were instrumental in ensuring facility compliance for it s detractors however citizen suits bordered on extortion and allowed environmentalist shttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20012crs6 lazarus supra note 1516 31 usc 3730d17 see references supra note 15 18to maintain suits for technical violations so trivial that they had not warrante d governmental enforcement thus it is by means clear that congress even should16 it conclude that the abovedescribed impacts will occur will choose to respond i f congress determines that such results are undesirable however it has at least thre options for negating steel co and laidlaw 1 bounties or dam ages congress might authorize recovery by successful citizen plaintiff of monetary sum eg percenta ge of the civil penalties imposed or damages for persona l or property injury the first bountylike solution resembles the qui tam provision in the false claims act under which citizens may bring suit for violations of the false claims act and rec eive 15 to 30 percent of the civil penalty awarded or settlement amount commentators have written approvingly of the bounty option however17 18 there may be constitutional complication where there remains injury in fact whos abatement may be aided by the bounty payment as when plaintiffs only claimed injury is an agencys failure to disclose information and that failure has already been rectified 2 mitigation paym ents congress might authorize the earmarking of civil penalties for mitigating the environmental problem that prompted the citizen suit less clearl sufficient from constitutional standpoint is placing the recovered civil penalty in state or local fund that supports remediation of environmental problems over broad area including the problem that gave rise to the citizen suit in question as above wit h bounties these solutions assume lingering injury 3 expenses unrelated to litigation steel co recall not ed that recovery of expenses unrelate d to the litigation there the prelitigation cost of digging up the informatio n defendant should have file d would support standing hence congress might consider an expansion of the plaintiff costs recoverable through citizen suits to embrace thi s category if steel co and laidlaw widely adopted ulti mately do reduce the number of citizen suits and their value as incentives for advance compliance one should not assume tha t rampant flouting of environmental and other regulations will result nothing in thes decisions impairs the enforcement ability of federal agencies or state agencies unde r delegated federal programs the key issue is whether government enforcement s frequently assisted by citizen watchdogs as the possible result of these decisions ca n achieve level of compliance by the regulated community that congr ess and the public still regard as acceptable
