19872006 updated january 29 2008 thomas gabe specialist in social policy domestic social policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30797trends in welfare work and the economic wellbeing of femaleheaded families with children 19872006 summary more than decade has passed since repeal of the nations major cash welfare program assisting lowincome families with children and its replacement with program of temporary assistance for needy families tanf tanf ended the 61 yearold federal entitlement program to poor families w ith children aid to families with dependent children afd c major purpose of t anf is to end dependence of needy families on government assistan ce by limiting the time they may receive federal assistance fiveyear maximum or fewer years under state option and by promoting job preparation work and ma rriage tanf gives states increased flexibility to design programs to assist needy families with children over what existed under afdc the majority of families assisted by t anf and its predecessor afdc program are poor and lowincome singlep arent families headed mostly by women this report examines trends in welfare work and the economic wellbeing of femaleheaded families with children the principal gr oup affected by the replacement of afdc with tanf the report presents analysis of 20 years of us census bureau current population survey cps da ta the principal source of information for us family income and poverty statis tics the analysis spans the runup in welfare caseloads that began in 1989 to reach an alltime high in 1994 and the historic caseload declines th at have since followed over the period studied variety of economic demographic and public policy and progra m changes besides tanf are likely to have affected welfare work and the economic wellbeing of single mother families this report does not attempt to untangle these possible effects the analysis shows that there has been dramatic transformation with regard to welfare work and poverty status of si ngle mothers over the past 20 years many of these changes began before the passa ge and implementati on of tanf but have continued perhaps to an even greater extent since the analysis shows that single mothers are more likely to be working in recent than in past years and that they are less likely to receive cash welfare or to be poor however reduc tions in poverty have not been as large as the large declines in welfare and the increased rates of work that have occurred the analysis indicates that welfare receipt rates among poor families headed by single mothers have dropped considerably among single mothers whose incomes place them in the bottom fifth of all such mothers income from earnings supplemented by the earned income tax credit eitc has grown markedly since 1993 but s been insufficient to offset concurrent losses in cash welfare and food stamp benefits while single mothers are less dependent on welfare in most recent than in past years increased work has not resulted in marked gains in net income for these lowestincome families the report suggests that fulltime fullyear work may be necessary but not sufficient to raise single mothers family in comes above poverty us income support policy will continue to be challenged to promot economic selfsupport through work and to reduce poverty and welfare pendency among families headed by single mothers this report will be updated nnually when new census bureau data are releasedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30797contents introduction 1 v r v i w 4s i n g l m t h r s m p l m n t r t s 7welfare receipt among

decade has passed since repeal of the nations major cash welfare program assisting lowinco families with children nd its replacement with program of temporary assistance for needy families tanf tanf signed into law as part of the persona l responsibility and work pportunity reconciliation act prwora pl 104193 replaced th 61yearold aid to families with dependent children afdc program federal entitlement program to lowincome families with children tanf eliminated the federal entitlement to assistance that existed under afdc replacing an openende d matching grant program with fixed dollar block grant program and imposing maximum fiveyear lifetime limit receipt of federallyfunded assistan ce states may impose shorte r limits than the maximum tanf gives states increased flexibility to design programs to assist needy families with children over what existed under its predecessor program major purpose of tanf is to end dependence of needy families on government assistance by limiting the time they may receive assistance and by promoting job preparation work and marriage the majority of families assisted by tanf and its pred ecessor afdc program are poor and lowincome singlep arent families headed mostly by women this report examines trends in welfare work and economic wellbeing of femaleheaded families with children the principal group affected by the repl acement of afdc with tanf the report presents data from congressional research service crs analysis of us bureau of the census march current population survey cps the principal source of informa tion for us family income and poverty statistics the analysis is based on c ps data collected fro m march 1988 to march 2007 the earliest years data precedes the passage of the fa mily s upport act of 1988 pl 100485 the last major nationwid reform to the afdc program prior to its repeal under tanf the data series begins before the most recent runup in cash welfare caseloads that occurred under afdc in the late1980s and early 1990s it captures the caseload increase to its pea k in 1994 and the historic caseload decline that followed over the period examined in this report variety of economic and demographic factors and policy interventions are genera lly thought to have affected cash welfare caseloads increased numbers of singlemother families especially nevermarried mothers who are prone to poverty and receipt of welfare as well as the ill effects of an economic recession jul 1990 to marc h 1991 are generally thought to havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30797crs2 1 see for example crs report 937 demographic

gene falk 3 section 1115 of the social security act grants the secretary authority to waive compliance of states with certain sections of the so cial security act for state experiments or demonstrations which the secretary judges to promote specific objectives of the act 4 see crs report rl30785 the child care and development block grant background and funding by melinda gishcontributed to the increase in the afdc caseload from mid1989 to march 19941 the 10year long economic expansion fro m march 1991 to march 2001 the longest in us history presented most favorable economic climate to provide jobs to mothers who otherwise might rely on welfare and is considered to have contributed to declines in welfare caseloads the economic recession that followed march to november 2001 is likely to have contributed to the subsequent leveling off of tanf caseloads2 and increases in food stamp program caseloads variety of welfare policy interventions are likely to have affected welfare caseloads by conditioning benefits on new behavioral requirements for example the 1988 family s upport act extended work requireme nts which could include work preparation activities such as education and training from mothers with child as young as 6 to mothers with child as young as 3 under the law states had the option of extending work requirements to moth ers with child as young as 1 in the years immediately preceding passage of th 1996 welfare law states experimented with changes to welfare policy under waiver authority granted to the secretary of the department of health nd human services dhhs3 among the features of state programs tested under waiver authority gr anted by the secretary were efforts to strengthen work requirements experiments requiring w ork first approach rather than training first followed by work time limits strengthened sanctions for noncompliance with welfare rules and cappi ng of welfare benefits for new baby conceived or born while mother was receiving welfare after the passage of the 1996 welfare reform law many states adopted these and many other approaches first tried under welfare waivers in addition number of other policy inte rventions are generally thought to have promoted work compared to welfare over the period examined in this report expanded eligibility and funding for child care has helped make work possible for mothers who otherwise might have difficulty finding child care for example the 1988 family support act expanded eligibility for child care assistance in the form of transitional child care assistance for families working their way off afdc in 1990 federally funded child care assistan ce was extended to lowincome families deemed to be at risk of receiving we lfare under the child ca re and development block grant ccdbg4 expansions to the earned income tax credit eitc in 1990 phasedin 1991 nd 1992 and in 1993 phasedin 1994 through 1996 expanded the credits work bonus to familie s with

furthermore since the passage of tanf mo st states have increased financial work incentives for families receiving cash assist ance by allowing families to keep more of their cash welfare benefit as their earnings increase8 untangling the effects of demographic f actors the economy welfare policy and other policy interventions on singlemothers work behavior welfare receipt income and poverty status is beyond the scope of this repor t others have attempted to parcel out these effects with mixed success and differing conclusions as to the relative impacts of each9 in contrast to these efforts this report is intended to simply describe changes in single mothers welfare work income and poverty status that have occurred over the past 20 years the analysis which follows relies on data from the us bureau of the census annual social and economic supplement asec tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30797crs4 10 the cpsasec was formerly known as th march supplement to the current population survey as data for the social and economic supplement were collected in march of each year beginning in 2001 the census bureau expanded the cps sample for collecting social and economic supplementary data to include some households interviewed in february and april most of the households in the asec are still interviewed in march and estimates for the full asec continue to be controlled to independent population estimates for march 11 unlike longitudinal surveys the cps does not follow the same families from year to year longitudinal surveys allow for the study of how individual families circumstances change over time 12 see appendix which compares cps estimates to afdctanf caseload counts 13 administrative caseload statistics show th caseload as peaking in march 1994 with nearly 51 million cases by march 2006 the caseload had dropped to 18 million cases 65 decline from its march 1994 peakthe cps10 over the period examined the cpsasec data provides comparatively consistent approach for assessing changes in the economic status of singlemothers and their families the cpsasec asks questions about family compos ition in march family members labor force and employment status in the month and retrospective accounting of income and labor force participation during the prior year the data presented in this re port capture family composition from march 1988 to march 2007 and family in come and poverty status from 1987 to 2006 providing representative crosssecti on of families headed by single mothers in each year11 overview cps data show an increase in cash welfare receipt afdc tanf or other assistance among single mothers durin g the late 1980s and early 1990s and decrease in the midtolate 1990s the cps data generally correspond to the caseload rise and fall documented by administra tive program data but underestimate the caseload statistics to some extent12 figure 1 shows that the total number of single mothers increased from 84 million in 1989 to about 99 million in 1993 an increase of 15 million or 17 from 1993 throug h 2000 the number of single mothers remained fairly stable ranging between 97 and 101 million since 2000 the number of single mothers has increas ed by over one million from 10 million in 2000 to 109 million in 2006 the number of single mothers in familie s reporting receipt of cash welfare on the cps increased from 25 million in 1989 to 34 million in 1993 an increase of 900000 or 36 over the fouryear period compared to 1993 the peak year of welfare receipt the number of single mothers reporting cash welfare was down to just under one million 991000 in 2006 71 decline from 1993 the bottom shaded portion in figure 1 13 over the same period the number of poor single mothers who reported receiving cas h welfare increased from 1722 million in 1993 to 3120 million in 2006 an 81 increas over the period the middleshaded area in figure 1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30797crs5 14 the official us census bureau defin ition counts cash pretax income against poverty thresholds that vary by family size and composition in 2006 for example single mother with one child would be considered poor if her income were below 13896 and if she had two children below 16242figure 2 provides an overview of single mo thers welfare work and poverty status from 1987 to 2006 the figure shows that since 1993 the share of single mothers who worked at some time during the year has increased markedly and that the share who received cash welfare afdc or post1996 tanf has declined significantly as has the share who are poor under the official poverty definition14 the figure illustrates that while both cash welfare recipiency rates and poverty rates for single mothers have generally fa llen since 1993 single mothers welfare recipiency rate has fallen faster than their poverty rate more recently since 2000 the poverty rate of single mo thers has increased but cash welfare receipt has not growing share of single mothers

whose youngest child was of school age age 617 had employ ment rates about equa l to those of their married counterparts over the 19882006 period healthy economy during much of the 1990s combined with transformed welfare system improvements to the eitc and increases in the minimum wage are among factors thought to have encouraged work among single mothers tanf and the afdc waivers that preceded it transformed cash assistance from needsbased entitlement to program of temporary assistance encouraging work and personal responsibility imposition of work require ments time limits nd sanctions and in most states more generous earnings disreg ards all serve to encourage work either in lieu of welfare or for temporary peri od in conjunction with welfare the eitc which is conditioned on earnings is thought to encourage work among most groups especially single parents who were not work ing or who were marginally attached to the labor market increases in the ei tc passed by congre ss in 1993 and phased in between 1994 and 1996 have increased the fi nancial incentive for single mothers to work15 other factors such as increased f unding for child care subsidies may also have contributed to making work po ssible for more single mothers given their greater attachment to the work force in recent years one might expect single mothers to be more severe ly impacted by downturns in the economy than in years past evidence from the most recent recession march to november 2001 shows declining employment rate and increased incidence in poverty among single mothers since 2000 the employment rate among single mothers has yet to rebound seven years after having reached hi storic high and th eir poverty rate has yet to show significant movement back toward it historic low reached seven years ago in contrast in the previous rece ssion july 1990 to march 1991 single mothers also experienced declining employment and an increased incidence in poverty although their employment rate was lower nd their poverty rate higher than today however in the previous recession em ployment rebounded sooner after three years and the poverty rate increase abated within two years and began to fall once again after three welfare receipt among single mothers figure 4 shows that cash welfare recipiency rates among single mothers overall and among poor single mothers based on their pre transfer income ie cash income excluding cash welfare remained fa irly steady during the 19871993 period but have fallen considerably since among single mothers overall about onethird received cash welfare during the late1980s and early 1990s with low of about 30 in 1989 and peak of about 35 in 1993 cash welfare recipiency rates amonghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30797crs9 single mothers began to fall after 1993 fa lling to 10 in 2002 drop in the rate from nine years earlier of more than tw othirds with the exception of 2003 cash welfare recipiency rates have remained around 10 since 2002 the apparent rise in the 2003 recipiency rate may be an aberration in cps measurement as administrative caseload data showed such increase see appendix for further discussion of cps and admin istrative data caseload tr ends in 2006 only about 9 of single mothers were receiving cash welfare recent declines in cash welfare recipiency rates have not simply been due to diminished need for assistance as recipiency rates have fallen even among mothers who would appear to be in economic n eed based on their pretransfer income relative to poverty for example figure 4 shows that among single mothers who were poor based on their pretr ansfer cash income ie in come before counting cash welfare the share who received cash welfare generally held relatively steady around 63 in most years over the 1987 93 period since 1993 the cash welfare recipiency rate among single mothers w ith pretransfer income below poverty has fallen dramatically in 2006 only about one in five 202 single mothers with pre transfer income

likely to be receiving cash welfare in recent than in earlier years figures 4 and 5 similarly like all single mothers poor single mothers are also now more likely to be working than not changes in poor mothers participation in wo rk and welfare status first became evident in the earlytomid 1990s with rates of employment increasing after 1992 and rates of welfare receipt declining after 1993 see

share of poor single mothers who received cash welfare at any time during the year fell from ju st over 60 in the 198793 period to about 19 in 2006 the rate of decline in welfare receipt among poor single mothers has been greatest since 1996 pe riod coinciding with the passage and imp lementation of national welfare reform legisl ation similarly the share of poor single mothers who were working

family members support from unrelat ed household members which is not included in the official poverty measure and other means of support from outside the household not captured on the cps it may also reflect income reporting problems on the cps especially with regard to welfare income17 finally welfare diversion and sanction policie s may have contributed to the increased number of poor mothers

changes in the economy and changes in welfare policy and other programs such as the eitc have both di rect and indirect effects on income and poverty however the official us poverty measure counts only family cash income excluding capital gains and lump sum or onetime payments against familys poverty threshold which varies by family size and compositio n to determine whether family is counted as poor the finition does not include the value of in kind benefits such as food stamps school lunches or public housing subsidies nor does it include the effects of ta xes or tax credits such as the eitc inclusion of in kind benefits and the eitc provides mo re comprehensive income definition than the official definition additionally other unrelated hous ehold members may contribute to the familys ec onomic wellbeing but deter mining the extent to which resources are shared among unrelated household members is often difficult figure 8 shows the effects of income from these other sources on poverty among all single mothers components of family income are quentially added and measured against families poverty thresholds as one moves from the top line of the chart to subsequent lines

on family size and co mposition to households based on household size and composition it must be noted that official poverty measurement is based on family concept which assumes that family members share income and economies of scale that result from shared living arrangements it is generally agreed among researchers that assumptions regarding income sharing and shared economies of scale among related family members who have ties based on blood marriage and adop tion do not apply to the same extent among unrelated household members consequently these estimates of household wincome status

congress house committee on ways and means 2004 green book table 716 tanf phaseout points pp 751 to 753 washington dc march 2004in viewing figure 8 note that the trend in earnings is the principal factor affecting the declining trend in poverty wh ereas the other income sources with the exception of the eitc affect the leve l of poverty more than its trend over time evidence of this effect is that most lines in the chart with the exception of the eitc roughly run parallel to the ones above effect of earnings and other nonwelfare cash income on poverty figure 8 shows that between 1993 and 2000 sing mothers poverty based on family earnings alone fell from 562 to 408 line 1 as result of the economic recession their earnedincome poverty rate rose from 2001 through 2004 and in 2006 at 445 was still above its historic low in 2000 adding other cash income except cash welfare to family earnings line 2 reduces poverty in 1993 from 562 line 1 to 474 line 2 and in 2006 from 445 to 357 effect of cash welfare on poverty cash welfare benefits ve only small impact on the poverty rate as these benefits generally are not sufficient even when combined with other cash income to lift families above the federal poverty threshold in the vast majority of states the level of earnings or other cash income at which states cash welfare benefits under tanf become unavailable for family are well below the poverty line for example in january 2003 in only seven st ates could single mother with two children have earnings above the poverty line and still continue to receive tanf cash assistance18 consequently cash welfare benefits have little impact on the poverty rate the addition of cash welfare line 3 representing the official income definition for measuring poverty redu ces poverty only slightly from 474 line 2 to 452 line 3 in 1993 and from 357 to 351 in 2006 nonetheless cash welfare benefits can have significant impact on the level of poor families incomes affecting the degree to which their income s fall below the poverty income standard this impact is not captured by changes in the poverty rate as shown above in figure 8 effect on poverty of counting selected income sources

mothershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30797crs17 19 note that the value of the eitc on the cps is based on census bureau imputations rather than actual reported tax credits also the eitc is different from most sources of income as most families receive the eitc as lump sum refund 20 for discussion of the child tax credit see crs report rs21860 the child tax credit by gregg esenweinfrom about 2 to 3 percentage points over th period compare the reduction in poverty from line 3 to line 4 effect of taxes and tax credits on poverty as noted above the net effect of the eitc19 and the child tax credit20 after counting the effect of reductions in income from federal and state income taxes and fica taxes line 5 when added to total family cash income and food stamps line 4 causes divergence in trend from the lines above this is especially notable after 1993 major expansion of the eitc passed by congress in 1993 and phased in between 1994 and 1996 increased the amount of the ei tc work bonus fa milies might r eceive the anti poverty effectiveness of the eitc was pproximately three times greater in 2006 than in 1993 in 1993 the aftertax poverty rate counting food stamps among single mothers dropped from 427 line 4 to 407 line 5 20 percentage point 47 reduction in 2006 the eitc in comb ination with the child tax credit after counting estimated tax payments re duced poverty from 329 to 279 50 percentage point 152 reduc tion the bulk of this reduction is the result of the eitc as the child tax credit is comparatively small for most families headed by single mothers with adjusted gross incomes near the poverty line as receipt of the eitc is conditioned on earnings the growing impact of the eitc in part reflects the rise in work rates among single mothers among those who are working and poor before counting the ei tc the eitc helps lift the income of some above the poverty line althoug h the eitc expansion provided add itional income to lowincome families who were already working it may also have helped induce increased employment among family heads with low to moderate earnings potential and thus contributed to the d ecline in poverty based on earned income only that has occurred since 1993 shown as the top line in the chart note too that to the extent that change s in cash welfare programs in recent years have encouraged work such as work requirements and increased earnings disregards these changes may have had an indirect effect on poverty by increasing earnings and through earnings making th eitc available to greater number of families effect of unrelated househol d members income on poverty the household lowincome line bottom line shows that if all household members income is counted as though shared qually among household members the poverty rate among single mothers would drop by at most 3 to 4 percentage points over the 1987 to 2006 period using the household as opposed to the family as the economic unit for determining poverty reduces the pos t inkind transfer posttax poverty rate in 1993 from 407 line 5 to 368 line 6 and in 2006 from 279 to 237 again this is most likely an overstatement of the possible effect that sharedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30797crs18 household living arrangements might have on single mothers poverty status because of uncertainty about the extent to wh ich such income is actually shared degree of poverty among poor single mothers as noted above the poverty rate measur only the percent of families whose incomes fall below their respective povert thresholds based on family size and composition although the poverty rate provi des an overall indication of the level of need in the population it does not measure the extent of need among poor families figures 9 and 10 show two different measures of the poverty gap among poor families headed by single mothers that is the degree to which poor families incomes fall below the poverty income level in these figures the poverty gap is depicted as family income as per cent of poverty among poor families figure 9 is based on the cash income poverty measure whereas figure 10 is based on cash income plus the value of food assistance nd taxes including the eitc and the child tax credit note that the families depicted in figure 10 are subset of those included in figure 9 as they are families who rema in poor after considering food stamps and taxes including the eitc nd the child tax credit the effects of which are not counted in figure 9 in each figure the extent of poverty among poor families is depicted at various percentiles based on families ranked by family income as percent of poverty figures 9 and 10 show that the median family income as percent of need ie poverty among poor families s remained relatively steady over the past 18 years based on official cash income for purpos of measuring poverty the median family income as percent of need among poor families headed by single mothers has ranged from low of 48 to high of 53 over the period figure 9 looking at just the subset of singlemother families who were poor based on more comprehensive income definition that incl udes food stamps and taxes including the eitc and child tax credit the median family income as percent of need was somewhat higher over the period ranging from high of 66 of poverty in 1991 to low of 56 of poverty in 2004 figure 10 both figures 9 and 10 show recent declines in income relative to poverty for the poorest families headed by single mothers for example figure 9 shows that for the bottom fifth of poor

welfare work and poverty status over the period cps data generally follow the upsurge in the afdc caseload evidenced by administrativeprogram statis tics that occurred in the te1980s and early 1990s and the historic declines that followed increases in the number of families headed by single mothers during the te1980s and early 1990s are likely to have contributed to the rapid growth in cash welfare casel oads under the afdc program that occurred over the period the number of single mothers increased from about 82 million in 1987 to 99 million in 1993 cash welfare cas eloads peaked in march 1994 and have dropped dramatically since whereas the number of single mothers stayed close to 10 million in most years since 1994 in 2006 the number of single mothers reached 109 million but the number reporting receipt of cash welfare has continued to fall economic conditions certainly contributed to the welfare caseload increase that began in the late 1980s and the historic declines since 1994 number of policy interventions have helped to increase the economic returns to work and to encourage work over welfare increases to the eitc and the minimum wage and erosion of most states welfare benefit levels due to inflation ve helped to increase the economic returns to work compared to welf are in recent years states extension of work requirements to mothers with young er children increased welfare sanction authority and adoption of timelimits on welfare receipt first experimented with under afdc waiver authority and now wide ly adopted by states under tanf have helped to transform the welfare system from an entitlement program to program that emphasizes selfsupport primarily through work and personal responsibility the cps data show that single mothers are considerably more likely to be working and less likely to be poor or receivi ng welfare in most recent than in earlier years figure 2 although many of these changes precede passage of the 1996 welfare law reductions in welfare receipt ve since been especially large since 1996 poor single mothers are more likely to work during the year than to receive welfare figure 7 however reductions in povert among single mothers have not been as large as the concurrent declines in cash welfare receipt and increased work among single mothers in recent years moreover cps data indicate that welfare receipt rates among very poor families based on their pr etransfer income ie income other than welfare have dr opped considerably in recent years figure 5 among singlemother families whose incomes are lowest the bottom 20 of singlemothers based on fa mily income relative to poverty income from earnings has grown markedly since 1993 but has failed to offset losses in cash welfare and food stamp benefits whic h have occurred since figure 10 while single mothers are less dependent on welfare in most recent than in past years increased work has not resulted in marked gains in net income for the bottom fifth of single mothers ranked by family income relative to povert in 2006 average income of these families was well below its 2000 level its most recent hi ghwater mark and only slightly above its 2004 level which marked the lowest vel observed in the 20 years examined the cps data show that although we lfare receipt and poverty among single mothers has declined in recent years mothers receiving welfare are now more likelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30797crs26 to be working and poor mothers are now less likely to be receiving welfare and more likely to be working than in past years prospects of single mothers working their way off welfare and out of poverty hinge in large part on their finding fulltime stable employment at sufficient wage cps data show that most single mothers work fulltime schedules 35 or more hours per week when they work see figure 13 in 2006 among single mothers who combined welfare and work during the year 59 worked fulltime schedules not that much different from workin g poor single mothers who did not receive welfare of whom 61 worked fulltime schedules however mothers who worked and received cash welfare were considerably less likely to have worked fullyear 50 to 52 weeks 30 than their working poor counterparts who did not receive cash welfare 52 source prepared by the congressional research service crs based on analysis of us census
