wisdom as an auditor lecture given on 28 april 1964 thank you that umbrella is the einstein touch i dont have to have the einstein touch you see to cope with scientology research its with melbourne how are you today audience fine whats the date audience april 28th twenty eighth what month audience april what year audience ad 14 all right twenty eight april ad 14 planet audience earth earth earth this lecture is being given on earth all right i want to say couple of words about australia australia is only in one difficulty it has yet to take any instructions or orders concerning its status or activities ive just gone through three days of the rock crusher just trying to get one simple instruction through to australia just that see and i finally landed and got it through and now im was unstabilized the following day i dont know whether it got through or not if i feel little bit abstracted or if i look little bit that way youll know why i dont know i think its been two or three thousand words on the telex have been typed some of it sent some of it not sent you see everything sent to the australian office is picked up by the australian government you see and used at its inquiry now i wanted to gen you in on this inquiry and by the time this information gets around anyplace it will already have happened so its perfectly all right to tell you but when the opposition decides to cut theta line they should be advised that when you try to cut theta line it explodes sooner or later it will explode that you can be absolutely confident of with regard to all such villainous and vicious activities i have seen this happen time and time and time again you always get an explosion on cutting theta line guy is trying to give some truth something like that or it even gets worse than that dont you see youre trying to wish somebody happy birthday or something like that dont you see and somebody villainously stops the card you see now theyve done something there see and the doingness of that type of thing will all of sudden catch up with them in some mysterious and fantastic fashion its very its not really metaphysical you can see why because the only power there is is on theta line all other power is derived from cutting theta lines the secret of power is just that power is truth you can extend untruth in certain direction and derive power from it for certain time but youre only deriving power from the amount of truth in the situation this is why in war government can engage in war and talk to its citizens about how they must engage in war against this other power and that sort of thing but they are at that and you notice every war is followed by usually an overthrow of the government and disillusionment of the people we want to know why well actually there werent that many reasons to go to war and the line they are cutting there is simply the line of friendliness and decency from people to people see so somebody jumps across this line you see and cuts it up and then when the war is all over everybody sits down and says im not mad at the sloveronians why were we fighting the sloveronians you hear this after every war you see you also have an overthrow of the existing regime regime really ever lasts through war and they never notice this it always emerges on the different side of it some other government its the most remarkable phenomenon you ever cared to see its obscured by the fact that the state is still there or somebody may be still king but there will be different government sitting there entirely different what have they done they have cut the natural arc of being to being for their own ends and it blew them up now the violence of the war is temporary action but this other thing carries it on for very very long time thats the long continuing action those are the wounds that have to heal its very interesting now there there it is on just cut arc from people to people b and whatever violence occurred and even though it is very bad and very difficult for while it recoils on the people who cut the line it inevitably recoils i saw one time as simple an action as this manuscript telling how to give 36 hour intensive was carefully put in safe and not issued well it was put in the safe because it was valuable material and everybody all over the place was trying to find out how to do 36 hour intensive this person was going consistently and continually mad trying to cope with the amount of traffic and activity resulting from randomity from everybody trying to do 36 hour intensive without realizing that the manuscript had been carefully parked in his safe because it was so valuable do you understand it was just one two see well now thats very simple simple type of thing but you go into this this is the mechanism which makes people have an almost pathetic belief in retribution they say the villain will get it in the end they dont really know how he gets it or why he gets it but its this mechanism im talking to you about that brings about and fosters that particular belief you cut arc the cutter of the arc will explode sooner or later there is going to be an explosion at that point mechanics electronics and so forth continue on down this line to quite marked degree youve got to cut flow or do something with flow before you get much of an explosion as result of flow see you dont get any commotion with regard to flow unless you interpose something into the flow and thats what you as an auditor have lot of trouble about every once in while youre wondering why youre having trouble with the pc and you never look at the amount of theta line which you cut by chopped acknowledgment not letting him complete his communication see the whole auditing cycle is based on this and then the auditor wonders why hes getting his head blown off and the pc is mad at him and everybody is chopping him up and everybody is down on him and so forth hes the unwitting victim of having accidentally done this through his inexpert timing of his acks and that sort of thing thats the exact mechanism were talking about he has cut the natural cycling arc with the pc inopportunely he hadnt let the pc originate or something of this sort you see hes busted it up one way or the other and he in other words he cut the theta line of the session lets put it that way and sooner or later boom well it oddly enough always explodes on the auditor you want to know why does it always explode on the auditor the pc recovers but youll see the auditor staggering around for while longer one of the reasons is he isnt getting any processing and the other reason is he has unwittingly himself in person cut that line when he has cut the line and then doesnt recognize that he has cut the line now hes really in trouble because he has explanation for whats happening to him hence we get this drill of for heavens sakes listen to your taped session and keep turning that tape back till you find the point where you first cut the line got dirty needle all right lets take the tape back to where the auditor cut the line were not interested in the ramifications of what happened at the point of the explosion its foolish to look at the point of the explosion to find out what happened at the point of the explosion because we know what happened at the point of the explosion the explosion is the result of cut theta line see thats so why do you keep looking at the result and youll find out when you first try to train an auditor to do this you practically will go around the bend yourself in trying to drive it home to the auditor look i want you were not interested in what caused the arc break in terms of you did this or that or something of the sort which then resulted in the arc break and then the auditor goes on at some great length explaining what the arc break happened and the pc said this and the pc said that were not interested in that were interested in the first cut of the theta line which then began to mount up to point where the pc became aware of the fact that it had been cut and it went from there to the explosion and you know real fast hot arc break do you know that it takes up to an hour and half to work one up i mean the comm lag is so great between these two things that the auditor seldom ever recognizes at first glance that he did it to begin with hell turn it back hell turn it back five or six inches to where the pcs rather snarly origin was chopped by the auditor and hell say well thats it i of course perfectly justified in doing so answered the pc rather sharply and abruptly and there we had an arc break so youll get in these reports i answered the pc sharply and abruptly and then minute or so later had dirty needle well thats fine hes now joined kindergarten at this art he is just in kindergarten at this art hes gotten the point now where he can actually recognize that it was snarl back at the pc after the pc snarled at him which caused the meter to snarl at both of them see hes gotten up that high youll have little difficulty getting him up that high but there is an awful lot further to go how did this get into this situation now you keep reeling that tape back few inches at time few inches at time or feet at time and you all of sudden will find back there mistake in an acknowledgment the whole situation is riding on that first little flub the mistake in acknowledgment made the auditor less secure made the pc very much less secure and the line has been cut at that point you see so therefore more little mistakes result in that particular cycle and the pc is more difficult to follow and the auditor makes more mistakes and then it gets down to this point finally where we get the explosion of the cut line well that may not be very violent it may just be dirty needle but as far as the tape is concerned of the session its actually can be as far as one and one half hours actual measurement in an auditing session an auditor can see an arc break coming when he is very sensitive he can see an arc break coming over long period of time now the only thing were trying to make him aware of with the drill the only thing were trying to make him aware of is that it was his flub not taken care of which let this thing keep working up when he does get some awareness that all is not quite well he then doesnt take it up he just hopes it will all go away the black panther mechanism you see he just ignores it and it may go away and he is usually very good at this he is expert at this its marvelous he has greater capacity for ignoring than is easily measurable and its his favorite hope that the black panther will yawn and walk out of the room undetected by anybody and the black panther never does he just he just starts lashing his tail faster and faster and he starts flexing his claws and then he starts snarling and then he starts getting little bit more hate in the eye and then the next thing you know you can get him rocking back on those haunches so forth and the auditor still says now if i just pay attention to it at all the black panther will still go away you see the black panther is now has left the ground and is halfway through the air in the spring and the auditor says now if i just ignore this completely and pretend it isnt happening and so forth all will be well and all of sudden there he is with snarling roaring arc break on his hands pc slams down the cans gets up walks out of the room something or other happens on the thing aw he had he had warning from friend see he had telegrams you see he had wigwag signals he had everything you could think of they were all coming his way and he paid attention to any of them see something is wrong in the session well the only thing that goes wrong in the session is somewhere the theta line has been cut now thats the only thing thats wrong you try to trace this down and get its genus and you will run into all other varieties of bypassed charge now you frankly could take somebody that has been processed or has been treated or has merely lived and simply treat this as front rank auditing problem just treat this as front rank auditing problem when has your arc been cut see now the oddity of it is is you cant keep running this as the only problem now let call to your attention that there are some unworkable processes real unworkable processes and theyll catch up with the auditor sooner or later too one of these processes is look around here and find something you can go out of arc with this is what we call the psychiatric process because its only run on psychiatrists sounds marvelous doesnt it sounds absolutely marvelous doesnt sound like there is thing wrong with that process its the wildest sneaker you ever had anything to do with in your life you might even get some tone arm action with it and your pc will start going down down down down down down because you are cutting his theta line right in the room this is really the only sure absolutely guaranteed silver plated madison avenue advertised method of knocking pc to smithereens look around here and find something you could go out of arc with i dont care how else you phrase it you understand that could be phrased as what one of your friends wouldnt you have to talk to sounds like process doesnt it what wouldnt you have to touch to know what it was you get quite inventive with this type of process what doesnt necessarily have to be real to you see how innocent it sounds it sounds very cultured it sounds as though you really have arrived there with some some greater reality than real see and its completely guaranteed that the pc would be very interested in running it would continue to answer the auditing question and would go right on out the bottom and they get paler and paler and more strained and more strained and more upset and more upset and they will finally explode because you are saying sit in that auditing chair and cut your arc thank you sit in that auditing chair and cut your arc thank you and that is really what the process consists of now ill give you another version of it off into havingness and you can put this down in your book these by the way are gaes gross auditing errors theyre high crimes high crimes everybody should know this weve known it for years if its received as news to you you were deaf someplace or another along the line see because im going over old material but im just showing it to you in new frame of reference now here it fits into the havingness cycle what dont you have to have isnt that marvelous clearing process obviously it educates the person into not having things and after while it gets him conditioned to point where he doesnt have to have bank and he would simply go free from the bank isnt that nice rationale perfect rationale thats psychologist process medical doctors we run what part of the body could you get along without thank you thats just known as an arc reverse process but you understand its expressed in havingness phrase look around here and find something you dont have to have thank you thank you hey hey thank you hey wreee wreee wreee hey answer the auditing question look around here and find something you dont have to hey hey hey hey oh hes conked out well wake him up wake him up all right all right now here is the auditing question look around here and find something you dont have to have thank you look around here and find something you dont have to have hey hes conked out again hey wake him up give hand joe wake him up hell hes dead whats absolutely fantastic in this particular frame of reference is that the pc will run any of those processes industriously and marvelously in fact i knew of somebody was diagnosed as being in compulsive arc with everybody and somebody to cure him of this ran that process on him of what could you go out of arc with and i dont know what happened to the poor bloke but you know i havent seen him since and ive actually put out some little lines at one time or another trying to get in touch with him trying to find out what happened in this everybody is covering it up like the rue morgue murders see i dont know what happened i mean i know hes not in scientology anymore but i dont know anything more than that i just caught it too late dont you see to do something drastic about it you know it oh nothing physically happened to him he just sort of drifted off one way or the other i suppose i suppose hes still around but who knows you see how peculiar this is now he would never in gods green earth have attributed any difficulty he was having to having been run on that process to which he consented with the greatest of glee he was simply told that he was in compulsive arc with people and this would have to be cured so that he could audit better the only difference between this process and russian roulette is russian roulette has five empty chambers and this doesnt have any now this is all on the basis of cutting arc and this is quite quite quite big rationale its big package all by itself affinity reality and communication cut thereof every time you cut it expect an explosion maybe youll be able to handle the explosion maybe it wont be of long duration and so forth but every time you cut it expect an explosion see dont go walking like an innocent babe you see straight into the black panthers cage and saying theres panther here because im telling you there is panther there see and he is quite visible now the way the psychologist particularly the child psychologist who has lot to recommend him since he has to get in there and pitch in numerous ways and so forth they have them in schools trying to advise people and so forth the way he gets into trouble left right and center is he doesnt know this datum and not knowing this datum therefore he cannot predict child future behavior theres another datum he doesnt know thetan never gives up he doesnt know that datum thats very terrible datum to know it cures many impulses toward tyranny if jokers like caligula knew the data knew that datum before they started to caligulize things i think they wouldnt have the temerity to go on caligulizing see because thetan really never gives up this also this also is is some bloke like the cardinal of spewjaw or something see hes all of sudden decided to cure everybody of sex see he is going to cure everybody in his diocese of sex small project he may go down in history but i can guarantee you he will certainly he will certainly get buried somewhere the thetan never gives up on an arc line or in any other direction we got bunch of wild eyed revolutionaries bunch of wild eyed revolutionaries let give you let give you right and wrong on handling wild eyed revolutionary reform him by giving him good talking to hm mm mm do oo oh shoot several of his companions ho oh sooner or later youre going to have revolution sooner or later you know he just never really gives up now thats the wrong way to handle revolutionary is to revolutionize him that would also apply to conquered people conquered people really never gives up that impulse may go on and on it may sail along for ages they really never give up as long as there is any there at all it gets more and more subconscious or more and more unconscious or whatever else you want to phrase it as but its still there now here is the other way take revolutionary take revolutionary and the very least or the very most you can do is to simply directionalize to some slight veering his revolution you maybe can slightly alter the direction of his revolutionary tendency see you could maybe persuade him not to revolt against the king but to revolt against the prime minister see change his vector little bit see you could say well dont revolt against the why revolt against the state because you cant win theyve all got machine guns very much better activity at the present moment is revolt against its educational system and eventually overthrow it thereby oh yeah hed say yeah all right all right thats okay see hed go on in that particular direction but understand he really has never given up revolting against the state in other words you could veer to some slight degree the direction of purpose of an individual but he really never gives up and what fools everybody is he says he gives up he goes through all kinds of mumbo jumbo and prestidigitation to prove conclusively hes given it all up see you just never saw so much window dressing sometimes you see in conquered nation and so forth flags lining the street in all directions you know and everybodys standing out there saying viva castro or something like that see and then they dont turn out any more bacardi rum see and then somehow or another the fires in the cane fields they just dont seem to abate they seem to get more frequent and production doesnt turn over and machinery keeps getting jammed somewhere and theres and castros going absolutely stark staring batty why cant this economy work why are all the trucks in cuba broken down suddenly and simultaneously ill solve this by buying hundreds of new trucks from england why they are going to run just long enough to let somebody turn out to pull off the distributor cap because you see the cuban didnt revolt to be communist see he revolted against batista and castro tried to change his vector of revolt too far too fast and that was the end of that they became subjugated people suddenly after their revolution dont you see so now hes wondering why hes having trouble well rename him rocks in the head castro see he cant have anything else but trouble now hell go on having trouble to the end of his days he would have to take every person in cuba every single person in cuba and ship them complete to venezuela and repeople cuba hundred percent with something else to win his revolution because he didnt have revolution there was revolution of the cuban people and then castro gave them another revolution you remember it wasnt for months that they found out they had been communist revolution and everything just quit and that was the end of that production now everybody comes along and he says what is the political significance of this lets see what is the political significance of this i can see toynbee now the great masterpiece of shallow thought that he would turn out on this would be marvelous lets see what what could possibly be the significance of this is it true that communism turns out less production than capitalism are are the comparative factors between this and the spartan regime which didnt exist on the left hand side of the bistro you see figure figure figure figure figure figure figure and the cuban people have willingness to go in the direction they are now going so they will go in that direction not and the way they dont go in that direction is take everything down in front of them and dont produce you see nation which cant produce you know that it is unwilling to do what it is doing thats the first thing you know about it its unwilling to support what its having to support the arc will be very poor now it doesnt matter how much communication is put into them and castro as an example puts in plenty i understand his television broadcast lasts several hours per day this is all very very fascinating but the communication may be there but of course reality isnt there at all and affinity doesnt exist this is from his particular side because man could have much affinity for people if he gives them another revolution after theyve won different one the arc is all missing from the other side and remember that arc has two sides there is the arc from b to and theres the arc from to b so you could put in tremendous amount of c without very much and practically r and if you did manage to generate anything on the other side it would be some pale shadow of the same thing the other side would also probably develop lot of c or lot of c or something like this but they certainly wouldnt develop any r and they certainly wouldnt develop any now if anybody stood up there in castros boots who really was putting r and c to those people then he would have an opportunity of seeing these people express r and c to some degree or another but hed have to stand up there without any past connotations dont you see he wouldnt have to be dug in in his own past and background in order to do this actually it doesnt mean that fellow could have past in order to do this the fellow anybody i suppose if he just suddenly went honest you know just that just come down with an outbreak of honesty you know break out all over with it if it were real honesty would probably get response from the other particular side because the target which is presenting r and c to that degree would have diminished see although theyd never given up against this other target they dont have anything against this target they now have you see so there is arc possible with that target honesty honesty frankly you can make tremendous number of mistakes but never be dishonest about your mistakes that is the big thing to know dont be dishonest about your mistakes you become unreal to the degree that youre dishonest about them and dont go over into the field of self immolation either theres ways to commit suicide with this sort of thing you see but thats also distortion of r and c because you are cutting out your own life in order to glorify your own mistakes i dont know if you ever read any russian literature its really not worth reading but dostoevski the brothers karamazov and so forth each one of dostoevskis works has some character who is busy selling himself down the river with great violence you know hes explaining to everybody what dog he is you see and so on he goes on and on he really is dog too anybody trying to rule russia would have my sympathy but not knowing much about the country im great expert on it almost as great an expert on russia as boston is on slavery theyve never had to cope with it so therefore they know everything there is to know about it there is nothing like complete inexperience to bring about enormous bravery now the north which was very authoritative on its various racial problems not having had any experience with them is getting them all in the teeth and its the people of the north have all of sudden have started voting madly for these mad dog anti ra you know these racist conscious candidates and so forth everybody is scared stiff because some place i think like wisconsin turned out third of its vote the other day as representing preference for racially prejudiced candidates this is just recoil see r so their r and c was very lousy they had r on the situation so they had very distorted arc and it all blew up in flinders the second they started to get some experience so they go to the other side of the thing see now they cut any potential arc they might have with the whole situation and from give them all cake they immediately jump over shoot them all down like dogs you see neither one of these things were real there was reality in either one of them see there wasnt any particular reason to give them all cake and theres certainly reason now to shoot them all down like dogs you see heres the two sides of the coin neither one of them had anything to do with theta what were they talking about well they didnt know then they dont know now now there is nothing like complete complete and utter inexperience to bring about great deal of bravery also brings about many wonderful opinions marvelous opinions theres many professor who has spent his life in beautiful seclusion who is the most wonderful expert on things he knows nothing about and has never met its like the scholastics they believed in this their whole method of education was based upon the principles here you never inspected anything you just lectured about it see you never go out an at sturgeon to find out what sturgeons look like you just go ahead and give lectures on sturgeons which are based on i think in their particular case aristotles opinion of sturgeon which i think was out of different ocean and was inaccurate to begin with and if anybody had tried to bring in real sturgeon to show them what it was the person would have been instantly and immediately flunked hands down that would have been the end of that that was the system called scholasticism an actual system on which we get scholastic average and other things but the scholastics lasted for about 1500 years and they were the total dominant philosophy of education and they lasted all the way across the dark ages and when they finally packed up and people began to look again we ceased to have dark ages i dont care if somebody like toynbee attributes the dark ages to the left hand square root of the ruddy rod or why the virgins were longer in church and that ended the dark ages that has nothing to do with it its the fact their system of education absolutely debarred and their religious beliefs absolutely debarred the inspection of anything that they were supposed to know about it was system of education based entirely upon noninspection it wasnt that they neglected noninspection it was that they insisted upon it and we had the dark ages well we had educated people i imagine if you had nobody educated youd have dark age its quite elementary if you kept every child in school so that he couldnt learn anything about the universe around him for the period that he was curious and then you turned him loose thereafter to run the affairs of man i imagine it would be very dark indeed and the scholastic was champion at this he became expert at this in other words he was cutting the arc of knowledge you are all supposed to know about rocks dont go look at any rocks this was how he cut the arc line if i were educating you as auditors all right now this is the way you behave as auditors this is what you do as auditors and dont let ever under any circumstances ever let hear you talking to preclear that would sound pretty wild wouldnt it that would sound pretty unreal you immediately up to your mind comes this question well if were never supposed to talk to pc if were never supposed to hear pc if were never supposed to have any touch with pc were never supposed to audit pc then how the hell would we ever learn to become auditors see that immediately enters up but remember you are already talking in zone of informed wisdom supposing you didnt know enough to ask that question youd have picture of dark age wouldnt you see dark age would be composed of people who didnt know enough to ask the question of why is our arc being cut they wouldnt know their arc is being cut so part of the very very intellectual individual part of the very wise person is recognition of this principle of when and where is his arc cut and he is wise to the degree that he can perceive this in existing situations and this would be not necessarily his wisdom but his ability to exercise wisdom ill give you an example youre an auditor class v auditor you know your business you go into factory theyre having lot of trouble they want you to audit staff something like this you know you want patch up somebody you say whats the matter what brings you to the conclusion that your staff or your managers or anybody else needs auditing what brings you to that conclusion see if you were very very smart auditor youd want to look over whats the condition of the pc whats expected here obviously youre not being asked to audit any pcs at their own volition youre being asked to audit some pcs at management volition well youd either have to talk the pcs into being audited of their own volition which is quite possible very easy to do as long as you are good and factual about it and dont use any of the management arguments which are not factual they inevitably would not be factual you see because theyre not auditors and youre talking to these people about auditing your ability to estimate the existing situation wouldnt necessarily measure how successful you were but would certainly measure how wise you were and how would you how would you exercise this as wisdom how would you be wise in relationship to one of this well you just look at the number of arc busts there were on both sides of what fences existed now you may have preconceived the idea of thinking there was management and labor and immediately believed that you had problem in management and labor because you read it in some textbook see and you might not have problem of management and labor at all you might have problem of management and management i know of hotel in the immediate vicinity which suffers from four problems of management versus management versus management versus management see thats their problem they dont have any trouble with their help they really dont its marvel that anybody works for them at all their help goes on and works but every once in while its upper strata of management gets interfered with the head of this department or that department gets shifted moved or sacked see so its only problem of management within management well your recognition of the thing must be just based on looking it over carefully of what what r and what c is being cut between what terminals thatd be the whole formula on which you could have to adjudicate that situation in that factory what what r what c not just what arc is being cut thats too careless see what what r and what c is being cut amongst what terminals you might find out the arc was being cut between the shop stewards and the mechanics now to locate that all youd have to locate is maximal confusion and minimal production just look over all the records and find where was the maximal number of despatches maximal confusion and the minimal production from expected production this department has two thirds of the plant employees and turns out one sixth of what theyre expected to id think about that time you would decide that there was something wrong with it now all you have to find out is where is the cut r and the cut c in that vicinity now there must be two terminals there otherwise there is flow of r and c to cut so one must be trying to flow arc and the other must be trying to cut it or this one is trying to flow arc and the other one is trying to cut it or to some degree they are both trying to flow r and c and they are both thoroughly cutting it so one of those conditions will exist and if you are being very wise you would simply look that over as the condition of affairs and you would say these people are unhappy with those people and you dont even have to do it on formula i tell you thats the only thing there you dont have to look for something else there but you just look for that thing and you find it and then you say all right im going to group process the shop stewards in the presence of the foremen and then we will process foremen against shop stewards and we will get this thing in other words all you do is start unblocking the arc you wouldnt even have to handle case just take the existing situation of the real universe just accept the fact theyre all nuts anyway dont bother about it in any other particular direction this is it now if you know this other thing do you know that all pt problems are suspended in nondelivered communications i suppose guy is trapped where he is today because one day he started to talk to god and it didnt get there you know or something of this sort something wild of this nature occurred now let warn you that if you tried to run this as process look where youd get what communication has been undelivered thank you what communication has been undelivered thank you the thing is selfdiscrediting because it wont run as the process in other words the way he came down the line it doesnt go back out the same way these are simply the problems the guy has had along the line how he has solved those problems is the clue see even though the genus of the problem was an undelivered communication he then made it real rough by solving it in some way see he didnt give up were now talking about r1c r1cm see were talking about very elementary processes this fellow comes in oh my god i have this terrible problem i i dont know whether im coming or going im love love awful problem and hes holding his head in his hands you know and rolling from side to side hes so worried hes almost out of his mind histrionic has fantastic numbers of ramifications obviously his whole case is sitting behind the thing and charging it up obviously youre dealing with tremendous instability to begin with obviously obviously this obviously that you got factors factors factors factors factors factors here you could add them up on ibm comptometers but you know one thing for sure about that condition that it exists here and now see this guy is in this condition here and now this you know yeah thats rather obvious because there he is rolling around and screaming and yowling so hes obviously in that condition now lets start with certainties lets get our own arc in with it see so whats the reality of the situation it exists whats the c of the situation well that you can talk at him but he doesnt hear you and whats the of the situation why youd like to give the guy hand complicated isnt it thats your arc with relationship to him if your arc includes ive got to solve this fellows problems for him ive got to give him solutions to all of his problems of course youre not establishing arc with him or getting his arc disentangled see youre winding him up in the soup therefore this thing called marital counseling will always wind up in the scrap bucket you could just about counsel two characters on the marital front into amity as you could tie two cats over clothesline by their tails and expect to kiss each other they just wont wont do it you could just stand there and keep saying now now puss you should kiss tom there and make up and theres obviously something hurting them even fool would stand back after while and say theres apparently something here i have not quite embraced in my analysis of the situation theres all of the factors that are right there now lets look at the fellow now now whats his r and c with his environment see well c he isnt talking to anybody if you ever notice fellow in that condition he is not talking to anybody hes talking at everything he really doesnt expect that anybody is even listening to him hes just going on you know and his r youll find out he contradicts himself every three minutes you dont quite know what he is talking about because the target of his conversation is so consistently shifting the subject of his conversation is so shifting so consistently and his words are i dont know and i cant find out and i havent you know been this its all full of doubt you see there isnt any solidity there anyplace so his r his r is obviously shot see he just hasnt any reality on anything he hasnt any grip on anything and his well he doesnt know whether he hates everybody or they hate him its kind of tossup hes worried because everybody might or somebody might hate him and hes worried that he might unjustly hate somebody else you see hes in confusion he wouldnt know what his affinity was his r and c are right down there running on the bottom is there any particular button out of theta line that you could trip that would cause this odd jam to unravel is there anything you could trip remember itd be terribly unlimited process pardon terribly limited process unlimited process in connection with this this is real limited but there is something you could say to him just the one shot situation what communication havent you been able to deliver let him tell you all about it and he to that degree is somewhat delivering it and you will see his whole condition alter interesting isnt it if you could get the insane to answer as much of question as that theyd probably unravel same way its not its not you understand repetitive process and it has nothing that refers to the past its the right now communication you havent been able to deliver because maybe this was past question and all that sort of thing but its still the communication he hasnt been able to deliver right now and hes trying so hard right now to deliver this communication that hes got himself completely snarled up on the r and the i imagine people used to get that way in prayers as matter of fact thats why i think certain organizations theres point in going on discussioning their depravities but id think there would be some organization or another that was id think theyd sit down calculatingly to spin people in by giving them something they couldnt pray to id say that in some villainous past uninformed period some barbarous age that people would even invent something like well theres being thats everywhere all the time and youre supposed to say your prayers theyd call you know invent some word like prayer and say youre supposed to talk to this being all the time and give him the hot dope id say in some dark age not on this planet but someplace theyd dream up some mechanism just spin people in because sooner or later somebody out of that lineup is going to say i am not being listened to my communication has not been delivered for instance im always hauling sideways the same operation as applied to santa claus santa claus is mythical being invented by madison avenue of yesteryear in order to sell merchandise and this bird gets written to and oddly enough mainly gets replied you know replies come from him one way or the other thats why you have department stores to reply see but i always make sure that the communication always goes through reliable channels like hco see and acknowledgment comes back down the line solid see and i find out that this brings great deal of cheerfulness about it all but i also find out by inspection that the ragamuffin doll that was scribbled ver vuh um umdmn on the list and that nobody could read and that didnt get delivered is all that gets talked about christmas day so you see this thing has many sides but its all on the subject of just r and c in its interchange and delivery and cutting the theta line and thats all there is to it that is what it is and you now start to walk away on thin ice from this very secure little footbridge and youre liable to go through now let give you an idea see let give you an idea i know this will come as shock to some of you that you shouldnt do this but your pc your pc is talking to you about bananas see the pc is talking to you about bananas and were getting along just fine with the pc talking about bananas but the pc accidentally in passing mentions watermelons and we instantly ask him to talk about watermelons he mentioned them we ask him to talk about them and then when he is busy talking about watermelons he happens to mention greengrocers and the moment he mentions greengrocers we then ask him to talk about greengrocers now i know nobody present would do anything like that we call it q and you may have heard of it well what exactly are you doing in relationship to r and c theres much easier explanation of what q and is q and is just not completing cycle of action thats all you can q and on pc over 500 hours of processing you just dont complete the cycle of action laid out to be completed in the 500 hours of processing you have qed and aed you dont even have to be the pcs auditor to q and on pc you can be the auditing director and mark the folder some other way shift off of this process which you started on last month and this program not even process see but shift off of this program which you started the pc on last month now and go on some other program even though hes still getting tone arm action on the program not process but program which we laid out last month because theres something more recent q and thats all thats just an interrupted auditing cycle an interrupted process cycle or an interrupted program cycle any one of those things is just an incomplete cycle of action and if you dont complete cycle of action in any category you know the little auditing comm cycle or on up the line to the session on up the line to the process on up the line to the program you fail to complete any of those youve just qedandaed but whats wrong with it why why is this so important when this fellow was talking to you about bananas you see trouble is once in blue moon you get away with it he just accidentally was finished talking about bananas when you asked him about watermelons so you thought that was all right because it was all right that time but let tell you that its only one about one chance in hundred of it being all right you sometimes get away with it you see which rather tends to trip you up so he was finished talking about bananas but supposing he hadnt really told you what he wanted to tell you about bananas you cut the theta line right there in the session now supposing he was just getting good on the subject of watermelons he was just getting good on this particular subject and he really realized that he had something to communicate on that subject and you qedandaed and transferred him off to greengrocers oh youd have by this time two not lets put it banally and technically wed have two unfinished communication cycles which doesnt sound like very much but back of that youve got something far worse you had an undelivered complete communication you have an undelivered serieses of communications in other words youve cut this fellows theta line from that point on its inevitable that you sooner or later will blow up as his auditor its just its just fate fate has intervened at this point kismet you just got out your knife and started working on the tightrope you were walking right in the middle of the chasm now you wonder why you have trouble with pcs you wonder why pcs needle roughs up you wonder why some auditors rough up pcs needles you wonder why you see some pcs arc break you wonder this and you wonder that you wouldnt wonder very long if you got ahold of tape of that session you wouldnt wonder very long youd cut it into the first third of the session something like that and youd say well well pick up something here and you hear this little note of asperity you see in the pcs voice hes he sounds little strained hes still enthusiastic but its sort of an enthusiastic strain theres note there that you dont quite like lets go back just little bit further than this and we find the auditor is okay yes you know i got that you know and letting the pc go on and on and then making very sure that the communication was acknowl well what the hell is making this auditor act that way we dont take it that he just doesnt know his drills see i have two different frames of reference by which to look at an auditors auditing one is teaching him how to do it and whether he is doing it the way he should be doing it see thats one frame of reference and the other frame of reference is what did he do that is making him do it wrong see thats the other frame of reference how is he behaving in this session and under that heading i always assume that he knows perfectly how to do it but that something is just disturbing him something has gone awry i assume that he knows all his drills see theres something haywire here that we are looking at that is making him go adrift i dont immediately then go into the subject of dressing him up on the subject of drills i start looking for something that is gone adrift in his auditing id simply see so youd have to have two frames of reference one is the frame of reference of critique of his ability to handle preclears and the other is critique of his ability to handle drills see there would be two different points of view and you cant mix up these two points of view and train an auditor or youre sunk otherwise every time the auditor mishandles pc you put the auditor back on doing drill you should be teaching him about pcs and you are teaching him about the drill hell he knows how to do the drill well why isnt he doing it see thats this other frame of reference well he isnt doing it like hes mucked up somewhere or another here on what handling pc thats where hes fouled up he isnt fouled up on being able to say good thank you and okay see that isnt where hes monkeyed up hes monkeyed up on handling that thing sitting in the chair across from him that he knows not wot of somehow and you hear him good than thank you thank thank you i i got i i got the communica i i heard you i i i heard heard you what you said now do you do you know that ive acknowledged you and you say what the hell is going on here well it isnt that this fellows drills are out its his pc handling is out here somehow or another he doesnt understand something that is going on here all right so you roll back the tape few more feet see lets find this thing see how come hes how come hes doing such lousy job of auditing is what we are asking see how come its all getting so difficult how come its an unaudited auditable pc in an unauditing situation see so we get this tape back here and we all of sudden we hear it we hear it well yes i know we heard all about your mother in the last session and so forth and we are not going to take that up now what were going to go on into now is your family in general and so forth my god it lay right in the r factor what corny r factor the auditor took off from this point of view with an incomplete cycle of action on the subject that he was addressing in the last session the pcs been thinking about it all night instantly and immediately the pc starts the session with present time problem because of the r factor see an incomplete cycle of action an incomplete communication definition of present time problem an undelivered communication see if you really want to handle present time problems dont ever define them any other way i dont care how gross or how crude or how stupid all this sounds on the subject or how it doesnt quite seem to apply you just keep looking at it and you will find stupid as it is well for instance we find out this fellow feels very batty and we trace back to where he feels very batty and he didnt shoot sniper in world war ii see undelivered communication well what the hell do you youll say thats funny communication bullet ah but it follows the communication formula it goes from here as cause across distance and arrives at an effect do you see now if we want to understand what an overt act is we go around to the other side of the coin and we find out it was communication he didnt want to deliver he delivered see and thats what an overt act is and what saves your bacon in auditing is the fact that the overt act is worse than the undelivered communication in terms of aberrative value because you have now perverted the arc theta line you see youve perverted the theta line by causing it to carry harm now that really mucks up theta line just not delivering at all is infinitely better than delivering harmfully i dont care what gpms say or anything else see youre too prone perhaps on occasion to say well we are all aberrated because of certain basic deep seated woof woofs and so forth its quite interesting that the deeper and further research has gone it isnt that i have found we are less and less governed by these predetermined impulses i have gone through phases of blaming parts of scientology on various parts of the mind i inevitably will come up on the other side of the stream dripping wet but with considerable relief looking at it and recognizing that we were still above in our basic understandings the aberrative influences by which the mind has previously been understood so we are really above in our technology what life has been up to in digging itself in dont you see our understanding is superior to the aberrative impulses let give you the idea very short faster idea for instance freud continuously stressed sex see and later on his apologists said that if he had just talked about social implications as well as sexual implications his work would have been more successful freuds work ceased to work when he got they got off the subject of sex the big libido theory of 1894 was his top top climb that was his summit and anything else went down from there that was as close as he got to the moon and when he started walking away from that or his apologists started walking away from that he got into trouble and he ceased to cure people why he was as close as he could get to the gpm create series see he just walked in close on that perimeter had big cognition laid it down as what he called his libido theory and then any time he tried to minimize this or walk away from it he was denying and invalidating gpms and so therefore it wasnt true that freud should have mentioned social implications hell freud should have kept right on pounding down the line of sex you see with capital freud see he should have hit it all the way see because he was right in there see he really did have his paws on something all right now he was below he was below the point of mental dramatization in other words he was interpreting the mind through dramatization of mind in other words he was dramatizing bit when he was doing this see all right to that degree we have not been guilty of this particular line and our materials the further we go on this start to stand clear and pure as total command of understanding of livingness life and so forth than before do you see i mean they separate out rather easily i go through some bad periods once in while on this i think oo oh you know oh you know not too long ago i looked with sudden horror oh actually about year ago i looked with sudden horror at the idea that the whole tone scale was simply based on something out of series of implants see uhhgh and i thought oh oh oh oh oh oh and then it turned out they werent there and so more recently i said well obviously the tone scale all came out of gpms obviously obviously heh its not there and my pc read great deal of significance into gpms to point where we developed full process one time to run gpms it had nothing but in scientology injected into the gpms we had to turn around and inject it in other words we knew more about the mind than was in the mind dont you see so we could it was r1c r1c for while i thought we couldnt run r1c because i thought it was my solution we understood more about life do you see than was understood by the thetan himself because he was not down the line on solution or anything like that see we understood that solution was an aberrative factor solution is real aberrative factor the gpm only brings about it doesnt solve you get what i mean so once in while you can get real hot and one of the difficulties we have is we understand the situation were looking at too well we understand it with such great pervasive thoroughness that we inject an awful lot of data into it that isnt there in other words its just total screwball the situation its like this now we could go on and on and say the present time problem is present time problem because its postulate versus postulate and so forth oh yes thats basically true of problems thats the anatomy of problem oh yes thats why gpms hang up oh yes all these things are very very true but lets draw back to the level of arc now thats not mild understanding for instance im talking to you today at arc at the level of 4 im not talking to you about arc at the level of 1c now i tell you all these things are true completely true about postulate versus postulate and its mass versus mass and it takes an impulse versus an impulse to make problem and because its this and its because its that and because there are disagreements involved and all of this and that and so forth all these things are true you understand but lets go right on upstairs in complete purity of understanding philosophically what is this thing problem this thing is problem because its an undelivered communication now you have to be pretty smart cookie to take case apart knowing that and knowing at the same thing that its an unrunnable process its an undelivered communication thats made it problem an overt act is not problem an overt act is withdrawal from putting out an arc line because you know you will abuse it its self discipline its an abuse of arc so one doesnt arc because one possibly might abuse arc so then one doesnt arc you see self discipline here is involved an individual is putting an awful check and brace on himself and this is the basic withhold dont shoot anybody see dont cause harm dont harm i dont care what kind of gpms are developed by the thetan coming down the line they probably louse him up end you could probably get an awful lot of mileage out of doing these things sideways but when the chips are all down and youve got them all processed out youll find the answer is still there the same way you understand this is this is the way the critter operates see he doesnt want to undertake this particular communication because it is harmful so therefore he withholds that particular communication all right theres that source then of not communicating theres that reason for not communicating which is looks little more involved than the other reason because it includes the overt withhold sequence but there is this other simple one which of course you understand now is the same statement as the other one the other was more complex statement its an undelivered communication even ow is an undelivered communication hes delivered one far too well pow oh well he better not deliver any more communications along this line and he better not have delivered that one so hell develop whole section of his bank out of communications he had better not deliver so he is not delivering the communications he did deliver what communication did you deliver that you hadnt ought to have would be guaranteed to set off an automaticity so you look at somebody whos having hard time with life and hes got lot of present time problems and he comes in and he says i got this present time problem tawowowow i tawowow oh what am i going to do and so forth and so on you know one thing that hes having an awful time and the other thing you know is for whatever reason because hes breaking himself because he might communicate dont you see and therefore is withholding because it will these are all just rationales you know two things one hes in that state and you know hes in that state because he hasnt delivered communication so you know those two things about this individual at once bang bang simple as that take off from there remembering at the same time that there is repetitive process what havent you communicated to there is process what dont you have to have there is process what could you get rid of these are all what could you go out of arc with you see brutal processes that go right straight downhill there is only process along the line of what have you communicated with see and so forth now you get your arc break process that mainly depends on regretted communication see youre running in some other factors and out of this understanding you could tailor make lot of processes that would go into lot of various lines just look at it at offhand what had you ought to have communicated that you didnt have see all right now what had you ought to communicated that you didnt have all right that is what did you go out of communication with all right you are going to run that process you say its absolutely necessary to get rid of this well how are you going to get away with running that process that process is unrunnable oh ho ho you will have to answer it up immediately with what did you go into communication with now youve got half cursed half blessed process you can probably get away with it you could say look around here and find something you dont have to have now look around here and find something you have see now youve half cursed it and half blessed it so you you understand this isnt ideal but this is run sufficiently workable process so that you can run an unworkable process so that you can simply get rid of the points he is hung up on in order to run better process do you understand that so you could go as far as that down into the shades of hell for the pc and you would after little while by the way you shouldnt be too puzzled why this process doesnt run marvelously why it doesnt run endlessly why the pc occasionally has headaches these things should be quite understood by you youre simply getting some problems out of the road that so that you can run the case so you wouldnt go on very long along this direction before you shifted over into well what communication did you deliver you could run that kind of process what communication did you deliver well now he doesnt understand that communication to him appears to be rather high order of thing and that he delivered it means that he was all right and so forth so you say what overt act did you commit and you run the same one what communication did you communicate that you didnt think you what ought to have communicated in other words what communication what delivered communication is regretted what are you trying now at this moment not to have delivered that you did do you see these ramifications work these things out and youve got it made the only difficulties that are going to happen anyplace in this universe the only difficulties that have happened in this universe and the only difficulties that would occur even if it werent here are simply based on this same information i am giving you whether or not there are gpms whether or not there are not gpms whether there is universe whether there is universe you still have this same potential of difficulty you see somebody in difficulty it would be this same reason see what communication arent you delivering because you have delivered so many lousy communications do you see unrunnable process but complete understanding of the situation now what have you got to do well youve got to do what youve got to do in order to get him to communicate where he should be communicating and that may be have to be approached through the r and that may be have to be approached through the as well as and you may have to work it around in some way but youre trying to multiply his ability to communicate and get the barriers of noncommunication out of the way and if you did that why youd have it made and everything would be all right and okay what i have been talking to you about is wisdom as an auditor and dont ever really think you could degenerate hundred percent to wound up doll and get result you have to know something of what you are doing and the pc across from you you have to be at least aware of the fact that he does live and that he follows the laws of life and he isnt different just because hes acting different there must be some thing that you are doing to make him act different perhaps those are hard lines but thats nevertheless an understanding an auditor should have thank you very much
