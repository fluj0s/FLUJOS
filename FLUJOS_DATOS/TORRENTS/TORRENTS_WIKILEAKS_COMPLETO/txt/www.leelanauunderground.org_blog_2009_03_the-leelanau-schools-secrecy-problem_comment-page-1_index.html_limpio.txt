inezha leelanau talk blog the leelanau schools secrecy problem march 20th 2009 tags leave comment trackback for those who may not be aware this week is sunshine week national week celebrated by journalists and public interest groups to focus attention on sunshine laws the laws that allow the public to access records held by their government newspapers and groups across the country do variety of things like file freedom of information act requests and lawsuits against government agencies that dont allow the light of public scrutiny some newspapers black out parts of their publications that couldnt exist without public records and some write articles about government agencies that arent letting the public see whats going on i couldnt think of better way to celebrate sunshine week than to shine some light on one of the most secretive nonprofits ive ever encountered the leelanau school whether its hiding records harassing students threatening journalists or outright censoring information the leelanau school has truly done it all the first batch of documents is from various michigan state agencies they detail the schools registered agents and the schools articles of incorporation and modifications among other things over the past few years number of students and faculty have been upset to see the library turn into the lrc multiple bookshelves have been dismantled and hundreds of books have been thrown away i know this because i was an lrc aid and i helped them do it what most people dont know and what i didnt know until recently is that leelanaus board actually formed separate foundation specifically to fund the school library for the use by the school community and the public at large its articles of incorporation and information about it are included in this first set of documents the second release we have is copy of every leenews announcement from 2007 these announcements from school administrators detail activities that occur on campus and often the administrations views on them on occasion the school makes statements or commitments in these announcements that it doesnt keep the standard way to see these announcements is via teacherease but this isnt very accessible for one thing you cant search through previous announcements instead you would have to manually click on each one and read through it additionally the school is free to change any of the announcements they have put online this makes it easy for the school to doubleback on previous commitments these announcements also contain the names of students as well as other information about them for this reason we have told google and other search engines to not to index the leenews archive we also have number of announcements from 2008 the third release we have is information about lawsuit filed against the leelanau school for 3575000 from 1992 this case was settled out of court and we couldnt find any references to it anywhere on the internet the school doesnt want this information to be released because its stain on their record they did something that made somebody upset enough to sue the school and that doesnt look good to prospective parents these files only say which papers were filed not their contents if somebody wants to get on pacer and download them that would be great docket report docket summary the fourth release we have is leelanaus irs 990 tax returns for 1999 2000 and 2001 for over decade the leelanau school has attempted to conceal their financial situation from donors parents students and the public by filing their tax forms late using extensions other nonprofits dont do this unless theres something catastrophic that requires them to such as fire in the records room we now have enough tax returns to generate statistically sound conclusions about the schools financial situation and the damage caused by exheadmaster richard odell the school is still millions of dollars in debt according to the most recent tax return we have these returns also often list contact information for donors and the names of financial aid recipients if these donors knew what leelanau was hiding do you think they would keep donating what if they went on donation strike would leelanau change their policies if prospective parents knew the school couldnt pay the bills would they still send their kids there if students knew that their diploma might only be worth the paper its printed on in few years due to the school going bankrupt would they attend the pdf files have the images in them compressed to make them smaller if you are interested in the original scans please contact us and we will be happy to provide them to you were releasing this information for lot of reasons some of them are retaliatory were retaliating against the schools secrecy were retaliating against students who have gotten in trouble for having books or magazines the school didnt approve of were retaliating for the web filter were retaliating for the threats made against student journalists were retaliating against the backroom blackmailing that the school has engaged in to silence its critics were also releasing this information for something better hope that one day there will be nothing to retaliate against that students faculty and parents will be able to participate in school governance that donors will be able to make educated decisions and that leelanau community members will be able to speak freely about the school without having to fear losing their jobs or their diploma that people wont be threatened when they speak their mind we cant do this without you and we cant publish without your support we cant talk about what goes on if nobody tells us and we cant publish documents unless you help us get our hands on them we cant blow the whistle when the school crosses the line if you dont tell us about it the press wont talk to us if nobody is interested in what were doing if you are angered by what you read about here take that anger and put it into something productive something insurrectionary something subversive something controversial something fun something liberating or something progressive take it where you want and dont let anybody stop you at the end of the day only you are fit to judge what you do and if you do nothing the outcome is predictable these documents dont mean anything if nobody does anything with them take this information put it out there and put it into practice get involved with the school community and engage yourself adb most commented
