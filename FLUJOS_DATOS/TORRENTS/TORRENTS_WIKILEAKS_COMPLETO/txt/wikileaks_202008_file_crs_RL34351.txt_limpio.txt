agricultural policy resources science and industry division brazils and canadas wto cases against us agricultural support summary on december 17 2007 the world trade organizations wtos dispute settlement body dsb established single panel to consider charges against us farm programs brought in two separate but similar cases ds357 brought by canada and ds365 brought by brazil both cases make two charges against us farm programs first that the united states has exceeded its annual wto commitment levels for total aggregate measurement of support ams for agriculture in each of the years 1999 2000 2001 2002 2004 and 2005 and second that the us export credit guarantee program for agricultural commodities operates as wtoillegal export subsidy both charges stem in large part from previous negative ruling against us farm programs in case ds267 brought by brazil against the us cotton program in that case wto panel ruled the ruling subsequently was upheld by wto appellate body first that direct payments made under us farm programs do not qualify for green box exemption status because of restriction prohibiting the planting of fruits vegetables or wild rice on payment acres and second that the us export credit guarantee program operates as prohibited export subsidy program because the financial benefits returned by these programs failed to cover their long run operating costs as result export credit guarantees are subject to previously scheduled export subsidy commitments for more information see crs report rs22187 brazils wto case against the us cotton program brief overview by randy schnepf canada and brazil claim that since they fail to qualify for inclusion in the green box us direct payments should be added to its ams when calculating total domestic support in addition they also charge that the united states has improperly notified several of its farm support programs as exempt from the ams limit while several other programs were improperly excluded from us notifications canada and brazil claim that when all of the outlays from these allegedly misnotified programs are included then the us ams total exceeds its wto commitment level the panel hearing the case is not likely to conclude its work until late 2008 should any eventual changes in us farm policy be needed to comply with wto ruling against the united states it would likely involve action by congress to produce new legislation this report provides background and details as well as the current status of the two wto dispute settlement cases in addition it discusses the role of congress in

initiated separate but similar wto cases against certain us farm programs as they relate to us commitments made to the world trade organization wto both canadas ds357 and brazils ds365 cases make two broad charges first they contend that the united states has exceeded the subsidy spending limit it committed to for domestic agricultural support programs second they charge that the united states operates its agricultural export credit guarantee program in such manner as to provide prohibited subsidies to those exports made under the programs on december 17 2007 the wtos dispute settlement body dsb announced the establishment of panel to hear both cases against us farm programs panel ruling is not expected until late 2008 subsequent appeals of any negative ruling and disagreement over appropriate retaliatory levels etc could push resolution of the dispute well into the future however the importance of the case is not diminished to the us agricultural community us agriculture

wtds36510 and nicaragua wtds36511 origins of canadas wto case canada and the united states have history of commodity trade disputes traditionally focused on various wheat support programs and trade practices2 in 2005 after several years of wrangling over wheat trade issues canada extended its disagreement with us farm programs to the corn sector when canadian corn producers sought legal action for alleged unfair subsidization and dumping of us corn in canadian markets canadas international trade tribunal citt ultimately ruled on the 2005 antidumping and countervailing adcv duty case in favor of the united states3 however canadian corn producers continued to press their concerns upon the canadian government about perceived unfair subsidization of us corn in january 2007 canada requested consultations with the united states to discuss three specific charges against us farm programs 1 us farm support resulted in serious prejudice against canadian corn producers 2 us domestic support exceeded its wto commitments and 3 us export credit guarantee programs contained implicit wtoillegal subsidies canadas first allegation in its 2 for more information see crs report rl32426

crs4 wto case built upon previous trade complaints against the united states initiated by canadian corn producers starting in 2005 while the latter two allegations were based on previous wto ruling in case wto case ds267 brought by brazil against the us cotton program4 another potential factor motivating canada to bring its case against us farm subsidies was canadian domestic political concerns emanating from weak coalition government responding to pressure from cornproducing interests following the unfavorable citt adcv corn duty ruling in addition canada had general interest in influencing the 2007 us farm bill debate in favor of lower amberbox type support5 news report suggested that two additional factors motivating canadas case included the temporary suspension of doha round negotiations july 24 2006 which indefinitely postponed the possibility of us farm program reforms under multilateral trade negotiations and the settlement of softwood lumber dispute between canada and the united states which freed up canadian government trade attorneys to refocus on the wto litigation against us farm programs6 the request for consultations represented the first step in instituting wto dispute settlement case against the united states the assigning of an official dispute settlement case number ds357 thus setting in motion the explicit rules and timetables of the wto dsu process7 following canadas request for consultations several other wto members argentina australia brazil the european communities guatemala nicaragua thailand and uruguay officially requested to join the consultations as interested third parties on february 7 2007 canada and the united states held consultations concerning the three charges raised by canada under wto rules for subsidy complaints alleging adverse effects minimum 60day consultation period is required before country can ask the wto to establish dispute settlement panel8 although the consultations failed to resolve the dispute the canadian international trade minister david emerson announced on may 2 2007 that the canadian government would temporarily hold off on taking any further action in its wto 4 for more information

dispute settlement in the world trade organization an overview by jeanne grimmett 8 article 74 scm agreement crs5 dispute settlement proceeding ds357 against us corn subsidies until at least the end of the year pending the outcome of doha round trade negotiations9 however in june 2007 canada requested that the establishment of wto dispute settlement panel to hear its case against us farm programs be included on the agenda of the next meeting of the wtos dispute settlement body dsb in its panel request canada dropped the serious prejudice charge against us corn subsidies probably in large part because corn market prices have risen so dramatically since mid2006 and were projected to remain high for at least the next ten years10 the united states blocked canadas request at the june 21 2007 dsb meeting according to wto rules panel can be blocked only once implying that second request by canada if made at one of the subsequent dsb meetings would have to be honored however canada refrained from pursuing the establishment of panel to hear the case at the next several dsb meetings origins of brazils wto case brazil which has already won series of wto dispute settlement rulings against us cotton programs11 introduced its new challenge against us farm programs on july 11 2007 when it requested consultations with the united states to discuss the same two charges against us farm programs as in canadas case ds357 the context for brazils new challenge of us farm programs is significant first the new challenge builds on panel rulings from brazils successful case ds267 against certain aspects of the us cotton program previous findings in the case although not part of the final recommendations appear to have set legal precedent and could facilitate brazils new claims second the doha round of wto trade negotiations continues to make very little apparent progress after having resumed in september 2007 possibly providing further incentive to seek legal recourse under wtos dispute settlement process rather than via negotiation12 third the us congress is presently revisiting omnibus farm legislation brazil has general interest in influencing the us farm bill debate in favor of lower amberboxtype support fourth canada had already initiated similar case brazil initially joined canadas case as an interested third party however brazil has since chosen to pursue its own separate but similar case news sources speculate that brazil did this in order to have greater voice in the wto dispute settlement process13 furthermore brazils case appears to be more comprehensive than canadas wto case in terms of the level of detail of program support activity that 9 holding up on the us corn wto case washington trade daily vol 16 88 may 3 2007 10 for longrun commodity price

members canada guatemala costa rica the european communities ec mexico australia argentina thailand india and nicaragua officially requested to join the consultations as interested third parties as with canadas case brazil was assigned an official dispute settlement case number ds365 thus setting in motion the explicit rules and timetables of the wto dispute settlement process14 consultations between brazil and the united states were held on august 22 2007 but failed to resolve the dispute status of the two cases by late 2007 canada and brazil appear to have coordinated their efforts as both countries submitted official requests on november 8 2007 for the dsb to add the establishment of panel to its next meeting agenda again according to the wto rules the united states blocked this new panel request at the november 27 2007 dsb meeting however at its next meeting on december 17 the dsb announced the establishment of single panel to jointly hear both cases brought by canada ds357 and brazil ds365 against us farm programs in their requests brazil and canada asked for single panel to be established to consider both cases jointly the united states did not object to this proposal15 in accordance with the understanding on rules and procedures governing the settlement of disputes dsu16 once the establishment of panel has been announced the dsb has up to 45 days for panel to be appointed plus six months for the panel to conclude its work as result it is not likely that the panel once appointed will finish its work and issue final ruling before late 2008 major charges against us farm programs both the canadian ds357 and brazilian ds365 cases raise two principal charges against us farm programs each of these is discussed below first allegation us total domestic agricultural support exceeds its wto limit in accordance with wto commitments all wto members have agreed to submit annual notifications of their farm program outlays to the wto and these outlays are subject to specific limits for the united states its total spending limit for amber box programs ie programs that are trade and marketdistorting was 199 billion in 1999 and 191 billion in all subsequent years17 to date the 14 for more information see crs report rs20088 dispute settlement in the world trade organization an overview by jeanne grimmett 15 wto dispute settlement body monthly news release december 17 2007 available at httpwwwwtoorgenglishnews_enews07_edsb_17dec07_ehtm 16 wto legal texts annex 2 dispute settlement understanding dsu available at httpwwwwtoorgenglishdocs_elegal_elegal_ehtm 17 amber box outlays are actually residual category comprised of the total aggregate measure of support ie total of all market and trade distorting support less those outlays continued crs7 united states has notified details of its farm program outlays through 200518 according to us farm program spending notifications to the wto us domestic support outlays have remained well within us wto spending commitments19 however canada and brazil argue that several us program payments were either omitted from the notification data or incorrectly notified either as green box or as nonproductspecific ams where they would more easily qualify for exclusion from amber box limits under the nonproductspecific minimis exemption canada and brazil contend that when all of the disputed payments and other subsidies are included in the us ams calculation then the total outlays would exceed the spending commitment in each of 1999 2000 2001 2002 2004 and 2005 the claim that the united states has exceeded its total spending limits hinges largely on previous ruling from the usbrazil cotton case in which wto panel found that us payments made under the production flexibility contract pfc and direct payment dp programs do not qualify for the wtos green box exemption category because of their prohibition on planting fruits vegetables and wild rice on covered program acreage20 however the panel did not make the extension that pfc and dp payments should therefore be counted as amber box programs but instead was mute on this point in its wto notifications the united states has notified its pfc payments as fully decoupled and green box compliant21 this is an important distinction because the green box contains only nondistorting program payments and is not subject to any limit canada and brazil argue that because of the previous panel ruling pfc and dp payments do not conform with wto greenbox rules and should be included with us amber box payments furthermore canada and brazil argue that several other us program payments were incorrectly notified as exempt from the us ams limit these include 17 continued that are exempt from any limit under four possible exclusion classifications green box blue box and product or nonproductspecific minimis exclusions for more information on wto support classifications see crs report rs20840 agriculture in the wto limits on domestic support 18 at the time that both canada and brazil initiated their cases ds357 and ds365 the united states had only notified its domestic support data through marketing year 2001 the united states notified for the marketing years 2002 2003 2004 and 2005 on october 8 2007 19 for more information on wto commitments and actual outlays see crs report

more information on these restrictions see usda farm service agency fact sheet direct and countercyclical payment program wild rice fruit and vegetable provisions february 2003 at httpwwwfsausdagovpaspublicationsfactshtmlfav03htm 21 decoupled means it has influence on producers decisionmaking process green box compliant means it adheres to the terms and conditions of annex 2 of the agreement on agriculture crs8 production flexibility contract pfc and direct payment dp programs whose payments were notified as green box under decoupled income payments noninsured crop disaster assistance program nap payments crop disaster assistance emergency feed livestock indemnity and tree assistance programs that were notified as green box under payments for relief from natural disasters and emergency crop market loss assistance payments from the early 2000s that were notified as nonproductspecific ams but which brazil and canada contend would be more correctly notified as productspecific ams outlays in addition both canada and brazil argue that ccp payments established under the 2002 farm act pl 107171 should similarly be counted against the us amber box spending limit of 191 billion in contrast the united states has notified ccp payments as exempt from ams limits under the nonproduct specific minimis exemption in addition as part of its doha policy reform proposal the united states recommends that ccp payments be eligible for the blue box where they would be subject to different limit than the amber box22 unlike canadas case brazil cited several additional us farm support programs that it claims were simply not notified ie they were omitted from inclusion in the us ams total these include both direct and guaranteed loans and usda farm loan programs programs exempting onfarm use of gasoline and diesel fuel from payment of various excise and sales taxes programs exempting us farmers from taxes based on overall farm income eg deductions from taxable income from farming farm marketing and purchasing cooperatives and export transactions of agricultural commodities and subsidies related to the operation and maintenance of irrigation works by the us department of the interior canada and brazil charge that when pfc dp and ccp payments for all covered crops wheat corn grain sorghum barley oats upland cotton rice soybeans and other oilseeds as well as the additional program outlays that were excluded from us notifications are included in the uss amber box then the total outlays would exceed the spending commitment in each of 1999 2000 2001 2002 2004 and 2005 however neither canada nor brazil provide the specific details on its yearbyyear determinations so direct comparisons are not possible crs calculations based on us notifications and available usda data suggest that with the inclusion of the otherwise excluded pfc and dp the us ams total would exceed the spending limit in two of the years indicated figure 1 the further inclusion of both market loss assistance and ccp payments as product specific amber box payments to the us ams total suggests that the spending limit would be exceeded in five of the years indicated figure 2 22 blue box payments are defined as productionlimiting types of payments for more information see crs report rl33144 wto doha round the agricultural negotiations by charles hanrahan

wtoillegal export subsidies canada and brazil argue that the us export credit guarantee program operates as wtoillegal export subsidy in the usbrazil cotton case ds267 wto panel found that us export credit guarantees effectively function as export subsidies because the financial benefits returned by these programs failed to cover their longrun operating costs23 furthermore the panel found that this applies not just to cotton but to all commodities that benefit from us commodity support programs and receive export credit guarantees as result export credit guarantees for any recipient commodity are subject to previously scheduled wto spending limits the panel recommended and was upheld on appeal that these prohibited subsidies be removed by july 1 2005 on december 18 2007 compliance panel found that the united states had not yet fully complied with the panel ruling with respect to the ruling that export credit guarantees operate like illegal export subsidies compliance through policy reform would likely involve incorporating user fees that reflect the market risk associated with each loan guarantee for example this could be achieved by removing the 1 cap on user fees charged under the export credit guarantee program the 1 fee cap prevents charging marketbased fees and contributes to the export credit guarantee program operating as wtoillegal export subsidy both the senate and housepassed versions of the 2007 farm bill hr 2419 include changes to the export credit program including the elimination of the 1 cap on user fees in addition both bills reauthorize direct payments but without the decoupling recommended to achieve greenbox compliance us response in response to canadas request for consultations on us subsidies thenus secretary of agriculture mike johanns declared in early 2007 that the united states would vigorously defend us farm programs against any possible wto challenge by canada24 spokesman for the us trade representative ustr declared that it was disappointed at canadas and brazils requests the us official said that this dispute was an unnecessary diversion of resources and time from the doha round negotiations the official also stated that us farm programs were designed to be in compliance with its wto obligations and believed that the panel would agree the official also added that some measures identified by canada and brazil had ceased to exist five years ago prior to the 2002 farm bill and that others were not part of the consultations with canada all three countries involved the united states canada and brazil have agreed that the meeting of the panel would be open to the public 23 for more detail see crs report rl32571 brazils wto case against the us cotton program by randy schnepf 24 inside us trade johanns says us will defend farm programs from canadian challenge january 12 2007 crs11 potential implications and role of congress many market analysts suggest that the two recent cases brought by brazil and canada are harbingers of future challenges to us commodity programs if either country were to successfully pursue its case it could affect most us program commodities since the charges against the us export credit guarantee program and ams limit extend to all major program crops should any eventual changes in us farm policy be needed to comply with wto ruling congress likely would be called upon to address this issue including adjustment if not full removal of the planting restriction on base acres receiving direct payments ultimately congress is responsible for passing farm program legislation that complies with us commitments in international trade agreements when confronted with negative wto dispute settlement ruling country has essentially five options to choose from eliminate the subsidy reduce the subsidy to diminish its adverse effect revise the program function to reduce the linkage between the subsidy and the adverse effect referred to as decoupling pay mutually acceptable compensatory payment to offset the adverse effects of the subsidy or suffer the consequences of trade retaliation while wto case can result in punitive sanctions being authorized the proceedings of formal case can take many months and sometimes years to reach conclusion25 for example the usbrazil cotton case was initiated by brazils request for wto consultations on september 27 2002 panel was established nearly six months later on march 18 2003 the panels final report was delivered to the dsb on september 8 2004 the case was appealed and the appellate bodys final report was adopted by the dsb on march 21 2005 nearly 30 months after the initial request for consultations26 subsequently brazil requested wto compliance panel to review whether the united states had fully complied with the panels rulings the wto compliance panel issued its final ruling on december 18 2007 thus extending the length of the usbrazil cotton case to over five years congress is presently revisiting omnibus farm legislation27 proposed provisions in the house and senatepassed versions of the farm bill hr 2419 would bring the export credit guarantee program into compliance with wto rules by eliminating the subsidy component of export credit guarantees28 however neither version appears to address the issue surrounding the disqualification of direct payments from the wtos green box ams exclusion due to the planting restriction on fruits 25 for more information see crs report rs20088 dispute settlement in the world trade organization an overview by jeanne grimmett 26 this timeline is discussed in more detail in crs report rl32571 background on the usbrazilwto cotton subsidy dispute by randy schnepf 27 for more information see crs report rl33934 farm bill legislative action in the 110th congress coordinated by renee johnson 28 section 3002 title iii of the housepassed hr 2419 july 27 2007 and section 3101 title iii of the senate version of hr 2419 as passed december 14 2007 with amendments crs12 vegetables and wild rice on program base acres instead direct payments are extended with change to the current planting restriction except for small pilot program on 10000 acres in indiana this retention of the status quo in the face of the cotton panels ruling and recommendation has important wto implications as it would appear to favor the charge that the united states has exceeded its total ams limit in at least two years 1999 and 2000 if direct payments are included in the ams calculation figure 1 many market watchers question the relevance of expending legal resources to establish an historical ams violation in light of the high commodity prices that have persisted since mid2007 us farm program payments made under the marketing loan provisions and ccp program have to be triggered by low commodity prices before payments are made most longrun commodity market projections predict high commodity prices and low government program support to persist well into the future thus keeping us domestic support outlays well within current ams limits without any further changes to the programs additional uncertainty arises from the ongoing doha round of trade negotiations where successful conclusion could potentially mitigate or end canadas and brazils interest in continuing its case against the us farm programs given the importance of agricultural trade in the us agricultural economy congress will likely be monitoring developments in the wto ams dispute the house and senate agriculture committees regularly hold hearings on agricultural trade negotiations if the ongoing doha round of wto trade negotiations were to successfully conclude with text for further multilateral trade reform it is likely that congress would hold hearings and consult with the administration concerning the possible renewal of fasttrack or trade promotion authority tpa legislation which expired on july 1 200729 such hearings and consultations would be major vehicle for members to express their views on the usbrazil ams trade dispute on the negotiating issues that it raises and on the potential implications for us farm policy 29 for more information see
