the face of longterm care maine summary demographic challenges posed by the growing elderly population and demands for greater public commitment to home and communitybased care for persons with disabilities have drawn the attention of federal and state policymakers spending on longterm care by both the public and private sectors is significant in 2001 spending for longterm care services for persons of all ages represented 122 of all personal health care spending almost 152 billion of 124 trillion federal and state governments accounted for almost twothirds of all spending by far the primary payer for longterm care is the federalstate medicaid program which paid for almost half of all longterm care spending in 2001 many states have devoted significant efforts to respond to the desire for home and communitybased care by persons with disabilities and their families nevertheless financing of nursing home care chiefly by medicaid still dominates most states spending for longterm care today to assist congress understand issues that states face in providing longterm care services crs undertook study of 10 states in 2002 this report presents background and analysis about longterm care in maine maine is one of the smallest states in the country with 13 million people in 2000 it is also one of the oldest states with 144 of its population aged 65 and older by 2025 over onefifth of its population will be 65 and older medicaid spending for longterm care in maine in fy2001 was 411 million almost onethird of all medicaid spending in part due to the aging population and because of 1993 budgetary crisis involving rapidly escalating medicaid nursing home costs maine has pursued an aggressive policy to decrease dependence on nursing homes between 1995 and 2001 the percentage of public longterm care funding devoted to these facilities decreased from 84 to 61 moreover the state has decreased reliance on large stateoperated residential facilities for persons with mental retardation in favor of smaller communitybased facilities maines efforts to reduce reliance on institutional care has been in part due to expanded use of medicaids home and communitybased waiver program as well as multiple state funded programs crs interviews with state officials and review of state reports highlighted maines reliance on medicaid maximization policy under which the state makes every effort to draw down federal medicaid dollars by incorporating in its state plan almost all the home and communitybased services options allowed by federal law one of the challenges the state faces during tight fiscal constraints is to hold on to the gains it has made in providing home and community services to people with disabilities the 10state study was funded in part by grants from the jewish healthcare foundation and the us department of health and human services health resources and services administration office of rural health policy this report will not be updated preface demographic challenges posed by the growing elderly population and demands for greater public commitment to home and communitybased care for persons with disabilities have drawn the attention of federal and state policymakers for some time spending on longterm care by both the public and private sectors is significant in 2001 spending for longterm care services for persons of all ages represented 122 of all personal health care spending almost 152 billion of 124 trillion federal and state governments accounted for almost twothirds of all spending by far the primary payor for longterm care is the federalstate medicaid program which paid for almost half of all us longterm care spending in 2001 federal and state medicaid spending for longterm care in fy2001 was about 75 billion representing over onethird of all medicaid spending over 70 of medicaid longterm care spending was for institutions nursing homes and intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded icfsmr many believe that the current federal financing system paid through medicaid is structurally biased in favor of institutional care state governments face significant challenges in refocusing care systems given the structure of current federal financing many states have devoted significant efforts to change their longterm care systems to expand home and communitybased services for persons with disabilities and their families nevertheless financing of nursing home care primarily through the medicaid program still dominates most states spending on longterm care today while some advocates maintain that the federal government should play larger role in providing support for home and communitybased care congress has not yet decided whether or how to change current federal policy one possibility is that congress may continue an incremental approach to longterm care without major federal policy involvement leaving to state governments the responsibility for developing strategies that support home and communitybased care within existing federal funding constraints and program rules to help congress review various policy alternatives and to assist policymakers understand issues that states face in development of longterm care services the congressional research service crs undertook study of ten states in 2002 the research was undertaken to look at state policies on longterm care as well as trends in both institutional and home and communitybased care for persons with disabilities the elderly persons with mental retardation and other adults with disabilities the research included review of state documents and data on long term care as well as national data sources on spending interviews were held with state officials responsible for longterm care wide range of stakeholders and in some cases members or staff of state legislatures the 10 states included in the study are arizona florida illinois indiana louisiana maine oklahoma oregon pennsylvania and texas

acknowledge the generous time and contributions of the many state officials and stakeholders who provided information on longterm care services in maine without their generous time and invaluable experience and insight this report would not be possible we would particularly like to thank officials from the department of human services the department of behavioral and developmental services and the department of labor we would also like to thank the advocates and providers who offered valuable perspectives on the longterm care system in maine the authors also gratefully acknowledge the excellent assistance of flora adams and charlotte foote in the production of this report crs review of 10 states home and communitybased services states seek to change the face of longterm care maine introduction federal legislative perspective states choosing to modify their programs for the social security amendments of 1965 which longterm care face created the medicaid program required states to significant challenges provide skilled nursing facility services under their financing of nursing home state medicaid plans and gave nursing home care the same level of priority as hospital and physician care has dominated longterm services care spending for decades the federal financing section 1902 state plan for medical assistance structure that created must provide for inclusion of some institutional and some noninstitutional care and services and effective incentives to support july 1 1967 provide for inclusion of at least institutional care reaches 1 inpatient hospital services 2 outpatient back to 1965 number of hospital services 3 other laboratory and xray converging factors have services 4 skilled nursing home services other than supported reliance on nursing services in an institution for tuberculosis or mental diseases for individuals 21 years of age or older 5 home spending prior to physicians services pl 8997 july 30 1965 enactment of medicaid homes for the aged and other public institutions were financed by combination of direct payments made by individuals with their social security old age assistance oaa benefits and vendor payments made by states with federal matching payments on behalf of individuals the kerrmills medical assistance to the aged maa program enacted in 1960 predecessor to medicaid allowed states to provide medical services including skilled nursing home services to persons who were not eligible for oaa cash payments thereby expanding the eligible population1 in 1965 when kerrmills was transformed into the federalstate medicaid program congress created an entitlement to skilled nursing facility care under the expanded program the social security amendments of 1965 required that states provide skilled nursing facility services and gave nursing home care the same level of priority as hospital and physician services amendments in 1967 allowed states to provide care in intermediate care facilities icfs for persons who did not need 1 crs report 83181 nursing home legislation issues and policies by maureen baltay archived and available upon request from the congressional research service crs crs2 skilled nursing home care but needed more than room and board in 1987 congress eliminated the distinction between skilled nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities effective in 1990 as result of these various amendments people eligible under the states medicaid plan are entitled to nursing home facility care that is if person meets the states income and asset requirements as well as the states functional eligibility requirements for entry into nursing home he or she is entitled to the benefit these early legislative developments were the basis for the beginnings of the modern day nursing home industry significant growth in the number of nursing homes occurred during the 1960s from 1960 to 1970 the number of homes more than doubled from 9582 to almost 23000 and the number of beds more than tripled from 331000 to more than one million2 today there are about since its inception medicaid has been the predominant 17000 nursing homes with payor for nursing home care in 1970 over 1 billion 3 was spent on nursing home care through medicaid and 18 million beds medicare federal and state medicaid payments accounted for almost all of this spending 87 during the latter part medicaid spending for nursing home care grew by 50 in of the 1960s and the 1970s the threeyear period beginning in 1967 nursing home care attracted great deal of in fy2001 medicaid spent 531 billion on institutional care for nursing homes and care in intermediate care congressional oversight as facilities for the mentally retarded result of concern about increasing federal expenditures and pattern of instances of fraud and abuse that was becoming evident between 1969 and 1976 the subcommittee on longterm care of the senate special committee on aging held 30 hearings on problems in the nursing home industry4 home care services received some congressional attention in the authorizing statute home health care services were one of the optional services that states could provide under the 1965 law three years later in 1968 congress amended the law to require states to provide home health care services to persons entitled to skilled nursing facility care as part of their state medicaid plans effective in 1970 during the 1970s the department of health education and welfare now health and human services dhhs devoted attention to alternatives to nursing home care through variety of federal research and demonstration efforts these efforts were 2 us congress senate special committee on aging developments in aging 1970 report 9246 feb 16 1970 washington cited from the american nursing home association fact book

1974 and supporting papers published in succeeding years crs3 undertaken not only to find ways to offset the high costs of nursing facility care but also to respond to the desires of persons with disabilities to remain in their homes and in community settings rather than in institutions however it was not until 1981 that congress took significant legislative action to expand home and communitybased services through medicaid when it authorized the medicaid section 1915c home and communitybased waiver program under that authority known then as the section 2176 waiver program the secretary of dhhs may waive certain medicaid state plan requirements to allow states to cover wide range of home and communitybased services to persons who otherwise meet the states eligibility requirements for institutional care the waiver provision was designed to alter the fact that the medicaid program had emphasized institutional care rather than care in home and communitybased settings services under the section 1915c waiver include case management personal care homemaker home health aide adult day care habilitation environmental modifications among many others5 these services are covered as an option of states and under the law persons are not entitled to these services as they are to nursing facility care moreover states are allowed to set cost caps and limits on the numbers and types of persons to be served under their waiver programs notwithstanding wide use of the section 1915c waiver authority by states over the last two decades total spending for medicaid home and communitybased services waivers is significantly less than institutional care about 144 billion in 2001 compared to 531 billion for nursing facility care services and care for persons with mental retardation in intermediate care facilities icfsmr despite this disparity in spending in many states the section 1915c waiver program is the primary source of financial support for wide range of home and communitybased services and funding has been increasing steadily federal and state medicaid support for the waiver programs increased by over 807 from fy1990 to fy2001 in constant 2001 dollars the home and communitybased waiver program has been significant source of support to care for persons with mental retardation and developmental disabilities as states have closed large state institutions for these persons over the last two decades nationally in fy2001 almost 75 of section 1915c waiver funding was devoted to providing services to these individuals states administer their longterm care programs against this backdrop of federal legislative initiatives first the entitlement to nursing home care and requirement to provide home health services to persons entitled to nursing home care and 5 states may waive the following medicaid requirements 1 statewideness states may cover services in only portion of the state rather than in all geographic jurisdictions 2 comparability of services states may cover stateselected groups of persons rather than all persons otherwise eligible in addition states may use more liberal income requirements for persons needing home and communitybased waiver services than would otherwise apply to persons living in the community for further information see crs report rl31163 longterm care profile of medicaid 1915c home and communitybased services waivers by carol oshaughnessy and rachel kelly crs4 second the option to provide wide range of home and communitybased services through waiver of federal law within statedefined eligibility requirements service availability and limits on numbers of persons served summary overview6 overview maine has pursued an aggressive policy to decrease dependence on nursing homes as result of 1993 budgetary crisis involving rapidly escalating medicaid nursing home costs its policies to tighten nursing home eligibility and expand community options have decreased reliance on nursing homes dramatically maine has also decreased its reliance on institutions for persons with developmental disabilities the state closed its large stateoperated facility in 1995 and has greatly reduced its use of private intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded icfsmr care of this population has shifted to the home and smaller group residential settings demographic trends maine is one of the smallest states in the country with 127 million people in 2000 its population increased by 50000 people during the 1990s it also is one of the oldest states with 144 of its population aged 65 and older in 2025 214 of maines population will be age 65 years or older compared to 185 for the nation persons aged 85 and over with two or more limitations in activities of daily living are estimated to increase 153 by 2010 to reach 2047 the number of persons aged 18 to 64 with the same level of disability will increase by 6 reaching 2990 administration of longterm care programs responsibility for administration and management of longterm care services for persons with disabilities is spread across several state agencies with the department of human services dhs retaining responsibility for most programs various substate agencies and some private contractors have responsibility for different aspects of longterm care administration and services 6 information based on maine data and documents national data and interviews with state officials this report does not discuss programs for persons with mental illness it also generally excludes discussion of programs for infants and children with disabilities other than those serving persons with mental retardation and developmental disabilities crs5 maine uses several management tools to try to control use of nursing homes and to manage its home and communitybased services including 1 preadmission screening for all nursing home applicants 2 contracted assessment and case management agencies for adults receiving home care agency services and 3 separate agency for participants in consumerdirected personal assistance programs trends in institutional care between 1995 and 2001 according to state data the percentage of public longterm care beneficiaries served in nursing homes declined from 50 to 33 during the same time period the percentage of public longterm care funding devoted to these facilities decreased from 84 to 61 very few persons with mental retardation and developmental disabilities who live in residential settings live in large institutions in 2002 10 of persons in residential settings lived in settings serving seven or more persons persons living in small residential settings with six or fewer persons has increased from 62 of all persons living in group residential settings in 1991 to over 90 in 2002 this is due in part to expanded use of maines section 1915c home and communitybased waiver program which was designed to move people from large institutions into smaller settings trends in home and communitybased care in fy2001 maine provided about 5000 older persons and persons with disabilities with the following medicaid state plan services private duty nursing home health personal care and adult day care in addition the state relies on two medicaid section 1915c home and community based waivers to serve the adult population with disabilities the elder and adult waiver and the consumer directed waiver together they served about 2000 participants in fy2001 the state also has large medicaid and statefunded residential care program which served about 4300 persons in fy2001 the largest state funded program is homebased care which served about 4000 people in fy2001 maine uses one optional medicaid state plan service day habilitation one medicaid section 1915c home and community based services waiver which includes day habilitation and some statefunded programs to serve persons with developmental disabilities the states section 1915c waiver serves people who would otherwise be in an institution it provides residential training in licensed homes personal support day habilitation supported employment respite environmental modification crisis intervention and other services about 2200 people received services in fy2002 crs6 longterm care spending longterm care comprises significant portion of medicaid spending in maine about 30 of all medicaid spending was devoted to longterm care in fy2001 411 million out of 13 billion nursing home spending represented 15 of all medicaid spending as share of medicaid longterm care spending nursing home spending decreased from 655 to 49 from fy1990fy2001 during the same time period medicaid spending for institutions for persons with mental retardation decreased from 232 to 109 in fy2001 maine spent 1528 million on medicaid section 1915c home and communitybased services waiver programs 536 increase in constant 2001 dollars from fy1990 issues in financing and delivery of longterm care one of the challenges maine faces during its 2003 budgetary crisis is to hold on to the gains it has made in providing home and community services to people with disabilities while dealing with its fiscal constraints the labor shortage is critical problem affecting all areas of health care including longterm care for older persons and care for persons with developmental disabilities particularly in southern maine the labor shortage also makes it difficult to recruit state and privately employed case managers much of the state is rural and it is challenge for people to travel to services or for workers to get to the homes of people with disabilities transportation services is largely unmet need in these areas demographic trends maine is one of the smallest states in the country with 127 million people in 2000 the population increased by about 50000 people in the past decade it also is one of the oldest states with 144 of its population

management of longterm care services for persons with disabilities is spread across several state agencies with the department of human services dhs retaining responsibility for most programs various substate agencies and some private contractors have responsibility for different aspects of longterm care administration and services the department of human services is the single state agency for medicaid and three of its bureaus administer most of the states longterm care programs the bureau of medical services bms is the fiscal agent for medicaid it processes claims enrolls participating providers and manages medicaids optional personal care service the bureau of elder and adult services beas manages two of the states four medicaid section 1915c home and communitybased services

also licensed assisted living facilities alfs this responsibility went to beas because the state wanted to maintain the social model for alfs in contrast to the medical model that the department used when it regulated those facilities responsibility for assessment eligibility and case management maine uses several management tools to try to control use of nursing homes and to manage its home and communitybased services including 1 preadmission screening for nursing home applicants using standardized assessment tool 2 contracted assessment and case management agencies for adults receiving agency provided home care services and 3 contracted agency that assists participants in consumerdirected programs functional eligibility private agency goold data management conducts the assessments of functional eligibility and authorizes service plans that establish the amount and type of services for all persons receiving medicaid home and communitybased services after this assessment people are advised of what their longterm care options are and many are able to remain in the community or enter group residential settings rather than enter nursing home fiftyfour nurses statewide conducted 16359 assessments in state fiscal year sfy 2001 at cost of 153 per assessment7 state officials and stakeholders commented that people who receive medicaid home health services from certified home health agencies must have two assessments the states uniform assessment as well as the outcome and assessment information set oasis tool that is federally required when people receive medicare or medicaidfunded home health services some stakeholders advocate replacing the states tool with oasis but state officials resist this idea because they believe their tool meets their management needs better than oasis would financial eligibility the bureau of family independence handles the financial eligibility determination for medicaid services through its 15 local offices some interviewees said that financial eligibility standards for longterm care programs differ and are so complex that applicants cannot understand them beas staff say they help people work through the eligibility rules so that they obtain the benefits for which they qualify however some stakeholders complained that the determination process can take several months which delays receipt of services state officials say that financial eligibility determination generally takes place within 7 bureau of elder and adult services maines home and communitybased care system at wwwstatemeasdhsltc2000 accessed on feb 6 2002

services performs case management for its clients with developmental disabilities through its three regional offices case managers are state employees who in addition to assessing eligibility and developing service plans also visit people in nursing homes to determine if they can live in the community in small group homes for example about 4500 people receive case management services from the

policy to decrease dependence on nursing homes in its longterm care system the state started on this course because of 1993 budgetary crisis since nursing home costs had increased by 50 over 3year period9 the state implemented stringent functional eligibility criteria for medicaid nursing home care in 1994 prior to implementation of these criteria people had been able to obtain medicaid nursing home coverage if they needed assistance with one activity of daily living adl or one instrumental activity of daily living iadl10 according to some stakeholders the new criteria resulted in some people being released to or remaining in the community without sufficient home and community service alternatives according to interviewees the alzheimers association succeeded in amending the functional criteria for nursing home eligibility to define nursing need to include management of cognition and behavior the standard now requires an applicant to need form of therapy 5 days week assistance with three specific adls nursing services three times week or have cognitive or behavior problem in 1994 the maine legislature adopted policy of universal preadmission screening of all nursing home applicants so facilities cannot admit anyone unless they first have an assessment the state found that there were not enough residential alternatives to nursing homes and that waiting lists for home and community services had developed to ameliorate this situation in 1996 the state devoted more funding to home and community services as result medicaid nursing home admissions decreased and use of home and community services increased tables 4 and 5 between 1995 and 2001 the percentage of publiclyfunded aged and disabled longterm care beneficiaries served in nursing homes declined from 50 to 33 during the same time period the percentage of public longterm care funding devoted to these facilities decreased from 84 to 61 9 bureau of elder and adult services longterm care

figure much lower than the national rate of 4348 the relatively high occupancy rates combined with the low ratio of nursing home beds to older persons implies that the state does not have much excess capacity in its nursing home industry according to data supplied by officials from the maine bureau of medical services medicaid helps fund the costs of 72 of all nursing home residents crs14 table 6

stakeholders claim that about half of nursing facilities are technically insolvent due to low payment rates and handful have closed in recent years state officials counter that maine has one of the highest nursing home payment rates in the country officials mentioned that elimination of the boren amendment which required that state medicaid nursing home payment rates be reasonable and adequate to meet the costs which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities section 1902a13 of the social security act enabled the state to control payments to nursing homes and avoid paying unnecessary costs nursing home quality is said to be generally good according to interviewees since many homes are located in rural areas where people know one another well the resulting sense of community promotes delivery of good quality care in some rural communities the facilities are major employer in the area trends in home and communitybased care maine takes advantage of medicaids mandatory and optional state plan services as well as section 1915c waivers to provide home and communitybased care to adults with disabilities in fy2001 the state provided about 5000 participants with the following medicaid state plan services private duty nursing home health personal care and adult day care costs of these services in fy2001 were 194 million in addition the state relies on two waivers to serve the adult population with disabilities in home and communitybased settings the elder and adult waiver and the consumerdirected waiver together they served almost 2000 participants at cost of 27 million in fy2001 the state also has large residential care program funded by medicaid and state funds which served about 4300 persons in fy2001 crs15 the state also sponsors number of programs that do not receive federal funding most of which serve just few hundred people by far the largest program is homebased care which served about 4000 people at cost of 15 million in fy2001 this program and the states other home and communitybased programs for adults have separate consumerdirected components that mirror the main programs medicaid state plan services and 1915 c waivers maines medicaid mandatory and optional longterm services have varying functional eligibility standards but all have the same financial eligibility standards under the states medicaid program persons countable income cannot exceed 100 of the federal poverty level countable assets cannot exceed 200011 although the state can disregard an additional 8000 in financial assets when calculating financial eligibility section 1915c waiver services require that person meet the states functional eligibility criteria for nursing facility coverage the income eligibility standard for these waivers is 222 of the federal poverty level and countable assets cannot exceed 2000 or 10000 including an 8000 additional asset disregard mandatory and optional state plan services the mandatory state plan home health service requires beneficiaries of any age to have need for skilled care and to be homebound physicians must order the service available services are nursing therapies aides and psychiatric monitoring there is cap on the amount of care available to an individual about 2000 adults received these services in fy2001 at cost of 53 million private duty nursing and personal care both optional services under the maine state medicaid plan require beneficiaries of any age to need assistance in at least two of seven activities of daily living adls or need direction with four adls both services offer nursing home health aide and personal care assistance costs are limited to 3884 month in fy2001 for people needing nursing home level of care but the cost cap for beneficiaries who are dependent on ventilator is 20100 month the programs served about 2500 adults in fy2001 the cost of the two programs was 93 million in that year consumerdirected personal care is an optional service for persons age 18 and over who need assistance with two of seven adls but who are cognitively capable of directing their own services the service limit is 35 hours week of daytime care and 14 hours of nighttime care in fy2001 alpha one served 357 consumers at cost of 41 million 11 in addition medicaid statute requires that certain items are excluded from assets an individuals home up to 2000 of household goods and personal effects life insurance policies with face value of 1500 or less an automobile with value up to 14500 and burial funds up to 1500 among other things crs16 adult day health services another medicaid optional service under the clinic option serves people who are age 18 or older and who attend day care minimum of four hours week services available to the 173 participants fy2001 include health care monitoring nursing rehabilitation counseling and health promotion the functional and financial eligibility standards for this service are the same as for private duty nursing and personal care adult day health spending was 787000 in fy2001 medicaid section 1915c waivers maine has two section 1915c waivers for the adult population one for services provided through home care agencies services and the other for consumerdirected services the section 1915c waiver for persons with mental retardation is discussed below they are administered independently of one another the elder and adult with disabilities waiver is for persons aged 18 and older who receive range of services including case management nursing aide and personal care services therapies homemaker adult day care mental health and transportation services the cap on services is 100 of the average nursing facility payment elder independence of maine administers these waivers the consumerdirected waiver also serves people who are eligible for nursing facility care but who are cognitively capable of directing their services this waiver provides case management skills training and personal care assistance the cap on services is 90 of the average nursing facility payment as of june 2003 the state was considering exploring an amendment to its medicaid waiver that would increase the cost cap the waiver served 279 participants at cost of 83 million in fy2001 alpha one manages this waiver one of the states largest medicaid programs is the residential care services program which paid for the medical and remedial component of group residential care for 4325 participants in fy2001 at cost of 451 million state funds paid for the room and board component for most participants accounting for 17 million in the same year the state expanded this program as it sought to increase alternatives to nursing home care during its budget crisis in the mid1990s medicaid finances the care component of services in residential care homes adult family care homes and residential care homes which have private or shared rooms and baths and assisted living facilities which have private apartments medicaid payments for residents of all residential facilities are adjusted for varying categories 15 casemix groups using standardized assessment of all residents assisted living facility residents receive an average subsidy of 10657 per year in sfy2003 according to data supplied by the bureau of medical services medicaid helps fund the costs of 67 of alf residents residents who are eligible for supplemental security income ssi use these payments and their ssi state supplemental payments to fund their room and board costs those who are not ssi eligible must pay 40 of their income and 3 of liquid assets over 10000 as copayment for residential care state programs there are number of pathways that establish medicaid eligibility for home and communitybased longterm care services these include crs17 coverage of persons whose income is 300 of the federal supplemental security income ssi payment level as allowed under the section 1915c waiver program 1656 month for an individual in 2003 despite the availability of this more liberal standard many people may need community care but cannot meet medicaids income limits or resource tests many of these persons cannot establish eligibility until they spenddown almost all of their resources and income to meet that eligibility level and by that time may be in danger of entering an institution one of the issues many states have confronted is how to serve these people maine has addressed this issue in part through its seven statefunded programs many of these programs are designed to complement their medicaid counterparts with more generous financial eligibility standards than those of medicaid by far the largest program is homebased care for adults aged 18 and over eligibility for services is based on the presence of limitations in adls and iadls with at least one being an adl or if they need direction with four adls the program has upper limits on participants incomes or assets however the program has copayment of 4 of monthly income and 3 of assets exceeding 15000 the program offers wide array of services including case management nursing home health aide therapies personal care and adult day care these are the same basic services provided under the elder and adult waiver there are four levels of care with corresponding maximum caps the cap on services for the highest level is 85 of the nursing facility rate elder independence of maine runs the program which served 3863 persons in fy2001 at cost of 124 million in addition the program has separatelymanaged consumerdirected component with the same basic eligibility standards as the agencyprovided service program the service cap is set at 35 hours per week plus 14 hours per week of night personal care services the consumerdirected component managed by alpha one served 203 people in fy2001 at cost of 31 million the state has five other state funded programs adult day services congregate housing assisted living alzheimers respite and homemaker services all of which have similar functional and financial eligibility standards as the other two statefunded programs these five programs served total of 2672 participants at cost of 6 million in fy2001 crs18 maines longterm care services for persons with mental retardation and developmental disabilities overview services to persons with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities in the united states changed dramatically over the last half of the 20th century as result of number of converging factors these include the advocacy efforts of families and organized constituency groups various changes to the social security law that provided payments to individuals through supplemental security income ssi and supplemental security disability insurance ssdi and to service providers through the medicaid program and significant litigation brought on behalf of persons with mental retardation12 trends in institutional care the early history of services to persons with mental retardation is characterized by the development of large state institutions or training schools begun during the latter part of the 19th century and continuing through the first part of the 20th century between 1920 and 1967 institutions quadrupled in size and peaked at almost 200000 individuals nationwide in 165 freestanding stateoperated mental retardation institutional facilities13 today some states are still faced with the legacy of large stateoperated institutions maine has eliminated its sole large stateoperated facility for persons with mental retardation and developmental disabilities it is also making strides to downsize its other three smaller stateoperated facilities see appendix table 2 for list of the facilities very few persons with mental retardation and developmental disabilities who live in residential settings live in large institutions in 2002 10 of persons in residential settings lived in settings serving 7 or more persons persons living in small residential settings with six or fewer persons has increased from 62 of all persons living in group residential settings in 1991 to over 90 in 2002 table 7 this is due in part to expanded use of maines section 1915c home and communitybased waiver program which was designed to move people from large institutions into smaller settings 12 for detailed history of the development

developmental disabilities fifth edition by david braddock et 1998 washington dc american association on mental retardation p 404 for 1990 data unpublished data furnished by richard hemp university of colorado for 2000 data issues in longterm care in maine the following discussion highlights selected issues raised in state reports collected for this report and in interviews with state officials and key stakeholders conducted during the site visit to maine in the summer of 2002 budgetary concerns in dealing with prior budgetary dilemmas the state has followed medicaid maximization policy in providing home and community based care that is because the state has opted to take opportunities to provide number of optional home and communitybased services that are allowed under the federal law it can therefore draw down federal medicaid matching dollars to support its program one of the challenges the state faces during its budgetary crisis is to hold on to the gains it has made in providing home and community services to people with disabilities according to interviewees this is particularly the case when the states crs27 nursing home lobby competes with other groups for funding part of the state governments plan to close its budget gap would involve 6 nursing home bed tax which would raise 7 million15 the money would be used to draw down federal medicaid funds which would then go to wages for longterm care workers including providers other than nursing homes other budget actions would shift some state funded residential costs to medicaid and reduce spending on statefunded services including homemaker adult day services and alzheimers respite care the governors budget proposal would decrease nursing facilities cost of living adjustment from 3 to 216 according to state officials as of march 2002 home and communitybased services had not been affected too negatively by budget cuts labor issues the health labor shortage is critical problem affecting all areas of health care including longterm care and care for persons with developmental disabilities particularly in southern maine the labor shortage also makes it difficult to recruit state and privatelyemployed case managers interviewees cited several reasons for the labor shortage fourteen percent of maines population is aged 65 or over and many younger people are leaving the state to find employment interviewees also cited low wages and lack of health insurance as barriers to employment in the longterm care sector the state has considered becoming selfinsurer for agencies contracting with the state to provide an opportunity for them to participate in large group health insurance plan the results of the labor shortage include high staff turnover and reliance on temporary agency staff this can disrupt continuity of care in facilities and lead to staff having insufficient training to handle some of the complex needs of nursing home residents there is also shortage of experienced nursing home administrators so many come to their jobs with very little training state officials said that some people in southern maine may have to be placed on waiting lists for home and community services because of the labor shortage conducting criminal background checks on longterm care employees is another controversial labor issue in maine not all longterm care programs require criminal background checks for longterm care workers and consumerdirected programs have actively resisted this the states certified nurse aide registry does not allow people who have committed crimes in health care settings to be on the registry but criminals with other types of convictions can be some officials recommended more attention to registries of nurse aides state officials noted that uswide registry could prevent criminals working in longterm care from going from state to state when they lose their credentials consumer direction number of controversial issues raised during the site visit related to various aspects of the consumerdirected programs control of these 15 rankin joe governor proposes nursing home tax kennebec journal june 29 2002 16 michael d moore health professionals wary of king cuts bangor daily news june 27 2002 crs28 programs was transferred from the maine department of human services dhs to the department of labor dol in 2001 the transfer occurred as result of advocacy efforts on the part of consumers many believed that maine dol would be the more appropriate administering agency since it has experience with rehabilitation services and independent living services for persons with severe disabilities dol administers programs authorized under the rehabilitation act of 1973 including vocational rehabilitation and centers for independent living programs another controversy surrounds paying family members to work for beneficiaries according to interviewees this can become problematic when the family members come to consider

generation of poor women because they do not have access to employment that provides fringe benefits like retirement and health insurance assisted living facilities some stakeholders interviewed said that assisted living facilities alfs are becoming more popular than nursing homes however sometimes people enter nursing homes because federal money isnt available for assisted living facilities also

disabilities was 500 people who are in crisis situations move off of the list to receive services first the waiting list for supported employment was between 300 and 400 crs29 appendix 1 major home
