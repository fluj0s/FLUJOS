charter travel and that lodging accommodations for trips arranged specifically for members or staff may only be at appropriate facilities considering cost location and proximity to the officially connected events for events arranged without regard to congressional participation lodging and f ood provided for all other ttendees are presumptively reasonable for events arra nged specifically for members and staff food costs must be reasonable and one factor for consideration will be the per diem rates for meals for official government travel expenses for such travel may be accepted only from entities that have significant role in organizing nd conducting the trip and that also have clear and defined interest in the pur pose of the trip or events16 travel on private noncommercial aircraft former rule members or employees of the house had generally been required to reimburse the owner of private aircraft to avoid violations of house gift rules unofficial office account rules or federal campaign finan ce laws criticism of this practice arose however because members and staff were allowed to use private corporate aircraft for travel for personal or official purposes while reimbursing the owner of such aircraft at ra tes which were arguably far below the fair market value for comparable privately chartered flight17 in addition the convenience and ease for member of congress to take such flight and the special access to members such flights provided for corporate officials and lobbyists regardless of the amount of reimbursement from official or personal funds for the f lights concerned reformers worried about the normal gratitude that such special favors for members might engender and the potential resulting undue infl uence on the members judgment new rule under the new house rules rule xxiii cl 15 members and staff are now prohibited from using any funds whether personal funds campaign funds or official funds to pay for or reimburse the expenses of traveling on private or corporate aircraft members and staff traveling for personal campaign or official purposes will generally be required to fly on commercially scheduled airlines or to charter flights from companies in that business it appears that under ex isting exceptions to the gift rule however members and staff can still fly on private corporate aircraft when the member or staffer is to be involved in permissible outsi business endeavor or in employment discussions with prospective private employer which owns the aircraft when the private company or prospective employer normally w ould make such aircraft available to one involved in the business endeavor or to one being interviewed or otherwise seeking employment18 similarly if an aircraft is owned by an individual who provides flight on the basis of personal friendship to member or staffer then flight can be accepted under such exception with approval from th house committee on standards of
