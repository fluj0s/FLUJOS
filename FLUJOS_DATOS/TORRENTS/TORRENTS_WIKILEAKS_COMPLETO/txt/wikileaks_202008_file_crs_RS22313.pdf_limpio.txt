development subtitle c and the sale of federal land subtitle d the two provisions removed from the bill would have opened up the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr for oil and gas development and offered coastal states the option of offshore oil and gas development in areas now under leasing and development moratoria the senate energy and natural resources committee however supported opening

two provision removed anwr and ocs from the resources committee recommendation mining fees subtitle of the housepassed bill would change the fee structure for minerals located and developed under the general mining law of 1872 the general mining law of 1872 is one of the major statutes that affects the fede ral governments land management policy the law grants free access to individuals and corporations to prospect for minerals in public domain lands and allows them upon making discovery to stake or locate claim on that deposit claim gives the holder the right to develop the minerals and may be patented to convey full title to the claimant less than 2 of public lands managed by the bureau of land management have been patented continuing issue is whether this law shoul d be reformed and if so how to balance mineral development with competing land uses the right to enter the public domain and fr eely prospect for and develop minerals is the feature of the claimpatent system th at draws the most vigorous support from the mining industry critics consid er the claimpatent system giveaway of publicly owned resources because of the small amounts paid to maintain claim nd to obtain patent congress has imposed moratorium on mining claim patents since fy1995 the onetime location fee now at 32 pe r claim would increase to 100 per claim under the resources bill required mineral velopment work ie work required prior to patent application would increas from 500 per claim to 7500 per cl aim and new schedule of maintenance fees would be established the patent application processing fee would increase from 250 for the first claim or site to 2500 for the first claim or site the charge of 50 for each additional claim woul d remain unchangedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22313crs3 patent fees which allow for the transfer of title would rise from 250 or 5 per acre to 1000 per acre or fair market value whicheve r is higher mineral examinations would not be required under certain circumstances and the mining and nerals policy act of 1970 30 usc 21a would be amended to f acilitate the productive second use of lands used for mining and energy production disposal of public lands under subtitle b in the housepassed version public lands in nevada and idaho would be conve yed to claimants unde r the general mining law of 1872 about 7000 acres in nevada woul d be transferred to the claimant for 500 per acre in idaho about 520 acres w ould be transferred at 1000 per acre under subtitle d several parcels of land would be made available for immediate sale at fair market value certai n lands are conveyed to the dist rict of columbia and there is transfer of property from the district to the united states for administration by the secretary of the interior oil shale oil shale and tar sands amendments in subtitle c of the houseapproved bill would require the secretary of the interior to conduct lease sales offering at least 35 of federal lands considered ge ologically suitable within the states of colorado utah and wyoming royalty rates for the first 10 years would be set at 13 of the gross value of production beyond 10 years the rates would range from 69 of production value the secretary could reduce the rates under cer tain circumstances states would receive 50 of the revenues generated from oil shale and tar sand leases within that state of this 50 local governments would receive onethird share in the first ten years of production state and local governments woul d share an additional 80of the receipts deposited with the federal treasury the royalty rates proposed for oil shale leasing would be much lower than the 125 for oil and gas leasing on public land there are currently oil shale leases in the united states arctic coastal plain domestic energy the anwr coastal plain east of present sites of oil production is the virt ually undisturbed home to wide variety of plants and animals several species there are protected by international treaties or agreements this 1002 ar ea is the calving grounds of rge caribou herd it is also believed to be promising us oil prospect seismic studies and drilling outside the restricted area have led to estimates of good chance of finding significant quantities of economically recoverable oil however because of the wide range of estimates and probabilities associated with finding oil ther is good deal of uncertainty in addition to oil estimates there are number of controversial environmental issues being debated for broader and

bernard gelb and pamela baldwin ocs leasing and revenues the outer continental shelf ocs moratoria which prohibit leasing on most federal offshore lands have been an important issue in the debate over energy security and the potential availability of additional domestic oil andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22313crs4 gas resources congress has approved the moratoria for each of fiscal years 19822006 in the annual interior appropr iations bill the offshore leasing moratoria began with the fy1982 interior appropriations act pl 97100 which prohi bited new leases offshore of california the imposition of other moratori came about after many coastal states and environmental groups contended that leasin g tracts in environmentally sensitive areas might lead to activities that could cause econo mic or irreversible environmental damage eventually the moratoria were expanded to include new england the georges bank the midatlantic the pacific northwest much of alaska and portion of the eastern gulf of mexico because of envir onmental and economic concerns congress for the past two decades has supported annual moratoria on leas ing and drilling in the ocs this proposal would affect states along the atlantic and pacific coasts the gulf of mexico and alaska the house resources committees budget reconciliation package would have imposed statutory leasing prohibition th rough june 30 2012 on the ocs areas currently under moratoria and revoke the 1998 clinton l easing prohibition that covers the same period states could opt out of the leas ing ban and receive 40 over time of ocs revenues after june 30 2012 states could petition for five year moratorium extensions for ocs areas within 125 miles of their coastlines states with offshore energy development have been seeking to receive di rect share of the federal revenues generated by those activities currently the affected st ates receive some revenue from offshore oil and gas leases in federal waters this is in c ontrast to states with onshore leases on federal lands which receive 50 direct share of the oil and gas leasing revenues the possibility of oil and gas production in offshore areas covered by the moratoria has sparked sharp debate in congress proposal to require th department of the interior to conduct comprehe nsive inventory of ocs oil nd natural gas resources drew heated opposition although it was ultimately in cluded in the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 section 357 opponents of the oc s inventory saw it as first step toward lifting the ocs leasing moratoria the h ouse resources budget reconciliation package would have also repealed the inventory requi rement for more deta ils on ocs issues see crs issue brief ib10149 outer continental shelf debat over oil and gas leasing and revenue sharing by marc
