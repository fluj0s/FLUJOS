decision which gave the court little paus and was unanimous likewise the courts decision strongly suggests that there is simple fix that would make cair acceptable to the court this leaves epa with three clear long term options 1 starting anew with new strategy with respect to mitigating transported air pollution based on the decision 2 allowing the states to sort out the issue through section 126 petitions and 3 seeking new legislation providing epa with the statutory authority to impleme nt either cair in some form or an alternative for the states and nonattainment areas attempting to attain the naaqs the decision puts the focus on section 126 petitions as the available means to address interstate transport of air pollutants for congress the decision raises several issues should the congress consider prov iding epa with the authority to implement cair or other costbased marketoriented approaches to address naaqs should the congress consider multipollutant legislation as supplement or substitute for the current regula tory regime at least for electric generating units should congress consider more comprehensive revision to the clean air act to address the full scope of ozone and pm25 naaqs nonattainment and related issues as well as mercury emissions from coalfired powerplants and emerging environmental issues such as climate

ozone and pm standards but the promulgation of the revised ozone naaqs and the new pm25 naaqs meant that the sips of most states were longer adequate to bring those states into attainment by the statutory deadlines under secti on 110k5 of the act if epa finds sip inadequate it must require the affected state to submit revised sip that includes sufficient measures to bring that state in to

the act recognizes this and requi res that those upwind states control major sources of pollution that affect other st ates under section 110a2d sips must include adequate provisions to prevent

the majority of eastern states epa issued the clean air interstate rule cair in ma rch 2005 to mitigate the problem cair was based on series of determin ations by epa with respect to pollution transport cost effective pollution control and compliance feasibility these determinations were made within the state implementation pl an process of sections 110k5 and 110a2d of the clean air act significant contribution the pivotal finding by epa in the rule is that so2 and nox emissions from 23 states and the district of columbia contribute to unhealthy levels of fine particles in downwind states and nox emissions in 25 eastern states and the district of columbia contribute to unhealthy levels of ozone in downwind states this determination defined the geog raphic scope of the rule epa conducted series of modeling runs to determine the contribution various upwind states are projected to make to areas in the eastern united states projected by epa to be in nonattainment in 2010 and 2015 for ozone nonattainment significant contribution was defined by epa as the product of three factors 1 the actual amount of transported pollution fro m upwind states that contributes to nonattainment in downwind states 2 how often contributions over specific thresholds occur and 3 the compar ative amount of the upwind transported contribution to the total nonattainme nt situation in the downwind area10 for the ozone naaqs epa modeled the emissions impact of the 31 states east of or bordering the mississippi river on 40 easte rn downwind counties projected by epa to be in nonattainment in 2010 states whose maximum contri bution was estimated at less than 2 pa rts per billion ppb11 andor that contribute less than 1 to total nonattainment were screened out after evaluating the re maining eastern states on the three criteria 25 states and the district of columbia were found to make significant contribution to nonattainment12 these states constitute the region covered under the cair seasonal nox cap13httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34589crs5 13 continued summer season seasonal cap on emissions because ozone forms primarily through atmospheric reactions among nox

proposed interstate air quality rule p 4584for the pm25 naaqs epa modeled the emissions impacts of 37 eastern states on 62 eastern downwind counties projected by epa to be in nonattainment in 201014 because the controlling 1997 pm25 naaqs is an annual standard epa considered only two of the three factors in determin ing significant contribution actual amount of transported pollution and comparative amount15 in the proposed rule epa suggested that the threshold for dete rmining significant contribution be 015 micrograms per cubic meter µgm3 1 of the annual standard of 15 µgm3 in the final rule epa settled on 02 µgm3 as the threshold16 based on that threshold epa found 23 states and the district of columbia were projected to contribute significantly to 2010 pm25 nonattainment these states constitute the region covered under cairs annual nox and so2 caps regional capstate budget with determination of signifi cant contribution cair moves toward developing costeffective re medy arguing need to base its remedy on highly costeffective reductions epa examined the potential balance of local control to interstate controls along with the availability and timing of costeffective pollution control measures in upwind states projecting nonattainment areas in 2010 epa concluded in the proposed rule that for many pm25 nonattainment areas it would be difficult if not impossible to reach attainment unless transport is reduced to much greater degree and over much broader regional area than by the simultaneous adoption of local contro ls within specific nonattainment areas in addition we found that much of the air quality improvement that did occur in downwind areas with this st rategy was due to reductions in transported sulfate attributable to upwind so2 emissions17 epa conclusions with respect to ozone nonattainment areas we re less dramatic but still significant enough for epa to concl ude that further regional reductions were warranted18httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34589crs6 19 based on epa data for 2003 see http wwwepagovairt rendseconemissionshtml 20 clean air interstate rule p 25229calling for combination of local and interstate transport control epas cair rulemaking developed crite ria for determining highly costeffective transport control levels so2 and nox are emitted by variety of sources sulfur dioxide is primarily emitted by stationary sources particularly coalfired electric generators 69 of the total so2 emissions in 2003 and industria l combustion 14 of the total in 200319 in the case of nitrogen oxides mobile sources are the primary source 55 of the total in 2003 although sta tionary sources particularly electric generators 22 of the tota l in 2003 and industrial com bustion 14 of the total in 2003 make substantial contributions to the overall to tals generally arguing that electric generators provided the most costeffective emission reduction source and that data were lacking on other stationa ry sources epa focused on reductions from electric generators to determine emission caps in contrast for an earlier regional cap andtrade program the nox si p call promulgated in the late 1990s large industrial combustion sources were included in epas costeffectiveness calculations focusing on electric generators greater than 25 megawatts mw epa developed threshold for controlling transported pollutants by comparing the average and marginal costs of other so2 and nox regulatory actions along with other factors finding the electric generatin g control technologies to be highly costeffective epa determined the final regionwide caps for affected states by assuming these control technologies were inst alled on electric generators based on the assumption that states would solely target electric generators for control epa proceeded to determine the appropriate individual statewide emission budgets under the sip process states are not required to adopt an electricgenerator only strategy in complying with their emissions budgets however they must do so if they choose to participate in the ep asponsored regional tr ading program set up under the model rule interaction with th title iv program since 1990 epa has been implementing regional capandtrade program to control so2 emissions that cause acid rain unde r title iv of the clean air act because the title iv program is both stat utory and successful epa felt it needed to protect the program thus limiting its ability to suggest alternative allocation schemes for emission allowances under cair20 based on the assumption that states would solely target electric generators for control epa proceeded to determine cairs appropriate statewide emi ssion budgets by melding cair s allocation scheme into the existing title iv acid rain program with both programs based on electric generators one effect of this allocation scheme is to c ontinue the grandfathering of pre1990 existing plants under cair epa recognized this but argued that maintaining the integrity of the title iv program prevented it from pursuing alternative allocation schemes that might have provided relief to newly constructed sourceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34589crs7 21 environmental protection agency finding of significant c ontribution and rulemaking for certain states in the ozone transpor t assessment group

the dc circuit court of ppeals upheld with some modifications on march 3 2000 the rule required 21 eastern states22 and the district of columbia to submit state implementation plans sips to address regional transport of ozone under the 1997 1hour ozone standard which is why the rule is known as the nox sip call as issued the rule called for increased c ontrols on nox focusing particularly on emissions from electric utilities and large combustion sources to achieve the necessary reductions epa stipulated emissi on budgets for each of the affected states with each state free to decide on what controls to use to maintain emissions within those budgets epa also couraged the formation of regional cap and trade program to implement the nox reductions through model program which all participating states agreed to join unlike epas approach with the so2 program and despite its emphasis on using nox sip methodology in developing ca ir the annual cair nox capandtrade scheme differs

requires that petitions fo r review of such rules be filed within 60 days after the rule is promulgated in the federal register sources24 in cair arguing lack of data epa generally released the other stationary source components from the rule epa notes it had sufficient data in 1997 to propose nox sip call that included these sources but argues it didnt have sufficient data in 2005 to include these s ources in cair because of the increased geographic scope of cair and its inclusion of so225 the courts decision less than 32 petitions for review of cair were consolidated and decided in north carolina v epa the dc circuit found severa l of the key challenges valid noting that epa regards cair as one inte grated action the court decided against voiding only the successfully challenged portions rather it vacated the entire rule and its associated federal implementa tion plan and remanded it to epa with regard to north carolinas challenges the court ruled that cairs emissions trading program for so2 and nox violates caa section 110a2dii this provision addre sses downwind states such as north carolina whose achievement of naaqs is interfered with by emission sources in upwind states it requires sips to prohibit consistent with the provisi ons of caa title i governing stationary sources of emissions any s ource or other type of emissions activity within the state from emitting any air pollutants in amounts which will contribute significantly to nonattainment in or in terference with maintenance by any other state with respect to any naaqs the court found the cair trading progra m unlawful in assuring only that entire region will contribute significantly wh ile section 110a2dii requires that each states sources not contribute significantly for similar reasons the court noted that the nox sip calls emissions trading program might have been judicially invalidated had this argument been raised26 the court also found unacceptable that cair attributed significance to the interference withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34589crs9 maintenance prong of s ection 110a2dii indepe ndent of the contribute significantly to nonattainment prong as cair would have it only states that satisfy the nonattainment prong can also sa tisfy the maintenance prong rendering the latter nullity north carolinas final successful argument was that cairs 2015 deadline for upwind states to eliminate their significant contribution to downwind nonattainment again ignores section 110a 2dii that provision requires compliance consistent with title i which imposes compliance deadlines for downwind states in 2010 finally the cour t elected not to pass judgment on the lawfulness of the nox compliance suppl ement pool 200000 extra allowances as reward for early reductions though sugge sting that epa would need to revise it on remand as to the challenges by electric utility companies the court agreed first that epa had improperly set states budgets for so2 and nox in the cair emissions trading program for example in basing the budgets on the number of allowances that states egus receive under th caas acid rain program title iv the budgets fail to track the requirements of section 110a2dii above second the court found epas use of adjustment factors th at gave smaller budgets to states with mostly naturalgas or oilfired egus to be inconsistent with section 110a2dii as well and thus arbitrar and capricious third the court agreed with the utilities that epas effort to reconcile cairs regulation of so2 with the existing program for trading so2 allowances under title iv was unlawful the court found nothing in section 110a2dii or other law giving epa authority to as cair proposed remove some title iv allowances created by cair from the title iv market fourth the cour t approved minnesota powers argument that epa had overstated the states dow nwind contribution to pm25 thereby pushing the state over the threshold for inclusion in cair the argument said the court requires response from epa on remand north carolina v epa is an immersion in regula tory program detail involving little in the way of broad legal principles the court simply juxtaposed what the caa chiefly section 110 a2dii requires and what cair said and in several key respects found the latter deficient nor did the court feel obliged to defer to epas views possibly because it saw the caa chiefly section 110a2dii as speaking unambiguously to many of the issues raised by petitioners in response to the courts decision ep requested reconsid eration september 24 with suggestion for rehearing banc that is rehearing by the entire court grant of reconsideration is unusual however and rehearing banc even more so if such second chances are granted success is especially unlikely when the initial decision appeared to give the court little pause and was unanimous as with north carolina v epa petition for certiorari to the us supreme court is also possiblehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34589crs10 27 531 f3d at 901 28 id at 930 29 allowing even modest emissions trading can significantly reduce costs estimates made during the development of the acid

fatal flaws27 in the rule and concluded cairs flaws are deep amount of tinkering will transform cair as written into an acceptable rule28 rewrite would appear to require stronger link between the significant contribution to nonattainment posed by individual states and the controls placed on their emissions given that requirement it is unclear whether the agency can salvage the regional capandtrade approach which lies at the heart of cair or whether capandtrade on smaller scale whether intrastate or intracompany would face better odds29 problems facing nonattainment areas whatever path epa chooses to follow the areas designated nonattainment for ozone and pm25 significant portion of the eastern united states face choices of their own as of june 2008 132 million people in 293

the courts decision regarding cair similarly for ozone epa strengthened the naaqs in march 2008 this sets in motion new round of nonattainment ar ea designations and sip revisions even though 293 counties have not ttained the old standard with most sips to attain that old standard still under review by epa states are required to submit sips to epa outlining their strategy for complying with

implementa tion of cair would have met the intersta transport downwind state provision of section 110a2d the vacating of cair means that sips from downwind states may be inadequate because they assumed the cair reductions in interstate transport of pollutants sips from upwind states on the other hand could be inadequate if they dont prevent downwind nonattainment the clean air act ma kes clear that states are to impose controls on stationary sources of pollution that contribute significantly to downwind nonattainment or interfere w ith the maintenance of air quality standards in other states this provision of th statute has been widely disregarded in the past with little epa effort other than regional capandtrade programs to address it this reluctance to act can be challe nged through section 126 petitions section 126 petitions under section 126 of the clean air act which addresses in terstate pollution abatement33 any state or political subdivisi on may petition the epa administrator for finding that major source or group of sources is violating the acts prohibition of emissions contributing significantly to nonattainment or interfering with thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34589crs12 34 the prohibition is found in section 110a2di 35 sierra club v epa dc cir 061221 filed june 23 2006 36 2008 westlaw 2698180 30 37 for comparison of legislation see crs report rl34018 air quality multipollutant legislation in the 110th congres s by larry parker and john blodgettmaintenance of attainment in another state34 epa has 60 days to make finding in response to such petition if the adminis trator found that outofstate sources were significantly contributing to an areas nona ttainment the outofstate sources would have to shut down within three months unless epa imposed emission limits and compliance schedule of not more than three years epa has never granted section 126 pe tition in the manner outlined by the statute most recently it denied 2004 pe tition from the state of north carolina for several reasons in part arguing that cair was better mechanism for addressing the interstate transport of pollution to which north carolina was subject than was the states petition under section 126 north caro lina challenged this denial in court its challenge was stayed pending the outcome of the cair suit35 with the cair decision now made the court case involving epas denial of north carolinas petition can go forward and decision in north carolinas favor would seem much more likely the dc circuit decision in the cair case after determining that cair must be vacated in toto notes that downwind states retain their statutory right to petition for immediate relief from unlawful interstate pollution under section 12636 court finding in favor of north carolinas section 126 petition might therefore bring on an aval anche of section 126 petitions from other states impetus for multipollutant legislation the vacating of cair and companion ru targeting mercury the clean air mercury rule camr raises again the argument for multipollutant strategy with respect to the electric utility industry framework based on consistent set of emissions caps implemented through emissi on trading such an approach would not resolve all the issues surrounding cair pa rticularly if limited to the electric utility industry and would raise issues of its own how stringent should the emission caps be what is an appropriate schedule for their introduction how should they relate to existing caa provisions should carbon dioxide be included with so2 nox and mercury control programs currently there are several bills intr oduced in congress to impose emission caps on these four pollutants emitted by the electric utility industry37 the vacating of cair may increase focus on this approach conformity and sanctions the clean air act does not impose form penalties on nonatta inment areas for failing to attain air quality standards

natural resources defense council v epa 081250 dc cir filed july 15 2008implement adequate plans plans that identify emission control measures that when modeled show that the area will have reduced emissions sufficiently to reach the standards many of the most recent sips have with epa s approval counted on the reductions projected from implementati on of cair as noted earlier in the cair proposal epa stated it would be difficult if not impossible to reach attainment unless transport is reduced to much greater degree and over much broader regional area than by the simulta neous adoption of local controls within specific nonattainment areas38 without cair these sips would l onger demonstrate attainment they would need to be revised and resubmitted presumably epa will provide timetable for such submissions but if it does not do so or if the states fail to submit timely revisions the states could be subject to sanctions for failure to act sanctions can include temporary withholding of fede ral highway funds for new projects until an adequate sip is approved impact on new source review nsr the bush administration has made several attempts over the past five years to revise the new source review nsr pro cess under the caa several of these initiatives have invoked the expected emission reductions under cair as one justification for epas proposed or fina lized revision of nsr these initiatives include the proposed rule changing the emi ssions test used to determine whether modification by an electric utility generating unit results in it being subject to nsr and final rule on implementing nsr for the pm25 naaqs39 which was recently challenged in the dc circuit40 whether these initiatives can withstand the loss of cair without revisions is not clear mercury emissions although cair applied only to so2 and nox epa has made clear since it proposed the rule in 2003 that it expected the scrubbers and nox controls installed for cair compliance to be the means by which most electric utilities would reduce mercury emissions the agency did prom ulgate clean air mercury rule camr at the same time as cair through which it would have established

new jersey v epa 44 70 federal register 39137 july 6 2005in february 200841 thus the agency is left w ith controls on mercury emissions from powerplants coalfired powerplants are responsible for 42 of total us emissions of mercury according to epa and are by far the largest uncontrolled mercury emission source mercury pollution is wide spread it deposits in water bodies where it is converted to meth ylmercury and is take n up in the food chain42 the clean air act requires that major sources of rcury meet standards based on epas determination of the max imum achievable control t echnology mact available to such sources epa sought to avoi d imposing mact on coalfired powerplants by substituting the cair and camr c ontrol programs which it argued would produce more costeffective controls

conclusion unless reversed on further re view the court decision in north carolina v epa leaves epas strategy for achieving attainment of the ozone and pm25 naaqs in serious disarray cair was the lynchpin that held together the administrations strategy for attainment of the ozone and fine particulate naaqs for achieving reductions in mercury emissions from coalfi red powerplants for addressing regionalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34589crs15 haze impacts from powerplants and for re sponding to state petitions under section 126 of the clean air act with respect to the ozone and fine particulate naaqs epas only shortterm option other th an letting the decision stand was to appeal it step epa took on september 24 however it appears unlikely the dc circuit will review the decision which gave the court little pause and was unanimous likewise the courts decision strongly suggests that there is simple fix that would make cair acceptable to the court this leaves epa with three clear options 1 starting over with new strategy to mitigate transported air pollutants based on the decision 2 allowing the states to sort out the issue through section 126 petitions and 3 seeking new legislation providing epa with the statutory authority to either implement cair in some form or an alternative for the states attempting to attain the naaqs the decision clearly puts the focus on section 126 petitions as the availabl means to address in terstate transport of air pollutants for congress the decision raises several issues should the congress consider provi ding epa with the authority to implement cair or other costbas ed marketoriented approaches to address naaqs should the congress consider mu ltipollutant legislation as supplement or substitute for the curre nt regulatory regime at least for electric generating units should congress consider more comprehensive revision to the clean air act to addre ss not only ozone and pm25 naaqs non attainment but also mercury emi ssions from coalfired powerplants and emerging environmental issues such as climate change
