if circumstances warranthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30517asian financial crisis and recovry status and implications for us interests summary in terms of broad economic measurements the asian financial crisis largely has ended but the surprisingly swift recovery has left lingering economic and political problems that still could have negative effects on us interests the economies that suffered most from the crisis that began with the collapse of the thai baht in july 1997 have regained positive economic growth bolstered their trade positions sharply reduced interest rates and rebuilt their international financial reserves at the same time the recovery has been uneven and most of the imfassisted economiesthailand south korea and indonesiaalong with less affected southeast asian economies and the regional giants china and japan continue to suffer from serious problems of nonperforming debt and corporate governance many analysts worry that as growth increases and international reserves strengthen structural reforms will continue to be deflected by opposition from vested economic elites labor unions and populist massbased political parties one of the most striking initial consequences of the financial crisis was the revalidation and expansion of democratic governance whether these gains will be sustained and expanded depends on how effectively governments deal with the lingering socioeconomic effects of the crisis in indonesia for instance the democratic opening ushered in by the collapse of the authoritarian suharto regime remains fragile one in late february 2000 singapores finance minister described the question about indonesias political stability key uncertainty affecting the wider economic recovery of southeast asia the united states has suffered little evident economic harm from the crisis thus far but the effects on us regional political and security interests still could be substantial in the long run us prestige continues to be affected by the perception that the united states was dictating the imfs painful conditionality while itself contributing little in the way of direct bilateral financial assistance generally speaking the united states has not received much public credit for its role as the crucial market of first resort for the recovering economies japan on the other hand has earned plaudits for providing more than 30 billion in aid and export credits even though japans economic problems arguably contributed to and intensified the crisis because the crisis has tended to undermine the strength and solidarity of the association of southeast asian nations asean while leaving china relatively unscathed it also has created the potential for regional power shifts that could threaten us interests some indicators suggest that the socalled east asian economic model which relied on unrestrained debt and close governmentbusiness collusion is in retreat and that more transparen t more equitybased and more fully entrepreneurial economic model may be emerging at present however due to the use of public funds for bank recapitalization governments are even more heavily involved in many asian economies than in the past and powerful vested interests continue to fight rearguard action against needed structural reforms and efforts to reduce huge levels of nonperforming

problems raise number of us policy concerns concerning longer term regional economic prospects and regional stability scale and scope of the asian financial crisis of 1997 the sharp drop in currency values in the most affected countries had strong ripple effect in the broader east asian region both because of the accompanying slowdown in interregional economic activity and as consequence of the sudden loss of confidence of lenders and investors about the prospects for asian and other emerging market economies the four most troubled economiessouth korea thailand indonesia and malaysiatogether experienced net reversal of private capital flows amounting to an estimated 100 billion in the early part of the crisis or about four times the magnitude of the outpouring of funds in the mexican peso crisis of 199419952 moreover while the crisis struck hardest in the three countries that became the object of imf rescue packagesindonesia south korea and thailandmany other economies in asia experienced similar albeit less severe underlying problems of deteriorating trade positions falling asset prices due to speculative real estate investment and excess manufacturing capacity dangerous levels of nonperforming loans and related financial system fragility the effect of the asian financial crisis on the market economies of asia varied from severe in the cases of thailand south korea and indonesia to relatively mild in the case of the philippines which had only recently begun to increase its participati on in economic globalization and had comparatively wellregulated banking system in thailand where the crisis began the closure of 56 insolvent finance companies decimated the previously hyperactive real estate sector leaving hundreds of projects unfinished in south korea several major financial institutions and corporations went bankrupt or had to be saved from bankruptcy by governmental intervention and the economy suffered its worst decline since the 19501953 korean war in indonesia the collapse of the banking system and the net loss of 20 percent of gdp between 1997 and 1998 left the country economically prostrate and on the edge of political collapse malaysia adopted an imf type reform program even though it did not accept imf assistance and took the risky step of temporarily freezing capital exports even singapore with one of asias best managed economies and banking systems suffered net drop of almost 9 percent in yearonyear growth due to its significant dependance on regional marketshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30517crs3 3 some analysts saw the crisis as the outcome of failure by japan to address the root cause of its own economic and financial problems in effect it has been argued an economic bubble that built up in japan in the late 1980s and burst in the early 1990s reemerged in the rest of asia as result of the failure of the japanese ministry of finance mof and the bank of japan boj to take the necessary steps to liquidate hundreds of billions of dollars worth of nonperforming domestic loans rather than force japanese banks to sell assets to cover their losses or take the politically unpalatable step of using public funds for financial system bailout as the united states did to deal with its savings and loan crisis of the 1980s the mof initially allowed banks to disguise the decline of their assets by various accounting subterfuges and to continue to make profitable but risky loans to the fast growing asian economies by one account japanese lending to asia alone rose from 40 billion in 1994 to 265 billion in 1997 much of it for speculative property investment and other doubtful purposes other analysts find the japanese connection circumstantial at best and note that european and american banks were also large lenders to asia martin feldstein japans folly drags asia down 6 wallstreet online service nov 26 1997 douglas ostrom japan and the asian economic crisis part of the solution or part of the problem japan economic institute jei report 8a feb 27 1998 36china vietnam and other nonmarket economies of asia suffered less due to the maintenance of fixed currency exchange rates and with the notable exception of china small exposure to global markets except for china which has successfully practiced what it calls market socialismthis was small blessing since the other nonmarket countries of asia had not shared in the prior decades of high growth experienced by their marketoriented neighbors moreover all of the nonmarket countries experienced some slowdown in growth as result of the general decline in intraasian trade and investment the crisis also hit japan hard since japanese banks held the largest share of nonperforming loans in south korea and southeast asia among other effects the crisis caused decline in exports to south korea and southeast asia and left japanese manufacturing facilities in the region with mounting losses and idled capacity this further exacerbated an ongoing financial sector meltdown japans biggest problems predated the crisis however and in some ways helped to precipitate it3 moreover tokyos inability to get its own economy moving has largely eliminated its ability to serve as an engine of regional recovery deep social and political impact the financial crisis and related economic contraction imposed harsh social cost on the most affected economies the impact varied from countrytocountry but in general it hurt the urban poor and middle classes more than the residents of rural areas in the most developed crisis country south korea and in the cities of the developing countries of southeast asia especially bangkok and jakarta distress was the most palpable because the value of many tropical cash crops are determined by world prices the currency devaluations tended to raise the incomes of farmers relative to their urban counterparts many urban workers in southeast asia returned at least temporarily to the villages from which they had once come looking for better life an option that south koreans workers generally did not have due to their countrys more advanced state of development conversely because of south

and indonesia lacked both the means and the necessary administrative infrastructure to provide much income or consumption support serious impact on living standards although it now appears that incomes in the crisis countries did not fall as much as was initially estimated the social impact was serious in every affected county the world bank calculated in mid1999 that in south korea the incidence of urban poverty more than doubled in the months after the crashfrom 86 percent in 1997 to 192 percent in 1998and that the overall urban standard of living declined by 216 percent the bank estimated that in indonesia the percentage of the population living below the nationally established poverty line nearly doubledfrom 110 percent before the crisis to 199 percent afterwardand that the overall standard of living fell by 244 percent or almost onefourth rural areas in west java and some other parts of indonesia were also affected during 1997 and early 1998 by severe ninoinfluenced drought which added to the general economic distress and created widesprea d hunger in thailand by contrast the crash appears to have mainly affected the urban middle classes who are still relatively small proportion of the total population with the effect that the overall incidence of nationally defined poverty increased only moderately from 110 to 129 percent between 1997 and 1998 while overall incomes dropped by 136 percent4 because of certain characteristics of asian social systems and labor markets unemployment levels do not reveal the true depth of the crisis in 1999 yearend assessment and forecast the world bank found that because of the flexibility of southeast asian labor markets ie willingn ess to work for subsistence wages if necessary incomes fell further than actual employment in indonesia by this account employment actually rose slightly after the crisis while wages fell by 42 percent5 reinforcement of democratic trends contrary to what some anticipated the sharp fall in incomes generally did not foster serious political instability except in the case of indonesia where the crisis led to the forced resignation of president suharto after more than 30 years of authoritarian rule and to the first free elections since the mid1950s the political reverberations of the crisis were felt everywhere however in some degree in all of the affected countries the crisis tended to accelerate existing challenges to the political status quogenerally but not always in the direction of greater democracy and transparency in thailand whose currency collapse

1932with provisions aimed at reducing political corruption increasin g accountability and transparency and establishing minimum educational credentials for elective office notably the army kept to the background but lent its weight to adoption of the new constitution as did the king who wields great influence in malaysia the crisis contributed to the acceleration of political succession struggle that has not yet fully played itself out in south korea the crisis further tarnished the image of the thenruling party and gave boost to the presidential campaign of the kim dae jung his election in december 1997 was widely viewed as strengthening democratization in south korea because of his longstanding reputation as an opposition leader kim has enjoyed considerable freedom of action and reserve of good will that has allowed him to pursue policies that adversely affect number of vested interests including the chaebol conglomerates and organized labor kim faces number of serious political and economic problems including an oppositioncontro lled national assembly and resistance from the chaebol and labor unions to restructuring the most dramatic political reaction occurred in indonesia where food riots mob violence against businesses owned by the ethnic chinese minority and university based antigovernment protests grew steadily after the initial collapse of the indonesian currency in late 1997 street demonstrations against governmental corruption and in favor of democratization forced president suharto from office on may 21 1998 his handpicked vicepresident b j habibie set in motion process that led to democratic elections in june 1999 the first such open elections since 1955 and violencemarred referendum that led to independence for east timor following intervention by peacekeeping forces acceptance of the need for greater economic openness the crisis also surprised some observers by generally reinforcing preexisting trend towards greater openness to the global economy despite sometimes harsh criticisms of foreign investors and lenders the imfs initial fiscal austerity requirements and perceived us dominance of the international economic system the wrath of most asians was turned more at their own leaders economic managers and corporations than at the impersonal forces of economic globalization in general asians appear to have accepted reluctantly in many cases that their economic salvation will have to come mainly from adopting reforms aimed at more transparency in the management of their economies more prudential financial sector behavior and better corporate governance the willingness however reluctant to accept the imfs policy conditionality rather than oppose it appeared to go handinhand with public support for political leaders who promised to end abuses such as favoritism towards wellconnected individuals and corporations generally referred to as crony capitalismand the desire to punish those associated with

management while also imposing controls on capital flight the comparatively mild reaction to the downside of economic globalization in asia thus far may also reflect the fact that until the crisis the growing involvement of east asian countries in world markets generally had been viewed as been beneficial by the affected populations in many asian countries authoritarian leaders justified their rule by delivering the benefits of rapid economic growth and rising living standards gains that would not have been possible without attracting foreign manufacturing investment and plugging into world markets opposition to globalization has tended to come mainly from nongovernmental organizations ngos that champion causes such as workers rights and environmentalism agendas that have received relatively weak public support the markets of the crisis countries had remained comparativ ely closed to all but capital goods high technology and industrial inputs such as chemicals and raw materials thus following path of openness to foreign capital and technology generally had produced more gains than losses in terms of domestic economic interests and employment also after what were perceived as some initial missteps in the direction of excessive fiscal austerity the imf moved relatively quickly to loosen its constraints to allow deficit spending to bolster consumption and provide social safety net indonesia and thailand successfully bargained with the imf to allow progressive increases in countercyclical deficit spending while accepting other aspects of the imf reform program current

indonesia is the flight of ethnic chinese capital in the wake of the financial collapse and antichinese riots various accounts estimate the size of the capital outflow from tens of millions to over 100 million some of this capital flow may have been facilitated by large loans made to wellconnected borrowers during the recapitalization of the failing banks loans that were not covered by real assets in other cases ethnic chinese families and business interests simply left the country with what liquid capital remained after the collapse of their businesses whatever the source of the funds and whatever the method of sending them abroad most analysts judge that ethnic chinese indonesians and others with capital outside the country do not yet see the time as ripe for returning to indonesia and reinvesting their capital two reasons are cited in particular by analysts first political uncertainties weigh heavily in the minds of the ethnic chinese who were the targets of scapegoating and mob violence during may 1998 riots leading up to the resignation of president suharto and they dont want to be victimized again21 the wahid government has taken number of steps to provide reassurance including allowing open celebrations of the lunar new year for the first time in several decades but one can guarantee that this new era of tolerance will continue second both ethnic chinese and other absent owners of property and bank loans who are in default on their obligations may not want to come to the attention of creditors or government prosecutors seeking to

unemployment problem are likely to continue to act as political brake on structural reforms on the more positive side even with its imperfections and opportunities for corruption the democratic process and the accompanying institution of free press still provide more transparency and accountability than the previously prevailing authoritarian models further supporters of democratization note that elections are only one part of the process to live up to its promise democratic processes must be accompanied by reform of the justice system and imposition of the rule of law improvements in other institutions of governance and the development of civil society all of these objectives are included in the assistance programs of the imf the world bank and the asian development bank and the bilateral aid programs of the united states and other donor countries but they are very difficult to implement due to the power of vested interests and deeply ingrained practices declining imf and other multilateral bank influence progress towards broader reforms has been slow in most asian crisis countries below the level of fiscal and other macroeconomic policies the imf and other international financial institutions are finding it difficult to make much headway pushing for structural and corporate governance reforms some analysts judge that thailand and indonesia are simply too large for the imf to abandon even if they fail to follow through with needed reforms although the imf has several times suspended support to indonesia on account of insufficient progress towards reform and has periodically criticized slow progress in other countries some analysts argue that now that the most immediate liquidity crisis is over and most affected countries have built up comfortable international reserves imf leverage is declining30 some accuse the past actions of the international financial institutions of being part of the problem in number of countries activist

despite signs of general economic recovery us interests continue to be affected by several lingering aspects of the crisis asian doubts about us leadership and intentions first while the crisis underscored the continuing importance of us influence over the international financial system and of the us market the countries of the region perceive that the united states has been more ready to exert its leverage over the imf than to contribute resources at the time of thailands initial foreign exchange crisis the us treasury department appeared to view the issue as regional matter of little significance to the us or global economy and declined to deploy financing available in the exchange stabilization fund32 subsequently in early 1998 the united states announced some 17 billion in trade credits and aid but thais still tend to see the united states treaty ally as failing them in their moment of greatest need33 the clinton administration took more serious view of the crisis when it appeared in late 1997 that south korea the worlds 11th largest economy might default on international loans amounting to tens of billions of us dollars the administration provided about 5 billion in accelerated funding in support of the imfs 57 billion rescue package and helped negotiate the rollover of 15 billion in international loans that were coming due in early 199834 despite its role as the largest shareholder in the imf and significant albeit minor aid donor us assistance to the crisis countries compared unfavorably with sizeable japanese loans to south korea and tokyos 30 billion

instability second while the crisis has brought about some creative destruction and tended to foster further democratization it has also led to significant increase in instability this is particularly true in the case of indonesia the worlds fourth largest country with critical geostrategic location astride major trade routes ethnic and religious riots in the tiny and distant molucca islands and separatist agitations in aceh on the large island of sumatra have taken thousands of lives in the past year in early february 2000 the government of abdurrahman wahid found itself in standoff with the former head of the indonesian military general wiranto who had refused demand that he resign his position as coordinating minister for defense and security based on recent findings that he played direct role in human rights abuses in east timor wiranto subsequently was fired analysts have speculated that indonesia will not be able to regain stability and attract foreign investment and loans until it has resolved the issue of what role the military will play in the state36 weakened asean third the crisis has tended to weaken the cohesiveness of the association of southeast asian nations asean and raise the profile and influence of china while some economists argue that official chinese exchange rates have little real significance and that the chinese yuan effectively has been declining in unofficial exchange markets beijing has received considerable credit in the region for holding the line on the yuan at the same time number of chinas neighbors notably taiwan and southeast asian claimants to disputed islands and atolls in the south china sea have sensed growing chinese selfconfidence and readiness to flaunt its military might continued nationalistic resistance to foreign ownership of assets fourth while asian countries have not rejected economic globalization and continue to welcome foreign investment of the traditional jointventure type the crisis has done little to reduce resistance to foreign ownership of national assets few high profile deals seem to signify change such as newbridge capital ltds purchase of korea first bank and semiconductor plant in

of more entrepreneurial and more marketoriented economic model in east asia even as the states role deepens in the older industrial economies as result of bank recapitalizations combination of pressures from economic globalization and political obstacles to fundamental reform have in some areas sparked new independent entrepreneur ial initiative japans financial sector big bang financial sector deregulation and similarly incomplete efforts towards financial and economic liberalization in other asian countries appear to have been enough to spark movement towards more reliance on equity
