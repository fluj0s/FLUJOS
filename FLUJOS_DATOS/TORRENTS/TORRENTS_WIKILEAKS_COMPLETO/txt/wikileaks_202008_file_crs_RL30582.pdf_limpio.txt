advocacy these organizations did not meet federal election campaign act feca criteria for political committees the lack of federal oversight of certain 527 organizations political activities attracted

how the differences in tax and election laws permitted certain organizations to engage in issue advocacy without public disclosure and proposals for change section 527 of the internal revenue code defines political organization and specifies how political organizations and other taxexempt organizations which make political expenditures are taxed the federal election campaign act feca 2 usc 431 et seq was enacted to regulate federal elections by imposing certain contribution limits and reporting and disclosure requirements on various persons feca defines political committee and specifies the reporting and disclosure requirements that these committees must follow for tax purposes virtually all political organizations are section 527 political organizations while most 527 organizations report to the federal election commission fec prior to the enactment of pl 106230 only those with taxable income reported to the internal revenue service irs in recent years political activists formed 527 organizations which did not have to disclose their activities to either the fec or the irs by structuring their activities so that they did not engage in express advocacy and had taxable income these organizations did not meet feca criteria for political committees and did not trigger the return requirements of the internal revenue code the first section of this report compares the prior tax law and election law definitions and disclosure requirements of political organization and political committee to illustrate how organizations engaging in issue advocacy could avoid reporting to either the fec or the irs the second section of the report summarizes the proposals to increase public disclosure of the activities of and contributors to these organizations background section 527 of the internal revenue code was enacted in 1975 by pl 93625 to clarify the tax treatment of political organizations section 527 covers the tax treatment of all political organizations whether they are at the federal state or local level whether they are parties pacs or candidate committees the federal election campaign act of 1971 pl 92225 was enacted in 1972 feca is intended to prevent corruption in federal elections section 301d of feca defines political committee for purposes of regulating federal elections although the concepts are similar the definitions of political organization and political committee are not identical the congressional reports associated with the enactment of irc 527 didhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30582crs2 1 srept 931357 hrept 931642 1974not mention feca1 the only concern was how the internal revenue service should treat political organizations the prior law version of irc 527 treated political organizations as taxexempt for purposes of any federal law referring to taxexempt organizations it provided that as long as their money was only used for political purposes 527 organizations were not taxed on contributions of money or property membersh ip dues fees or assessments proceeds from political fundraising or entertainment events proceeds from sales of political campaign materials providing the organization is not in the business of conducting such events or selling such materials and proceeds from conducting bingo games political organizations were and are taxed on investment income capital gains and on any expenditures which are not for political purposes irc 2501a5 provides that transfers of money or other property to political organization are not subject to gift taxes unlike 527 organizations organizations exempt under irc 501a which make political expenditures of more than 100 per year are taxed on the lesser of their net investment income or their political expenditures this provision gives exempt organizations an impetus to make political expenditures through 527 organization comparison of irc 527 and feca the first part of this report compares the definitions and reporting requirements of political organizations

name telephone number public disclosureform 3x is public form 1120pol is confidential breadth of definit ions the first striking difference between political organizations and political committees is that the tax law definition is much broader than the election law definition feca only applies to federal elections irc 527 applies to federal state and local elections as well as to the selection nomination or appointment of an individual to federal state or local public office groups which want to influence the selection of federal and state judges and groups that want to encourage state governor to select particular individuals to the state cabinet could be political organizations under the tax laws even though these activities are not covered by feca organizations covered both definitions encompass separate segregated fund which could be an organization as informal as separate bank account political organization includes party or any of its subdivisions the political committee definition only refers to local committee of political party this appears to be because political party is separately defined in 2 usc 43116 under the tax law newsletter fund of federal state or local officeholder can be political organization newsletter funds are not specifically mentioned by feca newsletter funds of federal officeholders who are candidates for reelection could come within the definition of political committee if certain monetary thresholds are met but newsletter funds of state or local officeholders would not be covered by feca candidates covered both statutes contemplate candidate for public office only candidates for elective federal public offices are covered by feca the tax code covers candidates for elective and appointive state local and federal offices the feca definition of candidate status turns on having collected or spent certain amount of money the tax definition is triggered by an individuals public announcement of candidacy for the office providing the individua l meets thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30582crs6 2 for an explanation of soft money see crs issue brief ib98025 campaign finance constitutional and legal issues of soft

political organization or to be candidate reporting requirements the information collected under the two reporting requirements was almost mutually exclusive under the campaign laws political committees report contributions and expenditures to the federal election commission under the tax laws political organization did not report contributions and expenditures for an exempt function ie influencing the selection nomination election or appointment of an individual to public or political office to the internal revenue service only investment income and expenses were reported and taxed political organizations which spent their contributions as fast as they were collected or which parked their contributions in noninterestbearing checking accounts may not have had any taxable income only organizations with taxable income were required to file with the irs on form 1120pol reports to the fec on form 3x are public information irs form 1120pol was confidential political committees which escape fec reporting requirements either because their activities do not cross the dollar thresholds or because their activities are not aimed at federal elections could avoid public disclosure of their contributions and expenditures use of 527 organizations to funnel soft money2 in december 1996 the irs published the first of series of private letter rulings3 which provided blueprint for setting up an entity which would qualify as political organization under irc 527 but would not have any expenditures or activities prohibited by or reportable under feca basically the activities that the organizations seeking the letter rulings planned to engage in were voter education activities which were intended to influence the outcome of an election but which did not expressly advocate the election of particular candidate and grassroots lobbying on particular legislative issues fec regulations 11 cfr 1144c4 and 5 permit the preparation publicizing and distribution of congressional voting records and voter guides on federal elected officials and candidates the irs rulings deemed enough of these activities to be for an exempt function ie political function to qualify the organization as political organization under irc 527 but the fec does not deem these reportable activities 11 cfr 1145e after these rulings became public tax and election law advisers realized that 527 organizations could be used to collect unlimited amounts of soft money for issue advertising in connection with elections that the names of contributors to 527 organizations with reportable activities under the election laws could remain secret and that donors could transfer an unlimited amount of money to 527 organizations free of gift taxes for these reasons 527 organizations were superior to 501c4 organizations as soft money vehicles these three facts contributed tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30582crs7 rapid acceleration of the use of 527 organizations to finance soft money activities proposals for change on january 28 2000 the staff of the joint committee on taxation released its threevolume study of presentlaw taxpayer confidentiality and disclosure provisions as required by section 3802 of the internal revenue service restructuring and reform act of 1998 jcs100 in volume ii study of disclosure provisions relating to taxexempt organizations httpwwwhousegovjctpubs00html particularly pages 9498 the staff recommended that irc 6104 be amended to require political organizations to disclose their 1120pol s and annual returns if any that political organizations be required to file an annual return even if they had taxable income that the annual return be revised to include more information about the organizations activities and that form 990 be amended to gather more information about the transfer of funds among various exempt organizations so that the public and the irs can better assess whether contributions to exempt organizations are being used to fund political activities on april 7 2000 common cause released report under the radar the attack of the stealth pacs on our nations elections

political committees information would be publicly available organizations which only attempt to influence state or local elections appointments to state or federal offices or the selection of

the documents the exemption from the gift tax of transfers to political organizations in excess of 10000 per year would only apply to organizations in compliance with the reporting requirements hr 4621 the accountability and disclosur act of 2000 hr 4621 would amend feca and the communications act of 1934 to require any person ie the bill applies to more than just 527 organizations who spend 10000 or more in year for advertisements that mention federal officeholder or federal candidate by name or by picture to disclose the names of contributors of at least 1000 the feca amendments apply to nonbroadcast communication s when the reporting thresholds are triggered the entity must include in the advertisement its name address and telephone number or its internet site which must contain the same information upon request the entity must provide the following information within 24 hours of the request name address and telephone number of officers and directors if any otherwise the same information about the person responsible for the communication the name of each person who provided at least 1000 to the entity during the calendar year along with the amount provided penalties are not specified in the bill but existing penalties in 2 usc 437g would apply potential civil and criminal penalties are similar to those described below the communications act amendments would apply similar requirements to broadcast communications video programmers and multichannel video program distributors and require that the entity furnish similar information about itself and its contributors to the broadcast station and that the station post the information on its internet site the communications act violations would be enforced by civil money penalties up to the greater of 5000 or the

advertisement andor imprisonment for up to one year hr 4717 the full and fair political activity disclosure act of 2000 hr 4717 as reported by the committee on ways and means would require newly
