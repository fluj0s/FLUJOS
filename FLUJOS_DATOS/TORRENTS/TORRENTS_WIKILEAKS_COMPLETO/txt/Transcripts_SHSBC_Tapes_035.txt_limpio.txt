period auditor effect on meter lecture given on 19 july 1961 thank you this is the what audience voices july 18th 19th eighteenth audience 19th i thought you were wrong i just got one of my motorcycles back out in the garage out there and so i didnt know the date thats sufficiently non sequitur nineteen july 1961 ad 11 all right now ive been giving you lot of information but i havent given you any opportunity to ask any questions we always assume at times like these that youve gotten up to point where youve found out you dont know something this is of course rare and strange occasion when this occurs but is there anything that i could help you out with any questions yes female voice why does stage four needle do what what is stage four needle female voice not what is it why does it do that particular thing instead of just sitting at clear or doing something else instead of just sitting at clear female voice yes or doing just so long why is it that in every case with person in that condition has exactly the same sort of movement why does he always have this stage four needle is that right female voice why is the why is the movement constant yeah why is that movement constant thats what i meant yeah well now of course youre asking for surmise now i can only give you surmise stage four needle of course is one which is unmistakable the tone arm setting has nothing to do with it usually however stage four needle will sit around clear read and therefore you should beware beware beware beware beware because the person is below clear its something like if he got long ladder and climbed for long time hed reach bottom this is the dead thetan case but the dead thetan case doesnt always have stage four needle the stage four needle is something that when you encounter it sometime or other will plague the living daylights out of you you dont see them too often but when you do run into them they are marvelous now the standard stage four needle that i have observed has about twoandahalf inch swing and it goes from well if youve got the tone arm set right itll sweep up from as youre looking at it the right side of the dial on the needle and itll sweep up here and it will stick there is stick thats what makes this quite different than free needle it sweeps up here and it sticks and then it drops back falling again to your right as you look at the thing and it just keeps doing that at just about this speed and thats all it ever does it just goes through that repetitive swing uuup stick fall uuup stick fall and that is the darndest thing you ever want to see because matter what you ask this pc matter if you hit him over the head with brickbat hell still have stage four needle in old times he comes under the heading of an unsolvable case you have so many things now that will resolve his case that its not particularly worrisome thing its just something that you shouldnt ever be in any illusion about you put somebody on an emeter heres where youll get into trouble you put him on an emeter and start to security check him haha have you ever raped your mother you know bang action have you ever put slugs in parking meter action have you ever breathed action its just that stage four needle just that stage four needle it just seems like it will go on forever its an electronic transfer what it is of energy in the mind and it is repetitive cycle and what you might call machine reaction and it is this person is not himself but is being machine always always they are not themselves at all that is to say theyre totally backed out of being human they distrust themselves to such degree that it is much safer to be machine now the oddity is is theyre so far down on this that the machine has an individual read not 25 tone arm read its liable to have any kind of read but as result machines are run by energy and what youre looking at is some kind of fancy doodad like an ac motor and its feeding its current on surge and then its reversing its flow and its feeding its current on surge and its reversing its flow and theres nothing going to disturb that except auditing anything in life could happen to this person and this machine will still go on on this charge line now that is surmise as that its current is running that way and reversing i myself have not observed this closely but i would say its very safe surmise because you can also get an alternating current read on pc if you ran black and white processing fast enough on pc youd get sixtycycle ac and you would over here in england fifty cycle but this is is just machine read machine facing its just the person isnt there he has responsibility for being there responsibility for his case doesnt have any responsibility for answering the auditing questions and whatever he thinks produces reaction at all upon his bank that he thinks thought has nothing to do with his bank he knows he can have effect on anything well there are too many ways to take this apart nowadays but the cchs if will always undercut it to some degree or another you can run one of these stage four cases on the cchs and get further than any other activity if in doubt but remember the common denominator of all cases as they worsen is less and less effect upon the bank and the bank has more and more effect upon them so getting them to think thought you see by an auditing command you say do this or do that well they think thought this then produces reaction upon the bank and they drive you sparky you know it doesnt matter how many auditing commands you think up you are not going to get any action even if the pc complies with them because of course the pc has effect upon his bank his thinkingness does not effect his bank the common denominator of all cases is the amount of effect the thetan has on his bank and that is gradient scale which runs from slightest effect all the way up to total easy effect on the bank and what you see at the bottom of the scale the reason you have clear read of course is the thetan has effect of any kind on the bank nothing disturbs anything there it sits of course youre just reading dead body and as you go up the scale by gradient he has more and more effect on the bank well now sooner or later hes going as you audit him hes going to start changing around the bank by the reason of what hes thinking and about this time youll see energy lines you will see ridges those generally show up before pictures and then they kind of pass out and he has lots of pictures and then you run into more energy masses and energy lines and the tone arm starts acting up like mad well what youre watching there is he has more effect on his bank now dont you see and eventually hes got enough effect on his bank that he can asis it and it gets up to point of bank and disturbing bank which is what you mean by clear all right now the stage four needle is retreat from bottom and when encountered your safest bet is always the cchs run exactly the way youre supposed to run them and so forth not thinkingness thing but an action thing however there are many other ways to take this apart and you will find that there are some buttons which are still open and the modern processes which you are doing in these three routines you always find some hole in the fence its problems its confusions its motion its leaving its something other you know theres something going to be open there someplace and you could keep tickling this spot in the fence and all of sudden youve got an entrance and thats about all it is you know on low case all you have to do is trigger an automaticity and then of course the case is undone because the automaticity is being run off by the auditor and the automaticity is what prevents the pc from having an effect on his own bank you as the auditor through triggering the automaticity are not ever actually asking the pc to do anything you see except not retreat thats the only thing you want him to do you want him to come to sessions and so forth and stage four is exception to these particular lines but if you were to open up on case and do case assessment on somebody and notice there was nothing on the meter whatsoever but this odd phenomenon of it rises the needle down here from where youd see on this old meter dial about 35 it goes back on up toward set sticks somewhere in there vicin that vicinity falls on down to 35 comes up sticks around set just about at the speed im talking now there is another spook stage four needle that i probably have never made any remarks about at all but that is turned on by the auditors statement and sometimes its very small and sometimes its large but it only occurs when the auditor says something actually youre turning it on and turning it off see by saying something or not saying something and it just doesnt matter what you say and you see this all the time this is very common this is third of the pcs that sits down in front of you have this ghost of stage four needle you say to him butter and you get little rise or little fall and rise and stick and fall or some combination of this sort youve got every time you speak you liven up the needle well thats you energizing the bank remember youre an electric eel and you can actually have on pcs more effect on the bank than the pc can something you have never learned something i have never been able to teach anybody they are always so sold on the idea the pcs totally responsible for it all that they dont realize that the auditor can just sit there and just actually push that bank around anyplace you know say be in the roman arena thank you now dont be in the roman arena be in the twentieth century thank you very much and the bank will just move because they cant see it they dont believe it see theyre not there then sitting looking at the picture of the roman arena which results and then maybe the pc is so occluded he doesnt see the picture of the roman arena that results but you an auditor can say something like that spear is now entering your right side and the pc gets somatic because its cinch someplace on the track spear has entered his right side and you say the somatic strip will now move to that part of the track where spear entered your right side and you get somatic youre very much in control of the situation and this other phenomenon will baffle you sometimes when youre doing security check and you open up the paper and do your security check and everything is fine and you start right in and you say to the person now are you on the moon something like that and you get boomp boomp tink and just for fun throw total non sequitur into the situation you see are bananas hot you see you get pzoomp tink get the same kind of reaction you say is the sky blue hmmm tink is your name george hmmm tink its you you see you are actually turning the reaction on it is the impact of your thinkingness and speakingness against the pc the pc isnt doing anything its just the fact that you are energizing the bank and then the emeter will read that energizing now i better clear up something here that hasnt been cleared up for quite while and that is what about these null questions to find out if theres needle reaction do you use these null questions today and do you pay any attention to them at all and the answer is you dont even have to ask them its always nice to know that the pc actually does respond and have lie reaction because its good case index you set some pcs down and when they say you say are you sitting in that chair and they say you get lie reaction well you know this pcs in pretty good shape well you say youre on the moon are you on the moon he says and you get lie reaction oh oh oh oh oh oh its way of indexing case dont you see its whether the case has any reaction or has reverse reaction or has proper lie reaction now of these the lowest reaction is when the pc is energized every time the auditor speaks and if youre seeing needle that every time you say something goes whir plunk you know or does something dont get an idea the pcs getting fall on it you just say are bananas hot and the needle goes whirr clunk and you say are you on the moon and the pc says and so on but that has nothing to do with what the pcs saying has nothing whatsoever to do with it you just say well now you shut up for moment and im just going to ask you few questions just to read it out on the meter and then you say well are bananas hot are you on the moon do automobiles have motors cheesecake each time youve said something you get the whir clink clink its nothing hes thinking in other words youre not reading the pcs reaction now if the pc is in security check the moment that you start to security check pc his level of interest rises and creates an emergency level and thereafter your needle rides straight so dont avoid reaction on an emeter needle just because the pc has one of these automatic response things on the needle at first because the second youre asking him meaty questions that he feels he might be caught out on he longer has that reaction hes right there pitching i dont care how low toned he is you see tethuooh ooh have you ever stolen any money wah well lets see i mmmm and youve got him in session and so that any reaction on security question that might be meaningful is always taken by the auditor as factual and you will never go wrong providing its an instant read so your null questions are just some kind of goofball case index and thats all they serve as anymore but any time you start asking whole series of questions that are non sequitur and have nothing to do with the case of course youre liable to get some kind of well youre liable to get an impulse reaction because you see the pc knows it has nothing to do with the case it seems silly to him and hes not taking any responsibility for the answer and if hes at level where the moment he just thinks of irresponsibility or it has nothing to do with the moment this is triggered why then after that you are moving the emeter around you got the idea but the second youre on something thats meaningful that might have something to do with him why it will behave just like any other emeter now im not sure that stage four needle at this time will behave that way or not but i tell you that its high probability that it will behave any time you hit the button because theyve got withholds by the avalanche got it so any reaction on an emeter mary sue has had little bit of hard time pushing this across occasionally so ill help her out here any reaction on an emeter when meaningful question is asked and thats any question on security check that might have might have something to do with the pc not just null nonsense questions is taken by the auditor as factual providing it is an instant read and an instant read is immediately factually instantly followed up by the auditor and latent read or latent reaction is totally ignored the only thing youre interested in is did the meter react instantly when i asked the question in spite of this other oddball phenomena youll find out that you wont go wrong if youll always investigate that instant read an instant read must occur within onetenth of second of asking the question anything that occurs later than that is neglected by the auditor now is there any judgment involved there well yes there is yes there is because i cannot guarantee the meter on which you are working unless its british mark iv or an american i cant guarantee the meter and lot of these meters squirrel meters and so forth have lag im not trying to sell meters or run down meters or anything im just warning you that they do have lag some of the early organization meters circa 1954 55 had lag built into them which made think that battery meters were good and then i found out everybody had been working day and night to build this lag into the meter and the meter did not respond for from onehalf to one second after the question was asked and if youre foolish enough to audit on some old decrepit affair that was made by the buggywhip companies or something you had better establish whether or not it has lag in its read and of course that would throw out this instantread law at once because the lag is in the meter not in the pc all right now what about three quarters of second well lets not get picky about this shall we three quarters of second well thats an instant read see because the lag is introduced by the length of the question you got the idea the length of the question and the difficulty in digesting the sense of the question and the sense of the question sometimes doesnt come home for half second after youve stopped talking got the idea thats got to come home before it can be even acted on in the bank but its just about as close to instant as you can get dont you see now definitely from second on and up let it drop man skip it get away from that horse because it has nothing to do with the question and so forth you can do great deal for the pc you can clear up enormous sections of his life you can clear up all of his relatives you can give security check to all the teachers hes ever had you can do all sorts of oddball things but youre not giving this pc security check thats what the main criteria is do you understand so by latent read we mean anything we dont mean anything after tenth of second by latent read we mean from one second plus thats one second plus and that would even apply to an old buggywhip meter if theres takes second or more for that needle to react in response to your question hohum brother hohum and i think youve been using that rather consistently most of you here and youve been getting along just dandy with it havent you audience mmhm yes and before when you were using latent reads you were just having one awful time right audience mmhm yes it took 139 hours to clear question 18 you know every time you ask have you stolen anything you would get long silence on the part of the pc and then little motion with the needle and you say what was that and he says well let see what could that have been well i thought actually of my aunt grace my aunt grace once kept rats and i think once she stole rat i am not sure so you say well all right thats fine all right have you ever stolen anything three four seconds go by and then fall what was that well it actually wasnt stealing i guess but i was on bus one time and the conductor gave too much change and there were lot of people and so i gave him the change back and corrected the change and gave him the right change even though hed given oh what the hell are we doing see what is all this about man well its not situate in the reactive mind and the basic characteristic of the reactive mind is instantaneousness the reactive mind has time in it and as result if you ask question that is going to be real to the pc that is to say if he can see that deep into his reactive mind and so that response can be energized you will get it instantly and thats the difference between an instant and latent read and not knowing this difference can louse you up on doing security check just from here on out youll have hundredhour security check every time you turn around you just dont ever get any security checking done its got to be an instant read well ive told you an awful lot about meters there extraneous to stage four needle but there it is okay yes male voice ron what has the velocity of fall got to do with it in other words the needle just rides nothing male voice slowly nothing male voice oh okay velocity of fall has nothing to do with nothing dont worry about velocities of falls or recoveries or the square root of the god of the god ohm im not making fun of your question bob male voice it has nothing to do with it im glad you brought it up because this rumor is always brooding about and were always hearing this that something about velocities of fall or repetitiveness of fall or thises of falls or that of reaction and so on and they dont have anything to do with it pc who is situated and has been living in glue for the last hundred trillennia is for sure going to get slow fall but velocity of fall cant be watched ill tell you more precisely why it cant have anything to do with it is because it can be altered by the setting of the meter so the second you can alter something by the setting of the meter then you cant calibrate anything against it so the devil with it okay male voice right thank you all right yes male voice whats the purpose of the what represents and how could you help questions in the joburg and do you have to null them you know what represents yourself how could you help your family questions like that is that still in form 3 female voice thats still in form 3 well now whats the question male voice well whats the purpose of them in security check whats the purpose of them in the security check nothing male voice do you have to null them its something like there are lot of people have nerves that go back underneath their lungs ill tell you where this comes from and this nerve channel passes actually underneath the lung and according to darwin this is all hangover got it im not making fun of your question im telling you this is fact this is fact and youll find lot of bricabrac of structure well like boats i was quite interested to recognize the other day on the subject of boats that the first boat was log and ill be of gun if the queen mary isnt still dragging log its now the keelson they have never moved off of this log the first boat was log of course with this caveman straddling the thing and paddling it and so help pete its still in the queen mary another thing is raft is three logs at least and so help pete theyve still got three logs in them theyre chines and the keelson there are eightthousand million ways of hanging boat together that have nothing to do with these logs but theyre still there i was i was quite interested in it thats darwin too he talks about these things and this check originally was an employment check and it was one of these things that was going to do everything and all in one package one of the things it was going to do was select out executives male voice well i know how it got there i put it in there but i was wondering i wondered how long it would take him to realize that well now why did you build the queen mary out of log thank you jack you can strike them you dont have to null them they have nothing to do with the price of fish or apples but that is basically remember now jack security check that is still security check even though it is used for processing it still serves organizations for various purposes and until theres proper organizational check and until purely processing checks are written that one will have to do but its just stopgap okay male voice yes thank you all right thats good security check by the way yes male voice yesterday you said that you told us that person cant have he creates then now is that prerequisite of creation thats the reactivity of creation male voice i understand now were only talking about unknowing creation and most of our discussions here concern the reactive mind and the unknowningness of it all this is some of the laws which have gotten submerged and which are out of ken and those are the only laws were interested in digging up nearly everybody who has studied the mind has studied analytical reactions only and i sometimes err in not telling you well this is not an analytical reaction or something of the sort thats not an analytical reaction it is totally reactive action and the statement here that canthave is prerequisite to creativeness is only reactive response of course at one time it was an analytical response and all reactive responses were at one time analytical but this is now longer analytical and so is hidden law right now lets get an idea out here weve got some very very terrific workmen here at saint hill i mean theyre marvelous people theres mr weller and mr jenner these guys are really marvelous and those birds arent under any such delusion they can really build in concrete and wood and do various things theyre quite good you know but they just go on the simple postulate of well i think i will build up this stone wall out here and well make curb around the thing and thats all there is to it and it doesnt fit with weller because everybody was giving him workshop he could have all the workshops he wanted but when he got around to moving his workshop well he built himself one well there he could have workshop and he did build workshop all right thats totally analytical response fellow decides hes going to fix up wall he decides to build wall you youre walking down the beach one day and you say well i would certainly dearly love to have house on the beach you very likely would simply call up couple of your friends and tell them to build house on the beach see nobody has even inferred that you couldnt have one and you up and built one but then youre doing it knowingly see you know what youre doing you know you want house on the beach now this other law comes up along this wise one day you have picture of rhinoceros in front of you where the hell did that come from well if you know that somebody somewhere along the line has forbidden you to have rhinoceroses i mean its as stupid as that and of course thats getting real stupid to have picture of rhinoceros because you dont even want rhinoceros you got the idea youre not aware of ever having wanted one at time the truth of the matter is it could get keyed in very well and very easily because of an interest in wildlife back along the track somewhere and regulating life on planets something of this sort and youve read in the paper how there are only 250 rhinoceroses left in the world or something like this and couple of days later youve forgotten that see couple of days later why you got picture of rhinoceros now where the devil did this picture of rhinoceros come from and you trace it back you see now this is the reaction of the unexplained appearance of mental image picture now we go back in the history of dianetics and scientology we didnt even know we were making them at first see this is how far weve progressed all right if you sort it back carefully knowing this law somewhere fairly recently some part of rhinocerodom has been run as canthave on you just like that and you get this automatic response but its totally an unknowing response which is what makes it utterly incredible but just creating oh well pooey you can always trace back desire to create something you can always find and link up some period when somebody told you not to have one you can always cross these things up but then actually youre the one thats crossing them up theyre not crossed up already see the freudians moved all sorts of rationale on the backtrack to explain what was happening in the present time you see theyd even invent backtrack rationale to explain what was happening in present time but the mysterious appearance of creation somewhere in your vicinity or wild and incredible impulse of something you dont even really want and for some reason or other youve just got to make up this tune youve got to make up this tune just got to you know i got to write this piece but i dont know how to write music but i got to write this i dont know how to and so on that kind of blingblong well somebodys run canthave on you on music and youve gotten the immediate back response from it see i know mary sue used to get the ideas all the time that she had to write book all right in spite of past track which she could have added up very easily into something like that it was true that member of her family used to run canthave on her on books but it wasnt canthave that was that easily explained it was another type of canthave entirely because people didnt want her to read see so somebody didnt want her to read wound her up in the necessity to create book which had nothing to do with the price of fish got the idea so this is how you can track one back its reactive law not knowing law all creativeness fortunately was not necessitydriven affair as matter of fact great deal of the creativeness that goes on is totally spontaneous it has connective action but spontaneous creativeness of course is usually an able creativeness and reactive creativeness is usually for the birds it is terrible have you seen any cubist paintings lately man that answered male voice thank you ron good enough okay male voice whats the purpose and when do you run negative sec check whats the purpose and when do you run negative sec check ah im glad you brought up that point ive been meaning to tell you about them i neglected to issue bulletin nobodys run canthaves on lately on bulletins so im not writing them anymore last time negative sec check may i just cover the whole subject male voice yes what is the reason why your pc advances in auditing and gets new answers on the sec check hes gone over them before he hasnt remembered that he did anything on these sec checks you see he hasnt remembered stealing anything and now he gets some advance in his responsibility in auditing and you can tell whether or not hes had any advance because now you ask him if hes stolen anything he suddenly remembers something and its rough to clear the question dont think that you missed the question before you have raised his responsibility level so that he does remember well by raising his responsibility level you have also made him braver and he doesnt hold everything as notised as before now on negative sec checking i refer you to the lecture of few days ago on the subject of notisness you should know how to do this trick its brandnew trick i just whipped it up to speed up the withhold situation its just speedup if youll notice thats about all were working on right now were working on speedup were working on more cases reached and reached faster all right now this is part of it why sit around and wait for this withhold to come up why not just knock it into existence well how would you knock it into existence well youd asis the notis you ask him the not couple of notis questions see this is processing check this isnt security check but i suppose you could use it as security check for employment or something of the sort and it would be much more reliable but this is plain murder you say to the fellow when havent you stolen something well he has to spot something on the time track you see and he has to spot another one on the time track and if youve got any needle response i certainly wouldnt bother to clear it with that question but i might run the question longer got the idea if i were getting needle response that would only tell to ask the question couple of more times its little auditing process that you run in there with the question dont you see when havent you stolen something very good now you pop the question to him have you ever stolen anything uhhiuckieoglkiougluh youve practically got it all answered in other words you scraped the notis off the top of the question and of course you got to the meat under it almost at once and although it is there are more questions and more processes and more statements involved you will find this will speed security check now your question of when should you use this is quite important you should use this on any security check which promises to have long duration do you know weve had some fortythree hour and thirtysix hour security checks around here one time through joburg hco ww security form 3 thirtysix fortythree kawow man i mean thats long time through security check well now why why did it take this long well actually the poor pc was just being tortured to death because they didnt remember and yet the needle was falling now everything was trembling right on the verge of memory but not sufficiently on the verge of memory that the pc could find out about any part of it all right if youre going to get fall it must be terribly thin crust you see that you have to penetrate so if youre going to get fall you say well have you stolen anything you get read and you say what was that and the pc says i havent got the faintest notion let see could it be this could it be that could it be something or other and you say well have you ever stolen good have you ever stolen anything lets see it might be this it might be that and have you ever stolen anything oh could oh i cant just comm lag they dont remember when you run into that kind of phenomenon just treat every question with negative check just take the crust off of it and let it explode what youre doing is notis stealing notis stealing notis stealing okay thank you very much now have you ever stolen anything bow www if the answer is there hes going to know about it got it and thats why you would use it and thats on what you would use it and actually that is how to use it now theres one little question there i havent answered completely and that is how many times do you ask this question well this would be gradient scale of how rough is it to get withhold off this pc if your pc is running easily on security check you dont use it at all if the pc is having little trouble use it once or twice if the pc is having lot of trouble use it five or six times and thats how you would establish it and it is unfortunately matter of judgment that answer your question male voice yes very much so thank you okay you bet female voice so one point on that its make point of when they ask when havent you stolen anything when havent you looked at pornography yeah you mustnt ask this question have you never thats for the birds man male voice thank you kawow kawow kawow because the guys telling lie of course if hes got reaction on it isnt he you must always ask an auditing question that can be answered thats one of the laws of commands it must be answered another law of command is that you mustnt ask question which if answered would be lie and have you never is lie you see because right away youve invalidated the pc so youve disobeyed the auditors code you say have you never stolen anything and the pc says well he doesnt know whether to answer yes or or right or wrong and he finally in desperation says and then you say well have you ever stolen anything if you said that right afterwards and so forth and he said yes this would make him look like liar its one of these legal questions something on the basis of now answer the following question yes or the prosecuting attorney says do you still beat your wife of course you cant answer that yes or and youre hung you see and thats another so it must be when havent you and then make them recall an actual time and itll seem to the fellow like on some of these cases where the question is real live it looks real funny by the way it just looks like they must have been doing it day and night all of their lives because they cant find moment on the track when they werent doing it it has several side effects too it knocks into reality the fact that the guy does have charge on it were of course adapting the negative processes of old sop 8c in its fullest sense in some of these respects the moment we move into games condition were right back to sop 8c 1953 54 okay any other question yes female voice since routine 1a has come out does this mean that now 1 is not good for half the scientologists in the world oh that doesnt mean so it does mean this that its speedup female voice mmhm 1a is speedup and i you want to know if routine 1a since routine 1a comes out does that say that routine cancels the statement that routine 1 is necessary on about half the scientologists in the world yes id say it modified this statement because its showing itself up as being very beefy process running you see now its further refined were getting it into real dynamite now you have youve got any problems process youve got any games condition process addressed to problems confusions or motions that all comes under the same routine youve got negative security check plus your positive security check and this is something on the order of this poor little suffering pc was doing all right and we were making good headway with him and then we started bringing up shotguns and rifles decided that wasnt good enough and brought up little bit of antitank armor and you know here it went so that actually the processes are so beefed up along this line that tremendous number of these cases now that would have been included in that onehalf are reachable without running routine 1 okay female voice okay thank you for asking any other questions well im glad you all know it im glad you all know it now the new students are of course lets see what day is this this is wednesday isnt it this is wednesday and couple of students got here tuesday theyve been here now twentyfour hours or fortyeight hours theyve been here really fortyeight hours and theyve passed all of their examinations female voice yeah ah thats pretty slow were dead serious about that though dead serious actually the beginning of learning is discovery that there is zones of notknowingness up to that time youre liable to go along like the oldtime pilot that was he was never taught to fly he just got into an airyplane and he just flew it you know and the wings kept brushing the trees and he always flew with the left wing low and few things like that but he never paid much attention to that because he was still alive and it was still flying wasnt it well thats enough answer to him you see now you take hold of this guy and you try to correct any of his errors or retrain him on any of his mistakes and he doesnt pay cottonpicking bit of attention to you because he doesnt think theres anything that he doesnt know and of course right now youre in position where you can catch the tips of your wings in more bushes and trees youre flying lower and slower and higher and faster than youve ever flown before actually its marvelous how few upsets occur now of course this is invalidative of training and ones past training and all of that sort of thing to insist so suddenly on it but let point out this horrible thing if your past training was real good why worry about taking an examination emeter for instance emeter has just been codified for the first time thats why that becomes very important with emeter essentials and i swear i dont think there was anybody in the whole world could run an emeter it is completely fantastic but i dont think anybody was emeters were telling lies to people and so forth im certain that none of these poor people in the states that were getting all swamped up in pdhs and that sort of thing i am sure that there wasnt single one of them knew the top of meter from the bottom of meter you know and you didnt even have to know the refinements of compartmenting questions i dont know i think they thought the tone arm wobbled when you asked question you know tone arm never wobbled the emeter didnt work say do fish swim motion on the tone arm one time motion you point out to them look you have to reach over and take hold of the tone arm and move it before the tone arm moves and they say oh is that right im sure being snide today okay all right are there any other questions female voice would you just say word about these obsessive people who talk about how they must you know react on the emeter and how when they think about something well then it doesnt react but other times they think about something and it does and you know theyre in real competition with the emeter well thats dodge of withholds when you see that worry now you dont mistake i will not tell you lie youre talking about people who say they can push around emeters and so forth well i will not kid you an emeter can be pushed around but ill tell you frankly i cant counterfeit reaction when i push around an emeter it does not look like any reaction i ever saw come off of pc im just not smooth enough my touch isnt sufficiently delicate but i can move needle back and forth by just putting beam on it and moving it back and forth you know i hit it knock it on the side and it looks like body motion i know i cant make one read i can make beep meter play yankee doodle or push that thing around but i cant make one read in any kind of read that is sensible its jerky itd look like body motion if you did see it read you wouldnt even mistake it for reading because it would be zzzz you know and youd say well the pc shifted his head or something you know moved his hands on the cans and the first thing youd say about pc who was worried about pushing around the meter is that he was not insession that would be the first thing youd say if he was worried about the meter the second thing youd say is that hes got withholds and hes afraid of the meter or the meter disturbs him or the meter is showing him up in some fashion or hes afraid it might show him up or you would say well hes trying to put up some sort of pretense of some kind or another that is making hes trying to impress the auditor and the effort to impress the auditor gets into the road of the session because hes not there to impress the auditor he is there to get audited so that tells you hes not insession so id say the common denominator of all this is the pc had never been put insession and i could say lot about this but i dont mean to condemn anybody because ive heard an awful lot of people talk about this meter and how they could do this and that but the point im making is it doesnt look like anything an auditor would ever mistake for read youd say well the battery has hit rut or something of the sort it would come over and it would go clank one way or the other and it would just be too jerky to pay any attention to male voice well ron i may have contributed to little bit of that confusion couple of weeks ago while i was being audited i was getting great big twangs on the body that werent showing on the meter and then all of sudden something would happen on the meter that i had absolutely idea about it its gone now apparently all right but that would be ordinary that you wouldnt know what was happening on the meter i know i find great deal of trouble predicting whether the thing fell or not because what its falling on is the unknown its what the pc doesnt know about that causes the meter to react i wouldnt worry about that wing whether you did or didnt contribute to it id just like to put the facts straight im certainly not going to tell anybody that they cannot move an emeter needle im not going to tell anybody that im not going to say that person who is clear couldnt mock up mass and read the tone arm high make the tone arm go high i couldnt say that either because i could undoubtedly myself sit and think about some juicy organizational problems and then be very careful not to look at any of them you know think of problem and then very carefully not confront it think of problem not confront it think of problem not confront it think of problem not confront it and start to get this tone arm going up you see there are various dodges that you could resort to but this wouldnt have anything to do with auditing thats the point im making it doesnt have thing to do with auditing and it rather tells person that the person is not insession or is upset in some fashion now all of the things that keep pc out of session are being handled pretty well these days those are present time problems withholds and arc breaks talking to the auditor and interested in their own case that is being insession now obviously part of that is violated when the pc is more interested in the emeter reaction than his own case or interested in what the emeter is saying about his case rather than what his case is all about his attention is already too extended to fit this thing of insession and i would say offhand for the benefit of pcs not their condemnation in any way that if pc starts talking about moving the meter or starts worrying about the meter that the pc has gone out of session and one of the rudiments is out and my first action as practical action would simply be to close off the process i was running smoothly with my model session and do end rudiments and just knock the spots off of those end rudiments and i would every time find something was wrong well this is not then the pcs fault if the rudiments are out its the auditors fault all right so therefore thats enough about this particular phenomena ive got an ometer were busy developing these days reg loaned couple of great big powerful scopes one was streamlined it was powered with cadillac engine i think and it was extremely easy to push beam around it registered mass more easily than it registered thinking and it was so easy to push beam around that it was utterly fantastic i was sitting there with mary sue and dick halpern and so forth i dont think they were even noticing this thing but i gave up on the thing at once i found all you had to do was put beam on the electrodes and it instantly got different read it jumped well that is too darned critical its almost as if all you do is look at the electrode and the emeter reads so you see i cant say that it doesnt happen i can only say that when pcs doing it hes not insession and the rudiments are out okay all right ive spoken about this ometer there is one it does exist it could be put into production now but the top zones of this thing have not been exhausted by most people and we neednt worry about that we would right now only have couple of dozen people on earth that could be audited on it so skip it any other questions yes female voice im so vague about this i dont know really how to say it perhaps youll help i read someplace or heard someplace that at sometime havingness plus confront processes were used in rudiments is there anything you say you heard someplace that havingness plus confront processes were used in rudiments this would not be true female voice at the beginning of the session ah yes this is where the confusion has arisen after youve done the rudiments and when you begin to audit the pc female voice mmhm when you begin to audit the pc this is not is it all right to audit in this room youve actually started session you can run the havingness and confront process to get the pc even more thoroughly insession but its not rudiment its not rudiment because its purposes are different the rudiments purposes have totally to do with the outer environment youre trying to reorient pc in his bank when youre running havingness and confront processes and its totally attached to processing and just before you finish it is very kind thing to straighten out the pcs bank its like you leave an auditing room its very nice thing to put the chairs back in the proper place and empty the ashtray or something like that you know well similarly pc will get along and actually go right on through to clear but you can actually leave him parked in the middle of what you were just running and havingness and confront processes move him into pt another thing you can be running terminal which it doesnt exist in this life it just doesnt exist there hasnt been any and all right so therefore all of your prehav processes on an sop goals routine 3 run would be addressed to past lives every single command how is the pc ever going to get up through and scan up to this present life hows he ever going to get back up to this life unless you run some confront this has strictly to do with subjective phenomena rudiments are basically objective having to do with the environment to break it down in an effort to get the pcs main things that keep him out of session off so that he will get into session now you set up the bank for auditing and you can set up the bank for auditing with the havingness and confront processes its very nice point and one can be much too picky about the thing but they couldnt possibly be part of rudiments because if they were part of rudiments then you would only run them at beginning and end of session and this is not what you do with them you can run them at the end of every process lets say you are going to shift processes in the middle of the session without going through whole bunch of rudiments or something of the sort well beautiful way to shift processes is to end this process run some havingness and confront and reassess thats preliminary to reassessment the pc isnt answering the auditing commands too well seems to be struggling and bungling and flobbling along you dont seem to be getting anyplace and the tone arm action sort of died out well theres two things you can do one is go back and cover the rudiments and end the session which is rather timeconsuming activity if usually very beneficial one or you can simply give him kick with havingness and confront and continue on with the process and the thing now gets active you understand their purpose and use little better female voice yes all right okay female voice i think where i heard it it was not stated that it was in the rudiments i think in my confusion i put it there it was in the beginning of the process so instead of in the process i put it in the rudiments in my thoughts thats why i asked you about it second female voice mmmm she just was explaining why she was confused mentally she made mistake is all im saying all right okay good enough good enough all right any other questions yes female voice i would like to ask what vitamins or what composition of vitamins would be taken in an intensive and if they were allowed vitamin b and c and iron and nicotinic acid oh well youre talking about an interesting subject you want to know what vitamins could be taken to what what is your exact question female voice it is usually advice to take in longer intensive or how do you good advice to take these things in longer intensive and so on all this is perfectly true youre talking about guk is its oldest phrase more politely latterly dianazene and other such mixtures all of them however directed at different targets the target of the atomic bomb is what gave us dianazene and that is the one which has the iron and everything else in it now lets see what is the formula for dianazene i think its 100 milligrams of b1 something on the order of this this would be workable formula anyhow 15 grains of dicalcium phosphate or calcium 250 milligrams of ascorbic acid vitamin c now that all by itself is guk that isnt the original guk but thats the component parts of the original guk that worked folic acid and several other items iron and so on had nothing to do with the original guk and its performance so those three items were the original guk and that is vitamin b1 100 milligrams 15 grains of dicalcium phosphate and 250 milligrams of vitamin c ascorbic acid now that was guk and to this if you add iron and 100 milligrams of nicotinic acid not niacinamide that has reaction at all its nicotinic acid its that vitamin which goes under that heading and if you add 100 milligrams of that and few grains of iron it doesnt much matter how many grains of iron youll start running off all of the sunburns all atomic blast flushes youll have ball man youll be on fire one moment and getting cold the next and its hotter than pistol it feels like bathing in mustard and in addition to that its basics have something to do with skin cancer because once in while some brave soul taking this stuff has turned on or this has happened now and then has turned on skin cancer per itself in person and it has run right straight on through and turned off again providing he persisted so we can assume that radiation and so forth has something to do with cancer we can probably expect more cancer in the world now with atomic bombs around or something of the sort all right the reason why this rationale came about is very simple is nicotinic acid is listed in the pharmaceticopeia ill bet you cant say that anyway is listed as drug which produces drug rash and this doesnt happen to be correct but i have also ive been informed informed by the powers that be who of course know all that if it isnt in the pharmaceticopeia it isnt true and that its the pharmaceticopeia that sets up the standards of chemistry throughout the world and if they made misprint in mendels chart or something like that why mendels chart would have had it you see and iron would longer weld or something so they had to be awfully careful with their typographical errors so it is listed as dangerous drug because it turns on flush well the observation was originally i was trying to find some drug mechanism when they were having such time exploding atomic bombs oh they were enjoying themselves boy were they enjoying themselves and every time it rained you could take geiger counter and you could point it down at gutter and itd go brrrrrrrrrrr fallout was falling all over the world and so forth i was walking down the street in washington one day and said there must be something here and then i suddenly remembered that the tremendous amount of research we did on this earlier that sunburn was turned on and run out by nicotinic acid sunburn very interesting now the odd factor which totally disagrees with the pharmaceticopeia is simply this it produces body flush but why always in the shape of bathing suit you know thats an interesting one thats i suppose the medicos would explain that by the fact that the various nerve centers as they go through the body end at those points but its very remarkable you can take some of this stuff and if youve been out this summer sunbathing in swimming suit the flush occurs exactly where the swimming suit wasnt its remarkable leads to better clinical research very interesting anyway this point is coupled with the fact that there was something which turned on radiation burn there was something that did because sunlight is radiation i know in just few short years ago they were teaching in all the public schools that the sun was burning ball of hydrogen which was regulated by the thames water board or something and it doesnt happen to be true the sun is ball of incandescent atomic fire and thats what the sun is and sunburn is nothing more nor less but radiation burn thats all okay lets take look at this and sure enough those people whod been unlucky enough to be around the sites where they were testing and we had some of these available boy they would turn on nicotinic acid flush the likes of which you never heard of and it was longer relegated to the shape of bathing suit but was relegated to the shape of work clothes interesting guy working down in the desert with low necked shirt you know and it would just be exactly these areas on the backs of his hands and it would be the very places he would get it and we did quite few tricks with this but we were experimenting around it was simply stopgap proposition theres serum i think theyve developed serum and if you shoot somebody with horse needle with this serum i think if you shoot him every ten minutes you shoot quart of serum into him every ten minutes in event of atomic fission he will get sick i think thats the limits and workabilities of the existing atomic energy serum its just grim in other words theyve done nothing now as far as the problems of civil defense are concerned the amount of equipment necessary to handle one atomic burn victim is something to the value of three to five thousand pounds and requires something of the order of large hospital room to house i think this is very interesting because theres enough to treat several hundred people for instance in the british isles you could treat several hundred but the last time i looked at the population count it wasnt several hundred so i thought that it might be good thing to know in event of atomic war that we would get we might have some chemical assist so that maybe the people who were only slightly frazzled and so forth could could come out of it and it would have to be very simple it would have to be some common drug some common pill well there are societies in england that are having an awfully good time fighting the cigarette they cant do anything else so they fight cigarettes and they say that the cigarette causes lung cancer and theyve youve been hearing something of this im sure yeah not smoking enough will cause lung cancer not smoking enough will cause lung cancer if anybody is getting cancerous activity in the lung the probabilities are that its radiation dosage coupled with the fact that he smokes and what it does is start to run out the radiation dosage dont you see but id say that would be better than not running out any of the radiation dosage at all and the number of lung cancer cases which exist of course that dont smoke are just forgotten by these societies but they are very numerous anyway theres nicotinic acid in that cigarette inevitably on inhalation of tobacco you will get some of this phenomena of face flush but in view of the fact that cigarette isnt pushing its smoke over the outside of the body but on the inside of course you run it out internally but if you will notice if youve had many sunburns that that cigarette smoke stings you can hold cigarette smoke up close to your face for quite little while and youll get it stinging or all of sudden you get some kind of lip upset or itll start burning or something of that sort well its the same phenomenon the same phenomena its the same stuff anyway we gratuitously were going to help out the tobacco companies and then found out that they had appointed committee for the defense of tobacco companies and this committee is in the research business and some guy goes around and hes got lot of letters after his name and he gets everybody to contribute lot of money so that hes then permitted to sit at desk and shuffle papers and then he takes all the papers that are issued him and he writes new reports you see and then they go to some other society and they take all those papers and then they write new reports on his papers you see and then they have another society and they write new reports on these two societies reports you see and then the first guy has still got job because he can still rewrite the papers of the third society you see and they get this circle going and that is what is called research never never be bumbled as to why they dont get anyplace much with research in this society because that is im not even being sarcastic that is the way they do it they grab all of the funds for appropriation and then run canthave of knowledge on everybody see by circulating these papers youve seen them do it the us government has gone insane on this subject my god you could walk into the us government and you could set spaceship down in the middle of the pentagon fully equipped with crews oxygen supplies and call all the generals out and say all right now boys were going to go up to the moon and bring you back sample of the stuff whatevers up there take off go to the moon bring them back sample present them with sample give them all the photographs theyve had you on radar all the way and so forth and they would turn around to their research department to find out whether or not it was possible to build such spaceship and of course the research department has only been reading their own papers so of course they say it is not possible to build spaceship and you would have had it theyre really going to lay one terrific egg on research one of these days because its getting more and more the old school tie and its all tied in and its all this and its all that and they are just rewriting papers and this committee for the defense of tobacco manufacturers is one of these outfits see weve had enough correspondence with them to know what the old school tie is all about you see and weve just been trying to tell them that probably it is because people dont smoke enough cigarettes and we can prove that you can actually get rid of the effects of atomic fission using the ingredients of cigarette which of course what would this do to this antitobacco campaign which is now upsetting the income of tobacco companies but that is solution and theyre only in the business of problems so they dont want anything to do with it at all ive detoured but i thought i might tell you something about that because i found it rather amusing when it was happening i knew definitely what was happening thats why we get research done is because we research we look we observe and then we dont spend the rest of our lives getting into arguments with people about what we wrote about it you see its the basis of whether or not it works not the basis of whether or not we are qualified to judge does it work or doesnt it work and thats the whole criterion and that makes us kind of new and strange all right dianazene is the whole mixture of the ancient guk plus nicotinic acid and is used only for the purpose of the discharge of radiation and is an experimental drug but does do some remarkable things so much for that guk on the other hand for fiftyseven minutes after dose of guk is taken pc runs at much accelerated rate because of the chemical boost by actual test by emeter and so on it does speed auditing for the first fiftyseven minutes after the dose is taken for that exact period of time this was very carefully researched female voice that would be guk only thats the old guk thats the first threeitem formula which i gave you if you have nightmares you should take some guk thats right if youre having nightmares during auditing or something youve simply drifted out on b1 and you want to drop off and take some guk its chemical assist thats what it is furthermore it will run engrams through all by itself too which is quite interesting when you start taking this stuff periodically day after day you take dose of it every day regularly as clock and somatic will progressively go on through and move youll move through an engram nutrilite and some of these other substances have this same basis but not in these proportions and these proportions are so alarming to chemist that they just dont know what theyre looking at and yet with great aplomb they will give 100 milligrams of b1 to people without the calcium and without the ascorbic acid and it sets them up to lose all their bones and teeth because b1 will find ascorbic acid from the teeth and gums and will find calcium from the bones and teeth if you start feeding somebody with it itll find it in the body and so you better put it there in the stomach for it to discover real fast otherwise it softens up all of the bone structure of the body which is quite interesting shows you the irresponsibility of some of the drug companies like abbot parke lilly menninger and some of these other drug companies these characters are uniformly having happy time pushing out into the hands of doctors and psychiatrists heavy enormous doses of b1 which are given by the needle and given by oral and so on they just give enormous doses of this stuff and its just knocking people to pieces they never even bothered to find out if there was any supplementary vitamin had to be given with it i think were the only ones that ever did any research on it probably because we didnt have any profit motive of course thats snide remark i know that abbott lilly and parke and davis and all the rest of them i know they have profit motive at all they never invest any money in fighting scientology or drugless healing either they never never never penny they invest it strictly in the american medical association and tell them to do it by the way theres pure food and drug act in england for which you can be very devoutly thankful but you can buy bottle of medicine in england and it doesnt have any of its ingredients on it and in america all the ingredients have to be on the thing but then to make sure they get the food and drug administration which is totally supported and subsidized by the drug people and if one of the big companies comes in with new drug doesnt matter what it does you know why if theyre big company they get an automatic okay its automatic well they say thats parkedavis must be all right so they have sterility pill now in america which was okayed by the food and drug administration despite the fact that it has about one hundred percent side effects and practically action on virility its almost hundred percent side effects it just tears person to pieces but because parke and menninger or somebody put it out see why it was automatically okayed and they have started actually now reversing the flow good example of flow reverse and theyve actually started okaying only things that are harmful they okay the electric shock machines of the psychiatrists even if they are going to short out and kill patients thats okay but they wont okay an emeter thats harmless device so it cant be okayed they wouldnt okay somebody selling bread pills which are totally harmless but they would okay somebody selling sterility pill i think these sterility pills are the biggest racket anybody ever heard they are about fifty cents apiece and you have to take one day and thats fifteen dollars month and the net security of them involves with upsetting the entire menstrual cycle blood upsets i think it makes people dizzy huh female voice sick at their stomach makes people violently sick at their stomachs and consistently dizzy and and fixes them so they cant eat and so forth and so thats the very thing we ought to do every time you get government bureau set up to guarantee purity you see they run canthave on impurities on everybody until they finally become totally impure wonderful example of games condition just gorgeous well ive talked to you quite while here and youre way overdue and probably anxious to get home so that you can get back in time im very happy with the case results which you have been resulting doing good job of auditing all except those of course who have just come lately and we cant expect anything more than that and were not going to worry about it particularly we wont worry about it till friday saint hill by the way doesnt have any dungeons there are dungeons at saint hill theres only the remains of some and down here theres an old wine cellar looks like dungeon and the electric door on it has nothing to do with the fact that atomic fission has been used in there or anything and the actual entrance to the dungeons has been sealed and there was an entrance in there if you go in and inspect the bricks very carefully you will find out where the dungeons are they were right back under the terrace back there it was an old norman castle sat on this site before 1733 and its dungeons are still there the boys discovered them the other day and were not going to use them before friday
