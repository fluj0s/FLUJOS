but common view is that disruptions in financial markets rise to the level of crisis wh the flow of credit to households and businesses is constrained and the real economy of goods and services is adversely affected since mid2007 governments have tried with limited success to keep the downturn in us subprime housing from developing into such crisis subprime mortgage problems and the financial shock they caused were widely anticipated but the spread of turmoil into many seemingly unrelated parts of the global financial system was not many of the losses occurring in diverse firms and marketsoften quite severehave common features the use of complex hardtovalue financial instruments large speculative positions underwritten by borrowed funds or leverage and the use of offthebooks entities to remove risky trading activities from the balance sheets of major financial institutions because of the prevalence of innovative financial arrangements the housing downturn appears to have triggered market dynamics that amplify the effects of financial shocks and generate selfreinforcing downward financial and economic spirals the federal reserve and foreign central banks have cut shortterm interest rates dramatically and injected trillions of dollars into the banking system to keep credit flowing the fed and treasury have engaged in series of extraordinary interven tions to shore up failing financial institutions the fed provided 29 billion to underwrite the rescuethroughacquisition of bear stearns leading investment bank and loaned billions to aig leading insurer fannie mae and freddie mac have been placed in government conservatorship with the treasury pledging to stand behind the 5 trillion in bonds the two firms sold or guaranteed in september 2008 as market conditions appeared to worsen congress passed 700 billion rescue plan pl 110343 authorizing the treasury to purchase securities to shore up bank balance sheets in october as conditions appeared to worsen the fed entered the commercial paper market and purchased tens of billions in shortterm corporate debt simultaneously trillions of dollars in private debt now carries government guarantees the duration of the current instability is in marked contrast to financial shocks of recent decades when the central bank was able to contain market problems quickly with little or interruption of us economic growth depending on how soon normal market conditions are restored and on the severity of the economic slowdown congress may view the social costs of failed financial speculation as sufficient to warrant new restrictions to reduce the incidence of losses that have systemwide impacts or to put the markets and the economy in better position to weather such shocks the treasury has already proposed sweeping restructuring of financial regulation this report supplements crs report rl34182 financial crisis the liquidity crunch of august 2007 by darryl getter et which describes in greater detail the channels through which subprime problems cascaded through the financial system this report focuses on the efforts of regulators to restore market stability and will be updated as

the turmoil has been surprising given the small size of the us subprime market in relation to global financial markets1 not only is subprime comparatively small market its problems were known well in advance when the rapid rise in housing prices stopped in 2006 it was inevitable that many subprime borrowers would have difficulty making payments particularly those whose adjustable mortgage rates were scheduled to reset in 2007 and 2008 swiss bank ceo called subprime loan losses probably the longest anticipated crisis we have ever seen 2 nevertheless wide range of financial institutions have been affected adversely many of which had little direct exposure to the subprime mortgage market almost weekly since july 2007 the financial press has highlighted new trouble spot including commercial and investment banks issuers of commercial paper conduits for securitization of loans credit swaps jumbo mortgages money market funds consumer lenders hedge funds bond insurers governmentsponsored enterprises state and local investment funds state and municipal governments themselves small business lending and so on as economic conditions deteriorate many fear that there may be more problems ahead possibly involving such major financial markets as commercial real estate and credit card lending in 2008 these periodic crises grew more severe with several leading us financial institutions requiring government ssistance merging with other firms or failing by september not single bulge bracket invest ment bank remained standing they had either failed lehman brothers merged merrill lynch and bear stearns or converted themselves into commercial bank holding companies goldman sachs and morgan stanley the links between many of these crises and subprime mortgages are not obvious but they are correctly viewed as symptoms of common underlying problem the stock market has certainly perceived systemic weakness across financial sectors as figure 1 below indicates share prices for commercial banks have significantly underperformed the market as whole as represented by the standard poors 500 index between january 2007 and october 2008 shares in those sectors lost over half their value sp 500 bank shares including the largest us banks have done worse than banks listed on nasdaq probably because they are more exposed to the complex instruments structures and trading practices at the heart of the crisis 1 about 12 trillion in subprime mortgages are outstanding and most of them are being paid off this compares to about 11 trillion in total us mortgage debt and 51 trillion in

from the major financial centers of the developed countries to these farflung financial systems has not been fully explained global economic slowdown may be partial explanation but the decline in stock prices began well before macroeconomic indicators turned negative all we can say for certain is that by the beginning of 2008 stock investors around the world had decided that banking and

august 2007 by darryl getter et describes the channels through which distress in subprime mortgages spread through the broader us financial system in addition to causing direct asset losses the subprime crisis triggered reassessment of financial risk that encompassed other debt markets including leveraged loans4 takeover financing credit derivatives and commercial paper there wasand still remainsgreat uncertainty regarding the true value of certain financial instruments especially those with complex structures or for which active trading markets do not exist to understand how relatively small market sectorus subprime mortgagescould trigger such widespread chaos in global markets it helps to consider ways that financial markets have evolved over decades innovations in financial theory improvements in communications and computing technology removal of barriers to in ternational investment flows the increasing reliance on trading markets by both businesses seeking funds and households investing their savings and the growth of financial services relative to the rest of the economy are all factors that have transformed the financial system since world war ii the present crisis is the gravest challenge that this new system of markets has faced and it may lead to fundamental changes in the way the business of financial intermediation is regulated in the 1930s the last time this level of turmoil occurred widespread bank failures were followed by long economic downturn in response congress recognized that banks were special their assets tended to be longterm loans and their liabilities were primarily shortterm deposits this meant that even sound and solvent banks could be destroyed if depositors sought to withdraw their money at the same time their assets were illiquid worse liquidity problems were contagious if one bank failed depositors were likely to run on healthy banks to stabilize the banking system congress instituted deposit insurance and gave bank regulators strong powers to limit the amount of risk that banks could take risky activities like underwriting and sale of corporate securities were placed off limits over the years however bank services and bank risks migrated outside of the regulatory safety net wall street securities firms for example developed the commercial paper market which replaced much of banks shortterm corporate lending investment banks like merrill lynch were never subject to the same kind of safety and soundness regulation as commercial banks newer market participants like hedge funds were not subject to any regulation at all even regulated banks were gradually allowed to own securities and insurance businesses within holding company structure and they were allowed to hold highlyrisky speculative positions in offbalance sheet special purpose entities in other words banklike investment strategiessuch as the use of leverage or borrowed money and financing longterm investments with shortterm debtbecame common outside the safety net provided by deposit insurance and strong regulation as result nonbank institutions became vulnerable to runsif markets lost confidence in them their sources of funds could dry up and these nonbank runs could also be contagious although this was not widely recognized before the current crisis 4 risky bank loans equivalent to highyield junk bonds often made in support of corporate takeovers or buyouts httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34412g5g152g151g157g138g146g151g146g151g144 g561g8g146g151 g138g151g140g146g138g149g561g5g155g146g156g146g156g561 g561

development of complex and hardtovalue financial instruments for example simple debt contracts like home mortgages were sold by the original lenders and packaged into bonds with wide range of risk and reward characteristics these bonds were often pooled again and sliced and diced into even more complex packages synthetic securities were created based on derivative instruments that replicate the price changes of an asset without requiring actual ownership of the asset itself the relationship between the performance of an underlying financial asset and the complex security or derivative based on it was never simple and under crisis conditions has proved to be completely unpredictable complexity reduces transparency neither regulators nor market participants can easily assess the true financial condition of firms that hold or trade these newer instruments since large parts of derivatives markets are unregulated there is global web of financial claims and counterclaims that is essentially invisible to financial supervisors and market participants alike the new finance was based on the ability to quantify and disaggregate risks in ways that were not possible before as derivatives markets grew common view was that they made the financial system more efficient and more resilient to shocks they let risks be transferred to those who were best able to understand them and who were willing to take on risk in search of profits just as farmers can use grain futures to protect themselves from unexpected declines in prices financial derivatives promised to allow many financial market participants to better manage risks arising from all sorts of financial transactions holdings and obligations the benefits in theory are not confined to market participants if farm failures can be prevented by shifting market losses from producers onto speculators on the chicago board of trade the entire economy gains valuable shock absorber similarly if hedge funds and other financial speculators take on credit risk interest rate risk currency risk and so on the core institutions of the financial system ought to be able to operate in more stable and predictable environment with general economic benefits in terms of lower costs to borrowers and higher returns to savers the crisis suggests that the system has not worked as hoped rather than use derivatives and other innovative financial instruments to shed risk the core institutions have employed them in speculative investment strategies increasing their risk the risks of these strategies appeared tolerable but now it appears that the underlying risk assumptions or models were deficient because they were based on historical price data that prevailed during the relatively benign financial conditions of the past 40 years 5 the shock of losses from rising mortgage linquencies and foreclosures though serious was probably not in itself sufficient to cause the crisis it was also necessary that the financial system be structured in such way as to multiply the initial shock and trigger dynamics that caused widening losses among financial institutions and now appear to weigh down the prospects for real economic growth key characteristics that produced this systemic vulnerability include the use of complex financial instruments whose value is often linked by complex formulae to the value of other instruments or financial variables and for which active trading markets exist 5 contracts linked to subprime mortgages had only few years of data on which to model performance

to take larger market positions with given capital base increasing potential profits but also losses and the practice of moving risky financial speculation off the books into nominally independent

financial strategies that were considered low risk and very likely to produce steady gains for participants in the crisis however risks that were discounted have come to the fore often producing large losses for which institutions and regulators have been unprepared two examples of these sorts of arrangements are set out briefly below g21g11g24g156g561 one example is the structured investment vehicle or siv an entity created by banks to enable speculation on the relationship between short and longterm interest rates in mid2007 commercial banks operated several dozen sivs with total assets of between 350 billion and 400 billion the market leader was citigroup figure 4 illustrates the basic cash flows the siv bought longterm debt assets often mortgageb acked bonds from which it received interest income purchase of these assets was financed by issuing shortterm debt usually commercial paper 6 the sivs net revenue was determined by the difference or spread between these two cash flows the operation was profitable so long as the payouts from the assets exceeded interest payments to the commercial paper holders 6 commercial paper is used as source of shortterm borrowing by many firms financial and nonfinancial the maturity is generally between three months and one year httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34412g5g152g151g157g138g146g151g146g151g144 g561g8g146g151

structur ed in v estment v ehicle cash flo ws source crs the profits were distributed in two ways first as fees for services to the sponsoring institution and second as dividends or interest to holders of subordinated debt and equity who were the nominal owners of the siv accounting rules requi re outside ownership for the siv to be carried off the books of the sponsoring bank in general however the bank was responsible for investment decisions and provided all brokerage trade processing and other services although data are not routinely reported or published one estimate is that 72 of the equity in mortgage conduits of which sivs are subset was held by hedge funds7 hedge funds are typically highly leveraged which suggests that much of the equity capital in sivs was borrowed perhaps from the sponsoring banks themselves many of the assets held by sivs were mortgagerelated but rarely were they actual loans rather they were securities backed by pools of loans in which the interest and principal payments of homeowners are passed through to the holders of the bonds financial engineers also bundled mortgagebacked bonds into pools of securities called collateralized debt obligations cdos and sold claims against them cdos were carved into various classes with different risk characteristics and yields the portions of the pool that proved most difficult to sell might be pooled again carved up and reso ldin socalled cdo squared despite their complexity such securities were often able to obtain aaa ratings and they were offered interest rates significantly higher th an aaa corporate bonds thus cdos found ready market in institutional investors seeking higher yi elds than traditional debt instruments offered in the early 2000s and they were incorporated into aggressive speculative strategies such as sivs as subprime defaults climbed to historically unprecedented levels in 2007 the value of mortgage backed instruments became hard to determine since it depended crucially on uncertain projections of future loan performance cdos were particularly affected since by the time loans had been pooled and resold two or three times it was difficult for investors to ascertain exactly 7 adrian blundellwignall structured products implications for financial markets oecd financial market trends 93 2007 p 45

cdo market which had provided the justification for those initial aaa ratings were shown to be wildly inaccurate sivs found that they were longer able to sell the commercial paper that supported their assets sponsoring banks often extended credit to the sivs and in many cases were compelled to do so having granted contingent lines of credit in order to secure high ratings for their sivs commercial paper or took the assets onto th eir own balance sheets exacerbating their own financial difficulties major banks did not allow sivs to fail because of the reputational damage that would follow but the associated losses were considerable sivs are only one part of the story of liquidity problems in 2007 and 2008 but they are instructive because they include three features that contributed disturbance elsewhere first they involved the use of innovative securities which were hard to value in the best of circumstances and which had little history to indicate how they might behave in severe market downturn second risks were underestimated the sivs were form of highlyleveraged speculation which was dependent on the assumption that the markets would always supply liquidity finally they were off balance sheet entities few in the markets or perhaps in the regulatory agencies had an accurate idea of the scope or nature of their activities until the trouble came 8 the result of the

metro the washington dc area transit system took out longterm loan from belgian bank kbc group to finance capital spending9 metro purchased contract from aig the new york insurance firm which guaranteed timely payment on the loan because the loan was insured metro received lower interest rate aig received fees the bank was able to save on capital charges because the loan was guaranteed by aig it was counted as less risky and the bank could reduce the amount of assets it had to hold against default risk10 each of the three parties gained little and none expected the deal to fall apart however when aig was downgraded in september 2008 the value of the insurance it provided dropped and the loan was technically in default even though metro itself had not missed payment under the terms of the contract the bank was able to demand immediate repayment of 43 million placing great burden on metro which sought and obtained legal relief what was the economic substance of the deal the loan was lowrisk to begin with since metro is backed by several government units each of whose cost of capital might rise sharply if metro were allowed to default on its debt the purpose of the credit derivative contract was not really to reduce risk but to permit kind of arbitrage against capital requirements and perhaps tax 8 for example citigroups sivs held about 100 billion in assets at the peak yet the firms quarterly report to the securities and exchange commission for the second quarter of 2007 contained reference to them the third quarter report of course devoted considerable space

going wrong appeared remote with hindsight the transaction did not reduce risk at all in fact it added slightly to systemic risk or the likelihood of the entire financial system becoming unstable

markets as principal threat to the economic outlook the fed has eased monetary policy reducing its target for the federal funds rate from 525 the level that was established in june 2006 to 100 it has declared its willingness to provide liquidity to the financial system 12 in the process of reaching the lower interest rate target the fed in its open market operations buys securities from depository institutions giving them new cash to lend lower rates themselves of course stimulate demand for credit as more investment projects become potentially profitable once they can be funded at lower cost

january 2008 that large losses reported by several major institutions were sign that the system is working as markets reassess we should not be surprised or disappointed to see financial institutions writing down assets and strengthening balance sheets this is market discipline in action and should enhance market confidence over time15 while the selfcorrecting properties of markets are generally acknowledged several analysts identify forces that work in the other direction in their models shocks produce other shocks multiplying the effects of an original loss in recent paper greenlaw et focus on the procyclical nature of leverage16 they assume that firms prefer to maintain more or less constant level of leverage or ratio of total assets to capital as the assets that make up firms capital base gain in value the firm can support more assets on the balance sheet balance sheet expansion in turn involves asset purchases boosting asset prices further when prices are falling however the cycle works in reverse as its capital loses value the firm must shrink its balance sheet to maintain given leverage ratio as firms sell assets to reduce balance sheet exposure asset prices are driven down because financial firms are typically highly leveraged balance sheet adjustment of any given size is multiplied the authors assume that commercial banks have leverage ratios of about 101 meaning that 1 billion capital loss requires 10 billion reduction in their portfolio of assets which consists primarily of loans in other words price shocks to firm cause behavior that reinforces the movement

the longstanding puzzle that large fluctuations in aggregate economic activity sometimes arise from what appear to be relatively small impulses17 they describe mechanism they call the financial accelerator they argue that the cost of external finance to firmits cost of borrowingis inversely related to its net worth fall in asset prices reduces the collateral value of the firms assets which hinders or raises the cost of borrowing by si multaneously increasing the need for external finance and restricting its availability negative shock causes the firm to reduce spending and production to the extent that negative shocks to the economy reduce the net worth of borrowers the spending and production effects of the initial shock will be amplified 18 these two models describe similar effects acting upon both the supply of and demand for credit the models suggest that shocks to financial firms can have disproportionate impacts on real economic activity when financial turbulence interacts with expectations of contraction in real economic activity the prospect of another negative spiral emerges martin feldstein chairman of the council of economic advisers under president reagan describes the situation as kind of catch22 the credit flows needed for economic expansion require confidence in the values of financial assets but market participants may not have such confidence while the risk of recession hangs over us 19 federal reserve governor frederic mishkin elaborated on this theme in november 2007 the second type of risk that i consider central to the understanding of financial stability is what i call macroeconomic risk that is an increase in the probability that financial disruption will cause significant deteriora tion in the real economy because economic downturns typically result in even greater uncertainty about asset values such episodes may involve an adverse feedback loop whereby financial disruptions cause investment and 17 ben bernanke mark

to contract such contraction then increases uncertainty about the value of assets and as result the financial disruption worsens in turn this development causes economic activity to contract further

the fed has made aggressive use of its monetary policy tools cutting the federal funds rate target six times including dramatic cuts of 75 basis points 075 in january and march of 2008 and using its open market operations to inject liquidity into the banking system early cuts appeared aimed specifically at financial markets but more recently as the fed has explicitly recognized that market conditions have become drag on real economic activity the distinction between actions aimed at restoring financial stability and those aimed at macroeconomic stimulus has become blurred if it exists

do the feds actions to expand credit prolong the adjustment process provision of liquidity lowers interest rates which is good for borrowers and for interestsensitive economic sectors such as housing

in the fall of 2007 when public attention focused on sivs that were suddenly unable to find buyers for assetbacked commercial paper number of large banks met with treasury officials and designed financial structure to alleviate siv funding problems they proposed that consortium of private banks create master liquidity enhancement conduit mlec to be capitalized entirely by the banks which would buy assets from existing sivs and fund these purchases in exactly the same way that the sivs had done in the past by issuing shortterm commercial paper the expectation was that co mmercial paper issued by the mlec would be viewed as safe because of the vast financial resources of the participating banks and because the treasury had endorsed the plan although mlecs debt would not carry any formal government guarantee the mlec concept was announced on october 15 2007 in joint press release from jp morgan chase bank of america and citigroup which noted that the treasury had facilitated the agreement 27 the federal reserve had comment on the plan then or later negotiations proceeded over the following weeks and months but although press reports suggested that agreement was near in the end banks were unwilling to commit capital to the project the apparent coupdegrace was delivered on december 20 2007 when the three largest japanese banks declined to participate 28 few days later the effort to launch the mlec was abandoned there are two explanations for the failure of the mlec proposal first it was not clear that the concept was economically viable the underlying problem was that the mortgagebacked assets held by sivs had lost value and might continue to lose value unless the housing market recovered how would transferring those assets and losses to supersiv help the assumption behind the mlec proposal was that market s were in state of panic and that prices of mortgagebacked assets at that time were below their fundamental values if liquidity could be restored the supersiv could simply hold assets until markets stabilized and rational valuations returned and make profit meanwhile the mlec would have given the sivs better price than they could have found elsewhere allowing the sponsoring banks and other investors to cap their losses and avoiding fire sale by desperate sivs at the brink of insolvency which would have driven values even lower exacerbating the general financial situation and further roiling housing markets in retrospect it appears that prospective mlec participants found this assumption and scenario less persuasive than an alternative view that mortgage assets were not necessarily priced below fundamental values but might still have some distance to fall in this analysis the sivs problem was not one of liquidity but of solvency and the notion that they could be rescued at profit was deemed to be unrealistic 26 see eg steven sloan fed pushes harder but sentiment isnt shifting american banker vol 178 march 10 2008 p 1

fact pose an acute threat to their sponsoring banks by the end of 2007 over 109 billion in siv assets had been brought back onto the sponsoring banks balance sheets without triggering solvency crisis in those banks29 siv assets became simply one of many sources of financial pain with hindsight the siv issue may have been overstated in the fall of 2007 it was serious problem and contributed to perceptions of elevated credit and valuation risk that fed the general financial turmoil but it was not the key to the entire systemic disturbance rather sivs were one of several trouble spots that may be more properly characterized as symptoms of an underlying problem or set of problems

noted above when banks and other financial institutions suffer declines in the value of their capital to maintain constant leverage ratios they must either shrink their balance sheets or raise new capital from regulatory perspective the latter method is usually preferable since it does not require that new lending be curtailed for the government to bail out troubled financial institutions through an injection of public funds is rare although many assume that certain large institutions are too big to failthat is that the failure of such an institution could have adverse systemic consequences so severe that the government would have choice but to intervene the treasury and the federal reserve officially deny that any such policy exists because the moral hazard issuewhich as discussed above may be secondary effect of the feds liquidity support programsis very clear here if institutions believe they will be rescued from insolvency they will take imprudent risks the calculus be comes heads i win tails the taxpayers lose although several major financial institutions experienced severe financial stress in 2007 there were major failures that required the us

the disorderly liquidations of several major financial institutions on thursday march 13 2008 it became known that the federal reserve had extended credit to bear stearns large investment bank whose liquidity problems had driven it to the brink of collapse as market perceptions of bear stearns weakness grew it became unable to borrow and its customers sought to retrieve their invested funds the fed was unwilling to allow the firm to collapse since liquidation would have meant the dumping of billions of dollars in mortgage backed and other securities on the market at time when demand was low the resulting fall in prices would have exacerbated the balance sheet problems of other institutions perhaps triggering further collapses over that weekend the fed worked with jp morgan chase to work out an agreement by which morgan would acquire bear in order for the deal to proceed the fed had to purchase pool of assets that bear valued at 30 billion but which jp morgan viewed as too risky to take onto its own balance sheet if those assets ultimately prove to be worth less than 30 billion the taxpayers will suffer loss equal to the difference 33 the final sale price was 10 per share paid in jp morgan stock remarkable plunge from the end of 2007 when bears financial statements reported book value of 80 per share and from january 2007 when the shares traded at high of 17261 in the wake of the bear stearns rescue the fed was criticized for widening the financial safety net to include firm that was neither insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation nor subject to the oversight of the fed or any other banking agency bear stearns was widely considered to have been among the most aggressive and reckless speculators in the subprime market

freddie mac two governmentsponsored enterprises g ses that play critical role in the us home mortgage market in conservatorship as conservator the fhfa has full powers to control the assets and operations of the firms dividends to common and preferred shareholders are suspended but the treasury has put in place set of financing agreements to ensure that the gses remain solvent and continue to meet their obligations to holders of bonds that they have issued or guaranteed this means that the us taxpayer now stands behind about 5 trillion of gseissued debt this step was taken because default by either of the two firms which have been battered by the downturn in housing and credit markets could have caused severe disruptions in global financial markets made home mortgages more difficult and expensive to obtain and had negative repercussions throughout the economy 32 see crs report rl34420 bear stearns crisis and rescue for major provider of mortgagerelated products by gary

that they were well capitalized and liquid in the context of plunging stock prices and doubts about creditworthiness however the firms were unable to raise capital by any of the normal means if they sold assets the deleveraging cycle described above applied they would have depressed the prices of mortgage loans and mbss still further wors ening both their own balance sheet problems and those of many other financial firms they could not use retained earnings to bolster capital because their operations had not turned profit since 2006 finally rapidly falling share prices made it all but impossible to raise capital by selling new equity or common stock treasury and fhfa recognized that falling values of home mortgage loans and related bonds the only investments that the gse charters perm it them to makemeant that the two firms were effectively insolvent even though fannie and freddie maintained access to the debt markets albeit at higherthanusual interest rates their inability to raise new capital cast doubts on their longterm viability if their interest costs continued to rise and the value of and their income from mortgage assets kept falling they were doomed to collapse

despite the steps taken to provide liquidity and prevent the failure of systemically important institutions financial conditions worsened in the fall of 2008 during the week of september 22 2008 following the bankruptcy of lehman brot hers markets approached fullblown panic investors pulled billions of dollars out of money market funds normally considered very lowrisk investments and rushed to safety driving the yields on treasury bills to near zero to the fed and treasury this was sign that the crisis had reached new level if financial institutions and investors viewed treasury securities at zero percent as good investment who would be willing to extend credit to households and businesses in other words the possibility that credit markets would freeze up with devastating consequences to the real economy now seemed to be at hand on thursday september 25 chairman bernanke and secretary paulson presented proposal to leaders of congress they asked for authority to purchase up to 700 billion of troubled mortgagerelated assets behind the plan lay the conclusion that the normal market self stabilizing processes were not resolving and would not resolve the balance sheet problems faced by many institutions banks could not sell their mortgagerelated assets except at fire sale prices that implied widespread insolvency throughout the financial system uncertainty about the fundamental value of those assets was disrupting interbank lending as one could judge the true condition of trading partners the negative leverage spiral described above had taken hold and severely constrained the ability of financial institutions to raise capital in the markets waiting for asset values to recover as the housing market improved was longer an attractive option given the possibility of general collapse of lending to households and businesses the 700 billion rescue plan proposed replacing the casebycase approach to interventions in the financial markets that had prevailed from summer 2007 through summer 2008 with systemic program to improve the balance sheets of any institution that was holding mortgagerelated assets the government better positioned than priv ate firms to bear longterm risks of uncertain magnitude would pay cash in exchange for troubled assets the hope was that once troubled mbs longer raised doubts about the reliability of banks balance

and professional traders the problem of hardtovalue assets and unverifiable trading models is likely to persist another view is that regulators had plenty of information indicating that trouble was imminent but failed to take adequate preventive measures according to martin feldstein even though the feds examiners have complete access to all of the transactions of the banks that they supervise and can also examine indirectly what nonbank financial institutions are doing the fed failed to provide appropriate supervisory oversight for major money center banks making such technical errors as understating liabilities associated with offbalance sheet activities and overstating the quality of bank asset values that were the result of the housing bubble 41 there is natural tendency for regulators to share industrys enthusiasm for the latest financial innovation or strategy as long as it is generating profits that enable banks to meet capital requirements and maintain healthy levels of reserves it is difficult as alan greenspan put it to be the one who takes away the punch bowl when the party is just getting started 42 federal bank agencies addressed securitization and offbalance

in general speculation is benign and useful activity speculators provide liquidity and help markets allocate resources efficiently the current episode however illustrates that speculative excesses and errors can cause liquidity to dry up and disrupt markets successful speculation rewards risktaking recent developments in finance make it possible to unbundle the risks embedded in traditional financial instruments mortgage for example carries credit risk interest rate risk and prepayment risk but with derivatives and cdos each of these risks can be disaggregated and made the basis of financial bet increasingly speculators identify financial propositions with high probability of making small profit and very small chance of large loss the siv model for exampl captured the spread between shortterm and longterm rates earning modest return that was almost riskfree unless there were to be major disruption in the commercial paper market whic h was normally very large and liquid the cdo market relies on the narrow spread between what homebuyers pay and what investors will pay for the identical mortgages repackaged using derivatives it is possible to construct similar trades based on tiny variations in observed historical relationships among multitude of economic variables of course strategy that promises small but seemingly predictable return does not appeal to most investment bankers treasury bills offer the same riskreward characteristics what the bankers do is add leverage if they borrow high multiple of their own capital and put those funds into the same trading position the returns to their own capital are magnified of course the potential losses are magnified to exactly the same degree then why is leveraged speculation attractive 41 martin feldstein

the international monetary fund is that compensation structures reward shortterm performance and ignore long term risk44 that strategy is likely to fail spectacularly every ten or twenty years is not disincentive to the leveraged trader he will probably receive several large annual bonuses before the bad year comes and even then may keep his job since many of his peers will probably have incurred similar losses the ceo of morgan stanley for example received bonus for 2007 but kept the 40 million from the year before 45 rajan suggests that significant portions of bankers pay could be held in escrow for long periods and that losses be factored in before final disbursement46 the combination of modern financial engineering and shortterm incentives may distort or weaken market discipline and lead to excessive risktaking the costs of failed speculation are not always borne by the speculators themselves but may be widely distributed throughout the financial system and in extreme cases may fall upon the economy as whole is there case for more stringent regulation to restrain speculation or limit the potential damage from speculative losses financial supervisors can impose higher capital and reserve requirements on regulated firms and can control the amount of leverage such firms extend to their unregulated customers such controls would smooth out the peaks and troughs of financial industry returns this would mean in effect putting brake on periods of economic and financial expansion the degree of support for initiatives such as these among regulators and policy makers is likely to depend on how the current financial turmoil is resolved and at what cost opposition to forms and degrees of regulation that would have seemed excessive before the crisis may be muted because the government has already established major ownership position in the financial services industry g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561
