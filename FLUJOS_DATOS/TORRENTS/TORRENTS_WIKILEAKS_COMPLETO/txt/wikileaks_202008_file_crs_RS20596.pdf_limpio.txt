described as the most sweeping nondiscrimination legislation since the civil rights act of 1964 as stated in the act its purpose is to provide clear and comprehensive national mandate for the

the goods services facilities privileges advantages or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns leases or leases to or operates place of public accommodation2 entities covered by the term public accommodation are listed and include among others hotels restaurants theaters auditoriums laundromats museums parks zoos private schools day care centers

difficulty or expense5 reasonable modifications in practices policies or procedures are required unless they would fundamentally alter the nature of the goods services facilities or privileges or they would result in an undue burden6 an undue burden is defined as an action involving significant difficulty or expense7 the remedies and procedures of section 204a of the civil rights act of 1964 are incorporated in title iii of the ada8 this allows for both private suit and suit by the attorney general when there is reasonable cause to believe that there is pattern or practice of discrimination against individuals with disabilities monetary damages are not recoverable in private suits but may be available in suits brought by the attorney general9 the impact of these provisions on small businesses was of concern to congress when the ada was enacted generally title iii provisions were not to become effective for eighteen months and there were specific further extensions for small businesses concerning the requirements for new construction and alterations actions under section 303 of the ada were not allowed during the first six months after the effective date for businesses that employed 25 or fewer and have gross receipts of 1000000 or less similarly section 303 actions were not allowed during the first year after the effective date against businesses that employed 10 or fewer employees and had gross receipts of 500000 or less10 section 204c of the civil rights act requires that when there is state or local law prohibiting an action also prohibited by title ii civil action may be brought before the expiration of thirty days after written notice of such alleged act or practice has been given to the appropriate state or local authority although the ada does not specifically incorporate this requirement several courts have found that it was prerequisite to suit11 hr 3590 the ada notification act hr 3590 would add provisions to the remedies and procedures of title iii of the ada to require plaintiff to provide notice of an alleged violation to the defendant this notice may be provided by registered mail or in personhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20596crs3 12

filed the court shall impose an appropriate sanction on the attorneys involved if the criteria are subsequently met and the action proceeds the court may not award attorneys fees department of justice views on hr 3590 the department of justice did not testify at the hearings but has gone on record as opposing hr 3590 in letter sent to rep canady assistant attorney general robert raben argued that the bill would work to undermine voluntary compliance with the americans with disabilities act and would unduly burden legitimate ada enforcement activity12 he noted that if attorneys are engaging in frivolous or harassing litigation the appropriate mechanism for addressing such problems is with the ethics and disciplinary bodies of state bar associations or the court where the litigation is pending in addition he detailed the efforts the department of justice has made to provide technical assistance13 hearing testimony in favor of hr 3590 the ada notification act attempts to prevent what its supporters have described as drive by lawsuits in his testimony representative foley who along with rep shaw introduced the bill noted that the ada was an important piece of civil rights legislation but stated that to put it simply the ada is being used by some attorneys to shake down thousands of businesses from florida to california14 rep foley observed that title iii of the ada does not allow for the collection of damages by plaintiffs but does allow for attorneys fees and stated the some attorneys apparently have figured out that the ada can be real cash cow for minimum work on their part15 he cited the actions of group in florida that filed blizzard of lawsuits against dozens of businesses as exemplifying the reason for hr 3590 one of the most prominent supporters of hr 3590 clint eastwood testified in support of the legislation at hearings noting that he had been sued because hotel he owned was not in compliance with the ada the suit against his mission ranch hotel and restaurant alleged that at least one bathroom and the hotel parking lot did not complyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20596crs4 16 clint eastwood battles disabled advocates usa today may 18 2000

that he and other small businesses were being preyed upon by money seeking attorneys16 christopher bell the managing partner of national managem ent labor and employment law firm also argued in support of hr 3590 he described ada drive by suits as all too common with four major ada enforcement groups having filed 112 lawsuits since january 1 2000 mr bell concluded that hr 3590 does not make any substantive legal changes to the ada it does not reduce in any way or to any degree the substantive rights of persons with disabilities several witnesses testified concerning their specific knowledge regarding certain lawsuits tammy fields testifying on behalf of the palm beach county board of county commissioners stated that the county commissioners adopted resolution urging passage of the hr 3590 this occurred after thirtyeight law suits were filed by one law firm in two week period against small businesses in depressed area17 donna and david batelaan testified that they were the coowners of mobility equipment business in florida and had mobility impairments themselves they were sued for parking spaces that were not in compliance with the ada they lauded the purposes and effects of the ada without which we may not have been able to come here today to testify but argued for notice for small businesses so they would not be subjected to large attorneys fees18 terri lynn davis manager or commercial office and retail center and volunteer for group raising money for united cerebral palsy testified about her experience in being sued for having six instead of seven parking places available for individuals with disabilities19 hearing testimony in opposition to hr 3590 although the actions of some attorneys are almost universally deplored there is considerable disagreement concerning whether the approach taken by hr 3590 is appropriate one of the hearing witnesses andrew levy trial lawyer from maryland argued that the proposed amendment will make enforcement of the ada cumbersome much more expensive and from practical standpoint frequently impossible worse it will eliminate much of the existing incentive businesses have to attempt to comply with thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20596crs5 20 testimony of andrew d levy hr 3590 the ada notification act before the house committee on the judiciary subcommittee on the constitution may 18 2000

may 18 2000 published at httpwwwhousegovjudiciaryshot0518htm 24 id mr shotz gave an example of how the legislation would work if an individual with quadriplegia encounters an inaccessible restaurant he stated that she would have to go to the library to find the details for the width of door and then go back to the restaurant to measure the door and either pay lawyer to write letter or write one herself and go to the post office to mail the letter certified mail then she must go back to the restaurant after 90 days to determine if the condition has been corrected 25 testimony of dr steven rattner hr 3590 the ada notification act before the house continuedlaw voluntarily20 he noted that there was damage provision in the law and observed that since there was risk of damages the effect of prohibiting lawsuits unless they get 90 days notice is to allow indeed encourage them to do nothing until they get letter21 he also observed that attorneys fees are only available if the plaintiff wins and are limited to what the judge finds is reasonable and that the department of justice has significant technical assistance available for small businesses in addition mr levy questioned the attorneys fees mr eastwood indicated were involved in his case stating the fees could only have grown to the size they did because of his refusal to comply with the law voluntarily and the scorched earth manner in which his lawyer conducted the defense22 another witness fred shotz the ada consultant for the city of lake worth florida also argued against the legislation stating that the ada is not broken and it does not need to be fixed23 mr shotz made several specific arguments first he stated that the bill would have much broader impact than describe d and would affect all businesses not simply small business he observed that there are various categories of lawsuits under title iii of the ada including suits involving new construction additions to existing facilities alterations to existing facilities accessible route improvements and architectural barrier removal in entities of various sizes of these types of suits mr shotz stated that only architectural barrier removal in facilities owned by small partnerships and individuals would possibly be worthy of the protections of the legislation he also argued that bill would require every individual with disability to know the details regarding ada access requirements and would limit an individuals ability to obtain legal representation24 mr shotz noted that he was aware of several law firms that were taking advantage of disability laws he felt that this problem could be addressed by the ethical requirements of the bar and the authority of district court judges dr steven rattner dentist who has been deaf from birth also testified against the legislation arguing that adding the notice provision would create significant barriers to obtaining accommodations such as sign language interpreters for continuing education classes25 similarly christine griffin the executive director of the disability law centerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20596crs6 25 continued committee on the judiciary subcommittee on the
