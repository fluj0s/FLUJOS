billion for the biennium 20082009 as we all know th is 419 billion proposal represents only part of the actual budget in additi on the secretarygeneral simultaneously but separately identified various add ons to the base budget that would bring the actual 20082009 budget up to approximately 48 billion the 20062007 approved budget was 3799 billion though it ultimately totaled 417 billion the 20082009 projected budget of 48 billi on represents 15 increase over the 20062007 budgethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33611crs19 38 statement by ambassador mark d wallace us representative for management and reform on the 20082009 budget in the fifth committee of the general assembly december 11 2007 see enclosed materialsthe proposed regular budget with just the add ons already identified by the secretarygeneral makes this budget the largest regular budget in the history of the this budget also represents the largest increase in the history of the on dollar basis moreover even this 48 billion figure is not what any of us expect as the final budget because it does not take into account additional proposals that have more recently been identified or which we can expect during the course of the biennium we expect that the final actual total budget of the 20082009 biennium to be in excess of approximately 52 billion accordingly such final budget is likely to represent an increase of 25 or more from the 20062007 budget and lets remember what such an increase actually funds as my colleagues from the g77 and china rightly point out in paragra ph 30 of the draft resolution before us approximately 75 percent of the budget resources are related to salaries and common staff cost the budget increase does not go directly to humanitarian or development aid but rather to incr easing the size of the secretariat bureaucracy we all agree that the piecemeal ad hoc approach of the current budget is inconsistent with sound budgeting practices see paragraphs 9 and 35 of the draft resolution on the 20082009 bie nnium budget moreover we are concerned that substantial cuts or offsets have been proposed by the secretarygeneral or member states to th is largest of all budget increases38 for
