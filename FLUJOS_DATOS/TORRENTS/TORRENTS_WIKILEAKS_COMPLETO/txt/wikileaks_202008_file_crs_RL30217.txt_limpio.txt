compensation are emerging in federal legislation for example the teacher quality enhancement grants program added to the higher education act in 1998 authorizes participating states to provide financial awards to teachers and principals when their students make significant academic improvement such awards may be part of performancebased compensation systems efforts by federal policymakers

policymakers at the federal state and local levels are considering and often implementing policies that link elementary and secondary school teachers salaries or financial awards to their performance or to the performance of their students these performancebased pay plans include broad array of different kinds of efforts ranging from meritpay plans for individual teachers to schoolbased performance award plans that may reward teachers for the overall performance of their schools1 this report is intended to provide background on performancebased pay that may be useful as legislative efforts in this area are considered by the congress it defines payforperformance plans and summarizes criteria that are important to the success of such plans implementation hurdles that may arise in meritpay plans one of the most widelystudied types of individual performancebased pay plans are summarized the relative strengths and weaknesses of individual payfor performance plans versus group incentive pay plans are also discussed throughout the report emphasizes the experience of performancebased pay plans for teachers by examining both the potential and the limitations of such plans in an educational setting this is background report and will not track legislative action in this area based on review of the research on performancebased pay in general and for teachers in particular several key issues emerge interest in performancebased pay for teachers arises in part from basic dissatisfaction with the traditional salary schedule many policymakers believe that the traditional salary schedule provides incentive for teachers to demonstrate subject matter competence improve teaching or increase academic performance by students there is single model of performancebased pay plans these plans can vary markedly in terms of such features as their measures of performance the size of the financial awards provided and the portion of the teaching force the plans might benefit successful implementation of performancebased pay plans depends on host of factors many of which may be complex and difficult to achieve among the most important of these factors is development of process for evaluating performance that is considered fair and reliable and that has desirable effects on the teaching force other important factors include ensuring that the 1 in practice terminology in this area is used loosely terms such as meritpay are often used to describe wide range of pay options with different characteristics in this report the term performancebased pay encompasses any pay that is linked to measures of performance crs2 portion of the teaching force that can receive the financial incentives and the size of the financial incentives provided are sufficient to provide appropriate incentives for teacher improvement many past plans appear to have been shortlived there is little unequivocal evidence of enhanced teacher performance as result of meritpay plans the most studied of performancebased pay plans for teachers2 performancebased pay for teachers is evolving policymakers are considering various alternative approaches that may address shortcomings of previous efforts in particular districts and states are looking to performance based pay plans that reward teachers for the overall performance of their schools federal interest interest by the congress in changes to teacher compensation policies arises because of concern about the academic performance of this countrys elementary and secondary school students and growing recognition that the quality of the teaching force is critical to the success of any educational reforms undertaken this interest focuses on utilizing the salary schedule to improve teacher quality by leveraging changes in teachers behavior knowledge and skills and by making teaching more attractive financially to successful teachers and to highly able individuals outside of teaching traditionally federal involvement in precollege teaching has not addressed the nature of the compensation instead it has focused on improving professional development or inservice training training for current teachers preservice training training for prospective teachers and teacher recruitment nevertheless significant amounts of funding from several federal programs support the salaries of specific kinds of teachers including teachers and paraprofessionals serving educationally disadvantaged students under the compensatory education program title i of the elementary and secondary education act and newly hired teachers under the class size reduction program fy1999 omnibus appropriations legislation reform of teacher compensation is emerging in federal legislation the recently enacted 1998 teacher quality enhancement grants program title ii of the higher education act authorizes participating states to provide financial awards to teachers and principals when their students make significant academic improvement such awards may be part of performancebased compensation systems the 106th congress actively considered legislation that would have supported meritpay for teachers but as of the date of this report had not enacted such legislation further in 1999 the us secretary of education richard riley called on school districts to 2 meritpay provides compensation to individual teachers based on certain activities they undertake or on demonstrated results of teaching performance crs3 take serious look at new and developing concept called knowledge and skills based pay3 performancebased pay in general this section first considers performancebased pay as it is applied to employees in general not just those in the teaching ranks this helps set the context for the remainder of the report which address performancebased pay for teachers specifically what is payforperformance payforperformance plans attempt to correlate employee pay directly with employee output payforperformance plans may take the form of individual incentive plans or group incentive plans performancebased pay is consistent with widely held beliefs that employees should be rewarded based on effort and with theories of human motivation which contend that effective motivation is predicated on close relationship between performance and rewards individual incentive pay plans most employers rely principally on timebased pay paying employees on an hourly or salaried basis but incorporate some form of performancebased pay on an adjunct basis implementation of performancebased pay requires supervisory time and consequently entails costs for employee monitoring especially for meritpay which also requires regular performance evaluations however it is presumed that because of the additional incentives to individual performance less supervision will be required than under strictly timebased pay meritpay is an individual incentive plan that rewards productive workers with larger annual wage increases4 the term meritpay is also frequently used to describe incentive bonuses which are awarded to individuals on the basis of performance but are not added to base pay because meritpay may be used in workplaces where output is not readily measurable unlike individual incentive plans such as piecework pay and commission pay which are generally only used when output is readily measurable and because it can entail more supervisory time for performance evaluation than other individual incentive pay plans it may be the most complex of the individual incentive pay plans to administer meritpay or some variation thereof such as merit bonuses is widely used throughout the private and public sector for these reasons this section focuses on meritpay to illustrate the potential conceptual 3 riley

wwwedgovspeeches for this report knowledge and skillsbased pay is considered to be kind of performancebased pay it is provided to teachers when they have successfully acquired specific knowledge and skills often aligned with district educational standards or objectives 4 other types of individual incentive plans include 1 piece rate pay the employee receives fixed amount for each item produced 2 commission pay the employee receives percentage of the value of the output sold crs4 and implementation problems that may arise with individual performancebased pay plans much of the literature on meritpay has focused on whether it serves as an effective inducement to greater employee productivity and whether one can accurately measure employee performance central component of all meritpay plans in survey of the empirical evidence on meritpay plans robert heneman found that meritpay can increase employee motivation and performance however heneman contends that in order for meritpay plan to be successful all of the following criteria must be met employees value meritpay performance can be measured accurately employees trust management and the meritpay budget is adequate even if these conditions are present meritpay plan may fail when it is not properly administered careful attention must be given to the introduction of the program the total compensation package the performanceappraisal system the formulas used to determine merit the method by which meritpay decisions are communicated to employees and the monitoring of the outcomes associated with meritpay5 accurately assessing employee performance in jobs where individual output is not readily measurable is quite difficult in practice this is because large number of variables affect the relationship between pay and performance 6 the issue of appropriately evaluating individual performance is also complicated by the fact that so much performance is affected by factors outside workers control for example whether or not necessary equipment is in good working order an employer may decide to award meritpay based on relative performance among employees who face similar external constraints however this may discourage group cooperation and might even lead to undercutting others or politicking instead of producing in order to improve ones apparent relative performance to the detriment of the employer in addition accurate measurement of individual performance is frequently limited by the practical difficulty of apportioning the output among the workers who contributed to it thus from the employers perspective finding good measures of individual output and setting rates are difficult one solution is compensating workers for output that can be measured objectively however this deemphasizes aspects of the job that cannot be measured or less easily lend themselves to measurement for example some argue that measuring teacher performance on the basis of pupil test scores encourages teachers to exclusively focus on teaching the test to the detriment of students in other areas7 5 heneman robert pay for performance exploring the merit system 1984 p 21 6 heneman robert merit pay linking pay increases to performance ratings 1992 examples of these variables include the overall environment in which the employer operates such as whether or not there is union unions typically oppose meritpay measures instead arguing for objective measure for pay increases like seniority the characteristics and culture of the firm as well as of the characteristics and background of the evaluator and the employee 7 output is more easily measured in some occupations such as manufacturing or sales but continued crs5 addressing these issues and ensuring fairness in the performance evaluation process itself are critical to the employers success in convincing employees that meritpay plan is fair in order for meritpay plan to be effective an employer must be able to provide answers to the following two questions that arise among employees 1 why does worker x get meritpay and i dont 2 what can i do to get meritpay8 murnane and cohen conclude that most plans that are truly meritpay plans fail to provide good answers to these questions other authors argue that these questions can be answered satisfactorily by welldesigned plan cohn for example uses the illustration of specific meritbased bonus plan for teachers to argue that meritpay plan that 1 provides explicit criteria that teacher must meet in order to receive meritpay including attendance performance evaluation selfimprovement and student achievement and 2 that is administered by committee composed mainly by teachers can adequately address murnane and cohens two questions the answer to question 1 is worker x got the award because she met the criteria and you didnt and the answer to question 2 is if you too will work to meet the criteria eg attendance or selfimprovement then you too will receive an award9 furthermore cohn argues that meritpay plan need not influence all employees to be effective so long as it influences the behavior of many employees10 some authors have suggested adaptations to traditional meritpay plans that would counter some of their shortcomings traditional meritpay plans are based on an annual pay increase that is incorporated into an employees base pay because the increase is then permanent part of base pay and because employee pay is rarely reduced for subsequent low performance meritpay raises effectively create an annuity that can be an expensive fixed cost to an organization during economic downturns11 7 continued workers paid on piece rate or on commission basis have an incentive to emphasize quantity over quality and to put their own interests ahead of other workers in the firm to the potential detriment of the firm 8 murnane richard and david cohen merit pay and the evaluation problem why most merit pay plans fail and few survive harvard education review v 56 1 february 1996 9 cohn elchanan methods of teacher remuneration merit pay and career ladders assessing education practices the contribution of economics edited by william becker and william baumol 1996 10 ibid p 221 11 fisher cynthia lyle schoenfeldt and james shaw human resource management 1996 crs6 most organizations employ meritpay raises in an overall compensation context that includes pay ranges for specific jobs as consequence it can be difficult for meritpay to achieve both goals of rewarding and retaining high performing employees new employees are usually hired near the bottom of their pay range even with meritpay increases that are in the high range new hires who are excellent performers may feel underpaid and seek other employment senior employees who are excellent performers on the other hand may receive virtually meritpay increases because they have bumped up against the ceiling of their pay range in both instances meritpay increases will not have the intended effect the result is lose lose situation an expensive annuity for the organization and topperforming employee who does not feel rewarded12 furthermore it is significant changes in pay in the context of adequate overall compensation rather than total compensation that have been found to motivate current employee performance consequently one method employers have adopted in lieu of traditional meritpay plans is to reward excellent performers with lumpsum bonuses rather than with permanent salary increase because employees respond to changes in pay 5 one time bonus of 1000 to an employee earning 20000 year may be more motivating than the same 5 increase incorporated into salary at 1925 week bonuses also give employers more flexibility to be generous in good years because they are not incurring permanent annuity however if employers choose to adopt merit bonuses rather than meritbased salary increases they must first assure that current base salaries are equitable based on employee performance13 group incentive pay plans group incentive plans reward organizationwide effort because group incentive plans ideally foster cooperation and teamwork rather than competition among coworkers they overcome one of the potential limitations of individual incentive plans group incentive plans in contrast are sometimes criticized for not sufficiently recognizing individual effort in practice many employers rely on both group and individual incentives to try and enhance individual performance and teamwork gainsharing plans which tie part of pay to some measure of group effort combine some components of individual performance plans in addition to potentially enhancing group effort14 gainsharing rewards are tied to improvements in organizational performance attributable to factors controllable by employees thus gainsharing plans affect performance by influencing employee motivation and organizational culture gainsharing plans do not however eliminate the difficulty of appropriately measuring performance for example gainsharing rewards may be tied 12 ibid 13 dessler gary human resource management 1997 p 481 14 in addition to gainsharing other group incentive pay plans are profitsharing and esops the most often employed group incentive plan is profitsharing used in least onethird of us organizations see lawler edward strategic pay 1990 for more on esops see crs report rl30038 employee stock ownership plans esops description and economic analysis by gerald mayer crs7 to easily measurable costs like labor costs but if labor costs are not the only significant factor in organizational performance then the success of the gainsharing plan will be thwarted employees may speed up their work pushing labor costs down by being more careless with supplies and machinery pushing supply costs up gainsharing is more difficult to successfully implement in situations where adequately measuring performance is complicated performancebased pay plans for teachers performancebased pay for teachers has long history particularly in the form of meritpay which has fallen into and out of favor in public schools repeatedly throughout the 20th century 15 this ebb and flow is reflected in the fact that meritpay programs in school districts typically have life span of less than 5 years16 relatively few teachers currently report receiving any form of performancebased pay 1996 survey found that only slightly more than 5 of all public school teachers received some form of performancebased pay 17 the average amount of such compensation for those who did receive it was 1335 the extent to which teachers currently have the opportunity to participate in such plans is not known over the long term interest in performancebased pay plans has been sparked by dissatisfaction with the traditional pay schedule for teachers this section begins with consideration of the traditional pay schedule following that are description of different kinds of performancebased pay plans delineation of several implementation issues that arise with these plans and review of several specific examples of these plans implemented by different states and districts traditional pay schedule teacher salary schedules are primarily determined at the level of the individual school district18 they are often the subject of negotiation between local school boards and teacher unions where applicable for much of the 20th century most 15 murnane richard j and david k cohen merit pay and the evaluation problem understanding why most merit pay plans fail and few survive institute for research on educational finance and governance stanford university november 1985 hereafter cited as murnane and cohn merit pay and the evaluation problem 16 there is significant amount of literature on the history of meritpay programs among teachers and the difficulties many of these plans have encountered the discussion below highlights number of problems that have arisen with meritpay 17 national education association status of the american public school teacher 1995 1996 1997 p 70 these data are derived from sample survey respondents were asked to identify sources of additional income performancebased or incentive pay was one of the choices offered 18 nearly half 23 of all states have statewide salary schedule that generally sets minimum salary levels usually local districts can exceed these minimum levels when fashioning salary schedules for their teachers education commission of the states teacher salary schedules ecs information clearinghouse september 1997 crs8 elementary and secondary school teachers have worked under the socalled single salary schedule19 this schedule bases teachers salary on two factors the number of years of teaching experience the individual has and the number of educational credits and degrees the individual has earned increases in both teaching experience and creditsdegrees lead to increases in salary up to absolute limits imposed by the applicable pay schedule the single salary schedule emerged as response to equity concerns about previous pay systems that often based salary on such factors as teachers gender race level elementary or secondary or marital and family situation although starting salaries for teachers have become more competitive with salaries for other college graduates the dispersion of teachers salaries are not commensurate with those available to other college graduates20 the relatively low maximum potential salary for teachers in combination with the single salary schedule which is currently used in the vast majority of districts is argued by some to fail to draw the highest caliber of potential teachers into the field reward teachers who are exceptionally productive or allocate the supply of teachers to fields where they are most needed like math and science criticism of the single salary schedule has undergirded efforts to implement performancebased pay plans in elementary and secondary education disenchantment with the single salary schedule focuses on the two central factors it uses to allocate wages more years of experience and higher levels of education critics view it as largely rewarding longevity and the accumulation of college credits not classroom effectiveness some researchers have found that these two factors experience and level of education have relatively little beneficial impact on classroom effectiveness as measured by the achievement of teachers students eric hanushek has concluded the results of review of the available research are startlingly consistent in finding strong evidence that teacherstudent ratios teacher education or teacher experience have an expected positive effect on student achievement21 nevertheless these conclusions about the relationship of experience and levels of education are debated for example based on their analysis of the literature rob greenwald et concluded resource variables that attempt to describe the quality of teachers teacher ability teacher education and teacher experience show very strong relations with student achievement22 19 protsik jean history of teacher pay and incentive

have features that fall into at least two broad categories teacherbased meritpay and schoolbased performance awards these correspond to the individual and group incentive pay plans described earlier in this report as illustrated below individual plans may draw from both of these categories teacherbased meritpay this kind of pay is based on an individual teachers performance inside andor outside of the classroom that performance can be defined and measured in myriad ways teachers may be rewarded for their perceived impact on various outcomes of their particular students such as achievement levels they may also be rewarded on the basis of such factors as evaluators assessments of their performance in the classroom completion of targeted activities that increase their subject matter knowledge or specific skills23 the range of duties assumed or the extent and quality of their interaction with other teachers schoolbased performance awards these awards are based on the aggregate performance of schools that may include wide range of possible measures student related measures may include achievement levels attendance rates dropout rates for secondary schools participation rates in advanced placement courses for secondary schools college going rates for secondary schools etc measures of school performance need not be studentbased for example they may include the extent of parental and community involvement in school activities or whether the schools have developed and implemented new curricula the awards are made to individual schools for use at the school level some but not all of the initiatives being implemented that include schoolbased performance awards call for distribution of these awards to individual teachers as additional compensation or permit such use of the awards implementation issues for performancebased pay in education the difficulties encountered in implementing performancebased pay plans in general discussed above can also arise in attempts to implement performancebased pay for teachers these difficulties primarily involve measures of teacher output or performance impact on desired behavior by teachers 22 continued public education new evidence on how and why money matters harvard journal on legislation 1991 and national commission on teaching and americas future doing what matters most investing in quality teaching november 1997 23 knowledge and skillsbased pay plans specifically identify skills and knowledge that are considered necessary for achievement of education reform objectives financial awards are provided to teachers who demonstrate that they have achieved such skills and knowledge see odden allan and carolyn kelley paying teachers for what they know and do new and smarter compensation strategies to improve schools 1997 hereafter cited as odden and kelly paying teachers for what they know and do crs10 measuring output or performance measuring teacher output is quite difficult many highly valued activities by teachers are qualitative and as consequence hard to measure one key problem in predicting teacher quality is that managers using the criteria demand quantitative measurements while the factors that actually relate to classroom performance are typically qualitative and vague even if the factors important in producing good teacher were known specifying true quality and implementation standards would still be exceedingly difficult24 meritpay plans founder frequently on the evaluation portion of the plans which often have required assessment of teacher performance by principals teachers or others in many instances teachers have considered the process to be illdefined overly subjective or basically biased students test scores are often suggested and sometimes used as measure of teacher effectiveness to many advocates performancebased pay provides an opportunity to interject into teacher pay measure of accountability for highly desired outcome changes in student achievement scores test scores may be viewed as more quantitative and less subjective way of gauging teacher performance than traditional evaluation procedures debate over this use of student test scores focuses on the attribution of changes in student test scores to the effectiveness of an individual teacher given the multitude of other factors including family background and the quality of previous teachers that are known to influence achievement in addition issues arise concerning the validity and reliability of the testing instruments and whether such assessment instruments measure the full range of student outcomes that policymakers and others desire teachers to achieve with their students25 generating desired teacher behavior as noted if evaluations are not to be subjective in nature quantitative measures of output are helpful however if quantitative measures like student test scores are used to measure teacher performance then teachers will be encouraged to emphasize teaching that will improve test scores potentially at the expense of other teaching tasks and at the expense of cooperation with other teachers for example if teachers are rewarded for rise in student reading scores in economic terms there is effectively zero price for student improvements in other areas teachers would have an incentive to neglect 24 hanushek eric making schools work washington the brookings institution 1994 p 79 25 cohn methods of teacher remuneration glass gene v using student test scores to evaluate teachers the new handbook of teacher evaluation assessing elementary and

and motivation edited by larry frase 1992 crs11 other subjects and to focus on students who are likeliest to bring up their reading scores the most with the least amount of teacher attention26 in addition to difficulties encountered in finding accurate measures of teacher performance meritpay may encourage opportunistic behavior like minimizing group related activities this would potentially be detrimental because much of the work of schools involves significant cooperation and teamwork among teachers for example some teachers monitor halls so others can teach all teachers work together to encourage good citizenship and to discourage drugs and violence evidence of success compounding the implementation issues considered above is the absence of evidence from previous research that financial incentives provided through performancebased pay in general or meritpay in particular change teacher behavior in ways that lead to increased student achievement in her history of teacher compensation protsik concluded many individual meritpay plans were adopted as means to increase teacher accountability and improve classroom performance for the most part these plans not only failed to improve student achievement but also destroyed teachers collaboration with each other and teachers trust in the administrators in charge of evaluating their performance 27 morrow found in her analysis of several states and districts with performancebased pay plans that although all showed some degree of improvement in student performance there was evidence in this study to support the position that it was payforperformance which improved student achievement28 given the complexity diversity and shortterm nature of most of the performancebased pay plans that have been implemented such findings may be expected this research does not suggest that performancebased pay plans are never associated with improved student performance and that more of them could not be fashioned that would be successful in this way further much of the available research is dated focused largely on meritpay plans and not necessarily applicable to different approaches to performancebased pay plans that appear to be increasingly popular particularly schoolbased performance awards 26 murnane and cohn merit pay and the evaluation problem 27 protsik history of teacher pay p 285286 28 morrow sharon yvonne study of student achievement results using selected teacher payforperformance models teacher performance dissertation baylor university 1992 p 229 hereafter cited as morrow study of student achievement results crs12 examples of performancebased pay plans several examples of performancebased pay plans are described below this is not representative sample of plans29 rather it is intended to show that performancebased pay plans for teachers can be structured in many different ways the factors that can trigger financial reward for teacher may range from certification by the national board for professional teaching standards30 to completion of skill or knowledgebuilding activity to improved academic performance of students individual teachers may receive financial compensation for their individual performance or they may share in group award particular grades or subjects may be targeted academic or nonacademic activities of teachers may be eligible for additional pay these plans may be established by districts or states despite these and other differences in the programs the performancebased pay in each case above was an extension or adjunct to the single salary schedule not replacement for that schedule examples of wholly performancebased pay plans were not located in the available literature where some information is available the impact of these plans is noted seiling school district meritpay program frequently cited in the research was initiated in the seiling oklahoma school district in 1980 and continued through 1986 when it was terminated for budgetary reasons31 this program included both teacherbased meritpay as well as schoolbased performance awards during the programs existence awards to teachers in addition to salary were based on student achievement outcomes in reading at the elementary and secondary school level mathematics at the elementary school level and various other subjects at the secondary school level those teachers agreeing to participate entered into separate contract acknowledging that the merit award was not part of their salary and would not carry forward into subsequent years in other words the payment had to be earned each year and was not covered by any costofliving adjustment applied to base salary the district set objectives for gains in achievement tests in reading math and other subjects participating elementary teachers received 500 bonus if their 29 there are numerous recent examples not described in this report that may also be of interest among them are the pilot program underway in the denver colorado public school district in which bonus payments are made to voluntarily participating teachers on the basis of improvements in classroom test scores and the new plan being implemented in the cincinnati ohio public school system which replaces the traditional salary schedule with one basing compensation increases and career mobility on teacher evaluations it might also be noted that oregon voters rejected 2000 ballot measure that would have tied each individual public school teachers base salary and salary increases other than cost of living increases to growth in the appropriate knowledge of his or her students 30 the board nonprofit organization is creating and implementing an assessment process to certify on voluntary basis teachers across the country who meet high standards nearly 9500 teachers have already achieved national board certification 31 see for example hatry harry p and john m greiner issues and case studies in teacher incentive plans the urban institute 1985 p 181186 hereafter cited as hatry and greiner issues and case studies in teacher incentive plans morrow study of student achievement results p 158164 there were approximately 44 teachers working in this district of 550 students crs13 schools achieved the districts reading objective and an additional 250 bonus if their individual classes met the reading goal and another 250 if the classes met the math objective secondary teachers received 300 bonus if their school reached the reading objective and 140 bonuses for each of their five classes that reached their subjects objectives the total that could be earned by an individual teacher was 100032 douglas county school district in 1994 the board of education of the douglas county colorado school district and the douglas county federation of teachers agreed to performancebased pay plan33 under this plan teachers in the district have pay schedule that determines base salary levels on length of service and education level but increases in salary are dependent upon teachers being evaluated as proficient teachers also are eligible for bonus pay under six different components of the districts compensation framework outstanding teacher bonuses four types of bonuses worth 1250 year to teacher are available type bonuses go to individual teachers in recognition of their classroom performance determined on basis of portfolios documenting teaching practices with review and selection made by the teachers principals the criteria evaluated include instructional skills content knowledge and collaboration with other teachers type b bonuses are tied to teachers demonstration through portfolios that their instructional practice is standardsbased type c bonuses are for teachers pursuing national board certification and type d bonuses being piloted for 20002001 are tied directly to achievement increases in each teachers students group incentive bonuses bonuses to teachers who are involved in an approved schoolwide activity focused on student performance with measurable outcomes bonuses made on basis of the teachers having implemented the proposed activity not necessarily having improved student performance the size of the bonus to each teacher depends upon the number of schools and teachers successfully implementing proposed activities site responsibility bonuses schoolbased bonuses used to pay teachers for activities beyond those normally arising from classroom instruction eg chairing school committee doing special activities with students etc fixed amount is distributed to each school in the district committee of teachers at the building level determines how the schoollevel award is to be 32 the plan was intended to improve teacher retention and increase student test scores for neither of these objectives did the district have substantive data that predated the implementation of the plan available data appear inconclusive concerning the impact of the plan on overall test scores in the district see hatry and greiner issues and case studies in teacher incentive plans morrow study of student achievement results 33 odden and kelley paying teachers for what they know and

traditional single salary schedule35 teachers move up the salary schedule primarily on the basis of longevity and credits earned nevertheless teachers who hold certification from the national board for professional teaching standards receive an additional 15 salary supplement half of that additional compensation is provided solely on the basis of the receipt of the certification the other half is to compensate board certified teachers for additional professional duties they perform georgia payforperformance program the state of georgia administers program that awards funds to schools that

resource development evidence of an increase in teachers knowledge and skills school reorganization or restructuring that lead to achievement gains schools submit initial applications for participation by the march prior to the applicable school year these applications are reviewed by statewide panel of 34 evaluations of the douglas county pay plan appear to have centered largely on how well teachers understand the plan how they have reacted to it and what impact they believe it has had for example teachers believed that the group incentive bonuses positively affected student

which are used to evaluate whether schools performance objectives have been met the size of the award per school depends upon the number of certified personnel at the recipient schools and the amount of funding appropriated for the program the uses of funds at individual schools which can include teacher bonuses or spending on instructionally related activities are determined by consensus of certified personnel at those schools for 19992000 awards in the amount of 125 million were made to 110 of the 165 schools that submitted acceptable plans 2000 provided per certified staff member in successful schools37 implications for federal policymaking several findings from the preceding analysis appear to be important for federal policymakers as they consider legislative efforts to make some portion of the compensation of elementary and secondary school teachers sensitive to performance either of the teacher or of the teachers students the discussion below identifies some of these findings and their importance for policymaking in this area in the development of and debate over federal initiatives to support performancebased pay plans it is important to recognize that there is single model for such pay plans the illustrative examples demonstrate that the plans can differ markedly among the characteristics upon which they differ are their measures of performance the size of the financial awards provided and the portion of the teaching force the plans might benefit as consequence federal legislation in this area may apply to plans with many different features at issue then are the characteristics of the plans that are intended to be supported through federal initiatives the terms used in legislation may be ambiguous in application for example title ii of the hea authorizes states to use teacher quality enhancement grants to support performancebased compensation systems hea ii section 202d5 without further definition are these plans to be teacherbased or schoolbased whose performance is to be measured the teachers or that of the teachers students how should that performance be measured similar kinds of questions would be triggered by other terms that have been considered in legislative action such as meritpay or performance pay 37 an evaluation provided by the georgia department of education the pay for performance program evidence of program impact august 2000 online httpwwwdoek12gaus concluded that math and reading test scores were higher in participating schools than in other schools including comparable schools in terms of students free lunch eligibility 135 of the poverty threshold participating schools reported that the program helped to improve student achievement faculty collaboration and attention to school goals among other positive outcomes nevertheless the evaluation did not attempt to measure the impact if any that participation might have had on participating schools test scores in comparison to these schools preparticipation scores crs16 at the same time precise definition of performancebased pay plans in legislation may inappropriately narrow the range of plans that could be supported under federal initiative available research suggests that successful implementation of performancebased pay plans has been the exception rather than the rule particularly if measure of success is longevity of the program or evidence of positive impact on student achievement nevertheless researchers and policymakers in districts and states are exploring and implementing performancebased pay plans that are intended to address the shortcomings of previous efforts such as basing financial awards on schoolbased performance or on the acquisition of skills and content knowledge closely aligned to academic standards and goals still others call for direct links between teacher salaries and student test scores however as of yet there is consensus on what works best and which direction to go many analysts therefore support including diversity and experimentation in any future federal initiatives in this area for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30217
