mandatory minimum sentencing statutes legislative proposals in the 108th congress charles doyle senior specialist american law division summary federal mandatory minimum sentencing statutes mandatory minimums demand that execution or incarceration follow crimin conviction they cover drug dealing murdering federal officials and using gun to commit federal crime they circumscribe judicial sentencing discretion they have been criticized as unthinkingly harsh and incompatible with rational sentencing guideline system yet they have also been embraced as hallmarks of truth in ntence and certain means of incapacitating the criminally dangerous mandatory minimum sentences are not unconstitutional per although on rare occasions individual ntences may violate th eighth amendment proscription on grossly dispr oportionate punishments the 108th congress appeared to overcome recent past reluctance and enacted flurry of new or enhanced mandatory minimum sentencing provisions the pro tect act sometimes known as the amber alert act pl 10821 contains two strike law that s ubjects certain repeat offenders of crimes against children to life imprisonment b increases the mandatory minimums application to various federal child offenses and c applies the mandatory minimums covering child pornography to obscen visual representations of the sexual abuse of children the unborn victims of vi olence act establishes separate crime for harming an unborn child during the course the commission of various federal crimes against the childs mother some which carry mandatory minimums and subjects offenders to the same penaltie s as the underlying offense against the mother 18 usc 1841 the identity theft penalty enhancemen t act established an aggravated identity theft offense with mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment for identity theft committed in furtherance of various terrorist and nonterrorist fede ral crimes 18 usc 1028a the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act

united states shall be imprisoned for life emphasis added 2 eg 18 usc 1201awhoever unlawfully seizes confines inveigles decoys kidnaps abducts or carries away and holds for ransom or reward or otherwise any person if death of any person results shall be punished by death or life imprisonment most observers would include w ithin this category capital crimes made punishable by death life imprisonment or imprisonment for any term of years the suggestion that sentence of imprisonment for zero years is sentence of any term of years being inconsistent with the intent of congress given the seriousness of the ffense to which the sentence attaches on the other hand most probably would not characterize as mandatory minimum any capital or flat sentence statute that permitted imposition of fine as an alternative sentence see eg 18 usc 1589 emphasis added if death results from violation of this section the defendant shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for any term of years or life 3 eg 18 usc 2 whoever commit an offense against the united states or aids abets counsels commands induces or procures its commission is punishable as principal345 hr 404 hr 1435 hr 4547 hr 5103 s

sentenci ng statutes an overview of legislation in 106th congress and crs report rs21346 mandatory minimum senten ces three strikes in the supreme court types of mandatory minimums mandatory minimum statutes come in many stripes including some whose status might be disputed the most widely recogn ized are those that demand that offenders be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than designated term of imprisonment some like the drug trafficking mandatory minimums are triggered by the nature of the offense others like the three strikes provisions by the criminal record of the offender few members of this category are somewhat less mandatory than others several of the drug related mandatory minimums in this category for instance are subject to safety valve that may make their minimu m penalties less than mandatory for small time nonviolent first time offenders second generally recognized category of mandatory minimums consists of the flat or single sentence statutes1 closely related are the capital punishment statutes that require imposition of either the death penalty or imprisonment for life2 the piggyback statutes make up third class the piggyback statutes are not themselves mandatory minimums but sentence offenders by reference to an underlying statute which in some instances calls for mandatory minimum3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21597crs3 constitutional boundaries the constitution precludes mandatory capital punishment statutes woodson v north carolina 428 us 280 1976 and sentences that are grossly disproportionate to the crimes for which they are
