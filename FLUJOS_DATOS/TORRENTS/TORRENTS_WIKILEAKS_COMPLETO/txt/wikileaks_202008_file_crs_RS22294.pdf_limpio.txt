wages than of higher earners wages when person applies for survivors benefits the deceased workers basic benefit amount is determined8 qualifying survivors will recei ve percentage of this basic benefit amount depending on their age and th eir relationship to the deceased worker survivors benefits may be subject to reductions based on their earnings and family size if survivor qualifies both
