practice most legislation is referred by committee to subcommittee prior to consideration by the full committee however some committees retain specific legislation at the fullcommittee level for example the ways and means committee keeps legislation amending the income tax sections of the internal revenue code at full committee and the natural resources committee retains matters relating to native americans for the full committee g21g157g138g143g143g561g138g151g141g561g8g158g151g141g146g151g144g561 in the 104th congress the republican majority adopted procedures whereby all subcommittee

leader determines and provides to other republican members of the committee the method for selecting subcommittee leaders however majority of the republican members of the full committee can disapprove the selection procedure for the 110 th congress subcommittee leaders of the appropriations committee require the approval of the republican steering committee house republicans also limit members to single committee or subcommittee ranking slot although the committee on standards of official conduct and house administration committee are exempt finally republican conference rules prohibit fullcommittee leaders from leading subcommittee of the committee they head under house rules subcommittee chairs are limited to 6 years of service although waivers can be granted house democrats allow each committee member to bid in order of seniority for available subcommittee leadership slots for all committees except appropriations this is done by full committee seniority for appropriations it is done by subcommittee seniority caucus rules generally limit members to chair only one full committee or one subcommittee with legislative jurisdiction some subcommittee leaders require full democratic caucus approval g21g158g139g140g152g150g150g146g157g157g142g142g561g3g156g156g146g144g151g150g142g151g157g156g561 under house rule x clause 5b2a memb ers generally are limited to service on four subcommittees however there are some exceptions house rules are silent on subcommittee assignment procedures they are traditionally governed by party rules and practices republicans
