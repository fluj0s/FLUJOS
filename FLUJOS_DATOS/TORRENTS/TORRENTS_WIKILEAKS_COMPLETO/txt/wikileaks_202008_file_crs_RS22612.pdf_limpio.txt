19512006httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22612crs2 merchandise trade versus trade in goods and services merchandise trade statistics are referred to as census basis statistics because they are collected compiled and distributed by the us census bureau these are the data reported here and constitute the one continuing data series using largely uniform definitions merchandise trade statistics are important because they alone are the basis for commodity and country trade information in january 1994 the us department of commerce began reporting and publishing trade data on goods and services as the be nchmark monthly trade statistic supplementing merchandise trade data services trade statistics are compiled by the bureau of economic analysis bea on balance of payments bop basis to harmonize census merchandise data with bea rvices data statistics on goods and services are reported on bop basis this involves such changes as deducting us military sales from merchandise accounts because th ey are considered services transactions and adding to merchandise statistics parcels mailed to foreigners by individuals in the united states what this means is that the goods component of trade in

transfers and foreign investments exports are defined in this report as total exports they include both domestically produced goods and reexpor ts which constitute imports of goods that are warehoused in the united states then reexported imports are defined here as general imports which measure total arrivals of g oods into the united states imports for both immediate consumption channels and warehouses or foreign trade zones balance of merchandise trade is defined here and in st andard us department of commerce data as total exports minus gene ral imports dollar amounts are current us

goods move in international trade they acqui re more costs although an automobile has one cost at the end of its assembly line it acquires higher cost when shipping and insurance to local dealer or port for export are added for this report current official us government valuation practice is followed total exports are valued free alongside or fas fas figures provide valuation of exports at the port of exportation and thus exclude charges for loading onto the vessel the trans portation itself insurance unloading and foreign transportation general imports are valued on customs valuation
