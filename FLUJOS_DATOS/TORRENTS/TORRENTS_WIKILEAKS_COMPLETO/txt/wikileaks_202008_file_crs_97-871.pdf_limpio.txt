examination of the debates and documents of the constitutional convention4 reveals that the wording changed from census to enumeration the records f the debates on the constitution do not reveal why the wording was changed th change appears in one of the various draf ts so it appears to have been an amendment made in the committee on style possibly the change was made because of religious attitudes regarding the taking of census the tradi tional prejudice against the taking of census not approved by god resulting from the biblical account of pestilenc inflicted on israel because david ordered an unsanctioned numbering may hav caused them to change the terms used many people may still have harbored thi s traditiona l prejudice against the taking of censuses and may have been reluctant t go along with the idea of census the united states was th first country to require5 the regular taking of census although apport ionments are based on the figures from the actual enumeration of the population the original apportionment in the constitution was based on figures from the various states there is clear indication in the record of the debate s about the origins of the figures used or even of the actual figures used however6 the figures used may be those given by charles cotesworth pinckney in speec h before the south carolina house of representatives in january 1788 and published by various newspapers of the time during the period of the articles f7 confedera tion the states had taken population counts or estimates to determine the proportion of the contribution to the general treasury nd payment of the war debt for which each would be responsible although the articles of confederation wer e8 amended in 1783 to provide for triennial census apparently not all of the state s complied with this plan for actual censuses these counts or estimates may hav e9 been the basis of the first apportionment so the original apportionment apparently was not bas ed on any actual headcount of all of the states but it was based on the best available estimates the framers of the constitution had apportioned the representatives without figures from

successful conclusion of constitution would have been impossible without clea r indicatio n of representation and nationwide census was impossible prior to th creation of federal uthority but although precise population accuracy apparently was not the paramount concern for the original apportionment the framers devised mechanism to ensure tha t future representation would reflect the actual differences in populatio n between the states as accurately as was possible legal commentary of the time noted that the us constitution was more consonant with the ideal f democratic representation than the scheme in england which at that time permitted representation in parliament which did not reflect the actual relative populations f the boroughs because there was provision for enumeration and reapportionment11 one legal commentator has suggested that possible reason for the ter m actual in actual enumeration was the intention to distinguish projections f potential population growth from actual current p opulation in the estimates for the12 original apportionment georgia was allotted m ore representation than it was actually entitled to have because of estimated rapid population growth that would hav justified the allotment of one more congressional seat before the first census an d subsequent apportionment could be held the constitutional term actual enumeration appears to require an actua l headcount some of the dictionaries roughly cont emporaneous with the period of the constitutional convention define enumerate as meaning to reckon singly an d enumeration as the act of counting over however one should keep in min d13 that the framers of the constitution could not foresee the development of statistical and survey methods which were nexistent at the time but the

glavin did not reach the constitutional issue because they held t hat the federal statute prohibited sampling of any kind in th apportionment census14 b federal statutory prohibition against sampling section 195 of title 13 united states code currently provides that except for the determination of population for purpose s of apportionment of representatives in congress among the several states the secretary shall if he considers it feasible authorize the statistical method known as sampling in carrying out the provision s of this title the legislative history of section 195 of title 13 indicates tha t congress originally merely authorized but did not require the use of sampling fo r economys sake and did not aut horize the use of sampling for apportionment the15 1957 house report states however section 195 does not authorize the use f sampling procedures in connection with apportionment of representatives the16 legislative history also indicates that in the 1976 amendment to section 195 congress intended to encourage the bureau of the census strongly to use sampling as much as possible and therefore required sampling whenever feasible the17 exception to this requirement is the census for apportionment there is clea r indication in the reports or floor debates about the reason for the exception in the house debates regarding the 1976 amendments and legislation for middecad census representative lotts remarks show that he considered the middecad population census to be one reason for encouraging the use of sampling and that he felt congres s should make clear that the middecade census was to be used fo r allocation of funding and not for apportionment however the clarification h e18 sought appears in section 141e2 of title 13 and the samplingapportionmen t prohibition predates any middecade census authorization congress may have had qualms about the use of sampling for apportionment in light of the actua l enumeration langua ge the fact that they authorized sampling for everything other than apportionment indicates they were not convinced sampling was an acceptabl substitute for headcount apparently they thought it was acceptable for othe r aspects of the census although prior to the enactment of section 195 there was an actual enumeration of everything on the census one should note that sectio n19 181a permits the use of s ampling for

argument can be made that the 1976 legislation supports the notion of samplin g for adjustment the statement in the 1957 house report and the text of section 19 5 itself appear to prohibit any sampling for apportionment purposes there is also the issue of whether section 195 applies to statistical methods other than sampling although there were statistical methods other than sampling i n existence at the time of the 1976 amendments to section 195 and these methods were described in hearings before the senate committee on post office and civi l service section 195 does not explicitly refer to anything other than sampling 20 therefore ne could argue that the congress knew of other methods for estimating the population and by only prohibiting the use of sampling for purposes f apportionment it di d not intend to restrict the use of other statistical methods on21 the other hand in 1976 report to the house committee on post office and civi l service the comptroller general of the united states noted that although severa l statistical methods were being developed methods other than sampling wer considered experimental or unreliable thus one could also argue that the reason22 sampling is t he only method explicitly mentioned in section 195 is that congress did not consider other methods to be feasible and worth mentioning and did not intend to permit their use for apportionment one could also conclude that since the other23 methods were considered inferior to sampling and would not be permitted wher sampling is not permitted then congress intended sampling to be generic ter m covering other methods24 section 141a of title 13 the united states code provides that the secretary shall in the year 1980 and every 10 years thereafter take decennial census f population as of th first day of april of such year which date shall be known as the decennial census date in such form and content as he may determine including the use of sampling procedures and special surveys this must be interpreted together with section 195 of title 13 prior to the district court decisions in department f commerce v us house of representatives and clinton v glavin the weight of case law had reconciled the apparent conflict between sections 141a and 195 by finding sampling permissible for adjustment of but not as substitute for the headcount although some have argued that census of population as defined in subsectio n 141g does not mean the census for apportionment but some general survey 25httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97871crs7 brief of petitioner state of

f representatives and clinton v glavin 1 before wisconsin v city of new york the decisions of the bureau of the census to not adjust the census in 1980 and 1990 by using statistical methods t correct the undercount led to spate of litigation for each census in the course of this litigation the courts indicated that statistical adjustment was not barred by th actual enumeration language because accuracy of the count was the paramoun t consideration therefore if greater accuracy could be achieved by adjustment than by headcount alone the adjustment would be permitted and arguably required27 nevertheless the initial census data had to be based on traditional enumeration or headcount28 the federal courts prior to the wisconsin v city of new york decision emphasized accuracy and sanctioned the use of certain statistical methods for th purposes of providing for more accurate congressional redistricting supporting the idea that statistical adjustment for apportionment is permissible for

statistical32 techniques result in count tha t is more accurate than an actual headcount they may arguably be permissib even as substitution for the headcount the census clause also provides that the enumera tion shall be made in such manner as they congress shall by law direct this language seems to permit congress to authorize an y33 method for the taking of the census although at least one court has suggested tha t there may be requirement for some type of raw headcount34 before the wisconsin decision and the second circuit decision it reversed the courts indicated that the standard for reviewing decision of the bureau of th census regarding the census methodology such as the extent of using statistica l adjustmen t methods was whether the decision was arbitrary and capricious standard under which it would be unlikely that the bureaus methods would b invalidated35 in cases where states and municipalities have sought an adjustment to th headcount for purposes of

in city of new york v us dept of commerce the district court concluded that because article i 2 requires the36 census to be as accurate as practicable the constitution is not bar to statistica l adjustment the census must be as accurate as practicable to permit redistrictin g within the states to be as c lose as possible to the ideal of one man one vote and to permit reapportionment of repres

the 1980 census the court noted that th reasoning of wesberry led to the conclusion that census figures must accurately reflect the populations of each state in order to preserve the efficacy of an indiv iduals vote the court noted40 that although section 195 of title 13 prohibited the use of sampling for the purpose of apportionment section 141 of title 13 provided for the population census in such form and content as t he secretary of commerce may determine including the use of sampling procedures and special surveys the court was obligated to adopt n interpretat ion that would reconcile the two sections rather than declare one null and void therefore it concluded that the sole use of sampling procedures has bee n authorized only for purposes other than tabulating census figures for the purpose of apportionmen t and that in the area of apportionment where important constitutional rights are at stake the bureau of the census may utilize sampling procedures bu t only in addition to more traditional methods of enumeration 41 in young v klutznick the city of detroit sought an adjustment of the allege d undercount in the 1980 census the court noted that since 1970 there had been simple straig ht forward headcount but rather relatively accurate estimate of the population developed through the use of selfenu meration by questionnaire statistical techniques and computer control devices the court concluded that the word s42 actual enumeration do not prohibit an accurate statistical adjustment of th decennial census to obtain more accurate count quite to the contrary article 1 of the constitu tion which mandates equal apportionment of representatives mandates an adjustment to obtain figure that more accurately reflects the actual populatio n of the united states and state and substate areas than the adjusted headcount43 finally the court also held that section 195 does not prohibit the use of statistica l techniques to adjust the population census for apportionment although the use f figures deriv ed solely by statistical techniques is prohibited the court seemed to44 treat samplin g and statistical techniques as equivalent and interchangeable the court in city of philadel phia v klutznick also concluded that section 195 does not45 prohibit the use of statistical methods to adjust the headcount finally in city of new york v us dept of commerce the district

in which the city alleged injuries of loss of federal an d48 state representatives and federal and state funding because of an undercount th opinion appears to support the use of statistical methods to adjust the headcount however the court in that case took the position that the census figures must be raw data from an actual enumeration although those figures may be adjusted b y49 statistical methods includi ng sampling in order to arrive at more accurate figure50 the court observed that the principal concern of the framers in the constitutional provision t issue was not the manner of conducting the census their chief concer n was the apportionment of seats in the house f representatives it may be that today an actual he adcount cannot hope to be an accurate reflection of either

census ad justment the litigation following the 1990 census appeared to accept the feasibility of adjustment and focused instead on the issue of the accuracy of th chosen adjustment method two federal appellate courts the sixth and seventh ci rcuits using the arbitrary and capricious standard held that the secretary of commerce had not acted in n arbitrary and capricious manner in deciding not to adjust the 1990 census figures53 the decision of whether to adjust was in the di scretion of the secretary of commerce who considered whether an adjustment would result in greater accuracy in severa l respects the sixth and seventh circuits apparently accepted the secretary s explanation that an adjustment of the actual count would not result in greate r accuracy with regard to the distribution of population among the states and othe r areas measured and might even result in decreased distributive accuracy findin g that the decision to not adjust was not arbitrary and capricious the courts refused to take sides in dispute among the ex perts about the desirability of adjustment finding that there were judicially administrable standards for determining the desirability of adjustment the second circu it in city of new york v united states dept of commerce 54 held that the arbitrary and capricious standard was not appropriate instead afte r looking to line of precedent involving judicial review of intrastate districtin g decisions beginni ng with wesberry the second circuit decided that the appropriate standard was whether the secretarys decision to not adjust was essential to th achieve ment of legitimate governmental interest it established standard f review that would make it more difficult for the secretary of commerce to defen d the decision against an adjustment of the raw he adcount figures from the 1990 census and found that the plaintiffs had sustained their initial burden of proving that th secretar had not made goodfaith effort to achieve the most accurate

supreme court reversed the second circuit decision rejecting th applicability of the intrastate redistricting line of cases with their requirements fo r mathematically precise equality and accuracy i t held that the appropriate standard for review of the adjustment decision of the secretary of commerce was whether th secretarys conduct of the census was consistent with the constitutional language and the constitutional goal of equal repres entation and in light of the broad grant56 of authorit over the census given to congress in the constitution whether th secretarys decision had reasonable relationship to the accomplishment of n actual enumeration of the population keeping in mind the constitutional purpose of the census equal representation through fair apportionment of the house f representatives the court looked to franklin v massa chusetts case involving57 the method of counting overseas federal employees and department of commerce v mont ana case involving the method of calculating the apportionment for thi s standard of review the court noted that it had rejected the applicability of th standard in the wesberry line of cases with regard to the congressional apportionment methods tested in franklin and montana the court had rejected the wesberry standard because it considered congressional reapportionment to be quite differen t from intrastate redistricting because of the reapportionment requirements that each state have at least one representative and that congressional districts cannot cros s state lines therefore the standard applicable to intrastate redistricting could t appropriately be applied to congressional re apportionment the court found that the federal governments conduct of the census was even further removed fro m intrastate redistricting than was congressional reapportionment thus the federa l government was due even greater deference in its census methodology than in it s congressional reapportionment methodology with regard to accuracy the court observed that for several reasons th goodfaith effort to achieve population equality required of state conductin g intrastate redistricting does not translate into requirement that the federa l government conduct census that is as accurate as possible the severa l58 reasons included the fact that the census clause of the constitution grante d congress broad authority to conduct the census in s uch manner as they shall by law direct and that fur ther constitutional requirements for apportionment as mentioned above made it impossible to achieve precise population equality among interstat districts and in determining congressional reapportionment the courts holdin g could be interpreted in two ways1 the federal government is longer required to conduct the most accurate census possible or 2 accuracy is still as important as the cases preceding t he second circuit decision in the wisconsin case indicated it is but there are

wisconsin 116 sct at 1101 n 1161governments determinations regarding the accuracy of particular censu s methodologies it appears that stronger case can be made for the second option since th passage follo wing the one quoted above goes on to note that the court sees way in which the courts can determine whether the fede ral government has made good faith effort to achieve population equality the court compares the situation before it to that in the montana case observing that just as it was impossible for the court to choose one apportionment methodology over another it was impossible for it to choose one census methodology over another as more accurate the constitution and the intrastate redistricting cases could offer guidance about what constituted goodfaith effort that is which census methodolog was more accurate and therefore better than another the polestar of equal representation does not provide sufficient guidance to allow us to discern single constitutionally permissible course the59 court does not appear to be saying that accuracy is not as important as it was or that the federal government has reduced obligation to maximize accuracy rather it is saying that goodfaith effort to conduct the most accurate census possible is not easily measu rable with the same mathematical precision as in intrastate redistricting therefore the court declined to secondguess the federal governments decisions about census methodology the supreme court specifically declined to decide whether the constitutio n might prohibit congress from conducting the type of statistical adjustmen t considered here or whether under section 195 of title 13 united states code 60 congress had constrained the secretarys discretion to statistically adjust th decennia l census in the
