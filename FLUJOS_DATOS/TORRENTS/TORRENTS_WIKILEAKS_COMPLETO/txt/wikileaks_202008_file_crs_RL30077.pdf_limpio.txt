comments on proposed regulation that would establish new standards for th processing of claims under the employee retirement income security act of 197 4 erisa if adopted in its current form the proposed regulation would addres s6 some of the concerns raised by congress this report will discuss the consumer bill of rights the various legislativ proposals and the department of labors proposed regulation the consumer bill of rights and almost all of the proposed legislation recognize need for both internal and external review of treatment and reimbursement decisions in general interna l review involves review by responsible plan personnel with the authority to correc t mistakes external review provides an oversight mechanism that could identif procedural errors provide substantive review and detect patterns of inappropriat denials it is also seen as assuring participants of an impartiality and independence7 that might b lacking in the internal review process although the department f8 labors proposed regulation does not provide for external review it does seek t refine the review process for participants in group health plans consumer bill of rights and responsibilities the commission believes that enhanced internal and external review procedures would benefit participants in three ways first they would assist in obtaining access9 to appropriate services in timely manner thus increasing the likelihood of positive health outcomes second improved procedures would bridge communication gaps between participants and their health plans and providers third improve d procedu res would empower participants and facilitate greater respect for th institutions that serve them the recommendations contained in the consumer bill of rights seek to make the resolution of grievances more timely nd more reliable the consumer bill of rights makes separate r ecommendations for internal and external appeals systems among its recommendations for an internal appeals system are the review of decision s involving emergency or urgent care within 72 hours claim review proces s conducted by health care professionals who are credentialed in the area of the relevant treatment and timely written notification of preliminary and final decisions suc h written notification would include information on appeals to the external appeal s
