chinas economy and uschina commercial relations with an analysis of publicly available data and reporting chinas economy presents divergent nd contradictory images on the one hand it is dynamic with considerable potential to become world class power in many areas on the other hand visions of china as an economic power constantly collide with the stark reality of the c ountrys poverty uneven development and glaring structural weaknesses while asias financial crisis has elevated sense of urgency among chinese officials to push fo rward with fundamental reforms of the countrys ba nking system and stateowned enterprises slowing economy will make the reforms more difficult to carry out in the hong kong special administrative region hksar most officials appeared confident that hong kongs special role as chinas main source of finance and services would continue to grow in the future their confidence was based on hong kongs successful transition to date and on chinas own obvious selfinterest in maintaining the hksar as its golden goose at the same time the challenge that asias financial crisis is posing fo r both hong kong and china as well as hong kongs own growing internal problems illu strated that the so called one country two systems arrangement remains deli cate subtle and vulnerable to stress chinas economic expansion was seen to be having huge albeit uncertain impact not only on the rest of the world but on china itself the effects both positive and negative encompass shifts in world trade production and employment the environment foreign relations and ch inas communist and authoritarian system of governance the rapid expansion of chinas economy has also coincided with an intensification of uschi na commercial ties chin as market holds tremendous allure for growing number of us companies but it remains very difficult one in which to do business although china s reforms and economic dynamism are gradually improving the business environment its domestic market remains substantially regulated and there are few shortcuts to commercial success the us trade deficit with china is large rapidly expanding and increasingly sensitive politically for many americans the deficit symbolizes an imbalanced trading relationship where chinese firms have relatively more access to the us market than american firms have to chinas market chinese and us officials proposed divergent solutions for curbing the deficit chinas bid to join the world trade or ganization wto is widely viewed as an enormously important complicated nd risky undertaking depending on the terms of the accession agreement chinas entry could either weaken or strengthen its own economy selected us economic interests as well as the world trading system it is not clear what

cultural site s were also provided1 the purpose of the trip was educational to gain information and insights on variety of issues confronting the china us relationship this was done through meetings with chinese and american official s and visits to the cities and countryside while most topics affecting the chinaus relationship were raised at least in passing discussions focused primar ily on chinas economy and uschina commercial tieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98131crs2 this report is intended to be useful to future congressional delegations to china as well as those in congress who monitor

dilemmas it faces in making transition to more open ec onomy observ ing chinas efforts to modernize its economy on massive scale the delegation was struck by numerous contradic tions challenges to us economic interests and unanswerable questions recognizing that chinas success in addressing its economic problems and engaging positively with the international system may well be key to prosperous and stable 21st century the importance of narrowing differences on the fu ll range of the issues that divide china and the united states became clear these overarching themes and impressions are elaborated on below in sections on ch inas economy and us china commercial ties chinas economy the following principal findings cerning chinas economy were derived from the trip and supplementary research chinas economy presents divergent and contradictory images on the one hand chinas economy is dynamic with considerable potential to become world class power in many areas on the other hand the majority of chinese people are poor and chinas economy remains hobbled by number of glaring structural weaknesses most hong kong officials and busine ssmen with whom we met expressed confidence that hong kongs importance to china as source of finance and services will continue to grow grounds for more guarded assessment however became apparent based on the challenge asias financial crisis was posing for hong kong and china and on hong kongs own growing internal problems thus it appeared that the hong kongchina or one countrytwo systems arrangement remains delicate subtle and potentially vulnerable to stress chinas economic dynamism is having huge albeit uncertain impact not only on the rest of the world but on china itself the effects both positive and negative encompass

from the ubiquitous shops and stalls on the backstreets and alleys in the cities to the production line of s ilk factory the group visited in suzhou the overwhelming impression gleaned was one of purposeful activity and vitality an underlying psychological component of this dynamism was demonstrated by widespread confidence that the country s path of opening and reform is the right one for china viewed from the large number of individual entrepreneurs providing haircuts shoe shines and bicycle repairs on the streets of beijing along with the omnipresent openair food stands it was clear that substantial numbers of chinese are taking advantage of new opportun ities to earn money off growing market economy the bargaining skills of vendors ensconced at the great wall and stone forest in

retiremen t quarters staring what the chinese call the iron rice bowl in th face we thought that even the most profitable western company would be hard pr essed to defray these social welfare and unemployment costs simultaneously but china is moving ahead with efforts to streamline and downsize its state sector and according to press accounts at c onsiderable risk street protests have been reported to be occurring regularly acro ss china as the state sector is cut back official projections are that future cutbacks could increase unemployment from the official figure of 96 million to 30

tested most directly by currency pressures stemming from the asian financial crisis in the case of hong kong the challenge has been for its monetary authorities to defend its dollar against speculative attacks hong kong officials viewed the strength and independence of the hong kong dollar as visible expression of the one country two systems concept in the case of china the challenge has been for the authorities to resist devaluation of its currency the yuan to keep its exports competitive with those from all the countries in the region that have recently devalued given the heavy degree of interdependence of the two economic systems an inability or unwillingness of authorities in either hong kong or beijing to carry through on their exchange rate pledges could have very substantial negative c onsequences for the other for hong kong the price of defending its 78 hong kong dollar link to the us dollar is higher interest rates u nder its currency board every hong kong

kong officials to whom we spoke appeared confident that its adjustment would be swift but painful they also believed that lower property prices and the stock market correction would he lp to boost hong kongs competitiveness over time thereby solidifying its role as chinas premier service and financial center in defending the decision to maintain the link hong kong authorities also emphasized that their underlying economic fundamentals which are the strongest in east asia will help protect their economy from the financial turmoil these include solid gdp growth the third largest foreign exchange reserve position in the world us 918 billion dollars in octobe r 1997 government debt fiscal surplus in excess of 2 of gdp in 1997 healthy balance of payments position and external debt in addition the author ities emphasized that hong kong had large stocks of underutilized buildings or industries propped up with government subsidies with which to contend while hong kong so far has been able to withstand the speculative attacks future attacks cannot be ruled out in ddition to generalized concerns that hong kong cannot main tain its high cost structure in the middle of region that has undertaken largescale devalu ations there could be grow ing pressures to sell hong kong dollars from residents that may be losing confidence in the governments ability to generate jobs adequate hous ing and edu cation the bankruptcy of peregrine investment holdings the larg est investment bank in asia outside of japan layoffs by cathay pacific airlin and big drop in tourism are further testing the confidence of hong kong residents11 the governments handling of the bird flu crisis has also reportedl undermined the public confidence and contributed to rising vel of public dissatisfaction12 future considerations at the same time any move by beijing authorities to devalue the yuan to keep its exports competitive with the rest of asia could undermine efforts to stabilize regional econo mies by perhaps sparking another round of competitive devaluations devaluation could also damage confidence in the territorys new leaders and lead to massive selloff of hong kong dollars on the basis of this one issue the staff delegation obtained glimpse of the degree that the hong kong china or one country two systems arrangement remains delicate subtle nd vulnerable to stress loss of confidence

that china by the year 2047 would become more like hong kong than vice versa their mindset was reflected in the comment that hong kong took over south china long before ch ina took over hong kong and they saw little reason why the takeover would not continue to move north in addition to the smooth transition to date the optimism of most hong kong officials and businessmen that china woul d move increasingly towards hong kongs standards of free markets free press free dom of choice and the rule of law rested on the future generation of chinese middle managers these future leaders many of whom

dream and sense of optimism that their lives will be materially better than their parents not by any recollection of mao tsetung effects of chinas rising economy as mentioned earlier it is difficult to find words that can adequately describe the scale of chinas economic revolution encompassing nearly onequarter of the worlds population the movement since 1979 to energize stagnating economy with market forces has been nothing short of massive and breathtaking to date these policies have transf ormed southern chinas appear ance and outlook in fundamental ways the spread of this economic revolu

compete with foreign production throughout asia and the world economy the governments still significant control of the economy allows it to create competitive advantages by attracting sophisticated technology transfers that can be combined with low wage labor force and less enforceable environmental standards already china has made some steps from being primarily an exporter of laborintensive products ch as apparel toys and footwear to an exporter of increasingly highervalued adde d products such as consumer electronics that are being produced by foreign joint ventures it is easy to see how chinas growing industrial prowess can generate acute apprehensions that it can cause huge shif ts in trade production and employment almost anywhere in the world recent accounts of huge gluts of unsold goods in which china was described as the mot her of all inventory problems add to concerns that many chinese products can be easily dumped on world markets at prices that are below the cost of

reiterating the governments determination to resist devaluation of the yuan this decision was base d substantially on the understanding that such an effort to increase chinas export competitiveness could undercut regional stability at the same time some chinese and hong kong officials appeared to show less sensitivity for the very real costs that specific expo rt surges could impose on foreign

drive towards industrialization chin has become one of the worlds most polluted both air and water places in th world views of beijings skyline for example are measurably constrained by heavy smog and pollutants in the air can make strenuous physical exercise unhealthy caused largely by the burning of mostly lowquality coal for heating buildings and runni ng factories thin layer of black soot not uncommonly can be detected on ones clothes after day of meetings chinas reliance on coal it has vast reserves will have huge potential effects on global warming and pletion of the ozone layer it also poses huge costs to china itself the world bank estimates these costs in terms of shortened life spans and lost production to be equi valent to 8 of the countrys total output each year14 chinese officials recognize that the i ndustrialization of th eir huge c ountry is placing incredible pressures on the envir onment both domestically and globally but they argue that they have put in place rigid environmental requirements which allegedly are widely skirted through payoffs to local officials at an earlier stage of development than most other countries given severe budget constraints and the pressures to develop economically they maintain that the government has few alternatives to heavy reliance on cheap co as chinas primary source of energy moreover as northern china possesses most the countrys high quality coal large amount of coal must be shipped from the north to the south putting huge strain on an already overburdened transportation system15 chinas economic developmen t

chinese side effects on china compared to possible external impacts potential reverberations of chinas economic revolution on itself appear as an even greater unknown as elements of capitalism continue to spread throughout the economy an overriding question bears on the fu ture of the communist party17 chinese officials maintained that communism was still longterm goal and they emphasized that the partys decision to pursue socialist market economy which can be defined as free market ins titutions with major economic policies and industries controlled by the state would br ing china closer to that vision in some distant future in particular deng xi aopings decision in 1992 to apply pragmatic and nonideological tests to reform pr oposals do they contribute to chinas development

the subsequent observed rise in individuality consumerism and the competition for getting rich all appear to be potent and irrevers ible forces dubbed by one participant the dominoes of capitalism number of group participants wondered how these developments ever c ould be put back into communist bottle and as chinas middle class continues to grow it seemed likely that there would be increased demands for more freedom ss corruption and cleaner environment at the same time the vision of fully individualistic and capitalist china raised its own set of questions on the one hand given its immense population and regional disparities how could china stay together if it did not maintain large dose of re distributive socialism and the trappings of welfare state given these challenges could

could not the constant concerns of chinese officials about stability be mostly an excuse for staying in power and could chinas deficiencies in the areas of democracy human rights and rule of law actually be key factors that are keeping the country economically backward while there were easy answers to any of these questions it seemed likely that as long as the economy continues to ge nerate higher living standards for the vast majority of the people the legitimacy of the communist party could remain substantially unchallenged but in the event of serious economic decline it is much less clear what forces beyond authoritari an rule can hold the country together certainly the marked absence of communi st propaganda throughout the parts of the country we visited suggested that ideolo gy may not serve as very strong glue discussions with number of us co mpany representatives put somewhat different twist on this speculation they noted that economic reforms have been accompanied by considerable devolution of authority from beijing and the central party organs to provincial and local authoritie s while this process has made china more freewheeling business environment it has also been accompanied by rising levels of corruption in many cases th greater difficulty of dealing with local authorities to obtain permits to do business has prompted them to bemoan the loss of predictability associated with more centralized authority commercial relations with the united states the rapid expansion of chinas economy s coincided with an intensification of uschina commercial ties since china launched its opening and reform policies china has become more significant trading partner and destination for us foreign direct investment problems nd tensions associated with the

industries ranging from footwear and apparel to cellular phones and computers the reasons why so many us companies have invested in china are varied for many the most compelling reason is chinas rapid

greatly from sector to sector for some producers of toys and clothing for example primary attraction has been to utiliz chinas lowcost labor for assembly operations geared toward exporting for some us multinationals such as general motors investment in chinas automotive market is viewed as part of the companys global and regional competitiveness strategy as well as to tap the rising demand in china for autos and auto parts for numbe r of banks and insurance companies the motivation is merely to develop ma rket foothold in anticipation of more liberalized and less restrictive environment in the future in luncheon meeting hosted by amcham representatives of us companies expressed declining enthusiasm and increased frustration for doing business in china top concern was that only few compan ies such as boeing procter gamble motorola and gillette suppos edly were making any money off their considerable investments frustrations were directed at number of chinese obstacles excessive redtape and restrictions on the scope of permissible business activities weak and nontransparent laws and in consistent enforcement of rules and regulations23 company representatives shared differe nt

making appropriate representations to the us embassy and chinese authorities in beijing given chinas growing dependence on foreign capital for its ec onomic growth us companies are not without leverage growing us trade deficit the united states is experiencing large and rapidly growing trade deficit with china the deficit has jumped according to us department of commerce statistics from 10 billion in 1990 to an estimated 50 billion in 1997 this has made china the second largest country sour ce of the overall us trade deficit if current trends continue china could eas ily replace japan in 1998 as the largest deficit trading partner of the united states the growing trade imbalance is po litically sens itive issue for many americans the deficit symbolizes an imb alanced trading relationship where chinese firms have relatively more access to the us market than american firms have to the chinese market as in the case of japan the trade deficit number rightly or wrongly is often used in the press and in governme nt circles as proxy for the state of the overall uschina co mmercial relationship while number of the chinese officials we met disputed the size of the imbalance most were acutely aware that it presented political problem that both sides had to deal with24 somewhat surprisingly none of these officials argued that the deficit should be ignored or trie d to defend the imbalance on the grounds of standard economic theorizing ie that bilateral imbalances do not matter because trade is multilateral or that trade balances are driven by macroeconomic forces and not by trade barriers our discussions indicated however that the us and chinese sides have strong differences over why the united states is exporting much less to china than it is importing us embassy officials unequivoca lly pinpointed the closed nature of the chinese market as the biggest cause of the u s trade deficit one official argued thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98131crs16 25us

is under considerationas chinas economy grows at around 9 per year its imports from the rest of the world would not be growing at only 12 if market forces were free to operate instead the chinese market was characterized as being politically organized and manipulated many layers of overlapping tariff and non tariff barriers were said to be denying us exporters levelplaying field chinese officials attributed the poor pe rformance of us exports to three factors the first was the poor financia l position of innumerable large soes situation that has lowered their demand for imports particularly raw materials the second related to the availability of us concessionary export financing as well as selfimposed restraints on us exports chinese officials argued that japanese and european exports were ofte n favored because of the more attractive governmentsubsidized financing they also argue that posttiananmen square imposed restrictions on export financing to china eximbank and suspension of other export promotion and insurance activities sponsored by the trade and development agency tda and the overseas private investment corporation opic were hurting us exports in add ition one official argued that us export controls particularly as they relate to dualuse it ems civilian technologies with military applications such as supercomputers and sale of us nuclear power generating equipment were curtailing us exports25 third factor allegedly contributing to weak us export performance was uncertainty caused by the annual debate in congress over chinas mfn status under this view which was echoed by veral large us company representatives the annual debate was judg ed to have chilling effect on the kind of business confidence that is necessary to concl ude number of mostly longterm sales agreements us and chinese solutions for curbing the imbalance diverged the us side argued that china needs to move aggressively to dismantle its formidable array of formal and informal trade barriers the chinese side maintained that us export performance problems are primarily selfinf licted and could be solved by lifting restrictions on export financ ing sales of hightech

symbolic prestige for joining the world trade grouping26 us embassy and company representatives explained why chinas accession on commercially viable terms is top us priority the main reason cited was that china would have to eliminate or curb its trade investment and industrial policies that have the potential for disrupting globa l trade distortions caused by government imposed trade barriers at the border by investment performance requirements by policies designed to buildup pillar indus tries and by subsid ies were flagged as overriding concerns more open chinese market was judged to facilitate increases in us exports as well as to strengthen uschina relations while chinas membership in the wto promises to yield largescale economic and political benefits for both sides reaching mutually acceptable accession agreement has been immensely complicated central to the impasse has been chinas insistence on joining the wto as developing country this would provide china very lenient treatment primarily by allowing exemptions or flexibility to phasein wto responsibilities over very l ong time period long timeframe for phasing in its obligations would obviously he lp china deal with the very real social adjustment costs and pain that liberalization will force on its people although chinas claim for developing c ountry status appears reasonable based on its low per capita income level its size and international competitiveness in selected industrial areas suggests that speci protections or exemptions could prove quite disruptive to global trade production and employment patterns for example if china were exempted from wto disciplines on subsidies or investment performance requirements the trade and ec onomic interests of many other countries could be put in harms way similarly if chinese trade barriers and interventionist practices were not significantly altered the source for much of uschina trade friction would remain the task of negotiating an accession agreement that balances chinas social and political needs against the requirements of the world trading system as well as us national economic interests is formidable and complex to meet the bottomline objectives of both china and the united states both chinese and american officials appeared to recognize that compromise on both sides will be required however none of the officials in terviewed on either side conve yed the impression that wto accession was pressi ng priority chinese officials emphasized the longterm benefits but they also indicated that accession could not be accomplished by sacrificing the countrys development needs us officials recognized that even good accession agr eement would not level the playing field with china for decades to come given th different perspectives it was not clear what forces or events might move the two sides toward concluding compromise agreement
