steep increases in their populations which could lead to as many as 50 million more arab workers crowding job markets in the next eight years4 in addition the arab human development report concluded that out of the seven world regions the arab countries had the lowest freedom score in the late 1990s many observers are concerned that slow growth in conjunction with rapidly rising populations and restrictions on personal freedoms which vary from country to country could lead to expanding regional instability in the years ahead mepi funding mepi which is managed by the state departments bureau

israels neighbors including the west bank and gaza strip finally the senate bill would provide the state department with the authority to establish private foundation and an enterprise fund utilizing mepi funds httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21457 mepi programs since the debut of mepi in december 2002 the state department has organized over 225 programs under each of the four main pillars8 commentators have noted that measuring the effectiveness of these programs will have to be done on casebycase and countrybycountry basis programs that work to increase literacy levels or the investment of capital are inherently easier to quantify than those seeking to improve the health of countrys democratic system some programs have longer time horizons for effecting change than others countries that are more willing to welcome foreignsponsored program like mepi may already have political conditions that make it easier to encourage internal reforms mepi programs can either operate in one or two countries or cover the entire middle east region morocco is one of the biggest beneficiaries of mepi together with yemen bahrain and other persian gulf and north african states many of mepis host countries have taken some steps to create quasidemocratic institutions such as parliaments or have allowed some political opposition parties to organize and run in elections however mepi has much smaller presence in egypt where the ongoing battle between the egyptian government and the muslim brotherhood has forestalled internal reforms in one of the largest countries in the region mepi has small presence in ultraconservative saudi arabia where the authorities are more sensitive to reformminded initiatives in the political arena mepi has funded preelection polling in lebanon and voter education programs in egypt mepi also has funded voter registration programs in yemen judicial reform seminars in oman and bahrain and training sessions for female candidates for parliament in morocco in the economic sphere the program has funded commercial law initiatives debt reform and the development of information technology infrastructures in algeria tunisia and morocco in addition mepi hopes to help fund 8 for complete list and description of mepi programs see httpmepistategov crs5 retraining programs for moroccan farmers who could incur financial hardships as result of the us moroccan free trade agreement9 the initiative also works with the us department of commerce to provide internships in american companies for young professionals and to provide training to women entrepreneurs from the middle east in the realm of education reform and assistance the middle east partnership initiative has pilot program in yemen to promote womens literacy as well as plans to develop greater access to the internet for rural populations mepi also is working to fund teacher training programs at the primary and secondary school levels evaluating mepi in his january 2005 inauguration address president bush stated that we will encourage reform in other governments by making clear that success in our relations will require the decent treatment of their own people as tool to implement this vision of reform analysts note that mepi like other us assistance programs in the region faces number of challenges in the years to come many analysts note that mepis biggest challenge is to promote political reform within autocratic regimes thereby gradually undermining the very governments that the united states rely upon for strategic httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21457 cooperation in the middle east thus programs such as mepi are in the difficult position of funding reformminded projects designed to circumvent the power of the state over the long term while relying on the good will of arab governments to operate such programs in host countries other government agencies such as usaid have long faced such dilemma though observers assert that mepis reform agenda makes this struggle more pronounced most political islamist groups which are the most powerful opposition movements across the region are excluded from participating in mepi programs due to the insistence of host governments and the unwillingness of some us policymakers to legitimize islamist groups that may seek to permanently enshrine islam in countrys political and social system10 questions remain as to the willingness of arab reformers secular or islamist to accept us assistance lest they run the risk of appearing to collaborate with the west some analysts charge that this concern is exaggerated and that many groups might be willing to accept us assistance to support their reform activities the mepi program is still relatively new and since its inception has received some criticism for concentrating on safe issues such as economic reform and education instead of more sensitive issues such as supporting opposition activities and constitutional reform according to one recent evaluation by the brookings institution mepi tends to fund programs carried out by american ngos that do not cross the red lines of regime 9 bureau of near eastern affairs briefing to the house international relations committee february 10 2003 10 political conditions vary across the middle east and some islamic groups are more moderate than others for example the evolving political process in iraq may produce shiite majority government which may seek to incorporate shiite islam in some parts of iraqi law without alienating nonshiite groups in other countries such as saudi arabia political reform could empower more hardline clerics rather than secular westernoriented reformers crs6 sponsored reform or that simply do not match the political realities arabs face11 however in recent months mepi has begun distributing small grants directly to ngos in egypt to support political activists and human rights groups12 the state department mepi office also has established two regional offices one in the united arab emirates and the other in tunisia overall mepis economic and social programs are designed to foster modernization reform and development over the long term some experts have recommended that mepi be transformed into private foundation in order to partly disassociate it from direct us government control us officials have rejected this idea asserting that the united states needs such policy tools to effect change in the region as noted above recent legislative proposals have called for the creation of middle east foundation that would be partially funded with mepi funds foreign reaction to mepi the middle east partnership initiative has received mixed reactions varying from country to country in the arab world at the governmental level mepi has been largely httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21457 welcomed by the arab monarchies of morocco bahrain jordan with particular support for the educational and economic components immediately following secretary powells announcement of the initiative the moroccan foreign ministry stated its support for mepi noting that it intended to strengthen the democratic process in morocco yemen also has welcomed the initiative however even among these enthusiastic arab countries there is still high degree of sensitivity toward western programs designed to promote what is perceived as westernstyle democracy the governments of egypt saudi arabia and oman have been more tepid in their response to mepi while the affluent united arab emirates has shown less interest than some of the other small persian gulf monarchies 11
