level iv auditing lecture given on 17 october 1963 all right whats the date audience 17 october seventeenth of october saint hill special briefing course going to give you lecture today on iv youve heard stressing level iv little bit actually the lectures i have been making are not particularly usable in academies and that sort of thing because we keep talking about level iv and interjecting it and that sort of thing and whatthose of you in the lower unitswhat youre terribly interested in of course is how to get ta motion and so on and so ill salt this level iv down with levels i ii and iii you see and reverse the procedure today so you can still hear it and now gettinggetting ta motion is common denominator of all scientology activities and you will be happy to know that on the staff coauditfeel little selfconscious just been watching that film we just made you know and good heavens its good film its good film theyll like it very much at the congress but on the staff coaudit and so on they at first didnt believe of course and still some of them dont really quite believe that you can simply sit there and let the ta move around at mad rate see and theyretheyre learning gradually however and the learning rate is very interesting really theyre not running anything different than they were running you know but they went into terrible slump they went into terrible slump for while they were getting fair ta you see they were getting around fourteen fifteen eighteen sixteenthat sort of thingdivisions per twoandahalfhour session see and this was it and then i started leaning on them to increase it and it went down to an average of about eight ta divisions per session you see they just went all to pieces you see got so selfconscious about all this you know that it was horrible now theyve come out of that slump and its interesting that theyre moving up few more ta divisions per session now you say well obviously the pc is loosening up and things are getting along better that has nothing to do with it at all the state of the case of the pc has practically nothing to do with ta motion the sooner you get that out of your heads that the pc has something to do with ta motion the more ta motion youre going to get what you do is simply sit there and get ta motion and i dont know why youre doing anything else see i dont know why youre doing anything else than just sitting there getting ta motion its too easy and its something like looking for an elephant in an empty room you knowand theres nothing else in the room but the elephant and one day you say to yourself lets see now if i dont yank the pcs attention off his case and if i give him anything at all to itsa and then if i dont stop him from doing what i ask him to do i get ta motion and youll finally come to that conclusion as horrible recognition and wonder what the devil you were doing before and so on well i wouldnt begin to betell you what you were doing before because they are too numerous the variabilities are too great one of the ways of reducing ta motion is to vary your model session every session run different model session on the pc the motto of ta motion is be unpredictable as an auditor when the pc expects you to put in the rfactor get the can squeeze put in the rfactor after youve started the session thats good that surprises him but next session correct it and put it in before you start the session and then he says well his attention goes onto his case you see before youve started the session and he has to suppress his case for that well all right so next session just omit the rfactor you get the idea this makes life very very very unpredictable see what im talking about pc doesnt know whats coming next well this is method of getting the pc to whatsit the auditor what is the auditor going to do next the pc doesnt know what the auditor is going to do next so the pc now whatsits the auditor and the more the pc whatsits the auditordoes this auditor know his business what is this auditor worried about what is this auditor going to do nextwhy the less ta motion you get because youve got the pc running whatsit and the auditor can then of course run an itsa youve got the auditor then itsaing and the pc whatsitting and that is the reverse to getting ta action and then you can carry on from there on out and get ta action you could settle down very comfortably into these particular errors and sooner or later you suddenly get breakthrough and win and then youre startled to find out that something must have been happening and youll suddenly say well this sessionthere must be something wrong with this session because it was too easy see this was too easy now one of them on the staff coauditto be congratulated on it and so forth just rolling along the linegot thirtysix ta thirtysix down divisions of ta see moving it up from about eight and not running anything very remarkable but im sure the auditor in that particular case thinks that what she ran had something to do with it yes somethinghad something to do with it but there must be relaxation setting into this sessioning get the idea so ta motion isnt being prevented now the auditor is in control of the bank thats something else that you may or may not ever believe you are in absolute positive control of the bank just complete the bank obeys you and doesnt obey the pc the pc nearly always tries to look at what you want him to look at the bank always does what you tell it to do its this sort of thing you remind of somebody sometimes when you get confused about this who is rolling marble along the walk you see something like that and arguingarguing like mad about the marble wont do what you are making it do you see and you kick the marble and it rolls along very nicely in the straight linethe exact straight line that you kicked it see and then if you kick it with little slice or curve or something like that it goes over into the verge of the walk you see well there are people around who say look at what this marble is doing to and these people take up golf it enters into the whole nomenclature of golf you seeyou hear them talking all the time you see the clubs are doing it and my drive has slice see my brassie gives hook now if you want to really fix golfer but goodhes dubbing along one way or the other hes gettingyou know hes fair got handicap of two or three hundred you know just golfer and hehes doing all right see and he can step up on the tee and theres the ball and he hauls off and swoosh down comes the driver you see and wham zzzzt out onto the fairway goes the golf ball and so forth and hes getting along all right see occasionally things happen like he tops it you see or undercuts it or something but usually something happens now walk up to him and say if you just interlock your hands you see in the snead grip or something you see and then if youll flex your elbows just before you do this and then dont take your eye off the ball and so on your drives will be much better now hes in trouble now hes in real trouble now he is facing up to the fact hes not driving now golf ball he is interlocking his hands on the handle he is keeping his eye on the top of the golf ball he is doing this and he is doing that and hes doing all these other things but he is not driving golf ball and the answer is of course he doesnt one professional lesson can put fifteen or twenty strokes on almost any dubbers score just one pro lesson and hes had it now lets take some twelveyearold kid and we take him outside and we hand himwe hand him set of golf clubs and we say all right now theres the ball and you put up on the tee and drive it down the fairway and so forth funny part of it is hes actually liable to connect hes liable to connect and he goes on and he fools around and he plays golf and so forth now we want to do him big favor hes going around in about hundred and ten you see or something like that lets do him big favor lets get him some professional lessons well for long time his score will just increase increase increase increase increase see and hell go into absolute despair finally on the thing but somewhere along the line he starts to coordinate again and select out whats essential and so forth and it comes back and he drifts back to point where he is actually driving the golf ball again and he starts making remarkable strides now unfortunately it is necessary for somebody to go over this period necessary in order to play golf or to audit now reg on sunday here with the people he has herehes got them chattering nicely to each other you know theyre putting in the itsa line theyre auditing each other at home they dont know what to do wrong you see and they very very happily get along and they listen to each other and their fundamentals are this and that and theyre all in and so on and their ta motions probably fair and all seems to be going along very well well you look at this as an auditor and you say those guys must be naturals those guys are auditing unconsciously theyre ignorant and ignorance is bliss in that particular case and heres the test the second theres just little more sand in the trap the second that theres just slightly greater dogleg on that particular hole theyve had it theyre through the second that the pc says to them well i dont know the pains moved up to the top of my head now they go huhhh huhhh they end the session instantly and come back and ask sunday what they should have done and one fellow did that and he said this very excitedly about this and all of sudden he got sort of filmy look in his eye and he said you know i should have kept the session going shouldnt i see his own cognition he found out something about it those guys would be dead ducks if they ran into ripple on the sea if they ran into pebble on the green if anything happened if the wind was little bit higher that day see theyre dead now what makes pro is actually being able to go over this hump and go all the way through it and get something at the other side now he becomes almost unshakable when he can do this hell carry on hell do the right thing and when you introduce new style of auditing such as listenstyle auditing why the auditing of lot of auditors shatters promptly and one of the errors they make is to make formal auditing adapt itself to listenstyle auditing see its like teaching somebody to dance you teach him polkaas it says in the bulletin something like thatand you teach him waltz well he doesnt differentiate between the fact that polka is quite different than waltz and right in the middle of the waltz he starts polkaing and right in the middle of the polka he starts to waltz well thats because he doesnt realize the tremendous differencethe tremendous difference between the two dances and yet good dancer would be able to polka or waltz at will knowingly without going all over the place now i wont minimize the fact that formal auditing has been alteredhas been altered to some degree in that you should let the pc itsa the item or itsa the goal and you shouldnt stop the pc from itsaing what the pc is supposed to be itsaing thats for sure but that is the only lesson in formal auditing that is learned from listenstyle auditing thats all you sit in formal style auditing letting somebody itsa his bank or itsa his items or itsa his gpms and youre going to have mighty sick pc on your hands all right what do you think your first goal is now sit back inviting communicationlistenstyle auditing thats it let the pc talk for two hours and half youre going to get yourself some tone arm action thats for sure next session now what do you suppose your first goal is that was the auditing question you were working on sit back and dont do anything sit back and invite communication and youre going to get little less ta next session what do you suppose your first goal is sit back invite communication and youre going to get lot less ta next session what do you suppose your first goal is ta stuck 55 thud unmoving frozen in concrete why because the factor of overrestimulation gets in your road very important factor dont let somebody wander amongst the gpms and ris endlessly if you want ta action why well because they cant do it thats why well why cant they do it well the reason they cant do it is contained in the ris and gpms so youve got circular activity going on here you are locating the things that prevent them from itsaing and therefore if they restimulate the things that prevent them from itsaing they wont be able to itsa you see this is the snake eating his tail youre dealing with very highpowered stuff this is the backbone of aberration in the case there is greater aberration in the case than is contained in the goalsgpms and ris of the pcs actual goals as they roll on back now if you ever want any facts about this if you ever want to see this in actual operation or action and you want to practically smash up the pc to find out about it and establish the matter all youd have to do is is you had lot of goals given you back around fortythree trillion years ago in an area called helatrobus implant area now lets move you back there now all right now you just tell all about the goals in that area that you were given i know anybody thats been over this stuff would just shudder with horror its likesomething like asking somebody to go up to the top of the empire state building and be bird hes going to be hit left right and center by charge everything is going to go black on him the more he looks at things the blacker it gets the more he tries to move the more hell become fixed on the track the more goals he picks up the more jammed hes going to get the more mass hes going to pick up and he wont recognize the mass properly anyhow so hell get all wrong masses all wrong names for the items he hasnt got the patterns youre not giving him any assistance of any kind whatsoever now justjust take that as an example and if you doubt whyand dont have nerve enough to actually go the whole hog with somebodyjust throw somebody into helatrobus implant area and watch the behavior of the tone arm and then somehow if you can run the session out theres stuff on the backtrack that bites level iv is all subitsa its all subitsa the thing which reduces the pcs ability to itsa is contained in the materials of level iv its contained in those materials so the restimulation but not the discharge of those materialsand they will not discharge because theres way for him to tell what is whatthe restimulation of that will therefore reduce his ability to itsa now if youre just looking at it as well all right whats your first goal fine all right give the two top ris oh fine ill just write those down here all right thats good give the next pair of ris good ill write those down ah thank you very much what do you suppose your next pair of ris is in that gpm oh well good ill write those down oh thats fine now i suppose as youdont saytheres nothing more much in that goal all right thoughthats fine give the second goal on the line all right thats what you say it is okay ill write that down thats fine now give the top riwhats the matter i dont seem to be getting any ta here have i cut your itsa line have i stopped you from telling something ta seems to be stuck up here i seem to not be getting any tone arm motion lets see now oh all rightill do an arc break assessment for the session you see all right is this restimulation of an earlier cut communication in the session uh is this restimulation of an earlier rejected affinity and so on i dont seem to get anything to read here oh well well lets see on auditing now howwhat about auditing what about auditing uhyeah what solutions have you had for auditing im going to get somewhere now what solutions have you had for auditing half an hour laterta now is at 525 well well lets see maybe i can send him back to goals of sessionsold session goals you know heres an old session goal to lose my lumbosis now we used to have good action on that all right now lets go back into this again because we can really get someplace now now give some solutions for lumbosis what solutions have you had for your lumbosis so forth all right good good 55 stuck there is nothing known and im sure nothing will ever be known that will take that ta down except level iv the right goal the right item its just going to go on up and its just going to stick and the only direction its going to go is higher and the more you keep at this type of nonsense the less tone arm action you would have your tone arm action would drop to zero for the session itself and maybe on your since mid ruds and so forth to one and then if you kept up this nonsense would drop to zero for the session and zero for the mid ruds and zero for everything else and youd see that needle start to stiffen and that needle would go stiffer and stiffer and tighter and tighter and if you kept up this nonsense you all of sudden would take the pc backwards through 70 and find the pc sitting at 10 now if you still kept up this nonsense and so forth you would eventually move the pc to clear read with total stuck needledead thetan and very sick pc it would be so its all very well to talk about how you must listen to the pc when it comes to level iv the liabilities of using listenstyle auditing the liabilities of using that as the exclusive approach are enormous now this is the level of the oneman band this is the level of the oneman band this is time to have an auditor worrying about his hook into the trees this is time to have an auditor who gets spooky because he misses putt now look he has to keep in the itsa line and not cut the pcs itsa on the goals and ris which the pc is supposed to be operating on hes supposed to keep the pc out of trouble on the track hes not supposed to let the pc wander all over the place on the track and hes not supposed to cut the itsa line now those are two interesting counteropposed data you mustnt let the pc idly itsa on the track and you mustnt really push the pc all over the track either and you mustnt of course cut the pcs itsa now look at this as problem whats solution to this problem pc starts to look on the far backtrack and the auditor says were not going to go into that now the bypassed charge of what the pc has already restimulated kicks in and youve got beautiful roaring arc break you understand that so this isnt minor problem this is major problem and its time at that level to have an auditor worrying about his putting worrying about shiny clubs or dull clubswhich see its time to be worrying about any of the niceties of auditing this auditors got to know all the niceties of auditing he got to be pretty smooth article this is time to have an auditor who cant keep his model session straight this is time to have an auditor who is still queasy about lets see whatwhatwhatwhat is rocket read let see iivei heard of one once i wonder what it is uhdo you suppose thatsuhwheres the instructor uhwhatisis this rocket read this tick this is time to have that kind of thing going on level iv is the scientologist level its onemanband level do you know how you solve the backtrack problem the solution to thisof not let the pc wander on the track and get his attention all stirred up all over the placeis complex solution but very workable solution you just have to be able to audit like streak of light you just audit so fast you list so fast and you null so fast and you keep going so accurately and you never halt anyplace along the line and the pc never gets chance to have his attention wander its case of attention wandering you simply are so positive in what the pcs attention is on that the pc never has an opportunity to draw his breath and wander now ill give you an idea whatswhatits very easy to make pc wander on his attention very easy lets have an auditorof course the basic action of listing and the question is can you write as an auditor i spit fifty times and then read back i spit fifty times can you do that well if you cancant do that easily and without vast misgivings youll have trouble somewhere along the line of listing and nulling because thats the basic action of listing and nulling can you just do those two things not even look at meter can you just do those two things see can you write i spit fifty times and read i spit back fifty times thats all because thats actually all there is to listing and nulling you write down what the pc says and you read it back i mean there are complications to listing and nulling now how long do you list well thats all wound up in the bag now theres nothing much to that goals lists are almost always underlisted and item lists are almost always overlisted and you can make the goals list as long as you possibly can and you may still have underlisted and an item list make it as short as you possibly can and you may have overlisted those are the two great sinsthe constant fight of level iv auditor the constant fight of level iv auditor you go on youre running this goals list on the pc you see and my god youve gone fifty past your last rr but your needle is still slashing every once in while theres surge that goal isnt on the list its still going tick and clack and surge about every third goal the fellow puts down you get nice big healthy surge the needle goes acrosswhoa that goals list is not complete complete goals list doesnt have any needle action there isnt any needle action doesnt matter what goal he puts on this list now there is needle action and on goals list there is ta action at the time the list is complete needle action ta action its all completely flat and that goals list is complete and that is the only safe goals list there is youll get lucky some time bless you on onegoal list and youll check it all out and youve hit it right on the button and the next time the pc will give you onegoal list and even though it doesnt read on the meter you skip two gpms you start listing the thing you wrap the pc around telegraph pole and you spend the next three or four sessions trying to unsnarl this godawful mess see troubletrouble with level iv is you can get lucky and every time you get lucky you learn bad habit ive seen onegoal list that is perfectly accurate and ive seen pc cognite on his goal and it was perfectly accurate but ive seen pc do onegoal list that was completely inaccurate even though the goal fired and it was used and god help us and ive seen pc cognite gorgeously upon his goal on the listdone it myselfand it turned out not to be the goal for that list in fact it only turned out to be an actual goal not an actual gpm the next five hours of auditing after that fact i wouldnt wish on khrushchev horrible youre running with wrong goal and you dont know it these are the liabilities of luckiness pc cognitesbang he says oh my goal is to spit haha i got it thats it thathoho thats it thatthatthats the list the auditor says well i just dont dare arc break the pc and continue listing the pc has said thats it now ive cut the pcs itsa if iif i dont take this ive refuted it well youve got dodges such as this particular character all right fine that fired very well fired very well and blew down however i have to take all the charge off of the goals list between the gpms so well just have to list here for little while and this is the auditing questionwe just have to make sure you see not make sure that it is your goal itswere not interested in thatbut we just have to take the charge off of this list and the charge is off the list why fine and if its not off the list we will have to take it off and the pc will sit there just usually like little soldier and go ahead unless youve said well i cant help it i cant accept that goal yeah i dont dare accept thative got to have complete list thati know i know you keep saying your goal is to spit but thatwell ii cant pay any attention to that well of course youve got an arc broken pc because you refused his goal so the trick is of course to accept the goal with wideopen arms and do your job see always do your jobalways accept the pcs itsa and then do what you have to do thats adroit there is substitute for being adroit substitute for live auditor in that chair he knows if he cuts the pcs itsa line hes going to smash up the session and he knows if he accepts that pcs cognition without any further check whatsoever hes liable to smash up not only that session but the next four takes the lesser of the two evils he runs the risk of smashing up the session without cutting the pcs itsa and boy that is difficult sometimes that is very difficult but you can be very adroit oh your goal is toto spit yeah rocket reads reassurance see hope factor good realrfactor good blew down blew down i had blowdown here on that and he says that is so on and he goes on and he talks about it for little whileoh sure let him talk about it and you say well thats all right that rocket reads beautifully to spit rocket reads nicely and that blew your ta down from 45 down here to 275 and thats very good all right anything else youd like to say about that all right thats fine good enough had lot of good cognitions all right now we got to take the remaining charge off of this list and heres the listing questionhas doubt about this this goal weve put it right here ive marked it with red circle around it and so forth theres that goal weve got to take the charge off this list charge in between the banks you know pc will sit back and list for you perfectly fine and 50 percent of the time it turns out that to spit was it but what if it wasnt that 50 percent this time what if it was the other 50 percent you get the idea pc will get used to this situation now its true that if you cut the pcs itsa at level iv auditing his r with his bank folds up and he gets less and less real so you must do everything at level iv to promote the pcs itsa well you say this is hell of thing you have to promote the pcs itsa while cutting the pcs itsa well there are many ways to do it and ill go on and give you some of these but first lets go back and take look at this how do you keep him from wandering all over the backtrack every time you sit back and draw long breath every time you say to uh spuh spi thinkuh wait minute what was this uh toto spuh i cant quite read my writing here excuse to uh1 guess its uh soh to spit oh yeah to spit to spit a1 right thank you got anything thats suppressed on that or anything all right thank you all right very good thats out during that period of time you were not in control of the pcs itsaing attention linethat itsa maker you werent in control of it you werent in control of the bank you showed you werent in control of the bank by being fumbly with list so youre in absolute control of the bank and if you fumble list the bank will fumble so the bank fumbles unseen to you the pcs line is on the point where you fumbled therefore the bank is shifted underneath that scanner and of course the pcs attention goes off onto other things because youve shifted other things into his view with your well was it spauh spauh what uh spoouh i have to get the mid ruds in on this now because i guess ive made mistake on it havent i huhhuhhuh sorry huh and that bank is going to move and therefore your pc is going to get his attention on something else and the pcs now going to say say you know you can always expect after you goof like this if youreif you real observant of your own auditing and youre studying tape of you doing level iv which you should do someday you will see that short time after one of these fumbles the pc will come up with some yickleyack not necessarily crude and not necessarily critical or anything like that he isnt arc broke in any fashion but hes got lot of comments see adds another four or five goals to complete list get the idea something else goes on in other words you did something that showed you did not have control of the pcs bank you distracted the pcs itsa maker line you seeyou distracted that and played it on something else shifted the bank underneath itwith this goof you made with this list see and youre going to get some other stuff see why it isnt neat and clean see youreits allit gets sputtered up at that particular point all right thatsthats the substance of an arc break if the pc has any bypassed charge at that particular time its that goof will key it in or cutting his itsa line will key in the arc breakkey in the bypassed charge and youll get the arc break so that the more of these little goofs and yickleyacks which you get into here the more arc breaks youre going to have per session and the number of arc breaks or upsets which the pc has the more wanderings the pcs attention has been the more cut his itsa line has been these things are all in coordination so guy whos doing clumsy job on listing and nulling its can you write i spit fifty times and read it back see and if you cant write i spit fifty times and read it back when youre writing the complexity of fifty goals and reading them back that additional complexity will show up the inability to do the simple action and you stumble on these simple points that shows you dont have control of the bank and so loses control of the bank for moment you see do you know that if you read two goals backwards or upside down on list youve disarranged the bank lets go back tolets go up two goals and read one out of sequence just to see if it fired and then drop three goalsno dont read thoseand read the fourth one down to resume our list and you put the pc in little tiny bit of creak because what youve done is roll the bank backwards and then you havent rolled it forward again if you go back to read goal you actually should keep on going from that goal right straight on through see you should be able to write i spit fifty times and read it back in other words not take the fortyseventh spit get to the fortyseventh i spit and then decide that the thirtyfifth ought to be read again because when you do that youve disrupted the reeloff of the reactive bank see the time factor you seethat bank is timed and its running off underneath the scanner you might say very nicely until you all of sudden get to the fortyseventh and read the thirtyfifth or you suddenly dont read whats there i spatticated you say and of course its i spit at that point of the bank and so youve got an error point these are not serious they do nothing to case but they do great deal to your session at that moment the pcs attention gets dispersed and that dispersed attention now leads into itsa all over the cockeyed time track do you see how that is it is so mechanical an action that it is almost unbelievable to an auditor that he could do this much to pc with little piece of randomness of this particular character so hes reading i spit and he says i spat i spatticatedii meanpardonexcuse little mistake therei spit yeah i spit oh and the one above that that was i spati said i spat and thats actually i spit iill read that again i spit now well go down three below this and we will read i spit and you of course stirred up that part of the bank the pc is not quite able to confront it anyway the pc disperses his scanner line comes off of tension because youve yanked it onto the auditorone of the reasons youve put it onso that it didnt fit squarely up against the bank it goes off onto something else it restimulates little more charge dont you see next thing you know the pcs saying something else about something else if he has any bypassed charge at that moment youve ledlaid in the seed of an arc break you do that two or three times and if youve really got some bypassed charge in the session see bypassed charge in session will just lie dormant theres always bypassed charge in session always you cant run session that doesnt have some bypassed charge in it either from former sessions or the session youre running or from the life around you and if youre going to go through the beautiful dream of having pc who has bypassed charge of any kind whatsoever knock off the hop wake up youre just dreaming with the opium addicts man because there is such thing the keyin of bypassed charge is always some comm failure all youve got to do is unnecessarily cut up the pcs communication line refute his itsa in dozen different ways knock it around knock it around and put some session charge in there which bypasses charge in the session that restimulates the bypassed charge which is waiting to be restimulated and only that gives you your arc break you can in actual fact run pc with wrong goal without an arc break of course its rough on the pc i mean hes got wrong goal you arent necessarily running that goal you understand but you have found wrong goal on the case well now man wrong goal will just about tear somebodys head off and the pc can sit there actually with his head half torn off and if you are very smooth auditor indeed you would audit without giving the pc single arc break he wouldnt arc break you see it isnt true that bypassed charge equals arc break arc break always equals bypassed charge but bypassed charge does not always equal an arc break that formula requires bypassed charge via rough spot in auditing via session keyinof cut comm or some other such thingequals bypassed charge i mean equals arc break so thats only how an arc break adds up when you look at it in reverse now an arc break then does not always come about because youve bypassed charge you find wrong goal on the pc this does not equal arc break this may equal very uncomfortable pc in other words bypassed charge does not equal arc break but an arc break is always traceable to bypassed charge ill go over that again for you so theres doubt in your mind i mixed it up there moment if you have an arc break there must be some bypassed charge see thats always true but just because there is bypassed charge is reason theres got to be an arc break whether there is or is not an arc break by reason of the bypassed charge is totally conditionalutterly and completely conditionalupon the auditor of course the more bypassed charge there is in the session the less mistake the auditor has to make to kick it in now this depends then on the auditorsome little goof little cut commusually commucut communication of some kind or another or refuted itsa got bypassed charge here actually three sessions ago you inadvertently when you were coming up the line found wrong goal its still sitting there it hasnt given anybody any trouble up to this moment the pc just feels little creaky occasionally but is not complaining about it see youve audited two sessions sinceno arc breaks everythings going along all rightand the pc is looking around dreamily at the start of session or something like this and the auditor takes over and starts the session badly pc said i was having little bit of tough time this afternoon talking to soandso and uh oh well all right all right all right okay okay okay all right now all right with you if i start the session now and that will sit there and it doesnt take the drop of pencil to blow in screaming arc break now its been keyed in see the apparent impatience of the auditor you see to do something the cut comm the auditors apparent refusal to let the pc look at his bank just little rough spot that gives the pc some dispersion and then cut line on that rough spot and pow youve got your arc break and every arc break you get on pc must have gone through that cycle there are arc breaks that dont go through that cycle so dont kid yourself just because you didnt spot how you cut the communication just because you didnt spot how you chopped the itsajust because of this dont think there wasnt cut comm if youd had tape running on the session take my word for it you could have wound that tape right square back to that point of the session and you would havewhere the arc break occurred and then go anything up to ten minutes to half an hour sometimes even an hour and half earlier it all depends on how much session there was and you would have found deadon the arc break you would have found some little misdemeanor on the part of the auditor and then wind it back there anywheres from that point back an hour and half earlier you would have found nice nasty one crude as thiscrude as this see theyre crude these things youre not actually auditing on tightwire see i mean its big broad highway and if you dont drop any stoves on it you see and dont cut holes in the concrete you get along fine its actually that magnitudinous youll look back there but youthe tragedy is when an auditor doesnt look at these things as magnitudinous and blames the pc for all this stuff happening after pulling corny actions of this particular character so heres the pc and the pcs saying you know ii thinki think we had aim not quite sure but ii think we had aaaaaaoverlist on something i think weve had an overlist on something uh i just think we have i think we must have overlisted someplace or another wei think we went too far on an ri or something hes guessing at something see like that oh oh well all right all right heres your next list question well you say well that isnt bad that isnt bad that isnt bad but then you will find out that it actually went like this i really dont think we should go on listing on this list uh theres something wrong here someplace ii oh all right well heres the quheres the question see there will be forcingness of some kind or another will be going on here see orthose are about the most innocent examples that can cause this threedayold wrong goal to suddenly kick see pc doesnt know what it is he merely knows theres something wrong and he usually says it very gently in some particular fashion and the auditor just misses it clean and slams the barn door on the thing and hes got the show on the road now this thing is going to roll hes opened the door to the hurricane and they always happen like that and its too bad that you cant review some of the more serious arc breaks you had toto give thegive the truth of this situation it would cure you utterly of stumbling and fumbling and being unadroit at level iv it would just cure you of it if you could hear exactly how corny the thing was because its plenty corny this is true of all these types of arc breaks and misdemeanors now look the people that reg teaches here on sundaythey sit down and they look at each other see and they can auditoh yeah theyre having good time they sit down and look at each other and one of them talks about life and so forth and they undoubtedly get tone arm motion and so forth that is one godawful distancethats through the whole training of the game of golfbetween there and the pro see thats long long distance and for one of those characters to try to take up with the pc whether it is the right goal or the wrong goal in such way as not to arc break the pc and handle that thing to successful unarc broke conclusion is about the same as watching man intently to see if hes going to flap his wings and fly off to the sun he just wouldnthavent have prayer well theres where youre going dont you see now when youve got yourself good smooth grip on the situation so it doesnt worry you whether the pc is talkingdoesnt worry you to have the pc talking doesnt worry you to have the pc not talking thishaving the pc there talking or not talking or doing or not doing and so forth is not great subject of worryto where you can move the bank around at will you know the bank moves to whatever the auditor says and the pc looks at whatever the auditor tells him to you learn that real good and you all of sudden see what youre doing bankanything will appear you can say the date 1492 forcefully to pc and youve moved the bank1492 you can even oddly enough move the bank to may the 3rd at 200 in the afternoon 1492 you can move it to 201 you can move it to 202 and you will have exactly what the pc was looking at at that time and date now you may have to move him through it several times to obscure the intervening murk you may have to have the duration of the incident if you landed in the middle of an engram but its like developing pictures all the auditors got to say 1492 may the 3rd 200 in the afternoon the pcs got it thatthat is it now if the auditor is so corny that he doesnt realize that hes put it there and then ask the pc what he is looking at very unconfidently you see youyoure not looking at anything there are you i mean there isnt anything there of course the auditors moved the bank back out again you see by being uncertain of its location and then if the auditor doesnt know that he has to get the pc to scan that area very enthusiastically before he finally will be able to develop the picture see why of course he will never learn that he can do this but it in itself would be aalmost an auditing practical exercisea cross between the auditing section and the practical section move the pc to 1067 at 800 in the evening and find out what he was doing oh my god how could you do that how could you possibly do that elementary elementary you simply say 1067 800 in the evening you know whatever the date is thats all the bank will respond to that and then all you have to do is tell the pc to put the old scanner on it and scrub it up one of the ways of doing that is to move the pc seeactually its not moving the bank youre moving the pcover the area move him from 759 to 810 on certain date seecertain hour move him once move him twice move him three times move him four times and all of suddenurhh i did it with one guy one time he actually was dead in his head solid concretehe wasnt special type of case of any kind whatsoever its just patience on the part of the auditor i even remember the datei think it was january the 3rd forgotten what year it was january the 3rd i think it must have been 1950 was the date i moved him toand he couldnt see anything there and took him at that hour of the morning when heit developed that he had entered his office at that hour of the morning i thought wed get him eating breakfast or something he entered the office at that hour of the morning we developed the next halfhour and we just got him to enter his office and develop the next halfhour entered his office and went through the next halfhour entered his office and went though the next halfhour entered his office and went through the next halfhour and after wed done this about half dozen times he was reading his mail word by word addresses that he had never even vaguely remembered were firmly printed on the envelopes in front of his face he was highly intrigued see it was nonsignificant date nothing had happened on january the 3rd you know he first tried to figure it out you know figure it out you know well i didnt interrupt thisi just kept moving the somatic strip you see just moving his time track through that particular time and getting the pc to look at it and move it through that little time span get the pc to go through that time span and move it through that time span get an auditor would become very intrigued with the fact that he actually was moving the strip and the pc was looking at whatever he said these are very positive actions there isnt any doubt about it whatsoever just because the pc doesnt see it is proof that you havent got the pgot the strip there and got the pcs attention on it now of course there is this bungle you can move him into something which sticks him and then rough him up so that he and the bank dont follow any instructions and not arrive see there are very very many ways by which you dont arrive but theyre all along the lines of bypassing charge refusing to handle the pcs attention linethe itsa maker seerefusing to move the strip for something there to look at and these things add up to an impossibility to do it but you can take almost anybody as an auditor and pro ought to really be able to do this take your landlady and say wellmaybe shes forty years old or something like thatand you say all right well thats forty yearstwenty years ago1943 it might have meant the war were liable to walk him into bombing explosion if we go much earlier however lets take 1947 lets take 1947 all right now lets pick out nonsignificant date in 1947 of course an auditors always going after significant dates so you forget the vast number of nonsignificant dates which the pc finds very easy to confront dont you see youre always adjudicating whether or not the pc is there and confronting because youre running hell of an engramsome dentist halfway down his throat you know oh you cant confront it i guess there must be something wrong with my auditing you know hell he couldnt confront it at the time but lets just takelets just takelets scout around little bit discussion and lets getlets get may the 15th 1947 and lets take it at random about three oclock in the afternoon and lets find everything between three oclock in the afternoon and four oclock that afternoon see see nonsignificant date and you all of sudden find that youre actually moving the strip and moving the pcs attention and the pcs just doing it just like that see and next thing you know well i walk into the kitchen and i put on the teakettle see pc will be very intriguedive never had them revolt against doing this walk into the kitchen i put on the teakettle and so forth the next thing you know my god shes even tasting the biscuits you know quite remarkable reading the tea caddy and so on trying to get pcs to get pictures on the trackyou get the date and the duration of the incident on the backtrack you can turn on any picture and r3r is conclusion of old dianetics its triumph because the reason we couldnt run engrams on some people dont you see is they couldnt see them well in r3r you can always get them to see and be the engram i mean thatsthats dead easy but this nonsignificant gag actually doesnt really require this much nonsense of course you could take somebody whos very aberrated and doesnt know what the hell youre doing and isnt under your control and is ready to jump out the window and ishes sure youre the dentist and all that sort of thing youre of course not going to produce result to amount to anything they still will do what you tell them to do but they wont be able to report on it thats the main thing their communication line is too lousy and your doubt and the upsets you get into in trying to get them to do it then stir up things that disperse them and that sort of thing but ordinarily this is very easy activity to take some nonsignificant moment in the persons past move that nonsignificant moment under their attention scan that moment and get it fully redeveloped all right now theres very minor action supposing you didnt permit the pc to tell you what the pc was seeing thats an elementary auditing situation see you see understood in the session is command that the pc sort of is supposed to communicate to you because youre doing it so obviously you must want to know see so if you present at that moment the bank and then prevent the pc from reporting on what the pc saysand there are several ways by which you can do this one is to demand more than is there thats the most effective arc breaky method because youve got him now the missed withhold of nothing and you can do various things with that communication line all of them very mucky which will upset the general operation and here were dealing with nonsignificant thing were dealing with from three to four on may the 15th 1947 when she went in actually and put on teakettle and made pot of tea and went down and sat at her table there in the kitchen and ate some biscuits and drank tea total action significance absolutely zero she may get confused shes done this so often how comereally is this may the 15th she may doubt this or something like that but all of sudden even that doubt will come away and she will know that its that time she did this same action that shes done thousands of times you see its that sharp all right now take that situationtake that situation and figure out the number of ways you could louse up that person that you could prevent this action from happening one not believe that you were moving the date underneath the pcs attention do psychologists stunt of challenge the experiment all the time so it doesnt work psychologists are wonderful at this its wonder they never find out anything you ought to see crew of those martians work you really ought to see bunch of them work i mean youd roll on the floor by the way i made comment on one of these lectures one day ofthat you really wouldnt believe what i tell you about what psychiatrists do to the insane you probably wouldnt believe it because its just too too extravagant theres too much and you possibly just think im talking but if youif you dont if you think you have some reservation why dont you go down to the local mental hospital and take look at some of this treatment well actually in pe course down in south africa an official in the government heard that tape which i gave you here and he said thats good idea ron says i ought to go down and take look all right i will so he did and he wrote report which cant be released because he got it as government official of what he observed you see and you actually would be stunned by it they just take 220 volts and bang it between somebodys temple and they all go blue and bust them up gorgeously andits real wild just couple of nurses you see apathetically throwing patients down on the bed and doing this with them and just long assembly line and he looked up at the wall and he saw whole bunch ofpicture with whole bunch of psychiatrists in it and they all seemed relatively young but they were marked off as most of them dead and the head of the institution said yes thats true most of them are dead they just seem to all die young in this particular business didnt seem to strike him as peculiar now of course i shouldnt be releasing that much of the report and i havent released the actual mental shock report to you but it was interesting he went down and he found out it just ran this way see this is the way it goes see unbelievable nobody thinks it cures anything it doesnt do anything for anybody youre even told you see that nobody knows why it works if it works see its just all what wall he didnt believe something like that could go on in this planet well this type of attitude carried through on to psychological experiment they did at the ucla somebodyyou were supposed to say phrase to somebody who was asleep and then audit it back out and recover the phrase you see so the conditions of the experiment were set up they were only supposed to say this phrase and they werent supposed to say anything else so they walked in dragged the tape recorders in and made all kinds of comments and upsets and fell over the chairs and hooked up tape recorders and discussed the whole thing and then they knew it couldnt work and some of thefellow says well he wont be able to remember it anyway and he went onthey went on like this for two hours and then couldnt make up their mind what remark to give the fellow to be remembered theyd neglected writing that out you see and at that time scrubbed the whole experiment didnt try to get it back and concluded dianetics didnt work well you associate with people hanging from trees you get remarks of people hanging from trees thatswe ought to find nice forest for those guys anyway this is their idea of controlled experiment of course you attack phenomenon with that fantastic carelessness of course younothing ever happens you never get chance to observe any part of it did anything happen you couldnt tell see well so you have to kind of wash all that out and stop worrying about whether he did or he didnt or would he or wouldnt he and so forth and you just do it and it works every time in other words the auditors in direct control of the pcs time track and the pc always cooperates putting his attention on what the auditor says and out of this combo you could do almost anything on nonsignificant moments and that sort of thing you can do the most phenomenal things why anybody ever had to hypnotize bridey murphy i dont know i dont know it just required little bit of patience if you wanted to know what somebody was doingif you want to know what somebody was doing youd have to get time span the person was in the person might not have been on this planet five hundred years ago you see or something like that theres that possibility so you have to get time span in which the person actually was there and location in which the person was there to make any sense because you cant say 1492 to somebody who didnt arrive here till 1493 you see and didnt even know the date 1492 when it did happen but you could take it on years ago and undoubtedly land with it very handily so move it back on any time span anyalmost any random date see because youre going after aberration youre accustomed to picking up the cause of psychosomatic or the cause of this or the cause of that and you overlook these other simplicities see the total simplicity of the fact is that if the psychosomatic lies there well good heavens his drinking tea lies there see oh you say well he only made picture of the psychos that isnt true theyve just been up there cranking away man thatthey got thatthey got that camera going they can always replay you can just pick random time sometimes rather fantastic time you could pick seven trillion four hundred and fiftyfive billion six hundred and seventytwo million four hundred and sixtythree thousand five hundred and seventytwo years ago all right lets pick that up now we could even add decimal on the end of itpoint nine three five give that to the pc but you dont give it to the pc and have him move the time track you simply you know hand it out to the time track directly see and get the pc now to go over that littlegiving him time span in thatof what he was doing at that exact moment and get him to go over that few times few timesjust little time span get him to go over thethe point nine two see and get him to go over that little time span over it and over it and over it and over it and over it whats he doing well hes sitting herehes sitting here braiding some leaves together now unless you go mad and try to find out whats his name rank serial number how many wives does he have at that particular timebecause youre liable to be rather embarrassed to find out hehe was woman at that particular time you see unless you start going goofy and demanding more than the pc has got you will get exactly what is there and exactly what hes doing hes like sitting there braiding leaves and after while as you develop it little bit furtheryoure working picture now you have to work this for quite while and work fairly decent span to get the consciousness which was present in that picture too and get the memory which was present in the picture were asking little bit too much because the thing is just picture dont you see but you work that span over and lets work over one of those years from beginning to end over and over and over and over and over and eventually you will even develop some consciousness if you keep doing this with just one year span working it over very carefully you would even redevelop language if nothing horrible happened in that year you would for suredo it if your auditing was absolutely smooth now there is test of auditing youre handling all the elements of auditing nothing happenedthere was nothing alarming occurred at that particular period youre going through you see theres nothing to upset the person now therefore the only upset that can be present is you now if you can do that action that smoothly and that calmly and just get somebody to do that without introducing any falderal or blangablang then i think you could audit an engram very well for that period dont you see because now youve got an unwillingness of the pc slight unwillingness he doesnt want to confront this he really will butfor your sakebut you put the engram in front of him and you say all right now go through this now kind of playing the itsa maker over this and tell all what is it what is it you know itsa itsa itsa itsa itsa ahhhh he starts he gets somatic seegghhuuu that told him he better not itsa it see and you got to get him persuaded you know little bit more gghhuuuthats another somatic and uhhh put your attention hrgguhhf hes not quite sure he wantshrgguhhf psssst that things hot hehheh hhuuhh all right well for your sake ill go back to the beginning of it again you see hes being actually punished for going over this period of the track well you know hes getting pain in his epiglottis or something see every time you go through this thing and its developing worse and he actually felt very sad afterwards and he doesnt want to face all those tears so that requires little bit higher grade of auditing doesnt it the auditor now has got to be pretty purely straight he cant besee he cant be dropping his emeter in between the scanner and the bank you see he cant be clubbing the pc around and failing to take the itsa and having lot of trouble writing down his auditor report while he is auditing the pc he hasnt mastered the ability you see to make some notes while talking to the pc you see these little things he hasnt mastered hes having trouble with all these things you know and nobody polished his brassie so therefore hes hooking into the woods you know i mean thatthis is time for that kind of thing to be happening not while youre running through this engram with r3r all right now lets go little bit further haha lets plunk the guythudinto goal which was supposed to solve problems which would have causedand probably did causeseveral nervous breakdowns plunk him into the middle of gpm and put him into the totality of confusion that got him killed at least fifteen thousand times one ri see about fifteen thousand deaths in this ri all of them painful and you sayoh cheerily cheerilygo on confront it all right itsa haha yeah itsa all right what goal do you think youve got whats the ri what are the two top ris oh yeah you think they are huh oh well thats fine well take those what are the next ris you got any other goals of your own oh well just go on through it youre sure youre there oh youre trying to tell about it well im sorry i interrupted you and so forthim sorrya belldoorbell rang you dont mind illill come back in moment uh yeah uh yeah what were you saying now yeah well i dont think so that doesnt seem like that to i really think that the goal might have been some other kind of goal i think you had probably some other reason to have postulated than what youre saying now im just trying to give you an example of the raised corn nothing like that would ever occur but what do you think would happen to the pc man garrh now youre handling the same tools its just how much nitroglycerin in each one of them how leery is the pc of putting his attention on that particular stretch of bank well anything that killed him fifteen thousand times will kind of seem little bit grim hed have to have considerable confidence in his auditor that nothing weird was going to happen here before he could put his attention on this thing and be free of his environment enough to submerge out right all right now youre going to put his attention on that and this is time to be putting his attention on eight other things now pcs do take tours for theirthrough their banks and pcs do suddenly pick up items and give you and pcs do cognite on goals and all of these things happen and often they are right and often when they tell you why they have an arc break theyre right and theyre often wrong too and after theyve told you what the gpm is you find out its an actual goal but not gpm and after theyve told you the ri you find out thats just lock on lock on lock on lock of an ri you see this stuff is justis precision stuff all right now if the pc in his effort to please you and handle the bank and so forth is forbidden to cutand not give you all of those things which hes got and is discouraged from giving them to you by finding that they are very often wrongyou have cut down the pcs ability to confront now thats one of the things pcs got to have there man that pcs got to be able to confront because the itsa maker only works on those things the pc is willing to confront and when the pc is not willing to confront something he cant get his attention on it and he will balk and he will tell you that he cant go into it and god help you if you try to force him into it too god help you i wont dont ever force pc on this stuff man if the pc cant go theres something wrong always true pc cant go theres something wrong now you dont want this pc wandering all over the track and you dont want this pc itsaing bunch of stuff he shouldnt have and if you stop the pc from itsaing things you cut down the confidence of the pc in looking at that bank and therefore youve cut down your ability to direct the pcs line because youre invalidating that pcs itsa making line and youre invalidating it all the time all the time and so therefore the pc is soon not going to be able to look at all and oh man this is onemanband proposition and you see the elements its made out of this is time to be wondering where is the switch that turns on the emeter you get my point now im not saying it is difficult im saying that you make it difficult or you will make it difficult and that is the whole thing the pcthe pc will only have difficulty on what he can confront and do if you make considerable difficulty for the pc all the difficulties from that point are made these are easy these are easy things to do but they start out with being able to handle the pcs itsa encourage the pcs itsa get the pc to increase his itsa be able to handle the pcs bank be able to handle these various factors in session get real comfortable in that and then you start gearing up into this other stuff and now there are various things which you really have to be able to swing in and do and those things you have to swing into have to be done rapidly and accurately you do goals listlearn how to write quick going to get that goal down man dont go saying justjust minute just minute ii havent caught up yet very usually pc if its pointed out to him that hes giving goals too fast simply slows down pc gets used to it you dont have to be able to take it all in shorthand but dont try his patience like mad and when you get that goals list down be able to read the thing back be able to write goals list and never make mistake on whether or not the goal read on the meter keep your tone arm record while youre doing so these are all onemanband actions but theyre all extraneous to the basic things of auditing can you sit there and handle pc well can you sit there and handle pc well you can you sit there and handle pc and do bunch of other complicated actions at the same time its onemanband proposition funny part of it is you do any of those actions well you finally come out at the other end and you say what the hell was i worried about theres nothing to listing goals list and getting pcs goal theres nothing to listing an item list theres nothing to keeping the pcs itsa in theres just nothing to these things what have i been worried about all this time somebodys gone clear as bell somebodys rolling right on down the line the additives the additives i think this time i will cross my hands and interlock the little finger and the index finger of the two hands and then if i bring around the club this way perhaps i will be able to cure my hook im afraid you will look back eventually when youve batted one 250 yards down the fairway and say for heavens sakes what am i doing in actual fact golf is very difficult game compared to auditing its much more difficult theres lot more freaks and things that can go wrong involved in it level iv is formal auditing very very smooth formal auditing done with great speed and rapidity and you use speed and rapidity to overcome the pcs idea of wander you keep out of trouble by never forcing the pc where the pc cant go you fill in the itsa every possible opportunity you can youve got nice long list youve just done seean item list i say nice long item list it had twenty items on it see before you got one that couldwould rr see long items list and so forth youve read this item back and its gone ppssswwww and you say all right is this your item is this your item here tree ropers is that your item oh yeah yeah yeah thats it well youdont you say another word then dont cut his itsa line by any action whatsoever let him sit there and cogitate let him look at the thing let himlet him feel around it let him cognite on the thing for while he stays introverted for little whilejust you be silent and let him do it see all right when hes all through and hes got all that cognition out of the road and so forth take the list you just did and shove it over in front of him and say how do these other items relate to it is that the main item on that list of course he has to look at all these other locks compare these other locks and you see the tone arm pump up and down and go back and forth promote yourself lot of ta action out of it oh yeah this would and that would and the other thing would and those two top items they must belong to something else because they wouldnt but this does this solves all the other items yeah thisthats the common denominator to it sort of proves to him hes gotten down to the center of the thing see its him sayingself saying so yeah thats the way it is thats the way it is all right hes done all that youvehes said everything hes said about that hes studied that list all that he wants to you know doggone wellthis whole actionthis whole action by the way of his cognition everything else took three and quarter minutes and the auditor wasnt doing blessed thing see takes that list back looks it over hell see by this time that his tone arm is starting to rise that tone arm hasnt got any more blow on it because of that item you see his tone arm now is starting to rise and hes back there licketysplit in other words he drives like mad all right heres your question who or what would resolve tree rovers bowbow bowbowbow bowwabow bowwabow bowwabow bowwabow hes had two or three thank you thank you thanks got it got it you think the items on the list by now oh yeah i guessyeah i guess it has otherwise youre going around the corner see all right all right good ill just null this list if its all right with you bowwabow bowwawabow bowwowwowwow bowwabow bowwawow that fired all right bowwabow all right monkeys is that your item yeah yeah now youre not doing thing you know yeah yeah heymonkeys haha yeah thatthats it thats it all right how do the rest of these items relate to monkeys all right is that your item oh i donti dont know i dont know i dont know i dont know i dont know i thoughti thought the earlier item was your item oh you thought the earlier item was oh all right im sorry okay ill just see what we can do about that see what we can do about that you see wind wind wind ill see if we can get it see if we can get it here wind wind tell you what lets list just little bit longer and see if it fires bowwawabow bowbabow bowbabow bowbabow all right wind wind hey that fires is that your item all right thats fine hereshow does these other items relate well those other items dont i wentlisted around corner there and so forth that upper item thatthatthats it winds all right providing that rocket read it blew down and everythings fine id compound it by telling the pci always canable to get little bit moreafter the pc has said its his itemafter the pc has said it relates to all other items after the pcs got it all sorted out and after its all square with the pc then i tell the pc its his item and ill always get another half tone arm division now this is onemanband proposition this is time to be hauling around and wondering about itsa so in your lower levels get very confident get up to pointitsa snitsa nothing to that move the bank move the bank move the pcs attention we want some tone arm actionheres fortyfive divisionsswish get the idea not worried about it because lookthat is just kindergarten to that youve got to add up up up up on great delicacy on great perception of what pcs doing all these things come on top of those basic skills and you probably have to break lot of bad habits such as the way to run level ivi know how to run level iv you sit back and you look at the pc and let him talk about his goals and gpms i know how to run level iv well you very soon will find out you dont know how to run level iv because its the greatest discipliner in the world but once youve learned how to run it once youve learned how to handle pc once youve learned how to handle bank theres actually very little to learning the rest of it and youll wind up at the other end of it wondering how in the name of god did i ever think this was complicated whats so complicated about this theres nothing complicated about this this is awful easy but sometimes it takes long time to get that point sometimes you arrive at that point and ill tell you the fast way to do it do it thank you
