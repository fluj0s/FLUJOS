the preclear and getting auditing to work lecture given on 19 may 1964 thank you whats the date audience 19th may nineteen may ad 14 saint hill special briefing course the reason whywhy everybody showed up here so fast actually has to do only with one factis i havent lectured here for couple of weeks you see now yourei dont know why we called this lecture today actually i should be up there working on the verification of your materials and so forth which are all pretty well in hand i think if you were going into the materials which im working on at the present moment why it would probably be different story but the object is not to get you wrapped up but to wrap up the materials so im doing it thei havent really anything to talk to you about today at all but i thinki think that you probably know all there is to know about auditing you probably have difficulties with auditing you probably have difficulties with the material at all and everything is smoothed out and you got all that taped now i think we probably ought to take up the preclear and getting win on the preclear applying the information to preclear i think that mightmight be germane to the situation the situation is pinpointed by the fact thative forgotten the exact numberi think i had twentyfive provisional class vis issued herewhat was thetwentyfourlast week and i think that you all ought to be applauded for getting through to where you did the only comment id like to make on that is i never saw such vicious grading in my life i just never saw such vicious grading in my life you had some of your papers on your fellow students down to around sixty when the grade was eighty plus and on one noteworthy example it was down around sixty when the actual grade was ninety its fantastic fantastic but on classification examination im not about to stand there idly twiddling my thumbs and of course i graded all the papers afterwards personally took about six hours by the way going through every question and so forth because all i wanted to know was justis this auditor competent and does he know his material you see and even so i didnt have to stretch any points to amount to anything but those grades were just cut to ribbons i never saw the like of it and so forth and i said to myselfi said to myself well i hope this isnt symptom of what will happen to the preclear pretty ghastly anyhow you all did quite amazingly well your grades were right up there with the saint hill coaudit course grades on the final exam and your examination was tougher if anything than that so im quite happy with that now now how auditing can occur is probably the greatest mystery to the person who makes it work the least youve got mysterious mysteriousness on any auditor who is having an awful hard time making anybody recover from something see hes got mystery and he may not know he has this mystery he may not know he has this mystery but he really doesnt know why auditing works or if it does work and he has assigned some value to the subject of auditing which is different and extraneous to the actual value of auditing so therefore he makes enough goofs in trying to handle auditing that auditing doesnt work its as simple as this you see and he always looks for something more mysterious than is he looks for something more complicated than is and you whenever you have student that just cant seem to get any kind of result whatsoever onethird of the time his trouble will resolve if you simply ask him why auditing doesnt work and why it does work and get him into big discussion about this thing now you will have relieved then the impediment which is preventing him from perceiving he will have been impeded from perceiving why auditing works so person who cant understand why auditing works has got barricade across the line of his understanding which is presumption that it doesnt work do you see he is not about to understand why it works because he already understands that it doesnt work on some reactive basis you see he knows it doesnt work so now youre going to ask him to try to understand why it does work and of course hell hit this other one and he never will grasp it do you see hes blocked himself out from comprehension of it so therefore discussion of this simple basic to you as an instructor of auditors is like diamondslike diamonds itll cut through most of your more difficult students and so on the way to use this little gimmick isyou see somebody is having terrible time with his comm cycle now anybody has little bit of trouble with comm cycle you take pc hes all rattled and hes upset and hes this and hes that and the other thing and hes in the middle of theof the bank and so on and his comm cycle response you see is so rough quite ordinarily that it takes good expert to even find out you know which way its going or what its doing you have to be an expert just to get by see as an auditor all right so the pc you see hes already all rattlepated out on the subject of his comm cycle you see you ask him one question he gets an answer to something else you see and your effort to steer him through this without arc breaking him and so forth as i said that is an expert actionan expert action because that is rugged its never quite by pattern from the pcs viewpoint and of course thats as it should be so the auditor who understands this aspect of it he doesnt have very much trouble with anything but the pc now supposing he has trouble with understanding what the comm cycle is understanding why auditing works and this is added to the difficulty the pc is going to introduce into it of course at this moment we get an unmanageable session we get improvement we get case gain we get nothing you see why the auditor is already incapable because of his own barricade across the line of understanding why auditing works because something is telling him that it doesnt work or there is some reason why it shouldnt work you see something like this so thats already got him stopped so therefore he doesnt understand that it should work now lets put that mess on the line then lets get the routine difficulty that pc introduces into the line you see pc gets all waddlegabopped you see he sounds like ions going around inside of his skull you know hes banging from hither to hence and you ask him do fish swim and he gets do they fly you know hesthats why hes being audited you see because hes got stuff to walk through see well that introduces the problem into the thing and by the time you get the combination of all these factors why you getyou get gain see so i repeat you have to be an expert to handle the pcs comm cycle anyway and therefore you have to take out of line as an auditing instructor an auditors instructor you have to take out of line those things which make it too difficult to do and chief amongst those is does auditing work or why doesnt auditing work and discussion of this particular character is very very very heavy in its payment youll be quite surprised im not giving you bum tip here this is hot one see as far as study is concerned all right now you take this fellowill show you how you spot him see hes sitting there and he says donow have you ever been up or whatever repetitive process hes running you know and the pc says mmhmm hmm thank you good thank you have you ever been up and the pc says thank you good itsitsyou go what the hells going on here see this thistheres comm cycle here whats going on see or youll get theres so many variations of this it would be almost impossible to mimic them all you get the auditor who says how many is up or something of the sort and the pc says well actuallyactually its matter of downness ive always thought it was really matter of downness and so forth but when you really come down to think about it and so forth when you really take how many is up you count them off andand so forth and so forth and but i dont really understand that its how many is down that is really gotgot the thing important to you see thatthats what really i keep dwelling on and the auditor says thank you just as though something has happened you see and he asks the same question again and he gets another evasion see and he never really notices that the pc never has understood or agreed with the auditing question now the pc hasnt got clue as to whats going to happen here well pc isnt answering the auditing question in other words you can just keep adding these various flubs you see any of them and they all come under the category the auditor isnt answasking the question getting it answered and acknowledging when the pc has completed his answer see and you get any variation of thatget any variation of that then youve got an auditor who has got one over here of course you show him how to do it and he says oh thats the way to do it and he does it perfectly you see you dont need anyany more action than that this guy cant seem to learn it you straighten him all up on cutting the pcs responses now he asks one question in 2Â½ hour session and lets the pc chatter the rest of the time see youve got him broken of one thing he goes into another thing you see now my recommendation is notas the auditors instructornot to go into despair but to examineto examine this one burning question why doesnt auditing work lets get it out into the clear see and you all of sudden will find some very interesting answers youve got to be auditing on your toes to get these things and catch them as they go by you know youve got to watch that tone arm he says well something or other something or other and you get wild blowdown on the tone arm well make note over here to take that one up too see and he all of sudden will come out with some very very interesting data and it will be very revelatory to him too and after that he says well of course auditing works you know now you say go back in there again with comm cycle and its ratatattatatabang and you wont have any trouble teaching the comm cycle see got this as side panel to auditing says nothing to do with taking care of the pc this is the auditor taking care of the pc why do you have trouble with this see all right thats under one heading thenthis one heading and thats why doesnt auditing work thatjust put that in one big wide broad heading you see somebody whos having too much trouble cant ever get tone arm action this way and that way as an auditor thatsthats one thing you do with this fellow and there happen to be two more things and thats the subject of this lecture here now in this type of interrogation this looks very much like an auditing session but its not quite an auditing session its not quite an auditing session because you are looking for something that answers your question that only the auditing will tell you not really the pc do you see thats little bit different youre accumulating information so that youre steering the pc toward cognition and he eventually will round up the cognition you dont preconceive the cognition you understand but you take tone arm blowdowns on everything he has told you see every time he sayshes sayingill just give you ridiculous exampleevery time he says its adult you see and its immaturity and he keepsevery time he says itsits adult or something you get blowdown you make note of that adult over here you see and then he mentions this word immaturity and hes still discussing why auditing doesnt work you see and you write down immaturity and you finallywhats this got to do with it see well hes finished telling you everythinghes finished now lets find out what does adult have to do with auditing not working you see and what does immaturity of it so on and hes got some kind of an idea that everybody is stuck at the age of four that he got taught in sociology class or something of this sort so therefore theyre not sufficiently mature to face up to the realities of existence you see hes got this all packed in sideways all of sudden hell get the rest of the puzzle and drag it off what these blowdowns are are little flags that tells you theres dynamite buried here and you take that up and you can completely change the auditing address and aspect of an auditors auditing with such discussion as an auditing instructor so thats well worth knowing but therere two other categories so i wont say that will work with every one of these cases and there may be two or three more categories but i will give you as many as i know and im certain of now lets give you the next one not because its the next most important but because it is theits an old one and it comes under the heading of help now unfortunately you must not use failed help you mustnt use failed anything thats because of the line plot of actual goals so lets just skip this idea of failed dont you see well just have to take up the subject of help this is another ramification of what ive just been telling you but it hits sometimes very close to home indeed there is gpm about help so letsyou can hit it as heavy as you want to see thats something above i can give you data of this particular character now because knowing what is the totality content of the reactive bank you see i know some things are slightly senior to the content or dont impinge on the content and therefore can be cared for independently you see without undue restimulation and this toothis just barely comes under the headinghelp just barely comes under the heading therefore its rather successful its rather successful you may find help in an implant someplace or something but it isnt going to wrap anybody around telegraph pole you can take up the subject of help you see you can take up the subject of who hes tried to help and whos tried to help him and who hes tried to help and any confounded thing you want to take up under this subject and youre liable to get someplace with this auditor who really cant make auditing work well theres use trying you get cognitions like this theres use trying to help them because man only succeeds when he helps himself see so where the hell did i get that you know hes standing back and he looks at this thing and he suddenly conceives of dragging somebody out of stone quarry you see and he conceives of standing up on the bank of the stone quarry looking diffidently down into the stone quarry with the guy drowning down there you see and sheer walls and thinking to himself well theres reason to give him hand or throw him rope because he really doesnt deserve help unless he can help himself you see the poor sod down there hasnt got anything to hold onto nothing to stand up in of course this becomes ridiculous even to him see but youll findyoull find that thesethese oddbit presumptions of some kind or another get wedged sideways in somebodys skull and you couldnt begin to make dictionary of the number of them you will find theyre just innumerable so you dont know quite what youre digging for except youre digging for an impediment on the subject of help something is impeding his ability to help or be helped and thats all youre digging for so anything that you talk about help that he hits on that is sidelight to help that gives you tone arm motion you then make note of to take up independently and you will chase this whole thing all the way down to proper cognition and you will therefore take care of his attitude toward pcs and auditing you see and all of sudden he will start using the comm cycle you understand that the whole basis of it is is the comm cycle is too easy to use as long as the persons intention toward the pc is good and hes trying to assist the pc and so forth so the things which make person unable to use such comm cycle are those things of course which make person believe that he cannot assist or cannot or should not or that its impossible to see you get theyou get where you enter this see theres where you enter it see of course all this works with pcs too this really works with pcs this also applies to the pcs who get tone arm action pcs who get tone arm action and so forth have got one of these buttons well theres dangling spring that goes out here about yard see and the button is out here you see and all the machinery down underneath where the spring should contact on this button and so on is all miswired and filled full of concrete and youre not about to get there without special address to the situation see in other words this person is sitting there saying well i cant be helped anyway actually nobody could help anybody if anybody did help anybody then he would become responsible for the other persons life and i dont want this other person to be responsible for my life because that would be bad thing to do to them so therefore if i sit here just sort of blank why therefore i wont incur any liability this is some reactive thlthlthlthl thats going on see and thats why the person isnt getting tone arm actiongiven good auditing but were taking it up of course here at saint hill from the auditors viewpoint thats all good preclear material now the other one which i save until last is bit more esoteric now there may be some more of these things i wouldnt say there arent but i notice from long lock of experience along the line most of the pcs ive had much to do with have come under one or another of these three categories now this other onethis other one is real dog this other one is sneaky sneak that probably could furnish the material for half dozen lectures ill give it to you very rapidly this is of great social importance what im giving you this is something to chitterchatter about now because its so interesting dont forget the other two this is very interesting and if i were giving thisif i were giving thistheres nice spring rainif i were giving this in broad sort of way at congress or something like this i could really embroider this thing up i would call the beginning lecture life amongst the lowly people especially southerners dont recognize thats the second title to uncle toms cabin its very amusing you can ask southerner have you ever read book called life amongst the lowly have you ever heard of this book and they will swear you can bet them couple of pounds and theyll lose every time life amongst the lowly why is life amongst the lowly so lowly ill give it to you right where i caught iton the entrance point this was the entrance point to this examination its all right for some professor to sit in his ivory tower and ivorytowerify and fill books withfull of what other professors in their ivory towers have ivorytowerified but theres substitute for getting down and getting your paws dirty with life to know what its all about there is just substitute for that and ive rubbed elbows with an awful lot of people at various stratas and classes sizes shapes and descriptions and in rubbing elbows one fact used to strike as wild bit that i never could quite reconcile there was this weird attitude which didnt fit with what they did to people im not now saying there is such thing as lower classes im talking about people who under tremendous duress people who are being hammered and pounded by the economic mills and ground very fine indeed people who are being hunted criminals on the run dont you see this type of person people thattheyve more or less had it you know from life and those people in group do one thing that is common denominator to the group its always poor dillinger they shot him its always poor bill poor joe theres always grief and supersaccharine sympathy of some kind or another it really isnt sentimentalityits too gruesome and ive listened to thisoh group of guys sitting on focsle head you know and theyre talking about poor old bill you know the sharks got him you know and ive listened to this and in life they just knock each others heads off see theyre unthinkably mean to one another but theyre so supersaccharineweird aspect thisand it always just kind of went clinkcreak it didnt make any sense you see theyd just as soon step on dillingers teeth and sell them at the local pawnshop see see but its poor dillinger you know and its poor you and this poor you gave clue to something that is confoundedly well worth knowing and it very well could open up whole field and make real subject of sociology because it gives us the mechanism by which the lowly hold the lowly down and which they do to one another constantly and continuously and instinctively and its just about as vicious as keeping cobra in the cash drawer and then inviting somebody to rob it its wild mechanism why is it wild mechanism i dare say you will occasionally hear this or you have occasionally heard this but really youd have to be on the seamier side of life than most of you are accustomed to to run into it as habit and way of life the slumsthe places where people have zero opportunity that sort of thing there is where it is most prevalent its the poor you you poor fellow and now lets move it up into little bit more workable technical platform how you have been wronged how he was wronged how they were wronged now lets just move it into that technical platform and we all of sudden see that life amongst the lowly depends exclusively on their continued operation of just this one little gimmick not on any other gimmick were looking now at the common denominator of sociology what makes slum slum why can fellow never get out of the slum how come what is this trap well its how you have been wronged how they have been wronged and so forth and not to any great degree except as an example how i have been wronged that is not its dominant cord you will hear that in there as an example but that isisntthats just response to the mechanism that isnt the important point of the mechanism in the early days of dianetics we ourselves had this you see how you have been wronged see and it is the most acceptable thing that you ever had anything to do with people just licked this up left right and center well what happened to it well i worked it out along another linean entirely different line if you cant take responsibility for your own actions and if you cant recognize the cause of your difficulties then youre in trap and youll continue in that trap forevermore and i became completely unwilling to hold people forever in trap by any reason even that of popularity which of course everybody knows is the greatest god to worship there is im thinking of johnsons poverty programs now and the fact that he had five families sitting down on one of hisone of his farms in the most abject poverty that anybody had ever lived in the republicans went down and dug it up it may haveit probably would contribute to finishing himjohnson off as presidential candidate the point is here this war against poverty would have to include an understanding of why people in groups remain poor this is the missing link this piece of data im giving you right nowquite valuable to the auditor and very valuable sociologically as i said i could lecture on it very long time and its very interesting but lets get down to what the truth of the matter is an individual must accept his own responsibility and his own ability as cause before he can run off his overts simple you cant have an overt if you cant recognize yourself as cause you cant get out of rat race unless you can recognize your overts thats all there is to it see so how do you keep somebody in rat race just never let him recognize his overts and you say poor you look at everything that has been done to you and you you have never done anything you poor fellow look how you have been wronged there you were sitting there innocently doing nothing and up jumped the regiment and wiped you out you poor fellow and all you have to do is keep up running fire of this stuff and you effectively suppress and mask the fact that the individual himself is capable of causation lets just not worry about the overt act youre telling this individual that he was incapable of cause and you are pointing out moments particularly when he was not at cause and you are pointing out the fact that he justthings just happen to him and that he doesnt cause any of them which brings him into causeless thing which throws him into the dwindling spiral and will hold him on the floor and on the bottom of the heap forever and all you have to do is keep convincing him that he has been wronged and that he himself never wrongs anybody thats all you have to do you just keep that mechanism going and theyll stay on the bottom of the pile forever so life amongst the lowly is long song of how you have been wronged you never had chance and when you get this tune played out to its bitterest end you get person who is bitterly finished because he can never get off an overt act now we have to go back into what is reallycompletely aside from the fact that this does occur in actual gpms and so forthwhat really is obsessedness how does person become obsessed with problem this isthis is gold man this is solid gold to an auditor how does person become obsessed with problem how is he always dwelling on it dwelling on it dwelling on it thinking on it thinking on it thinking on it why why why why why is he stuck inhow does he get stuck in this see why is thisthis isthis describes ninety percent of your pcs see they walk in and all he can think about is madge left madge left madge left madge left madge left you seehell bring it up and so forth and they say soandso and soandso and soandso and you think youve gotten them out of it now and youve processed them down the line very beautifully and all of sudden madge left see you never can seem to get them off of thatyou never can get the needle out of that groove much less off the platter they just go on days and days they spendworrying worrying thinking thinking going on and on about about this thing see they cant get the needle changed you see they cant get the platter flipped and you the auditor know instinctively that youve got to change that tune before you can have anybody in front of you whos paying any attention to auditing hes obsessed with the subject of well that all went backi guess that was in the days before madge left he had it all taped you never get tired of personnel like you get tired of one of these personnel in pcs bank you know that was before the bank failure before the bank failure that was after the bank failure you know the bank failed now what pins them into it and what can unpin them and this becomes very vital information what can unpin them off of this thing theres several systems that can be used to unpin them we wont go into all of the systems that can be used but chief amongst them is the ow sequence that is prime mechanism that pins person into obsessiveness they never recognize their own overt in that sphere of existence and not recognizing their own overt in that sphere of existence they can never unpin themselves from it now let put it very crudely before you get your hand cut off in buzz saw youve got to get yourself somehow in the vicinity of buzz saw and you in some fashion or another have got to reach for that buzz saw its actually impossible for you to get your hand cut off in band saw unless somehow or another you have by whatever concatenation arranged that proximity now somewhere back along the line before the buzz saw the individual did something or committed something that walked him on that channel up to getting his hand cut off in buzz saw he did something to arrive him there that is very important because he will never get out of there till youve tricked the something that actually did arrive him there its not good enough to have him inventing reasons its not guilt you see is justis ais the inversion of this you keep inventing ideas inventing overts theres guys around whovewho eventually have realized that they have to get off their overts but they dont know what they are they havent got an auditor so theyll invent overts to get off youve got to beware of this bird too see thats known as guilt complex ten thousand japanese killed in landslide this fellow was sitting in birmingham at the time he says how did i do it thats guilt complex in operation so it goes into an inversion and the individual will actually start dreaming up things he didnt do in order to get out of the obsession of thought see hell eventually go that far well hes spun by the time he goes there on that subject but lookahere what is thiswhat is this constant dwelling of the mind on this action that the auditor runs into continuously in processing pcs its very hard not to run into this its the overt act that he committed that kept him pinned into that line and if you want to really find the overt act and monkey around with this nicely and gently by any overt act system that we have ever had you all of sudden will find what he really did doand youve got to beware of the guilt complex of inventing things that he did do that he didnt do because this is just another alteris you see you see he can alteris this as well as get off his actual overt so therefore you always have to verify one of these things when youre handling one of these things on making sure that he didnt give you any untruths youve got to get your truth answer in there on the emeter in other words youve got to ask him is there anything youve told that doesnt apply to this you seeor youre trying in some diplomatic way you told any lies bud you want to get that off because they will but any one of these dwellings upon it is preceded by basic overt act which is followed by withhold and followed by other overt acts and the individual is keeping himself pinned into this thing by his series of overt acts he cannot get out of that channel of thought hell tell you i could just give anything anything anythingi could justidid just give anything not to be thinking about the service station ififif i could just for five minutes not think about the service station and worry about it you see anything youll actually run into somebody like this sometime or another you know ifif i could just stop thinking about it you know ififif i could just go down to the beach or something like that or so forth and vava vaa thats more notable example where the pc is articulating it sometimes you merely observe it in the pc or something well whats the action lets get off his actual overts against the service station his overts and withholds from the service station and bing just like magic he stops thinking about it in other words all dwellingness on subject is associated with overts against that subject you follow that thats rule that you can carry around in your hip pocket and feel like youve got it full of diamonds you wont recognize that youve got diamonds there until you run into this pc who is dadadadadahes got present time problem present time problem present time problem he comes to every session hes got present time problem hes got present time problem and its present time problem about his domestic affairs present time problem about his domestic affairs present time problem about his domestic affairs so you spend two hours of the two and half hours cleaning up the present time problem about domestic affairs it should occur to you now to ask do you spend lot of time thinking about this outside of auditing oh oh hahaha yes i dont think about anything else in other words hes really not insession hes just continued his life over into the auditing session see anybody comes up there with present time problems all the time in an auditing session hes not free of those things outside the auditing session and the way for you to cure this is ow you run any version of ow and weve got lots of systems of running ow theres some very slippy ones theres various types and kinds of running ow this is quite subject and it well merits being subject since it is very very upscale and is of greater order of magnitude than the reactive bank itself it is something that is part and parcel of life which is senior to other types of aberration told you something then didnt i its pretty horrible to think of it is senior in its power even to gpms in other words you could be totally free of gpms and still be colliding with the ow sequence youd still get the consequences of your overts now you can carry it perhaps upstairs in auditing to point where you longer have the consequences of your overts and that undoubtedly is true but im just telling you that there it stands and thats pretty magnitudinous statement just between ourselves that its senior to gpms so its always safe to audit ow and its always indicated to audit ow and thats one of the things unfortunately which auditors do very industriously but here or there do very badly they can make stinking job out of ow just not to be critical but just to be factual it can be the most stinking driveling job i ever heard of they chop up comm cycles and they do this and misread metersand somehow or anotherand then you find out oh i finally did i got the overt what was the overt well the auditor was thinking hostile thoughts about while i was auditing him oh oh this merely showed bypassed charge in the session he didnt get an overt off what auditors will sometimes buy as an overt is matter of grief to it really is i look over auditors reports and theyve gotten this overt off of this pc and the pc had been going around all the time all the time all the time not sending his mother candy this is an overt act you know its unbelievable its unbelievable but i dont mean to downgrade you or berate you but very often some godawful tacit consent will come into one of these sessions where i dont get my overts off therefore i wont get them off you and you dont get them off and well all sit here and be happy and you know why they do that and why theyve done that because theres some thread of this sociological datum ive just given you running through that session ah yes so we carried the typhoid fever with us into scientology so its good thing to know that theres atheres an illness known as youve been wronged because it has been the source of great despair to amongst auditors wondering why in the name of heaven they just couldnt sit down and say whatcha done sister whatcha done and she says well i didnt do very much all right but how much was it you know and just carry it on through in workmanlike fashion and thats because wrongitis has entered the session see how youve been wronged this is so much part of the social world around us that it very easily slips into session if the auditor is not aware of this fact so hes inclined to sympathize with the pc and he thinks its very openhearted beautiful sentiment on his own part its just about as beautiful as striking rattlesnake we always knew there was something wrong with this youll find it mentioned in the first book you can only give him sympathy as the lowest level of healing well morei revise that man thats level of healing thats method of strangulation you get my point now you get what im talking about here if the auditor sets theresits there see and thehe says to the pc all right what have youwhat have you done now you haveyoure thinking all the time about cat fur now what have you ever done to cats you see well the pc says well cats caterwaul outside my window all night long and keep awake good weve gotten that overt act off whats going on here see see the auditor very very slippily will pick up motivator for an overt and so forth you ask somebody somebody is unhappy with their auditor or something of the sort and somebodyll pick him up and youll say look get his overts off against the auditor and he sits there and listens to an hours worth of motivators and says well i fixed him up and now the guy does cave in see they think one is being tough or they can be interpreted wrongly in several different ways the only thing im trying to tell you is just thisthis very very close point is if you carry this you poor devil you have been wronged into session you longer audit the pc at cause youre auditing the pc at effect and so the pc will not get better you buy motivators and sympathize with these motivators of all the horrible things that have happened to the pc in his lifetimeperfectly all right you understand for pc to tell you how horrible life has been to him as long as with not too tactless change of pace you get in and find out all the horrible things hes done to life youve got to recognize that the you are wronged is disease you poor fellow you have been wronged you poor fellow you have been wronged and any time you give somebody this kind of response of any kind whatsoever youre contributing to his upset contributing to his illness because the only way hell ever get out of it is return his own causation not how hes been wronged how has he done some wrong to somebody and as soon as you get the other side of that picture cleaned up all of sudden bing its just like magic you see nothing can hold onto thetan there is butterfly net there is electronic switchboard there is nothing can hold onto thetan nothing that isthats the truth of the situation there is hobbles there is ropes nothing can really hold on to thetan it sounds absolutely incredible but its true well how come he gets caught he must have grabbed hold and then forgotten hed grabbed hold for him to be trapped thereafter see there he is holding onto the stanchion in the bus with third hand he didnt know he had and with the other two hands trying to push himself off the bus and wondered how he cant get off the bus so now he has to conclude that he is trapped on the bus nothing can trap him on the bus except his own holding onto the bus hes got tohes got to have hold of it now what is this third hand the third hand is his overts against the bus thats how he cant get out of it thats how he cannot get out of aof an engram thats how he cant getreally cant get out of the bank this isso on he himself has overts it might add up to something that the one that we areyoull find out to really get somebody out of are the banks he makes himself and has made himself oh man getting him out of those is rough getting him out of an implant oh sneeze see its nothing to get him out of an implant but how about his own actual gpms oh wow see its rough rough see its easily done today but its his own actual gpms that are holding him not the ones that were given to him gratuitously thats something for you to recognize so you sit down and you tell this pc you poor fellow how have you been wronged in life good how else have you been wronged all right now we both recognize you have been wronged where do you think hes going to drift up or down hes going to go down in session man he cant do anything else because youre auditing himone youre auditing him at effect two you are pulling on him the gadget that its all done to him and hes never done anything you are confirming this third mysterious hand that is busy holding onto this thing hes sohes so busy worried about and so forth youre just burying that hand little bit further because that hand is an overt see thats the overt act and youre carrying with you the whole sociological impact of life amongst the lowly how is it the man can never get out of slum well youll see this dramatized right straight on up into life in its solid aspects of today you go down to chicago you find out therethere are various types of slums nothing to do with color you can find white slums that are twice as slummy as any other kind of slums you see theres nothing to do with color see were talking about slums well the dominant aspect which you will find in that slum is how you have been wronged and that nobody can be at cause the thing is you cant do anything about it you look in their windows and youll find out that lucky charms and things like this probably occupy the greatest commerce of the whole place see its all based on some kind of wild luck like numbers racket or its based on buy your lucky pixie fish see today and so forth you know you cant do anything about it but maybe some goddess called lady luck or something like that nobody has run into lately actually she retired i forgot to tell them that down in reno when they opened up vegas she retired because she didnt like everything fixed anyway the whole score in that place is you cant do anything about it nothing can be done about it played hand in glove counterpoint with how you have been wronged and we notice that federal governments which arenational governments and so forth which are notorious for their affinity for the indigentthey just love the indigent they wont take care of any industrious bloke thats doing job in the society but boy they just love the indigent to point where theyd love to make them more indigent and that is the mechanism they use in their social work how you have been wronged this is thethis is the yap used by the labor agitator and so forth to the workmen how you have been wronged everybody always feels worse after hes talked to one of them but never can quite figure out why in other words its black operation just pure and simple black operation how you have been wronged so when you sit there and this fellow has actually kicked his sister downstairs and busted her skull in and you let him get off fact that his father whipped him yes father whipped you dont even say why did your father whip you but well father whipped and he was always brute oh you poor fellow well thank you i guess weve got that straightened out in your life now what else can we find teacher was mean to he doesnt say anything about those frogs in the inkwell see teacher was mean to and everybodys mean to the auditor who sits there and says yes we agree everybody was mean yes we agree everything is fine oh yes hes saying at t same time you werent at cause you didnt do anything it was all purposeless there is way you can regulate your fate life is this way see pah what corny tune and thats life amongst the lowly thats how they keep themselves lowly thats how they get themselves stuck in its series its not hard to understand its just series of overt acts naturally an individual whos guilty of overt acts does not like to be cause in that particular direction because hes held back from reaching in that direction by the fear they will perform further overt acts thetan is basically afraid of committing overt acts he doesnt really want to commit overt acts i dont care what else is arranged anyplace and as result when he does so he tends to pull them back he eaves himself in and there he goes so lets get nowi told you this was longa long dissertation to give you this third point and you can very easily see how this thing could occupy not just couple three hours of lecture but four or five sciences all in one fell swoop such as labor relations and sociology and war against my not getting any votes poverty all of these you could open up this subject see this subject becomes big subject but lets look at it in just the framework that were addressing it inis why cant some students audit and why can some students audit and why more germanesince this is not always at the root of auditing but more germane to the pcwhy do some pcs just never never never never never never never get any tone arm action see well ive given you two sources and this was the third one now you think im going to tell you that they believe they have been wronged and youve got to get their overts off if it were just that simple i would have found it out long time ago but it isnt that simple remember i told you problemsolutions are as complex as the problem and this is pretty complex this person has been so wrongedhow thetan can be wronged is pretty hard to dobut this persons been so wronged that they have longer any concept of an overt this person cannot really handle the idea of an overt act and thats whats wrong with that person now the christian already ran into this in the year yupgup he already ran into this and he tried to do something about it he didnt run into this he had another pitch in mind but he came down the line saying repent ye repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand and youd better repent he was pulling an inversion he wanted people to invert he wanted people to admit their guilt and its interesting that amongst middle western christians particularly when you listen to their confessions and so forth at holy roller meetings and so forth all you hear is long potpourri of things they never were courageous enough to do in their whole lives you could ask any one of them this burning question are you bragging or confessing now there is the crux of the situation because theyre getting off false overts in an effort to get off some overts they feel that they just could say they were guilty enough of something then somehow or another things would be better and youve got to safeguard yourself as an auditor against pc walking into this particular instance because they will invert and they go kind of mad on this subject christianity was trying to put them down little bit youre looking for the honest actual overt the actual one and thats what unpins him because only the truth sets you free see its the actual overts youre looking for and recognizing that if you dont find it why youve committed him to further progress of being stuck into it see now youwhat you want to do with this character when you run into himand hes very frequent he is not very unnumerous at alli dont know what he runs but he certainly must run something like ten twelve percentis you get him to define an overt act heres one of the gagsill give you gag you define an overt act and then after hes got it all defined is ask him why it isnt an overt and hell tell you right away with the greatest automaticity you have ever heard in your life hell go brrrrrr call out an overt act and hell give you some sort of an answer and so forth well if i walked out and pushed little child in the road and pushed him underneath an automobile and so forth that would be an overt act thats an overt act its aits an act of harmfulness against some other person and if you werent alert you could be pretty pretty knuckleheaded about this and let it go at that and say weve got that licked because you havent asked the little geewhizzer that comes around the back door and youre just going to going to have your eyeballs snapped out about an inch and back into your skull few times when you work this on your pc sometime in the future youre going to really be upset even though the pc knew theknew the gimmick i mean he cant get around it all right you pushed this child out in the street and so on all right very good now why isnt that an overt act brrrr hell have immediate instant explanation of why it isnt an overt act and they dont think they can commit an overt act well how are you going to get an overt act off if the person cant commit an overt act theyve committed overt acts but they havent committed any overt acts so the netnet result of all this is they stay pinned into it tight because theres reality on this as an overt act at all then youve got to find something searchingly that they do really consider an overt that would really be an overt act it may be something very mild the old effect scale tells you that itd be something very mild on such person theyve done something or failed to do something and that was an overt act and now youve got real honest to goodness overt act and it might be so petty and so nothing that ityoud hardly categorize it as an overt act but its actually real to this person because they cant answer this question why isnt that an overt act but it is an overt act and sit there and look rather griefy about the situation see didnt praise their mothers cakes of course we also know that they knocked their mother down the cellar steps and broke her leg but that wasnt an overt act see but didnt praise mothers cakes and that was the overt act see but thats real overt act to the person now you can go up on gradient scale like that and there are numerous ways of tackling this im not even trying to give you the whole embrace of how you tackle this problem its wide numerous ways you can handle this situation if you know the situation exists how do you walk upstairs on this thing the individual could get off some overt acts but he wouldnt get any tone arm action and theyre not real to him he didnt do anything you ask him how hewell how it isnt an overt act on discussion basis but not processing basis thats not process and hell give you some very good reasons why it isnt an overt act you know right away that you havent got how this is an overt act thats thatthats that discussion level and thats crosscheck of one kind or another which is left to your cleverness to walk around and straighten up see well how do you finally do something about this well there are probably numerous ways that something could be done about this fred here the other day was running person had found real overt act real overt act they really considered real overt act and then fred was auditing himaudited his justifications for having committed it and asised all the persons justifications for having committed it like aan r1 type of approach dont you see use justifications got the justifications off well the thing would be getting realer and realer and realer unburden it in other words see that was very clever method of approach now heresheres wide avenue of what do you do in order to bring about the reality of this now its good to stand there and try to convince the fellow how serious it is because thats why he isnt saying it is an overt because hes so convinced that its so serious that he cant confront it you find if you went to prison for instance to process some blokes in prison one of the wildest things youd run into is the fact that nobody there has ever committed crime that would be the most astonishing thing to you and also how sorry they are for each other that would also be little astonishing unless you remember what ive told you here and also how theyve all been wronged and how society has wronged them lets look at where they are theyre in prison well how come theyre staying there you see you cant put thetan in prison unless hes committed an overt act only then the overt act actually would have to be against the prison or the people who were holding him in prison or prisons in general or metal oror bars or block buildings or something like that otherwise you couldnt keep him in the place for minute you see so what is this how would you sort this out therefore the criminal must be very serious problem to the society because they lock him up all the time but maybe hes more serious problem to the criminal because he gets himself locked up all the time how does he get locked up all the time well he commits overt acts all the time im afraid this isnt planned idea at all im afraid this is totally reactive as far as life is concerned person commits overt acts why he locks himself up the criminals that go around and ask to be caught alone accounts for the record of the fbi nothing else could account for it so theres the overt actmotivator sequence see there it starts operating this doesnt mean now that everybody is guilty and everybody is this and everybody is that and everybody should be shot down in flames because they are this way they have forgotten how to let themselves out of the trap theyve forgotten how to let themselves out of the trap they dont know where the door is anymore theyre walking around in circles here and they would as happily get out of the trap as anybody else but theyve lost the key and theyve lost the door and thats it and thats the state you find him in reason standing around and saying well its your own fault you lost the key and you lost the door so i guess youre locked up and there you are particular point inin adopting that particular attitude either because that in itself is an overt too isnt it thank you
