specialist in american national government government and finance division examples of legislative provisions in annual appropriations acts summary over the years house and senate rules generally have been used to promote the separate consideration of substantive legislation and measures providing annual appropriations to federal agencies chiefly so that the regular funding of the federal government is not impeded by controversies associated with authorizing and other legislation the key rules upon which this separation is based are house rule xxi and senate rule xvi on july 26 1999 the senate agreed to sres160 measure effectively overturning 1995 precedent that had caused the senates ban against considering legislative provisions in annual appropriations acts not to be enforced for several years the procedural separation however is not ironclad because 1 the rules are not selfenforcing 2 the rules may be waived in various ways and 3 the rules are not fully comprehensive in their coverage and application legislative provisions may generate controversy with any type of annual appropriations act including regular continuing and supplemental appropriations acts the most visible controversies in recent years often have been associated with omnibus appropriations acts which are measures that combine two or more regular appropriations acts during the 1980s and 1990s and continuing into the 2000s there has been greater use of omnibus appropriations acts in some instances considerable portion of these omnibus appropriations acts has consisted of legislative provisions this report illustrates house and senate practices regarding legislative provisions by listing dozens of major legislative provisions that were included in 13 omnibus appropriations acts enacted in recent years as well legislative provisions included in recent supplemental appropriations acts in addition the report lists more than dozen legislative provisions that were dropped from three of the omnibus appropriations acts the report will be updated as developments warrant for more information on omnibus appropriations acts see crs report rl32473 omnibus appropriations acts overview of recent

appropriations acts 19 examples of legislative provisions in annual appropriations acts the separation of legislation and appropriations for well over century the house and senate have had rules meant to promote the separate consideration of substantive legislation and measures providing annual appropriations to federal agencies the chief reason behind this procedural division is to ensure that the regular funding of the federal government is not impeded by controversies associated with authorizing and other legislation that establishes and organizes agencies authorizes and reauthorizes programs and sets forth policy guidelines and restrictions despite these rules substantive legislation sometimes is included in annual appropriations acts provisions in annual appropriations acts carrying substantive legislation are referred to as legislative provisions1 the house and senate appropriations committees typically report three different types of annual appropriations acts each year each of the house and senate appropriations subcommittees develop one regular appropriations act which provides budget authority to federal agencies for the upcoming fiscal year2 supplemental appropriations acts provide additional budget authority during the fiscal year when the regular appropriation is insufficient or to finance activities not provided for in the regular appropriation continuing appropriations acts also called continuing resolutions provide stopgap funding for agencies that have not yet received regular appropriation 1 legislative provisions in annual appropriations acts often are referred to colloquially as riders in many instances the term riders is intended by some to apply also to limitation provisions ie provisions that bar the use of appropriations for certain specified purposes in such acts whereas legislative provisions usually deal with matters extraneous to the issue of funding and usually are out of order under house and senate rules limitation provisions are an integral part of funding issues and usually do not violate the rules the use of the term riders is avoided in this report because it is slang and because there is common agreement as to whether it should apply to limitation provisions as well as legislative provisions 2 from the late 1960s through 2004 the house and senate appropriations committees had 13 parallel subcommittees that each reported one of the regular appropriations acts the two appropriations committees revised their subcommittee structure in 2005 at the beginning of the 109th congress reducing the number of subcommittees to 10 in the house appropriations committee and 12 in the senate appropriations committee the subcommittee structure was revised again in 2007 at the beginning of the 110th congress resulting in 12 parallel subcommittees in the house and senate appropriations committees crs2 an omnibus appropriations act generally is regarded as regular appropriations act or continuing resolution that has been expanded to encompass agencies and accounts normally covered in two or more of the regular appropriations acts in the case of continuing resolution that is an omnibus appropriations act it typically goes beyond formulafunding for multiple bills to include the full text of the regular appropriations acts house rule xxi in the house rule xxi is intended to keep the consideration of annual appropriations acts separate from the consideration of substantive legislation clauses 2b and 2c of the rule prohibit the inclusion of legislative provisions ie provisions changing existing law or otherwise carrying substantive law in general appropriations bills reported by the committee or offered as floor amendments in addition clause 4 prohibits the inclusion of appropriations in legislation reported by any committee other than the appropriations committee3 the house unlike the senate does not regard continuing resolutions to be general appropriations bills senate rule xvi in the senate rule xvi serves to separate the consideration of legislative and appropriations matters in fashion similar to that employed by the house in 1995 however during the senates consideration of supplemental appropriations bill the chairs ruling that particular amendment offered by senator was out of order as legislation was overturned by the full senate this action came to be referred to as the hutchison precedent4 in the aftermath of that ruling the senate for several years did not enforce the portion of the rule prohibiting legislative provisions in annual appropriations acts on july 26 1999 the senate agreed by vote of 53 to 45 to sres 160 measure effectively overturning the hutchison precedent and restoring the longstanding prohibition against legislative provisions5 in addition senate rule xxviii in part bars conferees from inserting new matter ie matter not in the bills passed by either body into conference report in 1996 in an action known as the fedex precedent the senate overturned ruling of the chair thereby allowing new matter to be included in conference report as consequence of this action the restriction in rule xxviii against the inclusion of new matter in conference reports was not enforced for several years in the case of annual appropriations acts the suspension of this part of rule xxviii facilitated the inclusion of legislative provisions during this period toward the end of the 106th congress provision overturning the fedex precedent effective at the beginning 3 under the recodification of the house rules on january 6 1999 pursuant to the adoption of hres 5 this provision was moved to clause 4 from clause 5a 4 see the consideration in the congressional record of march 16 1995 of an amendment offered by senator kay bailey hutchison to hr 889 supplemental appropriations and rescission act 5 the measure simply declared the following resolved that the presiding officer of the senate should apply all precedents of the senate under rule 16 in effect at the conclusion of the 103rd congress crs3 of the 107th congress was enacted as part of the consolidated omnibus appropriations act for fy20016 inclusion of legislative provisions in appropriations acts although house and senate rules and practices over the decades have promoted the separate consideration of legislation and appropriations the separation has not been ironclad in many instances during the routine operation of the annual appropriations process minor provisions are included in appropriations acts that technically may be regarded under the rules as legislative in nature but do not significantly undermine the dichotomy between legislation and appropriations at other times however the legislative provisions included in annual appropriations acts have been much more substantial and have represented deliberate suspension of the usual procedural boundaries in the house and senate legislative provisions may be included in annual appropriations acts in several ways as discussed below rules are not selfenforcing first the rules that enforce the boundaries between legislation and appropriations are not selfenforcing in order for potential violation to be stopped member must successfully raise point of order and it must be sustained if challenged rules may be waived second like any other rules of the house and senate these rules may be waived in various ways in the house for example it is not uncommon to waive rule xxi under special rule reported by the house rules committee governing consideration of the annual appropriations act the senate sometimes effectively waives its rules when it considers legislation under unanimous consent agreements rules are not comprehensive finally the rules are not fully comprehensive in their coverage and application both house rule xxi and senate rule xvi afford some exceptions particularly in the senate for example the house as previously mentioned does not regard continuing resolutions to be general appropriations bills consequently the prohibitions under rule xxi do not apply to their consideration further while the senates restrictions against legislative provisions apply to amendments of the senate appropriations committee made to housepassed appropriations act they do not apply to legislative provisions originated by the committee in senatenumbered appropriations act in recent years the senate appropriations committee has originated greater number of annual appropriations acts ie acting on senatenumbered measure rather than housepassed measure up to the stage of final action thereby circumventing the rule xvi prohibitions against legislative provisions 6 see section 903 of hr 5666 the miscellaneous appropriations act for fy2001 as enacted into law by crossreference in pl 106554 114 stat 2763a198 december 21 2000 crs4 it should be noted that provision in an appropriations act generally is determined to be legislative by ruling of the chair in the senate the members sometimes decide the matter by vote upon the raising of point of order or an appeal of the chairs ruling the provisions listed in this report therefore should be regarded only as possibly legislative in nature although they meet criteria long used by the house and senate to determine whether provision is legislative ruling was made by the chair or the senate in these cases many of the examples provided in the report explicitly state that they amend an existing law and cite public law number or section of the united states code often marginal note is provided in the slip law indicating the applicable section of the usc recent practices the inclusion of legislative provisions in annual appropriations acts has been longstanding feature of the appropriations process in many instances legislative provisions are regarded as routine or technical and do not generate controversy in other cases legislative provisions may spark contentious debate complicating and prolonging the consideration of the underlying appropriations measure controversies regarding the use of legislative provisions sometimes arise in connection with the consideration of regular continuing and supplemental appropriations acts particularly when such acts have been chosen by the house and senate leadership as vehicles to carry other legislative matters controversies probably occur less often in the case of continuing resolutions because these stop gap funding measures usually are considered under circumstances where the pressures are greater to keep the measures clean and free of provisions that would impede their timely enactment with respect to regular and supplemental appropriations acts the latter type of annual appropriations act is more likely to have been used in recent years as vehicle for significant legislative matters recent supplemental appropriations act for example included separate titles dealing with funding shortfalls in mandatory health program an increase in the minimum wage small business tax incentives and other matters typically addressed outside of the annual appropriations process several examples of legislative provisions included in recent supplemental appropriations acts are shown in reverse chronological order in table 1 for each legislative provision the subject matter is identified if the provision is given short title such as the post911 veterans educational

appropriations act the most visible controversies in recent years have tended to be associated with omnibus or consolidated appropriations acts which merge two or more of the regular appropriations acts into single measure7 beginning in the 1980s various factors have contributed to the greater use of omnibus appropriations acts particularly escalating disagreements between the president and congress over general budgetary policy and policies in key program areas and the resultant legislative gridlock at first the omnibus appropriations acts took the form of continuing resolutions but in recent years they mostly have taken the form of bills table 2 lists the 13 most recent omnibus appropriations acts table 2 omnibus appropriations acts fy1986fy2008 public law number and act date of

omnibus appropriations acts see crs report rl32473 omnibus appropriations acts overview of recent practices by robert keith crs8 table 3 provides examples in reverse chronological order of legislative provisions that were included in those omnibus appropriations acts the earliest three acts were continuing resolutions enacted in the midtolate 1980s the remaining 10 acts were bills enacted in the 1990s and 2000s in some instances considerable portion of these omnibus appropriations acts has consisted of legislative provisions two reasons for this practice are that 1 legislation stalled at the end of session that otherwise might not advance can be carried through to enactment on the funding bill which is considered to be must pass legislation and 2 popular legislative provisions may be added to an appropriations act to increase its chances of enactment the practice of including major legislative provisions in annual appropriations acts particularly omnibus acts generates controversy for several reasons some members decry the practice as undermining the deliberative process they assert that in many instances the inclusion of such provisions in lengthy and complex appropriations bills considered toward the close of session may require members to vote on matters with which they are largely unfamiliar may give them too little time to debate these matters may usurp the prerogatives of the relevant authorizing committees and may shield from proper scrutiny legislation that would not prevail on its own merits advocates of the practice however argue that it provides needed flexibility to the legislative process allowing congress to process and complete its business more efficiently especially in the waning days of session many such provisions they maintain already have been given thorough review under regular procedures further their inclusion in annual appropriations bills often is at the behest of authorizing committee members who have not been able to advance their legislation because of crowded legislative agenda in 2004 circumstances in the senate prompted some to advance another argument in favor of using an omnibus appropriations act for fy2005 by the beginning of the appropriations cycle for fy2005 the senate had not agreed to the conference report on the fy2005 budget resolution sconres 95 consequently one of the principal procedural tools used to encourage spending restraint points of order to enforce spending allocations to the appropriations subcommittees under section 302b of the congressional budget act of 1974 was not available the senate however had imposed ceiling of 814 billion on total appropriations for fy2005 enforceable by point of order in the prior years budget resolution which still was in effect in order for the ceiling on total fy2005 appropriations to be enforced at that time however all of the regular appropriations bills for that fiscal year would have had to been considered in single omnibus measure although the house and senate did not reach final agreement on the fy2005 budget resolution the senate adopted deeming resolution later in the session that resolved the enforcement problem for the remainder of the budget cycle8 8 the senates deeming resolution was included as section 14007 in the defense appropriations act for fy2005 pl 108287 august 5 2004 for additional information continued crs9 the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 pl 106113 and the consolidated appropriations act for fy2001 pl 106554 enacted several appropriations bills and legislative bills by crossreference although the house and senate regularly incorporate major legislative provisions into annual appropriations acts members often are successful in getting legislative provisions dropped from such acts table 4 provides listing of legislative provisions dropped from three of the omnibus appropriations acts listed in the previous table as with the other tables the listing is intended merely to be illustrative for the sake of expedience the examples provided in table 4 were drawn from articles contained in the cq almanac for calendar year 1996 and the cq monitor for calendar year 1998 in the case of the three omnibus appropriations acts listed in the table all of the legislative provisions were dropped in conference however such provisions sometimes are dropped at earlier stages of the legislative process whether the provision originated in the house or the senate is indicated in this context origination in chamber means that it was offered in the markup of the appropriations committee or subcommittee of that chamber was offered during floor consideration by that chamber or was proposed in conference by the conferees of that chamber the three omnibus appropriations acts incorporated the full text of several of the regular appropriations acts legislative provisions listed under these omnibus acts may have been dropped in the conference on the omnibus act or beforehand in conference on one of the regular appropriations acts subsequently incorporated into the omnibus act on many occasions the house and senate resolved controversy over contentious legislative provision by adopting substantial modification of it rather than dropping it altogether this report does not address such practices 8 continued on this topic see crs report
