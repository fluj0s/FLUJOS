opportunities as well as challenges for us policy partic ipants at crs seminar on dealing with chinas rise focused on the challenges china was seen as very large strategicallylocated country undergoing rapid economic growth and social change and ruled byauthoritarian political leaders since the maoist era china has made great strides inconforming to many international norms but combination of rising chinese powerand nationalistic assertiveness has posed seri ous problems for us security interests in asia us efforts to curb trafficking in technology for weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons us support for smooth running market based international economic systems and us backing of other international normsregarding human rights environmental protection and other issues seminar participants judged that historical experience suggests that the united states will be unable to reach any grand ba rgain or lasting solution to the china challenges rather us leaders will need to devote continuous highlevel policyattention issue by issue case by case in order both to deter chinese assertiveness andto encourage chinese accommodation to prevailing international practice in so doingthe us would be ill served to rely sole ly on policies designed to moderate chinese assertiveness through accommodation and greater integration in world affairsalthough many are hopeful about the positive changes that could come from chinaseconomic modernization and social change positive changes could be long in comingas result seminar participants urged u s policymakers to establish us national goals visavis china and clearly defined negative and positive incentives that would prompt prc behavior more compatible with us interests at the same time us policy of containment against china wa s seen as both premature and unworkable an effective us strategy toward china n eeded to be seen in the context of broader us strategy in asia one seen

intimidate voters in taiwans first presidential election on march 23 1996 headed the list of beijingsdeviations from usbacked international norms in early 1996 other contentiousissues included the estimated 2 billion in annual losses us firms suffer as result of chinas continued and growing violati ons of us intellectual property rights despite past chinese government agreement to halt such violations chinas reported continued close cooperation in pakistans widely noted effort to build nuclear weapons capability reports of chinas sale of advanced surfacetosurface missiles and related technology to such troubled areas as iran and pakistan and beijingshardline stance toward any signs of politi cal dissent or advocacy of greater human rights in china 1 against the backdrop of deluge of media and congressional criticism of chinas actions and the clinton administrations avowed policy of comprehensiveengagement with the peoples republic of china prc the administrationtoughened the us posture toward china specific steps included deploying two us carrier battle groups to the taiwan ar ea during the prc military exercises in the region in march 1996 postponement of the pl anned visit of chinas defense minister to the united states temporary suspen sion on approval of us exportimport bank financing for new us projects in china pending thorough review of us options to deal with reported chinese exports of nuclear weapons technology and othermeasures the administration endeavored to underline its dissatis faction with recent chinese behavior while trying to find common ground to sustain longer termengagement with china through series of recent or anticipated discussions withsenior prc leaders notably president clinton reportedly sent letter to chinasleaders with newly appointed us amba ssador james sasser requesting such dialogue the chinese responded in part by sending in march 1996 the prc state councils senior foreign policy official to the united states for extensive discussion with executive branch and congressional leaders 2 congressional opinion was not assuaged by the administrations actions and congress sought additional measures to reinforce the us posture against chinasinfractions of international norms the house and senate passed separate nonbinding resolutions expressing support for ta iwan in the face of prc intimidationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96518crs2 many members strongly concerned with ch inese infractions on nuclear and missile proliferation and on important trade issues like intellectual property rights wereadamant in hearings public statements and private communications with theadministration that more needed to be done in order to end beijings egregiousviolations of accepted world norms for example the house committee on national security along with the senate foreign re lations committee held extensive hearings on chinas military and national security cha llenges to us interests the house and the senate also passed the 19961997 state department authorization bill hr 1561 that contained over one dozen provisions targeted directly or indirectly on strengthening us opposition to prc govern ment practices on issues ranging from taiwan to tibet and from human rights to world trade organization wtomembership president clinton vetoed hr 1561 and th veto was sustained by the house on april 30 1996 after reaching an understanding with chinese officials on reportedchinese exports of nuclear weapons related technology to pakistan the president inmay 1996 lifted the suspension of us export import bank financing but he alsobegan formal procedures threatening ove r 2 billion in trade sanctions unless china took further measures to curb intellectua l property rights violations deadline of june 17 was set on may 20 1996 the pres ident announced that he would grant on june 3 the annual waiver that allows ch inese imports mostfavorednation mfn tariff treatment by the united states setting the stage for the annual congressionaldebate on the pros and cons of the move and on the broader direction of usrelations with china senate majority leader and republican presidential candidate bob dole added to the debate with speech on may 9 that was sharply critical of the clinton administrations vacillation on china policy though also supportive ofcontinued mfn for beijing in this context the congressional research service at the request of the house national security committee and with the support of the national committee onuschina relations conducted seminar on may 13 1996 the topic wasdealing with china altern ative us national security strategies clinton administration representative and four nongovernment experts offered diverseperspectives as to the challenges

communisthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96518crs3 3see china and congress in 1992 kerry dumbaugh crs report 93894f october 12 1993regime in china was destined for collapse3 observers also sometimes warned of major retrogression in chinese economic reforms speculating that beijing wouldfeel compelled in the face of domestic and foreign pressure to revert to autarchicdevelopment policies of the maoist past these would reduce chineseinterdependence with other countries nd substantially reduce chinas incentive to avoid disruptive behavior in interaction with its neighbors and other world powers on balance chinas record in recent years has undercut the predictions of collapse or retrogression the regime in beijing has presided over period of unprecedented growth in the chinese economy this growth has not only benefitted many in china but has come at time of lack luster growth in most other parts of the world the result has been period of unpr ecedented international investment in and interaction with the chinese economy when combined with beijings selectivelyaccommodating posture in world affairs in recent years the result has been to erodeforeign sanctions and to enhance the international legitimacy of the chinese leaders nevertheless analysis of key determinants of chinas future shows wide range of possible outcomes for china over the next few years in particular good deal of the success of beijings efforts in recent years is attributed to the leadership of senior leader deng xiaoping dengs anticipated early demise means that vacuumat the center of political power in chin could lead to political struggles with possibly adverse outcomes for the country the leadership transition is likely tocomplicate an already difficult set of problems of governance caused by dynamiceconomic growth rapid social change realignment of central and local powerarrangements and other factors also seen as complicating chinas future is the rise of the chinese militarys influence on sensitive policy issues including foreignpolicy and the increasingly nationalistic tendency among chinese leaders and people alike which seems to reduce chinese flexibility in dealing with the united states and much of the outside world positive scenario for chinas future posits an effective administration and some political reform along with powerful economic modernization alternativeoutcomes are of two kinds one sees series of developments including political changes leading to degeneration of government effectiveness and authority with arange of negative effects on chinas economic and social development another sees china developing formidable economic pow er while retaining strong authoritarian political control this raises the possi bility of an emerging chinese economic and military superpower less interested in accommodation with the outside world andunfettered by the political checks and balances that accompany less authoritarianpolitical structures it is the latter scenar io that has received considerable attention in hearings and is the cause of particular concern on capitol hill recent developments in china pose economic cultural and other opportunities and the prospect of cooperation on global nd regional issues as well as challenges for the united states the seminar partic ipants like much recent us government media and popular opinion focused on the cha llenges to us policy china is seen as very large strategically located c ountry undergoing rapid economic growth andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96518crs4 4see among others china in world affairs by robert sutter crs report 95265s january 31 1995 19 psocial change and ruled by an authoritari an political leadership strongly supported by conservative political military and other constituencies in china chineseleaders are seen as determined to main tain their political power while pursuing strongly nationalistic ideology emphasizi ng chinas desire for greater international respect and recognition of chinas territorial claims and aspirations for leadership in asia and world affairs chinese leader s strive to make china great power with broad international influence chinese capabilities to achieve great power remainlimited in certain areas because of such factors as continued widespread povertypopulation pressure and limited capability fo r military power projection chinas uncertain leadership transition is also seen as source of potential weakness as are the difficulties the authoritarian political leaders in beijing are seen to face in tryingto manage chinas rapid uneven economic nd social changes on balance the participants at the seminar saw problems for us policy focused heavily on china itself and nearby parts of asia although ch ina is also seen to pose difficulties in other areas of us policy concern the difficulties posed by chinas search for wealth and power prompted one participant at the seminar to recall the many positive features for us interests in chinas approach to world affairs since the death of mao zedong 20 years agochinese international policy changed markedly during the maoist period 19491976 it moved from reliance on the u ssr and strident opposition to the united states to posture of strong opposition to both the us and the ussr finally theirapproach relied strategically on reconciliation with the united states to deal with the danger posed by the soviet threat thes shifts were often accompanied by hostile and militant actions fundamentally threat ening peace and stability in asia and the broader international order after mao died chinese leaders emphasized domestic policies of development that required markedly increased economic contacts abroad these policiescomported with beijings desire to sustai n good relations with the west and avoid disruptions around the periphery of china that would complicate the chinese drive toward modernization 4 on specific issues in foreign affairs chinese leaders generally adhered to the logic underlying the pragmatic trend in chinese foreign policy seen in the postmaoperiod postmao chinese communist leaders need to foster better economic life for the people of china in order to gitimize and justify their continued monopoly of political power these l eaders cannot rely as mao did on enormous personal prestige as successf ul revolutionary or on the appeal of communist ideology they have little of maos prestige and the appeal ofcommunist ideology is fading china depends critically on foreign trade and related foreign investment and assistance for its economic developmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96518crs5 china depends particularly heavily on its neighbors for aid investment and trade benefits and on the united states to absorb its exports therefore to buttress their political survival postmao leaders emphasizetheir concern with maintaining peacef ul international environment which assures continued trade investment and assistance flows so important tochinese economic well being chinese leaders put aside past ideas of autarchy and selfreliance and allowed the chinese economy to become increasingly integrated into the world economythey sought to avoid dependence on any one power by encouraging broadcompetition beijing made efforts to meet the requirements of the united states and others regarding market access intellectual property rights and other economicissues and strove to become member of the gatt and f ounding member of the world trade organization wto chinese leaders duly accepted commitments andresponsibilities stemming from their particip ation with such international economic organizations as the world bank the asian development bank and the asian pacificeconomic cooperation apec forum chinese leaders remained sensitive on i ssues of national sovereignty and were less accommodating on international security issues they did adjust to world pressure when resistance appeared detrimental to broader chinese concernsexamples included chinese cooperation with the international peace settlement incambodia in 1991 beijings willingness to jo in the nonproliferation treaty and to consider halting nuclear tests by the end of 1996 under an international agreementbanning nuclear tests chinas reported w illingness to abide by terms of the missile technology control regime mtcr and the chinese leaders reportedly helpfulefforts to assist the united states in reaching an agreement with north korea in october 1994 over the latters nuclear weapons program beijing also selectivelysought to meet international expectations on other transnational issues like policingdrug traffic curbing international terrorism and working to avoid furtherdegradation of the worlds environment as was noted in the seminar it is easy to exaggerate the degree of chinese accommodation to international concerns beijings continued hard line againstoutside criticism of chinese political authoritarianism and poor human rights recordgraphically illustrates the limits of ch inese accommodation continued chinese transfer of sensitive military technology or dual use equipment to pakistan iran and other potential flash points is widely critic ized in the united states and elsewhere and the chinese political and military lead ers are not reluctant to use rhetorical threats or demonstrations of military force in order to intimidate and deter those insensitive areas like taiwan the south ch ina sea and hong kong who are seen by beijing as confronting its traditional territo rial or nationalistic claims these and other assertive chinese actions may reflect changing chinese internationalcalculus increasingly chinese leaders are seen as more confident in their international position of greater wealth and military power the power vacuum in asia caused by the collapse of the ussr combines with strong chinese nationalistic ambitions to fuel perceived prc tendenc to assert its interests in the face of opposition from the united states and othershttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96518crs6 5for example beijing saw by 1991 that maintaining its past support for the khmer rouge in cambodia would be counterproductiv regarding chinas broader interests in achieving favorable peace settlement in cambodi and solidifying closer relations with the association of southeast asian nations ase an countri japan and the west all of whom saw continued chinese aid as serious obstacle to peace by the same token theusled international moratorium on nuclear testing had reached point in 1994 that beijinghad to announce its decision to consider halting nuclear testing by the end of 1996 and join comprehensive nuclear test ban or risk majo r friction in its relations with the us japan western europe and russia 6see among others chinas rising military power and influence by robert sutter crs report 9666f january 16 1996 see so council on foreign relations publications redressing the balance american engagement in asia 1996 and weaving the net conditional engagement with china 1996in short beijing has been widely seen as accommodating pragmatically to many international norms not because such accommoda tion is seen as inherently in chinas interest rather beijing is said to view each issue on casebycase basiscalculating the costs and benefits of adhe rence to international norms in each case 5 underlying the casebycase approach is rising sense of nationalism among chinese leaders viewing the world as highly competitive state centered system chinese leaders remain deeply suspicious of multilateralism and interdependencerather they tend to see the world in more traditional balanceofpower terms and therefore argue that the current world tr end is more multipolar ie number of competing nation states than multilateral system where nation states sacrificesome of their independence and freedom of maneuver for the expected benefits of an interdependent international order governed by law chinese suspicions of many multilateral efforts focus on the central role of the united states and the other developed countries these nations are setting theagenda of most such multilateral regimes they are accused of doing so to serve their own particular national interests and to give short shrift to the interests and concerns of newly emerging powers like chin as result many leaders in china see us and other efforts to encourage or press china to conform to multilateral standards on international security human rights and economic policies and practices as motivated by the established powers fear of chinas rise their unwillingness to share power fairly with china and their desire to hold down china to keep it weak and fragmented for as long as possibl in short chinese leaders are often predisposed to oppose the international status quo supported by the united states this mix of accommodation and assertiveness has combined with chinas obviously growing power and importance to lead to number of specific conflicts with united states foreign policy and security interests 6 chinas military power there appears to be general agreement among specialists that china at present does not pose major direct military threat to the united states its military economic and other capabilities are seen as too limited to pose such danger in the near future 5 10 years us and foreign analysts see potential for china to challenge and threat the united states over the longer termhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96518crs7 20plus years of the nations of the world in their view china is among the very few that have the mix of economic political human resource and military factorsthat could produce the emergence of superpower capable of directly challengingthe united states in the first half of the 21st century chinas rapid economic growthin recent years has been accompanied by steady increase in military spending reflecting in part the influence of the chinese military on budget and policy issues the overall impact of chinas military buildup on justified us policy concernsremains subject of debate among us specialists in the interim the main danger to us positions coming from china bears on us interests in preserving and strengthening the peace and stability of the asianpacific region there is considerable debate among specialists as to whether or notchina is likely to embark on an expansionist or more assertive course disruptive tostability in the area b china as proliferator of weapons of mass destruction manufacturing technology for such weapons and related delivery systems chinese military strategy against both the united states and the soviet union focused during muchof the maoist period 19491976 on developing reliable hardtolocate weaponsystems of mass destruction ie nuclear missiles and bombs these weapons gave chinese leaders the option of second stri ke against stronger adversary and thus were seen to deter feared preemptive nuc lear attack especially from the ussr for many years china shared such technology with select group of countriesnotably pakistan whose defense had direct bearing on chinas own national security at the same time china has long record of selling materials technology and related expertise in these sensitive areas for profit in the past us and other westerna ligned international observers tended to play down the consequences of these chinese actions they appeared moreinterested in sustaining broadly coopera tive relationship with beijing in the cold war competition with the soviet union u s views changed markedly in the post cold war environment this occurred pecially after the 19911992 usled allied confrontation with iraq which was developing mass destruction weapons in orderto dominate regional adversaries and world oil supplies fearful of having toconfront authoritarian expansionist leaders armed with nuclear or other massdestruction weapons and related delivery systems us officials now saw chinasproliferation practices as major threat to us interests american officials havehad some success in recent years in leading international efforts to press china toadhere to international control regimes regarding nuclear weapons and relatedmissile delivery systems in this effort they have used leverage provided by chinas dependence on trade and other relations with the us and other developed countries concerned with proliferation c chinas economic rise the strength size and vibrancy of the chinese economy has attracted positive international attention but also has causedconsiderable uneasiness among chinas major trading partners although chinaseconomy was large though qualitatively weak and grew rapidly in the maoistperiod the regimes self reliant development strategy meant that chineseinteraction with the world economy was limited and the consequences ofdevelopments in china for other nations were generally limitedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96518crs8 7see central intelligence agency chinas economy in 1994 and 1995 december 1995the postmao economic reforms have changed that situation the chinese economy is larger than ever and is growi ng at rate surpassing that of the maoist period and mirroring the rapid rise that some other asian countries experiencedduring periods of economic take off in the latter 20th century at the same time the chinese open door policies have put aside maoist autarchy in favor ofintegrating the chinese economy with the growing economies of asia and the world in the past 10 years chinese foreign trade and foreign investment in china havegrown at rates far surpassing chinas overall economic growth rate the chineseeconomy today statistically depends more on foreign trade than do the economies of other large countries like russia india and brazil and that dependency evensurpasses that of japan china is now am ong the top 15 world trad ers and rising fast much of this trade stems from investment from inside china and from abroad in manufacturing industries designed to produ ce goods for export to considerable degree china has become manufacturing platform for exports to many countriesof the world with investment from hong kong and taiwan being the major impetus behind this development 7 analysts in asia and the west sometimes see chinas economic power and potential as current or prospective threat to asian stability or the stability ofinternational commerce in certain commodities on the one hand chinese leadersmay choose to use this rapid economic growth to support military modernization anda more assertive policy toward chinas neighbors on the other hand chineseenterprises may choose to direct their sometimes statesupported manufacturingcapabilities to world markets sensitive to the rest of asia and the west in this view the size scope and capabilities of the chinese economy when combined with the fact that the economic system in china remains subject to state control and direction in several important respects means that china is seen ashaving great ability to surge this involves targeting production in certain areasdominating markets and causing major disruption and dislocation for tradingpartners and competitors of course the larger and more resilient world economieseg the united states japan doubtless are better able to adjust to chinese growthbut others eg taiwan may find themselves more vulnerable to directed orpredatory chinese economic initiative another challenge relates to the ability of chinese authorities to divert foreign supplied technology from civilian to military us reports of such alleged diversions have led to investigations in congress over the past year d chinas challenge to other postcold war values beijings determined effort to sustain its authoritarian political re gime is seen to defy us backed efforts accentuated in the postcold war period s upporting greater pluralism human rights and democracy chinas economic developm ent could also come at the expense of its environment which given the size of ch ina is sure to have major impact on international efforts to curb suspected global warning among other environmental concerns as noted above it is unclear wh ether the rise of chinas wealth and powerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96518crs9 will prompt beijing leaders to be more or less accommodating to these widely shared values backed by the united states the problem of weakened china although the potential problems and dangers noted above stem from the growth of chinas wealth and power analysts at the seminar and elsewhere have been careful to point to the dangers to asian andinternational stability that could result fr om markedly weak ened china the concern focuses on possible breakdown in government authority in china such as was seen in number of communist countri in recent years the size and scope of problems in china suggest that such breakdown could be accompanied by largescale economic dislocation armed conflict and massive outflows of migrants for the crowded and often strongly homogeneous countries along chinas eastern rimand for the sparsely populated and poorly c ontrolled countries to chinas north and west such outflows of migrants would pose national security threat of the firstorder findings and recommendations the presentations and discussions at the seminar offered somber picture for the united states as it faces the wide ra nge of existing and potential challenges posed by chinas rising power in the years ahead there was general agreement that theunited states needed to clarify us goa ls visavis china and find practical ways both to engage china more fully in the cu rrent world system while deterring chinese behavior adverse to us interests policies of accommodation of china on the one hand or strict constraints of china on the other were deemed to be inappropriate or unworkable the panelists were in genera l agreement that the us strategy toward china should be seen in the context of broader us strategy in asia onerequiring strong us military economic nd political presence and also requiring significant cooperation from important us allies and friends in the region recommendations for us policy focused on establishing clearer set of us priorities that take account of us intere sts along with chinese concerns and those of interested third parties especially in asia to formulate these policy prioritiesand to help to insure that they are impl emented requires careful and consistent high level us policy attention including regular usprc summit meetings it wasacknowledged that such meetings and the prestige they give to prc leaders seen asillegitimate by many americans posed difficult problem for us policy as itendeavors to deal effectively with the rise of chinahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96518crs10 lessons of history china shows strong signs of emerging as the most important new world power in the early 21st century in modern history most instances of such rising powershave been accompanied by severe strains on the prevailing international systemoften resulting in conflict the size and im portance of china and its large influence on the strategically and economically important rimlands of the pacific basinprompted seminar participants repeatedly to emphasize the need for consistent and close us policy attention to china for ears to come given the wide differences in us and chinese leaders values and world views along with the relativelyimmature security political and economic frameworks for the postcold warsituation in asia specialists warned the us not to expect any grand bargainregarding the future of the region and of chinas role in it to be reached in the foreseeable future more likely in their view was future characterized by the need for persistent us efforts dealing casebycase with issues as they arise and strivingboth to encourage china to engage more fu lly with and conform to the norms of the international system and to deter china from taking action detrimental to accepted world norms limits of engagement and containment some seminar participants were hopeful that greater us and other international engagement with china along with conti nued rapid economic and social change in china would lead to changes prompting chinese leaders to conform more fully tointernational norms growing economic in terdependence presumably would reduce chinas incentive to challenge the interests of its important economic partners whileinternal pressures stemming from modernization would presumably reduce theability of the authoritarian regime to exert power in ways contrary to the interests of the chinese people nevertheless it was duly acknowledged that the positive fruits of such development process are not certain and could be long in coming this is seen asespecially relevant given the evident determination of chinas current leaders tosustain political authoritarianism and the slow and mixed record of such peacefulevolution in other parts of asia as result us policymakers were urged by some participants to establish some clearly defined positive and negative incentives thatwould both prompt chinese leaders to conf orm more to international norms backed by the united states and deter them from taking actions disruptive of such normsspecific recommendations are discussed below on the other hand policy of us containment of china was deemed unneeded and currently unworkable for one thing because of its economicstrength china is in far different position than the ussr or maoist china whenthey were targets of us containment strategies during the cold war in one senseit was argued it is already too late for the us to consider containing china as the prc in the past two decades has so broadened its economic and related politicalconnections abroad as to make policy of trying to isolate china unworkable at thesame time it was argued the challenges currently posed by china cannot becompared to the fundamental antagonism to th us of the ussr or of maoist chinahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96518crs11 during much of the cold war as noted above some participants thought that chinas record in world affairs shows increasing willingness to conform to usbacked norms while some chinese doubtle ss harbor antagonistic intentions toward the united states their freedom of action is constrained for now by realities of power and by the practical considerations of beiji ngs search for greater wealth and power at the same time rising wealth and power prevailing nationalistic sentimentleadership uncertainty giving greater infl uence to military and other conservative leaders and other trends could prompt mo re assertive and disruptive chinese foreign policy behavior at this time it remains unclear whether beijing will in the future follow path of confrontation or greater accommodation with world norms seminar participants judged that the united states should wait to see which path is chosen and trypositively to influence the choice before the us itself chooses path of containmentand confrontation us effort to pursue containment policy under currentcircumstances would likely get little support fr om allies and associates in asia who are wary of china and uncertain about beiji ngs future policy directions but who see little justification for such hard us response and in any event have to live inclose proximity to the prc seeing china in asia seminar participants were in agreement that an effective us policy toward china needs to be placed in the context of broader us policy toward east asia whatever strategy the united states dopts to deal with china needs to be compatible with broader us efforts to pr otect and foster american interests in the postcold war situation in east asia fr om the point of view of us national security policy the latter effort involves several major components in addition todealing with china us efforts to revitalize security alliances with regional allies the administration has already capped recent effort to strengthen alliancerelations with japan during president clintons visit to tokyo in april 1996 us efforts to build support at home and abroad for the us forward deployed forces in east asia despite us government spending cutbacksthe pentagon has been able to sustain support for around 100000 usforward deployed forces us domestic b acking for this effort is enhanced by the willingness of allies and associates to publicly support the us presenceand to bear some of the financial and other burdens associated with italthough japan and to much smaller degree korea bear financial costs associated with the us presence many asian governments are reluctant to stand up and be counted in support of the us military presence even thoughthey privately support it in strong term s such public ambivalence makes it difficult for us defense leaders to make strong case that the american military presen ce is an asset rather than liab ility in us efforts to benefit us interests in east asia us efforts to strengthen still weak multilateral efforts to promote more secure environment in asia some semi nar participants stated that existinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96518crs12 multilateral security efforts in the region like the asean regional forum arf were weak but they expressed sire to use at least some multilateral efforts to sustain us security interests in the region as the united states seeks both to deter and engage china seminar participants emphasized the need for the united states to build coalitions centered among asian allies and associates such coalitions were seen as difficult to form and use but important in making sure that chinas leader s did not outflank or isolate us efforts to press china for change key difficulty was the perceived preference of these asian allies and associates for an ambivalent position on china and on forthrightus efforts to deal with china thus seminar participants judged on the one hand that it was desirable for the united states to set out in clear terms its security and other concerns visavis china and to pre ss us asian allies and associates to back the us position yet on the other hand semi nar participants judged that us allies and associates under most likely circumstances would be very reluctant to take such forthright positions regarding china for fear of antagonizing the prc or importantdomestic political constituencies highlevel dialogue versus prestige for prc leaders seminar participants appeared to ag ree on the need for highlevel and continuous dialogue between us and prc leaders they readily acknowledged that summit meetings with chinese leaders would be used by the prc to legitimizebeijings current authoritarian rulers both at home and abroad this poses bigproblem for the large segment of us opinion that sees china as rising power benton rolling back us influence in asia and those that remain strongly offended bybeijings crackdown at the time of the tiananmen incident and its subsequentviolations of human rights and other norms specialists at the seminar offered arguments to persuade us skeptics of the utility of highlevel dialogue despite the problem of legitimizing beijingsauthoritarian rulers they stressed the need for senior us leaders to lay out us interests to their chinese counterparts in order for the latter to understand clearlyareas of great sensitivity to the united states the alternative is miscalculation thatcan lead to military confrontation for ex ample several seminar participants judged that beijing had misunderstood us resolve in pursuing its military intimidationefforts against taiwan in 19951996 they also emphasized the us needs to takeaccount of chinese leaders interests wit hout clear sense of chinese priorities it was argued us leaders will have difficulty in coming up with options for china that have realistic chance of being successful highlevel us dialogue with china was sa id to assist international efforts to get china to conform to norms favored by the us it was claimed that chinas shift from confrontation to more conformity in the last 20 years was facilitated by us leaders efforts in discussion with senior chinese leaders the us leaders were saidto make clear to beijing the negative consequences of confrontational orobstructionist actions in sensitive areas and the positive consequences of more cooperative behavior as such american leaders were seen to have helped tochannel chinese behavior in more constructive wayshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96518crs13 8while not addressed explicitly at the semin ar skepticism of such usprc military exchanges has been voiced repeat edly on capitol hill notably during hearings held by the house committee on national security and th senate committee on foreign relationshighlevel dialogue with china was especially needed during time of leadership transition in the prc without it chinese leaders are seen as prone toadopting politically safe nationalistic stan ces that greatly reduce chinese flexibility and increase prc paranoia in dealing with the united states with highlevel usassurances prc leaders could justify taki ng few more risks in moving away from narrow nationalistic positions to more cooperative internationalist stances broadlybeneficial for both china and the world community to deal with the issue of adding to beijings international prestige us officials were urged to pick and choose from among chinese leaders thus some at theseminar said there is need for us lead ers to have summit meeting with premier li peng who is widely identified with the tiananmen crackdown but the us could move ahead with president jiang zemin who handled the 1989 demonstrations in his area of responsibility shanghai in largely bloodless way the idea heresuggested by some is in part to empower the more pragmatic chinese leaders some seminar participants went on to stress that past practice and practical interests seem to argue in favor of dial ogue even with leaders thought to be key to distasteful or dangerous prc policies fo r one thing us practice in dealing with the ussr during the cold war showed the utility of dialogue with soviet leaders even when us policy saw the ussr as an evil empire meanwhile seminar participant supportive of clinton administration policy pointedly emphasized thebenefits of active dialogue with china s peoples liberation army pla viewed by many as key force in chinese domestic authoritarianism and internationalassertiveness the perceived benefits were make known us military priorities and concerns to key prc leaders at atime of leadership transition and policy formulation in china exposing the nationalistic pla leaders to the possible negative consequencesincluding possible us military actions if they forcefully pursue theirnationalistic goals exposing the pla leaders to broad discussion of us perceptions ofinterests and priorities encouraging them to pursue paths of constructiveactivity and avoid disruption and confrontation exposing us leaders to clear understanding of pla plans intentions andcapabilities establishing rules of the road so that us and prc forces in proximity in east asia do not accidentally come into conflict8httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96518crs14 9in particular some noted that us explanation of its difficult experience with proliferation in sensitive world areas might ve positive impact on chinas appreciation of how such proliferation could affect its interestsspecific recommendations set priority among us policy interests panelists were in agreement that us policymakers should establish more clear priorities in order to set clearer guidelines for dealing with china in the years ahead specifically seminar participants urged higher priority be given to us securityand economic interests regarding peace and development in asian and world affairs and suggested that us concerns over issu of values like human rights be given less priority part of the reasoning had to do with sense that regional peace and development were not only in us intere sts but were of fundamental importance to human rights conditions in china and nei ghboring areas and part of the reasoning had to do with the general judgment that chinese priorities made it unrealistic for us policymakers to hinge relations with china on human rights seminar participants agreed that us policymakers where possible should reduce linkage between major issue areas as they set their priorities for dealing with china they generally endorsed the recent us administrations practice of dealingwith economic and trade disputes with positive and negative in centives focused in the area of economic relations the c linton administrations may 1996 decision to threaten over 2 billion in trade sanctions if china did not do more to protect usand international intellectual property rights was case in point they urged similar approaches in dealing with security issues and human rights questions though itappeared that us leverage on the human rights issue per was relatively weak in part this is why some in congress wish to link human rights and us trade policy toward china chinese leaders were thought to be re latively open to meaningful negotiations with suitable giveandtake on trade and economic issues with the united statesbeijing had shown less flexibility on secur ity issues involving such questions as nuclear technology and missile exports some seminar participants judged thatprogress could be made here as well provided in part that us negotiators wereaware of chinese motives for reported nuclear and missile sales to pakistan and themiddle east 9 those motives included chinas s earch for economic profit and better overall relations with key strategic and il producing countries china is now net importer of oil seminar participants also linked chinese arms transfers to thissensitive area to prc desire to show the united states that if us policy continuesto upgrade arms sales to taiwan then beijing is prepared to respond with anupgrading of military related sales to areas sensitive for the united states given beijings strident nationalistic emphasis in recent months specialists judged that the us could expect little fl exibility on chinese issues of sovereignty eg taiwan or internal political control eg human rights on the former thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96518crs15 faceoff of us and prc forces in the taiwan area at the time of the march 1996 taiwan presidential election had the benef it of giving beijing clearer notion of the limits of us tolerance to mainland chines pressure tactics seminar participants warned that beijing remains determined to restore its sovereignty over taiwan over the long term and that one of the lessons learned by the pla from the faceoff with the us forces was that china needed to do more to prepare militarily for possible contingencies over taiwan it was assumed that this line of thinking would add toincentives prompting faster chinese military modernization neverthelessparticipants also judged that the us s how of force had provided useful deterrent to further prc aggressive actions at least for the time being over the longer termat least one seminar participant judged th at the usprc framework setup in the 1970s and 1980s for dealing with the so called taiwan issue longer conformed to reality and would have to be adjusted through what were expected to be very difficult discussions with the prc several suggestions on how to advance u s human rights interests despite prc inflexibility included use an improved atmosphere coming from us leaders willingness to meetwith chinese leaders to petition strongly and privately for the release ofprominent chinese dissidents use improved us interchange with china to actively promote us interestsand values through business contacts exchange and education programsstudy missions etc some seminar partic ipants urged greater us funding for these efforts build consensus behind us policy at home and in asia as noted above seminar participants judged that this consensus had to focus on broader us policy toward asia as well as policy toward china us officials wereurged to explain fully to american opinion leaders and citizens the utility of acontinued strong and active us military economic and political involvement inasia as the foundation of an effective policy toward china strong exposition on the many current and future challenges pos ed by china was thought to be helpful in obtaining greater american support for an ffective and balanced asian presence in east asia clear and realistic priorities and consiste nt direction were deemed important in building of asian support for us leadersh ip as noted earlier most us friends and allies are reluctant to follow the united states in confrontation with china even when the prc strongly violat world norms part of the reason has to do with regional perception that us policy could change with the united stateswithdrawing from asia leaving its allies and associates exposed before the rising power of china seminar experts acknowledged the difficulty for us policy incrafting china policy sufficiently balanced to win support among asian allies andfriends while having enough force behind the policy to warrant serious andconstructive prc response some participants noted that this argues for more activeus diplomacy and military cooperation with allies and friendshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96518crs16 clarity and consistency once us leaders establish clear and workable policy priorities and build consensus at home and abroad behind them it is incumbent on us leaders to remainconsistent in pursuing these objectives one participant judged that the clintonadministration had been less than optimally effective in dealing with china because it had changed policy in key areas regarding mfn and taiwan in particular theadministrations ability to establish lasting understandings with chinese leaders andto build consensus in the us depends on clarity credibility and consistency thealternative is seen as vacillation and drift whereby the us may be forced to resort to extraordinary means including the use of force in order to clarify its intentions in the face of growing pressure from china
