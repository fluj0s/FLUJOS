bulk of unocals oil and gas production and reserves are located overseas this report will not be updated usbased unocal corporation primarily is engaged in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas and project development in the united states and in various other countries particularly in southeast asia among other operations unocal produces geothermal energy that supplies steam to power plants for electricity generation performs physical asset and real estate management of unocal facilities and owns mine in the united states with the capacity to produce some nonenergy minerals including rare earths1 china national offshore oil corporation ltd subsidiary of cnooc largely owned by the government of china2 has submitted bid to acquire unocal cnooc ltd has exclusive rights and overall responsibilities for the exploitation of chinas offshore oil and natural gas resources in cooperation with foreign partners its bid for unocal attempts to supercede an april 4 2005 merger agreement between chevron corporation and unocal that has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies some members of congress and others are concerned that the potential acquisition of unocal by cnooc poses threat to the adequacy and dependability of us energy 1 unocal corporation httpwwwunocalcom 2 reportedly the chinese government owns 70 of cnooc see for example the wall street journal oil battle sets showdown over china june 24 2005 p a1 congressional research service the library of congress crs2 supplies and partly because of this threat to national security as well some members of congress have requested review of the bid as provided for by statute3 because some are concerned about possible effects on us energy and national security of successful bid by cnooc to acquire unocal they may be interested in the quantitative significance and geographical pattern of unocals oil and gas operations of possible particular interest are the proportions of unocals oil and gas operations and holdings in geographic regions that one might consider to be easily accessible to us energy needs however because oil is fungible commodity in world market it can be argued that it matters little where oil supplies originate whether cnooc acquires unocal or not it can much more easily and at basically the same price obtain oil to meet chinas domestic needs from geographically closer supplier than from north america4 countering this is the perception of some that world oil supplies will be very tight in at least the medium term and that control of supplies will be advantageous petroleum is an integral input to the economies of industrialized and industrializing countries and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22182 to the armed forces of any nation disruption of supplies can disrupt economic activity and affect military readiness but there is some concern that widespread buying up of energy assets could greatly diminish the size and usefulness of the oil market5 extent and pattern of unocals oil and gas operations unocals worldwide operations produced total of 169000 barrels of petroleum liquids6 and 156 billion cubic feet of dry natural gas per day in the first quarter of 2005 table 17 it has total proven worldwide reserves of 681 million barrels of petroleum liquids and 656 billion cubic feet of natural gas unocals operations in the united states and canada combined accounted for 43 of the companys worldwide liquids production and 35 of the dry natural gas production with the united states accounting for about 80 of the north american total unocals us production of 58000 barrels per day represents 08 of us production of petroleum liquids and 03 of us consumption of petroleum inasmuch as canada is major oil supplier to the united states it is reasonable to assume that unocals small quantity of canadian production is at least potentially available to the united states on 3 commonly called the exonflorio provision the statute is section 5021of the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 4 the price of north american oil would be lower than that obtained elsewhere if the per barrel cost of acquiring unocals north american reserves and production facilities should be lower than the world price 5 katinka barysch embracing the dragon the eus partnership with china centre for european

httpwwwunocalcominvestorindexhtml crs3 the other hand cnooc has purchased 169 of small canadian company with oil sands holdings8 the shares of unocals total proved reserves of oil and gas that are in north america are almost identical to the shares of unocals worldwide production forty three percent of its worldwide liquids reserves and 36 of its worldwide natural gas reserves are located in north america with about 80 of each located in the united states table 2 it is clear from the above that operations overseas account for the bulk of unocals operations and holdings the rest of the world primarily southeast asia account for 57 and 65 respectively of unocals worldwide production of petroleum liquids and dry natural gas similarly the rest of the world accounts for 57 of unocals proved

that may result in changes are presented in unocals 2004 form 10k submitted to the us securities and exchange commission possible diversion of north american oil and gas it is likely that one of the considerations in any us government review of the bid by cnooc to acquire unocal is the risk that oil and gas now produced by unocal in north america and particularly in the united states will be diverted to markets elsewhere to the extent that it is significant it is clear from the data provided above that the amounts of such quantities are small relative to us oil and gas consumption also to the extent it is significant cnooc in proposing its acquisition of unocal has committed to continue unocals practice of selling or marketing in us markets all or substantially all of the oil and gas produced from unocals us properties9 9 cnooc transaction information site the deal website of the proposed merger of unocal overview httpwwwtransactioninfocomcnoochomephp viewed june 29 2005
