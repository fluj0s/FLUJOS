the dollar on foreign exchange markets is mirrored by an equally ra pid appreciation of currencies such as the yen and euro this has raised concerns that japan may intervene in currency markets for the first time since march 2004 to shore up the value of the dollar and slow the appreciation of the yen japan has conducted such inte rvention in the past by purchasing dollars and selling yen on foreign exchange markets this intervention has raised concerns in the united states and brought charges th at tokyo is manipulating its exchange rate in order to gain unfair advantage in world trade

japanese government has not intervened significantly although some cla im that tokyo continues to talk down the value of the yen this heavy buying of dollars resulted in an accumulation of official foreign exchange reserves th at exceeded record 979 billion february 2008 by japan the intervention however seems to have had little lasting effect estimates on the cumulative effect of the interventions range from an undervaluation of the yen of about 3 or 4 yen to as much as 20 yen per dollar although recent appreciation of the yen has eras ed most of such undervaluation in 2007 the us secretary of the tr easury indicated that it had not found currency manipulation by any country incl uding by japan an april 2005 report by the government accountability office repor ted that treasury had not found currency manipulation because it viewed japans exch ange rate interventions as part of macroeconomic policy aimed at combating deflation in its may 2006 report on consultations with japan th international monetary fund imf likewise did not find currency manipulation by japan one problem with the focus on currency intervention to correct balance of trade deficits is that only about half of the increase in the value of foreign currency is reflected in prices of imports into the united states periods of heaviest intervention also coincided with slower not fa ster economic

japans case the bank of japan in c onsultation with the ministry of finance has bought us treasury securities and othe r liquid dollar assets at times when the value of the dollar relative to the yen was declining the intended result was to keep the value of the yen from appreciating too quickly in order to keep the price of japanese exports from rising in markets such as those in the united states and to maintain the profitability of those exports some experts argue that the yen has b een undervalued by 10 to 29 or more although recent appreciation of the yen largely negates this argument the underlying concern is that an undervalue d yen gives many ja panese manufacturers significant price advantage over us competitors the usheadquartered automobile industry for example claims that an undervalued yen generates price advantage of about 4000 per car to vehicles made in japan and resultant surge in sales of such vehicles in the united states2 another measure of the exchange rate ta kes into account differences in inflation rates between those in japan and in th united states real rate and provides relatively greater weight to currencies with which japan trades the most effective rate these adjustments produce real effective exchange rate as shown in figure 2 this adjusted value of the yen reached 20year low in may 2007 but it has appreciated since then any undervalua tion since 2004 arguably has resulted from private market forces and inflation ra tes resulting from macroeconomic policy in both countries rather than from government currency intervention3 economic studies indicate that currency intervention for large countries with floating exchange rates such as japan merely slows the rate of currency appreciation or depreciation over the short run less than 30 days and has little effect over the long term whether japan can be consider ed to have manipulated its exchange rate under criteria set by the inte rnational monetary fund

for international settlements the daily trading of foreign currencies through traditional foreign exchange markets totaled more than 32 trillion in april 2007 up sharply from 19 trillion in 2004 another 24 trillion was tr aded in the overthecounter foreign exchange derivatives market for tota l of 56 trillion per day in both markets about 86 of the trading on traditional fo reign exchange markets was in dollars7 these amounts are so large that for any in tervention to have an effect it arguably would have to be coordi nated among japan the united states and the european union with possible cooperation from china the interventions in 1971 when the link between the us dollar and gold wa s severed and the dollar was allowed to float within certain bands the yen began to appreciate in value the yendollar exchange rate establishe d during the us occupation of japan in 1949 had been held at 360 yen per dollar for 22 years since then it appreciated to around 105 yen per dollar in early 2005 but in late 2005 it had depreciated to around 120 yen per dollar before rising slightly to about 119 yen per dollar in march 2007 japans government has intervened in cu rrency markets to buy dollars or other foreign exchange at times when the yen wa s appreciating at pace that it considered to be too rapid japan also has intervened by selling dollars at times when the japanese government bank of japan and ministry of finance felt that the yen was depreciating too rapidly th net result of this intervention is that japans holdings of foreign exchange reserves have risen to 902 billion by july 31 20078 as can be seen in figure 2 the most significant of japans interventions to counter the yens appreciation took place in 19761978 19851988 19921996 and 19982004 since march

japanese interventions only had value as forecast that the previous days yen appreciation or depreciation would moderate during the current day after june 1995 japanese purchases of dollars had value as forecas t that the yen would depreciate in the very short run this analysis also confirmed that large infrequent interventions which characterized the latter period had higher likelihood of success than small frequent interventions for 2003 and 2004 despite the record size and frequency of the intervention by japan the authors found it di fficult to statistically distinguish the pattern of

by 1 per dollar or about 121 the imfs may 2006 report on consulta tions with japan did not discuss exchange rate intervention22 fundamental problem with exchange rates is that commonly accepted method exists to estimate the effectivene ss of official intervention into foreign exchange markets many interrelated factors affect the exchange rate at any given time and quan titative model exists that is able to provide the magnitude of any causal relationship between intervention and an exchange rate when so many interdependent variables are acting simultaneously23 2007 occasional paper 7 by ec onomists at the us treasury surveyed exchange rate models and misalignments in currencies the authors concluded that currencies cannot be said to be misaligned without estimating what the exchange rate should be economists use various models to estimate such hypothetical exchange rates and then compare the modeled rates to the actual ones the study notes that the models produce widely divergent results and depend heavily on their assumptions methodologies and mathematical structure in trying to capture all the relevant features of an economy partic ularly the behavior of financ ial markets

with the medi an at 15 undervaluation25 these models do not however differentiate betw een undervaluation caused by intervention and that caused by market forces setting aside the problems with statistical estimates what can be said is that the japanese economy has generate d surplus in its trade accounts for much of recent history without an offsetting deficit in its capital account market forces would have forced an appreciation of the yen that would have worked to eliminate the trade surplus from 1977 to 2004 japans cumulative surplus on current account net trade in goods and services plus remittances totaled 2077 billion offse tting japans surplus on current account was its net capital outflow and net official purchases of foreign exchange reserves intervention from 1977 to 2004 japan recorded deficit in its capital flows investments in foreign securities buying foreign companies deposits in foreign bank accounts etc of 1314 billion in other words japans private invest ors sent 1314 billion more abroad than foreigners invested in japan the remaining 763 billion outflow 2077 billion minus 1314 b illion of dollars was primarily from official currency intervention that added to japans foreign exchange reserves this net buying of 763 billion26 in dollars over the 19772004 period provided more than third 37 of the total capital outflow from japan to offset the count rys surplus in trade if japan had not intervened to this extent the yen likely would have appreciated more than it did taking the estimate by takatoshi ito th at 250 billion in intervention moved the exchange rate by about 1 or 1 the net ffect of the direct intervention that ended in 2004 would have been around 3 or 4 per dollar taking the estimates by preeg and general motors the upper bound on th effect of the intervention would be around 20 or about 20 per dollar the range therefore for the effect of exchange rate undervaluation because of japanese intervention would be from 3 to 20 per dollar with the statistical likelihood more toward the lower end of the range the link between exchange value and trade setting aside the question of the efficacy of japans intervention into exchange markets to weaken the yen second questi on is whether changes in the yendollar exchange rate actually affect imports and exports in theory japans intervention by buying dollars and selling yen induces

price while increasing profits it also makes imports relatively more expensive in japan lowered export prices and higher import prices will tend to increase japans trade surplus which then contributes to higher growth rate the bank of japan may or may not sterilize the currency operation by selling japanese bonds locally to keep the domestic money supply constant in an economic sense if the intervention is not sterilized buying dollars is equivalent to increasing the japanese money supply since the finan ce ministry purchases the dollars from japanese exporters with yen which then enters the japanese money supply in actual practice the operation of cu rrency markets often deviates from that represented in economic theory and in models in particular the longterm link between intervention and the foreign exchange rate is difficult to show empirically while the intervention has shortterm effects the longterm effects on exchange rates and trade flows are much less apparent pecially considering that most of the time the intervention leans against the wind rather than reversing the direction of change second problem is that in practice japans automakers and other exporters to us markets usually do not make short run adjustments to prices in response to exchange rate fluctuations unlike generic commodities such as crude oil or wheat that have standardized commodity markets japans exports tend to be brandnamed products for which the sellers have some control over pr ices when selling in the united states dealers and re tailers of products from japa n

for every 1 the cu rrency depreciates against the dollar28 for shipments to the united states economic studies have found that on average an exchange rate change induces price re sponse equal to onehalf the amount although it varies by industry29 an implication of this lack of complete response of domestic prices to exchange rate changes is that currency depreciation will not necessarily eliminate or even reduce significantly nations trade deficit httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33178crs12 30 in order for real depreciation to improv the current account exports and imports must be

real exchange rate and real current account balance somewhatempirical studies i ndicate however that for most countries over the long run real depreciation adjusting for domestic in flation is likely to improve nations current account balance while real appreci ation is likely to worsen it in the shortrun however the opposite is likely to ccur this is called the jcurve effect as the value of the yen rises for example some japanese exporters do increase their prices and us importers end up paying mo re for the quantity of goods they need this worsens the balance of trade befo re us importers can switch to other suppliers30 still japans balance of tr ade does respond somewhat in the long run to large appreciation of the yen japanese exporters ultimately have to either raise prices or decrease costs of producti on and importers of commodities in japan f ace lower international prices this works to reduce japans surplus in trade exports fall while imports rise one economic study indicated that in 2002 1 appreciation of the yen induced 22 decrease in japans current account surplus balance of trade with the world in goods and services plus unilateral transfers31 at that time japans current account surplu s was about 110 billion therefore 1 yen appreciation was estimated to decrease japans current account balance by about 24 billion another study for 19851991 found that 10 sustaine d appreciation of the yen would reduce japans trade surplus by 07 of gross national product gnp32 at that time japans gnp was around 3000 billion 1 appreciation of the yen therefore would have reduced japans trad surplus by about 21 billion in actuality from 2002 to 2004 the yen appreciated from 120 to 104 per dollar up by 13 but japans current account surplus rose not fell from 113 billion to 172 b illion up by 5233 part of this rise in japans current account surplus may have been the jcurve effect but in this case the yen appreciation was overshadowed by other variables yen ppreciation may have slowed the rise in japans current account surplus but it did not stop it other factors also came into play these included growth in the amer ican and other major markets relative savings and inflation rates the level of interest rates in various markets earnings from investments the competitiveness of ja panese products the price of petroleum competition from china and intrafirm trade by multinational corporationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33178crs13 another question is whether japans inte rvention into foreign exchange markets raised its rate of growth figure 4 shows japans currency intervention in terms of annual rates of change in its foreign exch ange reserves and the yendollar exchange rate it also shows japans economic grow th rate in real gr oss domestic product the chart indicates that many of the peri ods of yen appreciation and intervention into foreign exchange markets to buy dollars so were periods of relatively slower not faster economic growth rates ex cept in the late 1970s japans growth performance during periods of intervention wa s rather lackluster growth tended to be higher during periods without interven tion although it can be argued that the intervention may have helped to keep economic conditions from becoming worse than they actually were intervention or manipulation question for us policy is whether ja pans intervention into currency markets constituted manipulation of its exchange rate under us law the secretary of the treasury is required to analyze the exch ange rate policies of foreign countries annually in c onsultation with the international monetary fund and consider whether countries manipulate th eir exchange rate for purposes of preventing effective balance of payments adjustment or gaining unfair

german mark in figure 5 the euro index is set at 100 in january 1993 as can be seen the index of the euro also has moved roughly with the yen with the exception of the us recession period around 2001 when the dollar rose in value relative to the euro and mark but rose less relative to the yen most of the time however the values of these currencies seem ed to be responding to the same outside

ecause of tokyos past intervention and the possibility that it c ould resume intervening should the yen strengthen too rapidly or excessively agai nst the dollar japan also may use other methods to alter the expectations of curre ncy traders and talk down the yen through various statements or othe r jawboning japan also could be caught up in the concern over chinas currency policy policies aimed at china also could affect japan currently tokyo seems content to abstain from active intervention into international currency markets at some point however japan may want to decrease its dollar denominated foreign exchange holdings it would likely do this by selling dollardenominated assets an action that would weaken the dollar and strengthen the yen depending on how this potential dive stiture is conducted it could be viewed as intervention into foreign exchange ma rkets albeit in the opposite direction of concern given the weakness of the dollar in 2008 moreover if the value of the yen overshoots and rises to va lue considered to be too high for japanese financial authorities they may be compelled by political pressures from their exporting industries to intervene according to

since the federal reserve has been lowering interest rates to stimulate the us economy and shore up the financial sector foreign invest ors are seeking higher returns elsewhere and less capital appears to be flowing into the unite d states this has caused the value of the dollar to decline and prices of imported products especially energy to rise this in turn raises the rate of inflation in the united stat if the federal reserve wants to increase inflows of capital it may need an outside policy instrument i ntervention by japan since it is not able to induce greater capital inflows without raising interest rates and impairing its other policy actionsintervention under current circumstances to strengthen the weakened dollar may coincide with us economic policy goals42 question remains moreover whether the united states should take measures to compensate for past intervention by japan setting aside the issue of how much past intervention actually moved the exchange rate and whether any exchange rate change affected actual market transacti ons if us industries were significantly impacted negatively should remedial action be taken now if for example the us automobile industry lost market share becau of past japanese government attempts to reduce the value of the yen is there acti on that should be taken now to remedy the lost market share the major policy options for congress include the following let the market adjust do nothing clarify the definition of currency manipulation require reports nd negotiations require the president to certify which countries are manipulating their currencies and take remedial action if the manipulation is not halted and convene special meeting of th international monetary fund to reach an agreement on the misalignment of the yen oppose increased voting shares or representation in international financial organizations for any country that has currency that is manipulated or in fundamental misalignment initiate dispute settlement case with the world trade organization wto or block the overseas private investment corporation fro m providing services to japan let the market adjust do nothing most economists argue that currency markets are so large that only extensive and coordinated intervention has any lasting effects countries that do intervene often find themselves leaning against the wind and not materially altering either the direction of or the extent of change als intervention is expensive it is not clear that japan could afford to invest anothe r 800 billion in us treasury securities and other liquid

nvestors can offset official buying and selling of foreign financial assets currency peg without capital controls is expensive and difficult to maintain during financial crisis during the 19971998 asian financial crisis for example hong kong maintained its pegged exchange rate partly by raising domestic interest rates to attract foreign capital and to retard capital flight by local investors to reduce the incentive to convert hong kong dollars to us dollars in anticipation of drop in the value of the hong kong dollar on october 23 1997 the overnight rate of interest in hong kong jumped from 625 to 1000 as the monetary authorities tried to stem the capital outflow even t hough hong kong was able to maintain its exchange rate peg the high interest rates caused near collapse of real estate markets there this is one reason china still maintains some capital controls43 since the asian financial crisis japa n and other asian nations ve negotiated currency swap agreements to provide shortterm sources of foreign exchange in times of crisis44 this obviates somewhat the need to rely on interest rates to attract foreign capital under policy of allowing market forces to determine exchange rates some intervention still may be necessary to ca lm excessive volatility in markets or to counter trends that overshoot b ecause of herd mentality and ot her effects in the past the more successful of such interven tions were coordinated among the large industrialized nations clarify the definition of currency manipulation major provision of various currency bills in congress has been to clarify the definition of currency manipulation while this legislation apparently has been aimed primarily at chinas currency policy in cases the bills also have cited japan and south korea in the

or pursuing any other policy or action th at in the view of the secretary of the treasury warrants desi gnation for priority action the bills also specify that trade data are to be those of the united states and other trading partners of the exporting country unless such trade data are not available or are demonstrably inaccurate in which case the exporting countrys trade data may be relied upon if shown to be sufficien tly accurate and trustworthy the issue of which data to use applies primarily to china mainly because of imports and exports that flow through but do not originate in hong kong and the general lack of confidence in chinas system for compiling statistics and reporting them the data problem however also arises with japan in 2004 for japan japanese data as accessed through the imf or global trade atlas46 reported merchandise trade surplus of 110 billi on 24 of gdp but compilation ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33178crs20 47 data from international monetary fund direction of trade statistics september 2005 for 2004 china reported merchandise trade surplus of 32 billion but the exports and imports of trading partners implied trade surplus of 314 billion the imf notes that data reported by exporting and importing countries can be inconsistent because of differences in country of origin or destination classificati on concepts lack of destination detail time of recording valuation coverage and processing errors 48 sterilized intervention refers in the governme nt of japans case to the buying of dollars or other foreign exchange from japanese holders and using those dollars to buy dollar denominated securities in the united states while simultaneously selling yendenominated securities in japan to keep the domestic money supply unchanged 49 united states

currency markets particularly when evidenced by large accumulations of foreign exchange such accumulations of dollars do not constitute prima facie evidence of currency manipulation but they would be used along with other criteria to determine whether country has been engaged in it the bills have not addressed the issue of sterilization in currency intervention48 in 2003 and 2 004 treasury f ound that japan did not meet the criteria for currency manipulation in part because its exchange rate interventions were considered to be part of macroeconomic policy to combat deflation49 it was considered to be unsterilized intervention to increase the m oney supply policy question is whether largescale interventions are justified when part of macroeconomic policy even though they may have
