first time constitutional amendment concerning church and state s been ordered reported by house committee the scope and effect of hjres 78 are also considerably broader than the school prayer issue that has been the focus of most previous proposals and in that respect the measure appears to build on the debate n churchstate issues that occurred in the 104 congress this report summarize sth

modified version f hjres 78 reported to the house on partyline vote of 1611 the proposal would add the following language to the constitution to secure the peoples right to acknowledge god according

cosponsors the subcommittee on the constitution of the house judiciary committee hel d hearing on the proposal on july 22 1997 and on partyline vote of 84 on october 28 1997 forwarded it to the full committee the measure as ordered reported by the judiciary committee differs in three respects from the proposal as it was originally introduced 1 the sentence neither the unite d states nor any state shall establish any official religion has been added 2 the phras neither the united states nor any state has been substituted for the government at the beginning of the last sentence and 3 the phrase prescribe school prayers in the last sentence originally read initiate or designa school prayers the changes were all made by the subcommittee on the constitution in subst itute proposed during markup by rep hutchinson rar the full committee approved the measure without further change democratic members offered number of amendments to the proposal in both the subcommittee and full committee but all were defeated largely on partyline votes proposed amendments in the full committee markup were as follows 1 proposal by rep scott dva to strike the last phrase or deny equa l access to benefit on account of religion rejected 914 2 an amendment by rep nadler dny to strike as well the part concerning the recognition of religious beliefs heritage or traditions on public property rejected on voice

strike the text and replace it with th language of the religion clauses of the first amendment rejected on voice vote hjres 78 is the latest in long succession of constitutional amendments that have been proposed since the supreme court handed down it s school prayer decisions of engel v vitale and abington school district v schempp in 1962 and 1963 but the proposal addresses broader range of churchstate issues than its predecessors and appears to build on competing constitutional proposals that emerged during the 104 congress late inth the first session of that congress both rep hyde rill and rep istook introduce d proposals to amend the constitution with respect to matters of church and state hjres 121 also introduced in the senate by sen hatch as sjres 45 and hjres 127 respectively

competed for support among proponents f amending the constitution in this rea of the law late in the second session of the 104th congress rep armey rtex introduced modified proposal in an effort to unif proponents of changing the constitution in this rea of the law hjres 184 but that4 effort also proved unavailing thus proposal to amend the constitution with respect to the law of church and state either emerged from committ ee or came to vote in the house or the senate during the 104th congress but that formal inaction masked what was in fact vigorou s examina tion of churchstate concerns moreover the proposals that were introduce d marked si gnificant broadening of the debate about constitutional amendment as they addressed not only the longstanding issue of prayer and other religious practices in the public schools but also such concerns s public aid to religious institutions and the display of religious symbols on public property the only p revious vote in the house on constitutional amendment concernin g church and state in recent decades occurred in 1971 when the house voted in favor f hjres 191 school prayer proposal by rep wylie roh by margin of 240162 but that was twentyeight votes short of the ne cessary twothirds majority that measure came to the house floor not by means of committee recommendation but through discharge petition5 constitutional

proposals of the 104 congress into single measure if adopted it would not repeal butth would coexist in the constitution with t he religion clauses of the first amendment which provide that congress shall make law respecting an establishment of religion r prohibiting the free exercise thereof nevertheless hjres 78 clearly is intended to alter number of judicial interpretatio ns of those clauses particularly of the establishment clause much of the l egislative history of the proposal is yet to be written of course but at this point in the measures consideration its likely constitutional effects appear t include the following 1 public aid to sectarian institutions hjres 78 appears to loosen considerably the existing constitutional limitations on public aid to sectarian institutions particularl of direct aid the proposals concluding words neither the united states nor any state shall discriminate against religion or deny equal access to benefit on account f religion likely would require government to include even pervasively religious entities in grant and contract programs currently the establishment clause allows direct public aid to religious entities if their secula r functions can be separated from their religious ones and the aid is channeled nly to the entities secular functions but it bars direct aid if the entity is so pervasively religious that the aid cannot be confined to secular neutral and nonideological p urposes under hjres 78 pervasively religious entities could not be6 excluded from participation in direct public aid programs for which they would otherwise be eligible and existing supreme court constructions of the establishment clause tha t require such exclusion would be overridden7 the proposa ls impact on indirect aid programs such as voucher and tax benefi t measures would not be quite as dramatic current interpretations of the establishmen t clause allow such i ndirect aid to flow even to pervasively sectarian entities so long as the primary recipient of the benefit has genuinely free choice about where to use it and i s not channeled by government toward religious entity hjres 78 would not change8 that interpretation but under current law government can include nonreligious privat entities in indirect public aid programs and exclude religious ones hjres 78 appears to mandate the inclusion of private religious entities including pervasively religious ones in any indirect assistance program that also includes nonreligious private entities with respect to both direct and indirect aid programs hjres 78 would als override state constitutional provisions that bar the funding of religious entities 2 religious activit ies on public property less certain is hjres 78s effect on the supreme courts jurisprudence concerning religious activities in the public school s and the display of religious symbols on public property the court has construed th establishment clause to prohibit government from sponsoring or promoting religiou shttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98387crs5 engel v vitale supra abing ton school district v schempp supra lee v weisman 5059 us 577 1992 wallace v jaffree 472 us 38 1985 mccollum v board of

fa r from being first amendment orphan is as fully protected under the free speech clause as secular private expression the supreme court has said thus the court has held the11 first amendment to

right to students at the secondary schoo l13 level affirmed released t ime programs of religious instruction and implicitly approved14 the constitutionality of properly drafted moment of silence statute in addition in a15 number of decisions it has held the first amendment to protect private religiou s expression on public property including privately sponsored displays of quintessentia l religious symbols16 to the extent that the sen tence in hjres 78 stating that the peoples right to pray and to recognize their religious beliefs heritage or traditions on public property including schools shall not be infringed is read to apply only to private religiou s expression it appears to be largely consonant with nd not to alter existing constitutional law but much of the ferment over the w of church and state has been stimulated by the courts decisions concerning government sponsorship and endorsement of religiou s expression and the legislative history of hjres 78 to date seems to make clear that it is intended to undo at least some of that jurisprudence rep istook has testified fo r instance that his proposal would overturn engel and abington to the extent that the disallow
