petroleum fuel additive that has commonly been in use since the 1970s and is now primarily used as fuel oxygenate legislation in the 108th congress would have dealt with mtbe in variety of ways

potential defendants from liability aris ing from defective product claims fo r fuel additives including mtbe and fuels blended with such additives so long as certain conditions are met this mtbe safeharbor would not insulate responsible party from other liabilities such as responsibility for environmental cleanup th safeharbor provision is also written to apply retroactively to september 5 2003 thus barring claims made in numerous lawsuits already filed in courts throughout the country the rationale behind the hr 6 form of liability protection is that mtbe use in gasoline was precipitated by federal mandates and that leaking storage tanks and other sources of exposure not the product itself ar responsible for current contamination as liability related to mtbe contamination remains controversial and may become the subject of debate in the 109th congress this report analyzes the legal implications of the safeharbor provision found in th current version of hr 6 background for technical and cost reasons mtbes presen t use was in part precipitated by the requirements of the 1990 clean air act ame ndments especially the requirement that reformulated gasoline contain at least 2 oxygen3 use of reformulated gasoline is required in areas that fail to meet federal ozone standards4 mtbe like all ethers is highly soluble and has become more controve rsial in recent years as reports of water contamination and resulting wsuits continue to surface5 sources of contamination are varied but are primarily identified with l eaks or other spills from underground storage tanks pervasive method of gasoline storage6 at the present time there is consensus on the health effects associated with mtbe contamination with cer tain parties claiming that mtbe is suspected carcinogen and others claiming that the chemical is relatively benign7 the epa has studied the health effects of mtbe and so far the agency hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21676crs3 7 continued law wkly newspaper

however the agency continues to study the issue8 liability title 15 of hr 6 109th congress would address fu additives section 1502 of that title contains the safeharbor provision for manufacturers and other parties associated with mtbe and other fuel oxygenates the section reads in general notwithstanding any othe r provision of federal or state law renewable fuel as defined by section 211 o1 of the clean air act or methyl tertiary butyl ether hereafter in this secti on referred to as mtbe used or intended to be used as motor vehicle fuel nor any motor vehicle fuel containing such renewable fuel or mtbe shall be deemed defective product by virtue of the fact that it is or contains such renewable fu or mtbe if it does not violate control or prohibition imposed by the administrato r of the environmental protection agency hereinafter in this section referred to as the administrator under section 211 of such act and the manufacturer is in co mpliance with all requests for information under subsection b of such section 211 of ch act if the safe harbor provided by this section does not apply the existence of claim of defective product shall be determined under otherwise applicable w nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect the liability of any person for environmental remediation costs drinking water contamination negligence for spills or other reasonably foreseeable events public or private nuisance trespass breach of warranty breach of contract or any other liability other than liability based upon claim of defective product9 this language would potentially provide liability shield for all those who might be sued for supplying defective renewable fuel or mtbe itself as well as fuels blended with mtbe or other additives10 the liability shield would take effect so long as the cited statutory and regulatory requi rements were complied with11 to this end we note that the term manufacturer as used in the bill mig ht apply to manufacturers of mtbe and other fuel additives as well as those entities th at produce additivebl ended and specifically mtbeblended fuels12 epa regulations issued under th clean air act define fuel

additive and thos who produce manufacture import or sell fuel additives13 section 211 of the clean air act app ear to implicitly adopt this definition of manufacturer and specifically indicates that the term encompasses importers14 thus it appears relatively clear that the applicability of the safeharbor provision would depend upon compliance with section 211 of the clean air act and any rele vant epa regulations by potentially large group of manufacturers assuming the safeharbors applicability the type of liability protection that would be provided would necessarily depend on the term defectiv product which appears to refer to state products liability claims15 products liability is traditional common law tort tort is civil action to recover da mages for injuries caused by means other than breach of contract the usual standard of lia bility in tort actions is negligence which is the failure to exercise due care in produc ts liability cases however courts apply strict liability instead of negligence as the standard for recovery16 thus absent the safeharbor provision an mtbe manufacturer or distributor for instance could be held liable for defective product that causes injury even if the party had exercised due care in all phases of production there are three different types of product defects that can give rise to liability manufacturing defects design defects nd failures to adequately warn of product hazards17 product with manufacturing defect is one that is not in the condition in which it was designed to be18 product with design def ect is one that is in the condition in which it was designed to be but was not designed in the safest feasible manner19 if manufacturer has used the safest feasible design but that design has an inherent danger that is not obvious to user s of the product then the manufacturer must warn users of the danger or be liable for failure to warn20 while manufacturers are often the target of such litigation and while the ex act contours are matter of state law liability often extends beyond manufactur ers to distributors sellers and even to commercial lessors and bailors21 thus absent safeharbor pr ovision most entities involved in the production distribution and sale of fuel additives or blende d fuel even those who would not be deemed manufacturers under the relativ ely broad definition found in the

product under any of the abovementioned theories the broad language of the mtbe safeh arbor provision would likely apply to all three concepts of products lia bility and effectively preven t liability from attaching under such theories additionally while the sa feharbors applicability is conditioned upon certain actions taken by additive or blendedfuel manufacturers the provision would likely apply to all potential fendants in products liability claim similarly failure on the part of manufacturer to comply with the cited environmental provisions would likely remove the liability shield for all potential defendants22 finally while potential defendants could be shielded from defective productsrelated liability it appears that they would remain susceptible to other types of legal claims indeed the language of the provision specifically maintains that other bases of liability such as environmental remediation costs drinking water conta mination trespass public or private nuisance breach of warranty breach of contract and negligence for reasonably foreseeable events are not to be affected by the safeharbor provisions23 it is worth noting that reaching mtbe manufacturers and those who blend fuels may prove more difficult under these other bases of liability as stated previously most contamination occurs due to leaking underground storage tanks located at individual gas stations liability for this contamination could attach to the party responsible for such tanks but that party is not necessarily the fuel manuf acturer or refiner retroactive application as is not an uncommon practice congress has indicated in hr 6 that the safe harbor provisions would apply retroactively meaning that the law if enacted would govern events in the past back to the specified date the provision states b effective date this section shall be effective as of september 5 2003 and shall apply with respect to all claims filed on or after that date24 in this particular case the safeharbors retroactive application would effectively bar products liability claims in seve ral pending lawsuits it is wellsettled that congress has the power to legislate retroac tively effectively closing off remedy in the courts under certain circumstances25 primary among these circumstances is the requirement that there be final decision in the case26 such legislative action mu st also

we refer here to accrued causes of action prior to being reduced to final unreviewable judgment once reduced to final unreviewable judgment preliminary research indicates near unanimous support for property statuslegislation has legitimate legislative purpose furthered by rational means standard that is quite deferential to the congress27 but while congress has the power to cut off pending mtbe lawsuits it is an altogether separate question whether exercise of that power effects fifth amendment taking of private property the underlying causes of action requiring compensation28 the crux is straightforward do the accrued mtbe causes of action that would be extinguished constitute property of particular significan ce is how this inquiry would be resolved in two courts the us court of federal claims and its appellate court the us court of appeals for the federal circuit since the former has exclusive jurisdiction over takings claims against the ited states seeking more than 1000029 but while the federal circuit has held accrue d causes of action to be prope rty it has done so apparently only as regards extinguishment of international claims30 were these courts faced with extinguishment of statelaw claims as in the case of the mtbe litigation they might be tempted to follow the rule that property under the takings clause is normally defined by reference to state law our preliminary review suggests that state courts are divided as to the property status of accrued causes of action31 in sum whether enactment of safeharbor provision similar to that contained in hr 6 would effect taking of the mtbe plaintiffs accrued pr oductliability causes of action must be deemed an open question
