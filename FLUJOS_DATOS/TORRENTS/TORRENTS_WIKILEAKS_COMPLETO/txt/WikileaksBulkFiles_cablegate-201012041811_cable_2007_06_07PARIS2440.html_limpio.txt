persian gulf shared his views on iran and iraq on june 7 gellet assessed that the iranians are overconfident and vulnerable to ban on international air travel his assessment of iraq was notably bleak end summary 2 c over lunch june 7 the mfas dasequivalent for the persian gulf franck gellet shared his views on iran and iraq having recently returned from 15day trip to iran gellet said that his most serious and useful interlocutor was former foreign minister velayati whom he described as being less romantic than the regimes other foreign policy heavyweights gellet said that virtually all of the iranian officials he met overestimated the regimes strength both on the regional and the international stage the iranians are convinced that one including the united states can touch them economically or militarily they simply cant imagine that the us has the capacity and the political will to launch military strike against them at time when the us military appears to be bogged down in iraq said gellet page 03 ruehfra2440 c n f i d n t i l paris 002440 3 c gellet said his own view which he cautioned is not shared by everyone at the mfa is that if the europeans really want to avoid military confrontation between the us and iran then they need to show the iranians they are serious about economic sanctions the iranians will never blink until they feel that the regimes survival is at stake said gellet he suggested that in addition to further sanctions on the banking sector full arms embargo and cut in export credits the iranians might be vulnerable to an embargo of refined petroleum products in addition he suggested that we not underestimate the dramatic isolating effect that ban on international air travel to and from iran would have gellet noted that these were just his personal views and said that he has not yet received any guidance from the new presidency on iran sanctions he observed that president sarkozy took hard line against the iranian nuclear program during his election campaign but said it remained to be seen what that would translate into in policy terms page 04 ruehfra2440 c n f i d n t i l paris 002440 4 c gellet who served for nearly three years at the french embassy in baghdad before assuming his current position had particularly grim view of iraq we dont have the slightest hope it can be salvaged its lost he said he predicted that iraq will descend into fullscale civil war whether or not mnfi remains on the other hand he predicted that if the coalition were to withdraw there would be an immediate and horrific spike in the level of violence your departure would be seen everywhere as sign that its time for the gloves to come off he said he further predicted that in the aftermath of the coalitions departure whenever that occurs the ensuing conflict would last many years until iraqs sunnis and shiites and their respective patrons were exhausted as for the kurds gellet said they seriously underestimated the risk that they would be annihilated during the course of civil war that would likely pull in most of iraqs neighbors including turkey 5 c notwithstanding his bleak analysis gellet encouraged page 05 ruehfra2440 c n f i d n t i l paris 002440 the us to continue its efforts to promote reconciliation he noted that one complaint he often heard from his sunni contacts was that they received conflicting messages from the various usg agencies on the ground in iraq and were never sure which of them had the ultimate decisionmaking authority gellet finished by warning that our tribal allies in anbar province would turn on us whenever it suited their interests to do so please visit paris classified website at httpwwwstatesgovgovpeurparisindexc fm stapleton
