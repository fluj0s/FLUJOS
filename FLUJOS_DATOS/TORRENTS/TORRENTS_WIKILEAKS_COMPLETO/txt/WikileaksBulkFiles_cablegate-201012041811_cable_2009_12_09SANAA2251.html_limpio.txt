mops mass pgov prel ye subject royg looks ahead following ct operations but perhaps not far enough ref sanaa 02230 classified by ambassador stephen seche for reasons 14b and d 1 snf summary the royg views the december 17 ct operations as success and benefit to yemeni national interests and appears not overly concerned about unauthorized leaks regarding the us role and negative media attention to civilian deaths royg officials continue to publicly maintain that the operation was conducted entirely by its forces acknowledging us support strictly in terms of intelligence sharing deputy prime minister rashad alalimi told the ambassador on december 20 that any evidence of greater us involvement such as fragments of us munitions found at the sites could be explained away as equipment purchased from the us while the royg has touted the operation as victory in terms of the number of alqaida in the arabian peninsula aqap members killed or captured it hasnt yet decided how or even if it should begin to modify its public messaging to address criticism over collateral damage or the likelihood that the extent of us involvement may become impossible to deny end summary 2 snf in december 20 meeting with the ambassador deputy prime minister for security and defense rashad alalimi said that the royg including president saleh himself views the december 17 ct operations in abyan and arhab as success despite negative press reports septel and leaks to the us press regarding us role in the operation alimi said he was joined by other royg officials in their positive view of the operation against alqaida in the arabian peninsula aqap and desire for continued collaboration on ct operations referring to an internal royg meeting chaired by president saleh on december 19 alimi assured the ambassador that saleh wants these operations against aqap to continue nonstop until we eradicate this disease 3 snf alimi told the ambassador that saleh was undisturbed by press reports citing us officials asserting american involvement in the operations saying that the royg must maintain the status quo with regard to the official denial of us involvement in order to ensure additional positive operations against aqap alimi seemed more concerned with the political opposition and southern movements use of the abyan operation as an example of the governments heavyhanded response to groups the royg deems threat the ambassador cautioned alimi that the royg may need to nuance its position regarding us involvement in the event more evidence surfaces complicating its ability to adhere to the official line that royg forces conducted the operations independently alimi appeared confident that any evidence of greater us involvement such as us munitions found at the sites could be explained away as equipment purchased from the us however alimi informed the ambassador that senior royg officials continue to the discuss media strategy and the public posture of the royg not so innocent 4 snf according to alimi the royg has recruited number of local political and religious leaders to visit the ares affected by the air strikes in abyan to explain the people the need for the operation and the dnger that aqap poses to all yemenis the governr of abyan was given yr 20 million approximatel usd 100000 to disburse to the families of those killed or wounded in the strikes in maajala where the aqap training camp was located alimi said that the civilians who died were largely nomadic bedouin families who lived in tents near the aqap training camp and were assisting aqap with logistical support alimi said they were poor people selling food and supplies to the terrorists but were nonetheless acting in collusion with the terrorists and benefitting financially from aqaps presence in the area he assured the ambassador that the governor of abyan visited the site after the operation and confirmed that there were villages houses or civilian institutions that were damaged only the training camp and the encampments of the noncombatant bedouin population comment 5 snf given that local and international media will continue to look for evidence of us role in the december 17 strikes against aqap the royg must think seriously about its public posture and whether its strict adherence to assertions that the strikes were unilateral will undermine public support for legitimate and urgently needed ct operations should evidence to the contrary surface thus far the royg has deployed influential local leaders to the affected area in abyan to explain the need for the strikes in an effort to quell potential unrest however it has not attempted to provide any context for the civilian casualties which might help to counter overblown claims of royg disregard for the local population in this particular case southerners end comment seche
