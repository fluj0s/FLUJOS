usc 431 et seqirc 501c3 only prohibits campaign intervention other types of political activities are permitted the line between the two can be difficult to discern clearly churches may not make statements that endorse or oppose candidate publish or distribute campaign literature or contribute to campaign5 on the other hand they may conduct activities not related to elections such as issue advocacy and supporting or opposing individuals for nonelective offices6 in other situations an activity is generally permissible unless it is structur ed or conducted in way that shows bias towards or against candidate thus c hurches may do such things as create and distribute voter education ma terials host candidate foru ms and invite candidates to appear at church functions so long as these activities do not show preference for or against candidate7 biases can be subtle and whether an activity is campaign intervention depends on the facts and circumstances of each case8 the tax laws do not prohibit religious leaders from participating in campaign activity as individuals9 religious leaders may dorse or oppose candidates in speeches advertisements etc in their capacity as private citizens leader may be identified as being from specific churc h but there should be intimation that he or she is speaking as representative of the church the church may not support the activity in any way thus leader may not make campaignrelated statements in the churchs publications at its events or in manner that uses its assets this is true even if the leader pays the costs of the

to ads that wisconsin right to life inc sought to run while not expressly overruling its decision in mcconnell v fec which had upheld the provision against first amendment facial challenge the court limited the laws appli cation specifically it ruled that advertisements that may reasonably be interpreted as something other than an appeal to vote for or against specific candidate are not the functional equivalent of cons titutionally protected express dvocacy and therefore cannot be regulated analysis of legislation bills introduced in the 110th 109th 108th and 107th congresses would allow churches to engage in some amount of political campaign activity without risking their taxexempt status each bill addresses the issue in different way thus they provide examples of various approaches congress could take if it so chose to amend the tax codes prohibition on cam paign activity by churches none of the bills would change the reporting requirements under current law churches unlike most taxexempt organiza tions are not required to file an annual information return form 990 with the irs22 historically organizations filing the form 990 have not been required to report meaningful information regarding their campaign activities23 however beginning in tax year 2008 returns filed in 2009 filing organizations will report informa tion about their political activities on the forms new schedule c24 thus while the bills would permit churches to engage inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32973crs5 25 see rev rul 8195 19811 cb 332 ruling that lawful campaign intervention by 501c4

501c6 trade associations 26 for the 501c organizations permitted to engage in campaign activity these funds are lawful way to avoid the tax imposed for making certain political expenditures see irc 527f churches and other 501c3 organi zations may not establish these funds under current law because it would be an indirect way to get around the political campaign prohibition see treas reg 15276g 27 at least one commentator has raised the possibility that congress could not constitutionally exempt churches and other organizations from the 4955 tax see review of internal revenue code ction 501c3 requirements for religious organizations hearing before the subcomm ittee on oversight of the committee on ways and means serial 10769 may 14 2002 statement of bruce r hopkins an expert on tax exempt organizations that i f churches only were exempted from this tax i believe that would amount to an unconstitutional sponsorship by the federal government of religioncampaign activities they would not require churches to report to the irs on those activities hr 2275 110th congress hr 2275 would repeal the political campaign prohibition in irc 501c3 thus it w ould allow churches and other 501c3 organizations to engage in all types of campaign activity without jeopardizing their taxexempt status if the bill were to become law it appears the sole tax code restriction on the amount of such activity would be that it could not be the organizations primary activity25 churches and other organizations would still be subject to tax on their political expe nditures under irc 4955 thus possibly providing disincentive to engage in activities with associated taxable expenditures it appears the bill would allow churches and other 501c3 organizations to establish 527 f3 separate segregated funds to co nduct electionre lated activities26 churches would under the bill still be subj ect to applicable campaign finance laws hr 235 109th congress under hr 235 the houses of worship free speech restoration act churches would not have been treated as participating in campaign activity because of the content preparation or presen tation of any homily sermon teaching dialectic or other presen tation made during re ligious services or gatherings this rule would have pplied for purposes of 501c3 status eligibility to receive taxdeductible cont ributions under 170c2 various estate and gift tax provisions 2055 2106 nd 2522 and the 4955 excise tax on political expenditures27 the bill clarified that church member or leader would be prohibited from expressing personal views on political matters or elections during regular religious services so long as t hose views were not disseminated beyond the services attendees dissemination would have included mailing with more than an incremental cost to the church and any electioneering communication the bill expressly stated that it did not permit disbursements for electioneering communications or political expenditures prohibited by fecahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32973crs6 it appears that hr 235 would have permitted activities such as the express endorsement of candidate by church leaders and others during religious services requests for contributions to candidate committees and other political committees during religious gatherings and written endorseme nts in church bulletins and inserts any expenditures for these activities would not have been subject to the 4955 tax the bill would not have allowed churches to set up 527f3 separate segregated funds or change existing campaign finance laws hr 235 108th congress hr 235 an earlier version of the houses of worship free speech restoration act was id entical to the version introduced in the 109th congress except it did not reference irc 2055 2106 2522 and 4955 nor did it include the clarification concerning c hurch leaders while this version did not provide an exception from the 4955 tax it would seem from practical standpoint that this difference between the two versions could be insignificant because many of the activities permitted under the bills would have little or associated expenditures hr 4520 108th congress the provision in hr 4520 former section 692 safe harbor for churches was only br iefly in the bill before the house ways and means committee struck it by unanimous consent it woul d have done several things first churches would not have been treated as participating in campaign activity solely because of their religious leaders private statements second churches that unintentionally intervened in political campaign would not have lost their taxexempt status or eligibility to receive deductible cont ributions unless the church or its religious lead ers had done so on more than three occasions during the year third unintentional violations of the 501c3 prohibition would have been subject to new excise tax if the chur ch had at least three unintentional violations during the year the tax would have equaled the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the churchs gross income contributi ons and gifts if the church had two violations then the tax would have equa led that amount divided by two if the church had one violation then the tax w ould have equaled th full amount divided by 52 the tax would have been reduced by any amount imposed under 4955 this bill was more restrictive than the others because it would have only permitted unintentional violations of the campaign prohibition and even those violations would have been fined thus this bill was specifically targeted at removing the risk that churches that inadvertently engaged in campaign activity could lose their taxexempt status as opposed to permitting churches to engage in such activity the impact of the provision addressing religious leaders private statements could be unclear because it could be interp reted as simply codifying existing law hr 2357 and s 2886 107th congress hr 2357 and s 2886 the houses of worship political speech protec tion act would have allowed 501c3 churches to engage in campaign activity so long as it was s ubstantial part of churchs activities s 2886 but not h r 2357 clarified that the bill would not allow disbursements for electioneering communications not permitted under feca hr 2357 received floor vote on octobe r 2 2002 and failed to pass by vote of 178 to 239 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32973crs7 28 see discussion supra note 6the substantial part test which is currently used to measure 501c3 organizations lobbying activities is flexible standard28 thus the bills would have required each church to be judged on casebycase basis as to whether its campaign activities were substantial part of its activities churches would have been allowed to engage in any type of campaign activity however the 4955 tax could have discouraged churches from conducting activities with associated taxable expenditures it could be unclear the extent to which the bills would have permitted churches to establish 527f3 separate segregated funds without overstepping the substantial part rule churches would have still been subject to applicable campaign finance laws hr 2931 107th congress under hr 2931 the brightline act of 2001 church would only have violated the campaign prohibition if it normally made expenditures for campaign activity in excess of 5 of its gross revenues lobbying expenditures could not have norma lly exceeded 20 of its gross revenues and the church could not ve normally spent more than 20 of its gross revenues on campaign and lobbying activities combine d the bill did not define the term normally the bill would have permitted churches to routinely engage in any type of campaign activity without risking their taxexempt status so long as their expenditures for such activities did not normally exceed the limits thus in practice or lowcost campaign activ ities could have b een conducted almost without limit churches would have b een allowed to occasionally engage in campaign activity in excess of the limits so long as this did not normally happen it could be unclear the extent to which chur ch would have been able to establish 527f3 separate segregated fund under th bill and still comply with the 5 limit any campaign activity would have been subj ect to the applicable campaign finance laws
