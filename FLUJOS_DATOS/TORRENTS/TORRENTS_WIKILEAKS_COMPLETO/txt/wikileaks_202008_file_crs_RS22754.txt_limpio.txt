though nsses have been conducted since 1998 congress has only appropriated funding specifically for general nsse fund since fy2006 congress has however appropriated funding for four specific nsses the first two were the 2004 democratic and republican presidential nominating conventions in boston ma and new york city ny respectively the final two will be the 2008 democratic and republican nominating conventions in denver co and minneapolis st paul mn respectively the 108th congress appropriated total of 100 million for presidential nominating convention security at these two events12 this 100 million was administered through the department of justices doj edward byrne memorial state and local enforcement assistance programs the byrne programs doj used the 12 in pl 108287 an act making appropriations for the department of defense for the fiscal year ending september 30 2005 and for other purposes sec 11002 congress appropriated 25 million for boston and 25 million for new york city presidential nominating convention security and in pl 108199 an act making appropriations for agriculture rural development food and drug administration and related agencies for the fiscal year ending september 30 2004 and for other purposes sec 103 congress appropriated 50 million for the 2004 presidential nominating conventions crs5 majority of this funding to reimburse state and local law enforcement entities for overtime costs because usss did not have mechanism to reimburse state and local law enforcement entities for nsse security costs13 federal funding for national special security events nsse costs incurred by federal state and local entities is one issue congress may wish to address in fy2008 congress appropriated 1 million for nsse costs within the secret service14 in addition the 110th congress appropriated total of 100 million for the 2008 presidential nominating conventions security this 100 million is to be administered through department of justices doj office of justice programs and this appropriation is to be used for security and related costs incurred by state and local governments including overtime associated with these two nsses15 some might argue that the 1 million congress has appropriated for nsses in fy2008 may not be adequate to fund unexpected nsse expenditures such as the funeral of former president the amount appropriated could be additionally problematic considering that the secret service is not authorized to reimburse state and local law enforcement entities overtime costs associated with nsses any security costs incurred httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22754 by the secret service could be funded with appropriations specifically designated for the agency whereas federal reimbursement of any security costs incurred by state and local jurisdictions would have to be appropriated through other federal assistance programs such as the 100 million appropriated for the 2008 presidential nominating conventions through dojs office of justice programs congress might consider establishing program within secret service that not only provides the agency with additional funds for unexpected nsse security costs but also authorizes the secret service to reimburse state and local law enforcement entities for security costs presently state and local jurisdictions can use dhs grants such as the state homeland security grant program shsgp and the urban area security initiative uasi for nsse security activities the grant approval process for these programs however is not flexible so the programs have limited application to nsses states and localities would need to plan shsgp and uasi funding for nsse security annually in their grant applications for unexpected nsses which may be the result of an unexpected death of president or change in location of planned nsse states and localities are unable to plan use shsgp or uasi funds to in advance for security costs dhs does authorize states and localities to reprogram shsgp and uasi funding with the dhs secretarys approval however that may result in states and localities not funding other planned homeland security activities 13 us department
