equipment for the use of the tccs rwanda senegal ghana burkina fasso and malawi freight and logistics costs are to be offered for both air and surface freight for each country vehicles are to fit within the technical specifications and restrictions outlined in the document tcc equipment support dpko mods as supplied this docum ent sets out the minimum standards for the vehicles of each type to be deployed and calls for quotationsupply of six months of spare parts for each vehicle but does not specify what level or number of spare parts are to be supplied outline of proposal this proposal will be divided into various sections 11 outline of total vehicular and equipment list requested in toto indicating those items on which osprea logistics ltd is bidding 12 pricing of 21 broken down into type of product sections with options for each item where appropriate and fob prices the freight logistics element will follow in due course 13 information in 22 regrouped country by country 14 weights and dimensions of all items grouped by country and then summarised 15 technical data shee ts for items proposed assumptions owing to the somewhat sparse nature of the specifications and item descriptions supplied we have assumed not the cheapest product in each case nor the best irrespective of price but selection based on value for money long term service life and in field reparability furthermore wherever possible with the vehicles we have for those same reasons opted for family advantage in other words vehicles to fulfil different roles but which are based on the same essential ch assis and drive chains in order to maximise cost effective servicing ease of maintenance training and reduction of ongoing spare parts costs we have not assumed the provision of air conditioning units run flat tyres nor machine gun mounts in the armou red vehicles but will provide quotes for those items as optional extras while we have been requested to supply air and surface freight costs and will endeavour to do so we have also assumed from the proposed deployment that sufficient lead times on all but the first two countries would allow for the more cost effective surface option to be preferred we have further assumed that ghana and burkina fasso can be treated as one in relation to logistics planning we have also assumed given the number of vehi cles required and in the interests of keeping costs down that reconditioned vehicles can be supplied for ambulances 25 and 5 ton utility vehicles and military pattern mobile workshops and recoveries all force protection vehicles will

basic force protection fp armoured vehicle will be the casspir mkii mine protected vehicle this vehicle can be configured as personnel carrier command post ambulance or recovery vehicle ambulance for use as an ambulance the casspir will be fully equipped by specialist company of ambulances fitters with capacity for two litters per vehicle recovery vehicle the casspir configured as recovery vehicle is excellent at its job of safe extraction of crippled apc however since its hull weig ht naturally restricts its lifting capacity to vertical lift of 33 of its own weight or 3 tons and its draglift to 10 tons if the towed vehicle has one axel usable we would therefore recommend the addition of set of dolly wheels onto which the rear end of the stricken vehicle can be loaded for towing purposes if its own wheels cannot be used the alternative for full vehicle liftdrag would be 6x6 vehicle with 15 ton capacity the samil 100 which can be supplied with armoured cab and engin bay but this is much more expensive option we will also quote for the samil 50 4x4 recovery with armoured cab and engine bay which has the same lifting capacity as the casspir but is considerably cheaper options in addition to the basic vehicle we will also quote for air conditioning units run flat tyres and machine gun mounts as optional extras webasto air conditioning units recommended would be 2 units per apc but one will also suffice leaving room for the roof mounted machine gun mounting run flat tyres available either full run flat tyre or as run flat system which gives the vehicle 50km at 50kph following main tread or side wall puncture it works by resealing the tyre with composite epoxy permanently injected into the wheel c avity we will be opting for very economical but sound run flat tyre from brazil swivelling gun mount the swivelling gun mount is an inexpensive add on giving the gunner sitting normally in the vehicles passenger seat the possibility to manipulate the roof mounted machine gun without exposing himself to enemy fire the gun swivels in mount set into the roof and is controlled by series of interconnecting levels similar to handle bars giving him upward downward and rotating motion the gun is aimed by means of sight mounted at eye level which is presighted to align with the weapon vision is out the windows and windscreen of the vehicle for an additional cost swivelling seat can be included for ease of use support vehicle options amb ulances the stated required vehicle is the landrover 109 ambulance while we understand the wisdom of this choice owing to the vehicle unparalleled reputation for reliability long service life and proven tack record we have come to the conclusion that it is impractical to be able to find 30 serviceable units in good enough condition this vehicle ceased manufacture in the 1970s without having to engage in major rebuild process which time would not allow for as result we have chosen the unimog mbulance which has long proven track record with the german and austrian armies is readily available and being mercedes benz unimog shares many parts with both the 1017 mercedes benz 5 ton truck the unimog 25 ton cargo vehicle and also the casspir apc the drive chain and engine of which are also mercedes benz based jeep 4x4 toyota landcruiser hj79 these we are quoting for new delivery time permitting for the shorter delivery time countries we may have to offer proven second hand vehicles tcc proposal document spring 2008 page 5 of 29 truck utilitycargo 15 24 tons 4x4 unimog 25 ton 4x4 cargo carrier compatibility with other mb drive chains reducing running and services costs and providing world renowned light 4x4 truck truck utilitycargo 25 5 tons 4x4 we offer two options for this vehicle mercedes benz 1017 4x4 cargo vehicle which is available at relatively short notice and in large numbers from europe and africa and which can be fitted as mobile workshop and tanker also offers compatibility with other mb chass is and drive chains samil 50 4x4 75 ton cargo vehicle this is an economical vehicle of proven reliability and appropriateness to african conditions maintenance truck medium daf1800 4x4 daf is not recommended option as procuring of spare parts on the african continent is more difficult and expensive than is the case with mercedes benz or samil mercedes be nz 1017 base units with load binsworkshops units and tools supplied from south africa these workshops units would be bolt on and would be shipped to destination countries to be mounted in situ we believe would provide significant cost saving in relation to supplying the tools and equipment out of europe samil 50 4x4 base vehicles which are cheaper than the mb1017s and would be compatib with the recovery vehicles either armoured cabs in the force protection role or under the recovery vehicle section truck recovery bedford mj 4x4 while bedford has solid record the service and spare parts infrastructure is poor in africa samil 50 4x4 this is the ideal recovery for african use with lifting capacity of 5 tons and more it is proven in africa has solid and dependable serviceability and has been the workhorse of the south african army and african mining and off haulage indu stry for many years samil 100 6x6 as per the samil 50 but 6 wheel drive and capable of liftingtowing 16 ton vehicles support equipment light cargo single axle 5x8 the lack of detailed specifications makes this an extremely difficult item to quote ideally we would need to know the load that is expected to be carried by the trailer and the

will therefore offer three different options covering varying degrees of ruggedness and price medium cargo single axle 5x12 the lack of detailed specifications make this an extremely difficult item to

water trailer 2000 to 7000 litres gm tumpeco 3000l wpump vital element of specifying what would be minimum of 3 ton trailer is to know what vehicle will be towing it and therefore the available of air brake systems the height and type of tow hook and the rim and wheel size without this information we will have to quote for standard trailer and we will do so in range of sizes and tcc proposal document spring 2008 page 6 of 29 configurations but it must be noted that the quote will be adjusted either up or down once we are provided the information above we will therefore offer different

tan or white 10m x 36 with mosquito walls shade cloth as optional extra pvc flooring as optional extra important note it is our considered opinion that this tent is not recommended 10x36m tent has an enormous roof and the entire ten t weighs 500kg it is extremely unwieldy and may require forklift trucks and so forth in order to erect it it may be better to look at larger number of smaller tent 5x5m or 5x10m which have interchangeable parts and in combination are in fact cheaper than the 10mx36m tent for example 5x10m tent will sleep approximately 15 20 men hence 3 tents would accommodate 50 men plus three 5x10m tents are cheaper than one 50 man tent similarly one 10x5 and one 15x5 would accommodate approximately 50 man and is cheaper than the 3 10x5s 30 man tent double framed wmosquito nets tan or white 5m x 15 with mosquito walls shade cloth as optional extra pvc flooring as optional extra 10x5 m tents with flooring tan or white hip tent with mosquito walls including flooring shade netting as optional extra 3x3 m tents with flooring tan or white standard bell tent with flooring as used by south african military we will be offering tents from two different companies and t he prices will be shown in the category price lists however to quote for all the options of tents for the relevant tccs will be impractical so we will take the cheapest figures for those tables note until such time as we have more detailed informati on on the usage of the tents and especially how many square metres are allocated for each person and whether they will be sleeping in single cots or in bunks it is difficult for us to assess the best configuration of tents for your purposes bpvs level iv level iii vests with ceramic panels to raise to level iv tcc proposal document spring 2008

the above prices where the are various options with which to fulfil specific requirement we have by and large aimed at an average position prices for samil 50s have been averaged between the three different production versions we have as result the prices of the samil 50 could come down considerably see notes on utility vehicles pricing under chart xyz depending on how many and how quickly they are ordered as the runners are limited in stock similarly for trailers and tents it is not practical to calculate all possible permutations of choice this will be done when the client has refined the selection based on the specification refinement and usa ge clarification where possible especially with tents and trailers we have tried to offer range of price and quality all prices are subject to negotiation and further discussion and refinement of the clients required is not just welcomed but asked f or training it is normal for us to offer training to the mechanics who will have to maintain the armoured vehicles this is recommended for the long service life of the vehicle and to increase efficiency we would offer to train 2 mechanics from each co untry receiving apcs to be present during the entire 3 week build process of one vehicle thus studying the complete process from the ground up this offer will include board lodging and training but not flights to and from nor spending money we lso recommend similar programme for training drivers of the vehicles owing the large numbers that could be involved we would limit our contribution to 10 drivers with any additional drivers be charged for at 120 per day again return flights and spen ding money not included to follow on from this presentation we will be sending 1 data sheets for any items listed but for which data sheets have not been prepared 2 further and better details on trailers 3 costing elements to the logistics package this quotation is good for 30 days is open to negotiation and constitutes preliminary offer tcc proposal document spring 2008 page 16 of 29 spare parts as an integral part of the rfq an offer of six months of spare parts was called for we are working on the detail of this but it is extremely difficult to determine however because the majority of our vehicle selections are based on mercedes benz parts we are presenting list of the normal usage of spare parts in 12 months for group of 10 casspirs operating in theatre the casspir is based on the mb1517 chassis and drive train they will also serve as guide to the usage of spare parts in the other mb trucks for which we are quoting mb1017 in the main it is normal as rule of thumb to allocate 15 of the price of the vehicles to the provision of spare parts for 6 12 month period freighting of spare parts will be calculated on 15 of

will be emphasised for the autumn deployment assuming sufficient lead time is given by the customer to enable this to happen roadsurface freight will be offered for the vehicular aspect of the rwandan deployment as the air freighting of some 224 vehicles will be extremely expensive we will however offer an airfreight price per ten vehicles to cater for the need to deliver at least some vehicles within shorter time frame miscellaneous freight items for simple reasons it is not nece ssarily practical or possible to calculate the weights and dimensions of certain large number small size items these items include principally spare parts tools workshop equipment any of the optional extras within the force protection section for t he purposes of freight cost estimation we will calculate the value of the freight as being 15 of the fob value of these items this figure will be adjusted up or down once the freight invoices have been calculated caveat it is extremely difficult to get accurate
