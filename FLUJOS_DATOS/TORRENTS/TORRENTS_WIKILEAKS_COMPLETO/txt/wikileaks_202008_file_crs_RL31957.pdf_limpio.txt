trade divisionnonproliferation and threat reduction assistance us programs in the former soviet union summary congress passed the nunnlugar amendment authorizing us threat reduction assistance to the former soviet union in november 1991 after failed coup in moscow and the disintegration of the soviet union raised concerns about the safety and security of soviet nuclear weapons the annual program has grown from 400 million in the dod budget around 11 billion across three agencies dod doe and the state department it has also evolved from an emergency response to impending chaos in the soviet union to more comprehensive threat reduction and nonproliferation effort to broader program seeking to keep nuclear chemical and biological weapons from leaking out of th former soviet union and into the hands of rogue nations or terrorist groups the department of defense manages the cooperative threat reduction ctr program which provides russia ukraine belarus and kazakhstan with assistance in transporting storing and dismantling nuclear chemical and biological weapons us assistance has helped these nations eliminate the delivery systems for nuclear weapons under the start i treaty secure weapons storage areas construct storage facility for nuclear materials rem oved from weapons cons truct destruction facility for chemical weapons and s ecure biological weapons materials the state department manages the in ternational science and technology centers in moscow and kiev these centers provide research grants to scientists and engineers so that they will not sell thei r knowledge to other nations or terrorist groups the state department has also provided assistance with export and border control programs in the former soviet st ates the department of energy manages programs that seek to improve the security of nuclear materials at civilian naval and nuclear weapons complex facilities it also funds programs that help nuclear scientists and engineers find employment in commercial enterprises doe is also helping russia dispose of plutonium rem oved from nuclear weapons and shutdown its remaining plutoniumproducing reactors by replacing them with fossilfuel plants analysts have debated numerous issues related to us nonproliferation and threat reduction assistance these include questions bout the coordination of and priority given to these programs in the us government questions about russias willingness to provide the united states with access to its weapons facilities questions about the presidents ability to wa ive certification requirements so that the programs can go forward and questions about the need to expand the efforts into global program that receives funding fro m numerous nations and possibly extends assistance to others outside the

soviet union 3 the term spent in this statement refers to the amount of money appropriated for threat reduction and nonproliferation programs the am ount of money actually paid to contractors for the work covered by these programs is less than the appropriated amount because many projects take years to complete and payments may occur years after the money is appropriated 4 the white house office

programs in the former soviet union introduction in the budget submitted for fy2008 congress authorized around 13 billion for us programs that provide nonprolif eration and threat reduction assistance to russia and the other states of the former soviet union1 the administration has requested around 11 billion for these programs in its fy2009 budget including 4141 million for dods cooperative threat reduction ctr program 572 million for the department of energys doe nonproliferation programs in russia and around 110 million for state department nonproliferation programs in the former soviet union2 with these programs the united states seeks to help the recipient nations transport store and liminate nuclear chemical and other weapons secure and eliminate the materials used in nuclear chemical and biological weapons and prevent proliferation of the knowle dge needed to produce these weapons to nations or groups outside the former s oviet union since fy1992 the united states has appropriated nearly 10 b illion across these three agen cies for these programs3 president bush has often voiced support for these programs in november 2001 the white house noted that the united states is committed to strong effective cooperation with russia and the other states emerging from the former soviet union to reduce weapons of mass struction and prevent the pr oliferation of these weapons or the material and expe rtise to develop them4 at the usrussian summit in may 2002 the united states and russia pledged to continue cooperativ threat reductioncrs2 5 the white house office of

passed after the september 11 2001 attacksprograms and expand efforts to redu ce weaponsusable fissile material5 at their summit meeting in bratislava in february 2005 presidents bush and putin again agreed to enhance their cooperation in securing nuclear weapons and materials6 furthermore in june 2002 the president jo ined with the leaders of the g8 nations to create the g8 global partnership agains t the spread of weapons and materials of mass destruction as is discussed in more detail later in this report under this partnership the united states has co mmitted to provide up to 10 billion over 10 years to pursue nonproliferation and threat reduction programs in russia and the other former soviet states this amount of 1 billion per year roughly equals current us expenditures on threat reduc tion and nonprolifer ation programs congress has also supported us nonproliferation and threat reduction programs in the former sovi et states although some members have questioned the value and effectiveness of some specific projects congress has authorized most of the funds requested by the executive branch in the years since these programs began congress has also helped shape the progra ms prohibiting funding for some types of projects and providing dded funding for others many analysts have questioned however whether the united states is doing all that it can to prevent the leakage of knowledge wea pons nd materials from the former soviet states in its first budget submission in early 2001 the bush administration reduced funding for the dod threat reduction programs by nearly 10 and cut more than 100 million out of does defense nuclear nonproliferation programs funding category that incl udes us nonproliferation assistance to russia7 the administration increased funding for these programs in fy2003 fy2004 and fy2006 but its budget for fy2005 and fy2007 for the dod threat reduction programs again showed 10 decrease even with increases in doe budgets some analysts argue that when combined with declines in the dod budget the funding falls short of what is need ed to address the continuing dangers of proliferation from the former soviet states further they note that the administration has begun to shift funding away from prog rams that secure w eapons and materials in the former soviet states and into pr ograms that provide border security and assistance to greater number of nati ons around the world consequently they argue if the funding level does not grow the united states will not be able to accelerate the programs with the former soviet union to ensure that they effectively stop the proliferation of russias wea pons materials and knowledge these concerns are evident in the congre ssional action on the fy2008 budget which includes increases in several of the thr eat reduction and nonpro liferation programs many analysts cite as further evidence of the administrations wavering commitment its failure to certify russia for threat reduction funding in fy2002 thecrs3 8 the certification is only required for dod programs and some state department programs the absence of certification did not affect doe programsadministration stated that it could not certify russias compliance with its obligations under the biological and che mical weapons conventions this finding delayed several ong oing programs8 the administration asked congress to allow it to waive the certification requirements this debate is discussed in more detail later in this report so that funding could tinue but for many analysts this episode demonstrated that the administration had not placed the highest priority on nonproliferation and threat re duction programs in spite of its declarations about stopping proliferation to keep weapons of mass destruction away from terrorists at issue in the debate over us thr eat reduction and nonpro liferation programs is not only the total amount of funding that the united states might commit to these programs in the former soviet states but also the priority and sense of urgency that the united states assigns to them furthe r congress has identified the expansion of these programs as one of the key steps that might be taken to implement the 911 commission reports recommenda tions legislation prepared for consideration early in the 110th congress indicates that among the steps that should be taken to implement the 911 commission recommendati ons the united states should ease the process of expanding these programs to other nations outside the former soviet states both the house and the senate are also poised to eliminate the certification requirements entirely in their versions of the fy2008 defense authorization bills many studies have offere d recommendations for the size shape and operation of these programs that differ from the pproaches taken by the clinton and bush administrations this report summarizes many issues raised in these reports and in congressional debates on the future of us nonprolifer ation and threat reduction assistance however it first reviews the history of these programs describing their origins in 1991 their expansion and evolution during the 1990s and the changes in their direction during the first two years of the bush administration the report also provides broad summary of many of the program ar eas and projects supported by us funding background the nunnlugar amendment congress initiated us thr eat reduction and nonprolifer ation assistance to the soviet union in november 1991 failed coup in moscow in august 1991 and the subsequent disintegration of the soviet union had raised concerns about the safety and security of soviet nuclear weapons consequently sena tors nunn and lugar proposed an amendment to the implementin g legislation for the conventional armed forces in europe cfe treaty pl 102228 the senate passe d the legislation by vote of 868 the house adopted it through the conference report this amendment titled the soviet nuclear thr eat reduction act of 1991 authorized the use of 400 million in fy1992 defense departme nt dod funds to assist the soviet union and its successor entities with efforts to 1 destroy nuclear wea ponscrs4 9 for more information on this legislation see crs report 94985 the nunnlugar program for soviet weapons dismantle ment background and implementation by theodor galdi

weapons and other weapons 2 tr ansport store disable and safeguard weapons in connection with their destructi on and 3 establish verifiable safeguards against the proliferation of such weapons9 senators arguing in support of the pr ogram including senators nunn lugar and biden emphasized the potential risks inhere nt in the soviet collapse they noted that the disintegration of the soviet union created the danger that the ultimate disposition of nuclear weapons in the ne w political system will not be conducive to their safety or international stability particularly if the weapons remained in several of the former soviet republics these senators also warned of danger of seizure theft sale or use of nuclear weapons or components particul arly if widespread disintegration in the custodial system should occur and third they argued that any weakening of control over weapons and co mponents could spill outside the territory of the former soviet union fuelin g nuclear proliferation worldwide10 senator nunn further warned that we are on the verge of either having the greatest destruction of nuclear weapons in the histor of the world or the greatest proliferation of nuclear weapons nuclear materials and scientific know how on how to make these weapons as well as chemical wea pons ballistic missiles even biological weapons the world has ever seen11 senators who supported this legislation so emphasized that by targeting us defense resources at the prompt safe dismantlement of nuclear and chemical weapons in the soviet arsenal12 this assistance would embody new approach to enhancing our national security an approach which f its dramatically new national security environment13 senator biden further stated that through this legislation the united states would be assisting ourse lves not the soviet union but others questioned this characterization they vi ewed the proposed assi stance to the soviet union as foreign aid which they opposed nd argued that the united states should instead use its defense resources to fund its own military and national security needs furthermore some argued that in provi ding assistance to the soviet union the united states would allow the soviet uni on to divert its own resources away from the protection and dismantleme nt of its older weapons nd towards the development and production of new weapons that could create new thr eats to the united states14 members have raised these themes on numerous occasions over the years debating whether us nonproliferation and threat reduction assistance is foreign aid programcrs5 that provides benefits primarily to the reci pients or security program that provides benefits to both the united states and th former states of the soviet union initially congress used the dod budget to fund us threat reduction assistance to the former soviet states in 1993 dod began to refer to this effort as the cooperative threat reduction ctr progra m experts from other agencies such as the state department and department of energy participated in the projects when their expertise was required in fy1997 these agencies each took budgetary and management responsibility for the proj ects that relied on their expertise consequently although many analysts nd observers still use the title cooperative threat reduction program wh referring to the full range of us nonproliferation programs this is longer accurate this report only uses the term ctr when referring to the threat reduction programs funded by the departme nt of defense it uses the phrase threat reduction and nonprolif eration assistance to refer to the full range of programs in dod doe and state slow start when congress created the ctr progra m many members and experts outside government seemed to envision relatively simple program where officials from the united states would travel to the four form er soviet states w ith nuclear weapons on their territories russia ukraine belarus and kazakhstan to quickly safeguard and help dismantle nuclear chemical and other weapons but the programs implementation was far slower and more complex than many expected first the need to develop and impleme nt coordinated po licies among severa l us government agencies primarily dod doe and the state department nd within several organizations in the pentagon slowed pr ogram implementation furthermore the united states had to negotiate umbrella agreements with each recipient nation setting out the privileges and immunities of us personnel and to establishing the legal and customs framework for the provi sion of aid before it could spend any money in the former soviet states lingering mistrust between the parties along with the high level of secrecy surrounding russias nuclear and chemical weapons programs complicated this process in 1992 and 1993 during its first few years in office the clinton administration sought to resolve the bureaucratic issues that had delayed the program it offered broader political support to cooperative rela tionship with russia through high level commission chaired by vice president gore and russias prime minister chernomyrdin this commission identified many efforts that later received funding through the ctr program the clinton administration also provided significant policy and financial support to the ctr program overcoming th reticence that had been expressed by some officials in the first bush administration consequently it succeeded in sharply increasing the rate of expenditu res on ctr projects by the mid1990s with the administrations support and with c ontinuing congressional interest in the program us threat reduc tion and nonproliferation assi stance began to expand and evolve it expanded to several agencies with doe and the state department each funding nonproliferation efforts in the form er soviet union it also expanded to include broader range of programs where it had first focused on improving transportation security and helping with the destruction of strategic offensive nuclear weapons it grew to include wide range of efforts to secure and destroy nuclearcrs6 15 see for example us department of defense cooperative threat reducti on april 1995 washington dc p 1 16 the march 1995 nerve agent attack in the tokyo subway system by the aum shinryo cult raised the profile of this type of threat 17 the report went on to state that unless protected from theft of diversion the former soviet arsenal of weapons of mass destruction threatens to become goldmine for wouldbe proliferators

these weapons and the knowledge needed to design and produce these weapons it has also expanded financially from an initial vel of approximate ly 400 million per year to total of nearly 1 billion per year across the three agencies an evolving program initially many in congress saw us assistance under nunnlugar as an emergency response to impending chaos in the soviet union even after the sense of immediate crisis passed in 1992 nd 1993 many analysts and members of congress remained concerned about the potential for dive rsion or loss of control of nuclear and other weapons russia s economy was extremely weak and press accounts reported that nuclear materials from russia were appearing on the black market in western europe consequently many began to view ctr as part of longterm threat reduction nd nonproliferation effort fo rmer secretary of defense william perry referred to ctr as defense by other means15 as the program helped eliminate soviet weapons that had threatened the united states and contain weapons and materials that could pose new thr eats in the hands of other nations by the mid1990s many observers also began to view us assistance to the former soviet states as part of the effort to keep weapons of mass destruction away from terrorists in 1996 experts testifie d to congress that russian nuclear and chemical facilities with their crumbling s ecurity and lack of accounting procedures could provide source for terrorists seekin g nuclear or chemical materials in response congress expanded the programs that provided security at facilities with nuclear materials and suggested that more attention be paid to security at facilities with materials that could be used in chemical or biological weapons16 in january 2001 task force sponsored by the departme nt of energy stated that the most urgent unmet national security threat to the united states today is the danger that weapons of mass destruction or weaponsusable materials in russia could be stolen and sold to terrorists or hostile nation stat and used against american troops abroad or citizens at home17 since september 11 2001 virtually all analysts who follow us threat reduction and nonpr oliferation assistance have made the link between the possible quest for weapons of mass destru ction by terrorists and the potential for thwarting them by helping russia protect its weapons materials and knowledge18crs7 18 continued and chemical weapons and materials should be the central organizing principle on security for the 21st century remarks by former us senator sam nunn chairman nuclear

arly attractive to terrorists for details see crs report rs21528 terrorist dirty bombs brief primer by jonathan medalia 21 for more detailed description of the chan ges in the legislative mandate for the ctr program see crs report 971027 f nunnlugar cooperative threat reduction programs issues for congress by amy f woolfthe bush administration has also linked us threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance to the former so viet states to us efforts to keep weapons of mass destruction away from terrori sts in early 2003 it stated that it had expanded the strategic focus of the ctr program to support the war on terrorism19 in its budgets presented between fy2004 and fy2007 it increased funding for several export and border control programs for programs designed to stem the leakage of knowledge out of the former sovi et union and for an effort to find and recover radiological sources type of military device that could provide terrorists with nuclear materials for use in dirty bomb20 all of these initiatives focus more on stemming pro liferation than on eliminatin g nuclear weapons in the former soviet states but it did not completely lose the initial focus in february 2005 at the bratislava summit presidents bush and putin agreed to accelerate some of the efforts to secure sovietera nuclear weapons as is noted below this agreement has shifted add itional funding into some of the dod ctr projects department of defense cooperative threat reduction program program objectives at its inception the ctr program sought to provide russia ukraine belarus and kazakhstan with assistance in the safe and secure transportation storage and dismantlement of nuclear weapons during the first few years the mandate for us assistance expanded to include efforts to secure materials that might be used in nuclear or chemical weapons to prevent the diversion of scientif ic expertise from the former soviet union to expand militaryto military contacts between officers in the united states and the former soviet union and to f acilitate the militarization of defense industries21 in 1994 congress also indicat ed that threat reduction funds could be used to assist in environmental restoration at former military sites and to provide housing for former military officers who had been demobilized as result of the dismantling of strategic offensive w eapons the 104th congress reversed this position however banning the use of ctr funds for environmen tal restoration orcrs8 22 us department of defense coopera tive threat reduction april 1995 washington dc p 4 23 dod has used ctr funds for this purpose in several instances for example in november 1997 the united states purchased 21 nuclearcapable mig29 aircraft from the republic of moldova before moldava could sell these aircraft to nation seeking nuclear delivery capabilities in april 1998 using ctr funds the united states and great britain moved 88 pounds of highly enriched uranium and 176 pounds of highly radioactive spent fuel from nuclear reactor outside tbilisi georgia to dounreay scotland 24 the white house fact sheet administ ration review of nonproliferation and threat reduction assistance to the russian federation december 11 2001housing for military officers it also nied additiona l funding for the defense enterprise fund which focu sed on demilitarizing former soviet defense industries by the mid1990s congress and the clinton administration had agreed on mandate for the ctr program that focused on the core objectives of securing and dismantling nuclear and chemical weapons along with protecting against the proliferation of knowledge and materials that might be used in the production of these weapons by other nations the c linton administration outlined this mandate in four key objectives for the ctr program destroy nuclear chemical and ot her weapons of mass destruction transport store disable and sa feguard these weapons in connection with their destruction establish verifiable safeguards against the proliferation of these weapons their components and weaponsusable materials and prevent the diversion of scientific expertise that could contribute to weapons programs in other nations22 in the late 1990s congress added funds to the ctr budget for biological weapons proliferation prevention this ffort has expanded substantially in recent years congress also expanded the ctr pr ogram to allow the use of ctr funds for emergency assistance to remove weapons of mass destruction or materials and equipment related to these weapons fro m any of the former soviet republics23 its first budget in fy2002 the bush administration reduced ctr funding by nearly 10 from over 440 million to 403 milli on it also began review of all us threat reduction and nonpr oliferation assistance to ru ssia and the former soviet states stating that it sought to ensure that existing us c ooperative nonproliferation programs with russia are focused on prio rity threat reducti on and nonproliferation goals and are conducted as efficiently and as effectively as possible24 s m analysts welcomed the review noting that it could provide an opportunity to revise and expand some programs but others feared the review would lead to reductions in funding and the eliminati on of some programs crs9 25 ibid 26 the reduced request for fy2004 reflects in part the presence of unexpended balances from fy2003 the united states did not spend th funds because it could not initiate any new contracts during the period after the pres ident did not certify russia for participation in the ctr program and before congress allo wed the president to waive the certification requirement see statement of dr jd crouch ii march 4 2003 p 4 27 us house committee on armed services st atement of dr jd crouch ii assistant secretary of defense for international security policy march 4 2003 p 4 the continuedwhen it announced the results of the review the administration stated that it found that most us programs to assist russia in threat reduction and nonproliferation work well are focused on priority tasks nd are well managed25 but the review did signal shift in th focus of us nonproliferation and threat reduction assistance instead of highlighting projects aimed at the elimination of nuclear weapons the administration indicat ed that it would expand some projects that focused on chemical and biolog ical weapons nonproliferation including increasing funding for the construction of controversial chemical weapons destruction facility in russia for many th is change seemed to be natural response in the postseptember 11 environment to growing concerns about the potential link between terrorism and weapons of mass struction others however saw it as retreat from the longstanding core objectives of the ctr program the administration confirmed this shift in focus with the release of its fy2004 budget request for ctr where the ad ministration request ed and received 50 million in fy2002 and around 133 million in fy 2003 for the construction of the chemical weapons destruc tion facility in russia it requested and congress authorized 2003 million in fy2004 this is nearly 45 of the total ctr budget request the administration also incr eased funding for biological weapons proliferation prevention from 17 million in fy2002 to around 55 million in fy2003 and 542 million for fy2004 in contrast funding for strategic offensive arms elimination in russia declined from 1334 million in fy2002 to 701 million in fy2003 and 576 million in fy200426 furthermore in testimony before the house armed services committee jd crouch the assistant secretary of defense for international security policy stated that the administration had revised the f our key objectives for ctr the program now seeks to dismantle fsu former soviet union wmd weapons of mass destruction and associated infrastructure consolidate and secure fsu wm d and related technology and materials increase transparency and encour age higher standards of conduct support defense and military coope ration with the objective of preventing proliferation27crs10 27 continued administration has formally incorporated these objectives into its planning for and reporting on the ctr program see us department of defense fy2006 ctr annual report to congress december 31 2004 p 1 28 this trend with the house approving less than the president requested and the senate approving the presidents request continued for several years for details see crs report 971027 nunnlugar cooperative threat reducti on programs issues for congress by amy f woolfalthough most ongoing ctr projects are consistent with these objectives the absence of any specific refere nce to the destruction of nuclear weapons is notable in addition by stating that the united stat seeks to encourage higher standards of conduct the bush administration has indicated that it will pl ace higher priority on russian openness cooperation and comp liance with arms control agreements this emphasis was evident in the administrations decision against certifying russia for ctr assistance in 2002 this also pres ents something of departure from the past when the united states raised issues of transparency openness and compliance with russia during private meetings but did not tie these issues directly to the goals of the ctr program ctr funding when congress first passed the nunnlugar amendment it authorized the transfer of 400 million in fy19 92 funds from other dod accounts for threat reduction activities in the former soviet ion few of these funds were spent in fy1992 so congress extended the transfer authority for fy1992 funds and authorized the transfer of an additional 400 million from other dod accounts in fy1993 in subsequent years the clint on administration reque sted and congress authorized new appropriations for the ctr program table 1 summarizes the amount of f unding the presidents requested for the ctr program and the amount authorized by congress in each of the fiscal years between 1992 and 2006 congress has authorized just over 6 billion for ctr since 1992 congress has approved the administrations request for ctr funding in most years but has added or reduced funding in some in fy1996 the new republican majority in the house questioned many ements of the ctr program and the house armed services committee reduced funding to 200 llion the senate had approved the administrations request and the conference committee agreed on compromise of 300

year and because russia did not yet appear committed to the elimina tion of its chemical weapons that the united states should not accel erate its efforts the conference report 107772 also limited f unding for sh chuchye to 50 million but it stated that the administration could use the remaining 836 fo r other projects related to the storage and elimination of nuclear w eapons or for chemical wea

budget between fy2004 and fy2005 this reduction in funding does not derive from any significan t policy debates about the project instead it occurred because the fy2004 budget included funding for one

account for the rising costs of construction materials in russia the conference committee approved 6 million for this project area allowing some wo rk to continue during fy2008 congress has also required that the secretary of defense submit report on the strategy and cost estimates for completing the shchcuchye project the administration again did not request any funding for shchcuchye in fy2009 in the past congress has subjected f unding for shchuchye to number of certifications for example it stated that the president must certify that russia is committed to providing at least 25 million per ear to help constr uct and operate the facility that russia was committed to destroying all its remaining nerve agent that other nations were committed to contributing to the construction of this facility and that russia is forthcoming with data ab out its chemical weapons stockpile the president requested that congress allow him to waive the certification requirement so that construction could continue even if russia has not met all the conditions congress provided the president with waiver authority but only for one year in the fy2003 defense au thorization bill pl

nations seeking nuclear weapons many of these scientists had worked in the soviet unions closed nuclear cities where they had enjoyed relatively high salaries and prestige but their jobs evaporated during russias economic and political crises in the early 1990s even thos scientists who retained their jobs saw their incomes decline sharply as russia was unable to pay their salaries for months at time in late 1992 the united states japan the european union and russia established the internationa l science and technology ce nter istc in moscow several other former soviet states jo ined the

the bush administration cited these centers for their achievements and i ndicated that it planned to expand them the state department has stated th at between 1994 and late 2002 about 50000 scientists

of the time most continue to work at their primary jobs in addition some of the grants go to research institutes in russia rather than directly to scientists and some of these funds may be used for administrative or management purposes nevertheless the income earned from even shortterm research projects may under mine incentives these individuals might otherwise encounter to sell their knowle

providing about 45 million of this tota l the united states has also provided around 70 million to the istc since fy1998 to support the biological weapons redirection program71 this program provides research grants to russian biotechnology institutes to redi rect scientists to commerc ial agricultural and public health projects the state department collaborates with several other us agencies in this program72 in recent years it has begun to shift grant funding away from russias nuclear scientists to biological and chemical weapons scientists thus re naming the program the biochem redirecti on program and to sc ientists from other former soviet states further it expects this decline in funding to force the istc to focus more on graduating scientists from us assistance to projects with more commercial viability73 the state department operates third program within this category known as the bio industry initiativ bii this initiative which began in 2002 seeks to help russia

program areas in fy2008 and 64 million in fy2009 analysts have raised numerous questi ons about the science center programs one of the first critiques came from the general accounting office in study published in 1995 gao found that some sc ientists who received grants from the istc may also continue to be employed by institutes engaged in weapons work76 gao interpreted this finding to mean that the centers had not succeeded in redirecting weapons scientists to p eaceful endeavors other critics of the ctr program claimed that gaos findings indi cated that by supporting russian weapons scientists us funds we re supporting russian weapons programs the state department disputed both of these conclusions noting that the grants from the istc were intended to supplement not replace th scientists income from work in other institutes and in the years since this re port the state depar tment has enhanced its auditing procedures to ensure that istc grants support the assigned projects and do not support work on russian weapons analysts have also noted that the is tc and stcu do not have enough money to support full pay for significant number of scientists cons equently some have questioned whether the centers achieve th eir objective of keeping these scientists away from nations or groups seeking weapons of mass destruction others however note that even if the financial support is less than complete the cooperation with russian institutes and the promise of fa irly steady stream of funding helps build relationships and draw these institutes into the western orbit77 to address this problem some have suggested that instead of providing shortterm grants the centers should focus on projects that w ill lead to the longterm redirection of scientists out of weapons work the stat department seems to agree with thiscrs29 78 us senate committee on foreign relations testimony of john s wolf assistant secretary of state for n onproliferation march 19 2003approach

soviet borders along with incentives created by the weakness in the economies of the newl independent states contributes to this growing concern the state department s export control and related border security assistance exbs program helps th former soviet stat and other nations improve their ability to interdict nuclear smuggling and stop the illicit trafficking of all materials for weapons of mass destruction along with dual use goods and technologies the exbs program currently has projects underway in more than 30 nations and is expanding its reach around the globe78 when designing nationspecific plan for border control assistance the united states seeks to address four key areas fi rst if needed it helps the recipient nation establish the legal and regulatory basis for effective export controls it then helps the nation develop appropr iate export licensing procedur and practices third the united states helps the recipient estab lish and enhance effective enforcement capabilities when needed it provides the recipient with detection and interdiction equipment and training finally the unite d states helps establish procedures that promote effective interaction between g overnment and industry so that business entities in the recipient nation will abide by the laws and regulations of the new export control regime the state department also provides s upport to border control efforts in dods ctr program and the does nonpr oliferation program it seeks to coordinate these and other us efforts to identify and st op the smuggling of nuclear chemical and biological weapons or materi als analysts inside and outside the government have questioned however whether th coordination has been eff ective consequently the national security council is leading an effo rt to develop governmentwide strategic plan for interdiction assistance which includes but is not limited to export assistance that might help stop the smugglin g of weapons of mass destruction

with russian officials on assistance to secure nuclear materials but these governmenttogovernment negotiations proceeded slowly in part because russias nuclear energy ministry known as minatom at the

congre ss added 10 million to this request in the fy2006 defense authorization act pl 109163 the administration requested an additional 168 million for this program area in fy2007 doe reports that the

have expressed growing concerns about the possibility that terrorists might acquire nuclear materials that could be used in dirty bomb although such device would not explode with nuclear yield it could nonetheless spread radiological debris across wide area many nations around the world have nuclear materials at research facilities hospitals or power plants that could be used in dirty bomb but most analysts agree that the states of the former soviet union pose greater threat in this regard particularly since the soviet union left devices with radioactive materials scattered across its territory according to spencer abraham the secretary of energy more attention is being paid to the risks associated with the misuse of radiological materials because they are much more abundant and much less secure than weaponsgrade materials95 consequently doe developed program to identify these sites set priorities and begin security upgrades this program received its initial funding in fy2002

the projects had not ye t produced any commercial successes doe responded by stating that iap had temporar ily employed thousands of scientists in around 170 institutes doe also stated that the program did not subsidize scientists who were performing weaponsrelated wo rk nevertheless in fy2000 congress reduced the clinton administrations reque st for funding for the iap program from 30 million to 25 million and specified that more than 35 of the funds be spent at the us labs it also mandated that the united states negotiate agreements with russia to ensure that funds provided under this program are not subject to taxes in russia furthermore it requested that the secretary of energy review iap programs for their commercialization potential the ipp program was once again the subject of critical gao report in late 200799 this report noted that doe had overstated the number of scientists receiving support from this program by counting bot h weapons and nonwea pons scientists in its totals it also argues that doe has overstated the number of longterm private sector jobs created as result of this program mostly because it does not have an independent way to

production reactors in seversk and zheleznogorsk this program is described below hence the budget reduction when combined with the shifting of funds to nations outside the former soviet union resulted in contraction of fforts to redirect russias nucl ear scientists and to reduce the size of russias nuclear weapons complex in the fy2007 budget request these two programs moved again to does nonproliferation and interna tional security account the total request for both parts of the program equaled 281 million doe reported that the decline was due to reduced activity at two sites that were part of nci and to the deferral of work at two commercial sites the house and senate armed services committees both approved the authorization request for these programs but the appropriations committees increased the funding to 396 million the fy2008 budget request sought 202 million for these programs doe has again indicated that the decline in f unding reflects the termination of the nci

united states and russia both pledged to end the production of plutonium for nuclear w eapons russia however balked at suggestions that it shut its three remain ing plutonium production reactors because it used the same reactors to produce light and heat in the cities of tomsk and krasnoyarsk in an agreement signed in 1994 under the auspices of the highlevel commission chaired by vice president gore and russias prime minister chernomyrdin the two sides agreed that they would work together to provide alternative energy sources for these russian cities this program began as part of the dod ctr program and moved to doe in fy2002 in the original 1994 agreement russia st ated that it would shut the reactors by 2000 if the alternative ener gy facilities were develope d in the same time frame initially the two nations pl anned to replace the reactor s with fossilfueled power plants but early studies concluded that the construction of these plants could cost up to 1 billion consequently the two si des began to explore the possibility of converting the plutonium production reactor s to type whose spent fuel did not require reprocessing these new react ors would longer produce weaponsgrade plutonium each side planned to pay half of the expected 160 million for this conversion project however over the next few years the expected cost of the core conversion more than doubled after its financial crisis in 1998 russia concluded that it could not pay its half if the pr oject had continued the united states might have had to pay more th an 300 million at the same time questions bout the reactors safety raised the possibility that th ey might need to be closed shortly after the core conversion was complete in late 1999 minatom proposed that the two sides again

convert surplus weaponsgrade plutonium to form that could not be re turned to nuclear weapons in the plutonium management and dispos ition agreement signed in september 2000 each side agreed to dispose of 34 metr ic tons of weaponsgrade plutonium and to do so at roughly the same time this agreement was designed to ease concerns about the possible theft or diversion of w eaponsgrade plutonium by nations or others seeking to develop their own nuclear weapons according to the agreement the partie s could use two methods for disposing of the plutonium they could either convert it to mixed oxide fuel mox for nuclear power reactors or immobilize it and dispose of it in way that would preclude its use in nuclear weapons some analysts have criticized the mox option on the principle of opposing any use of plutonium in power generation from this point of view nations that do not possess nuclear weapons could use plutoni umbase power fuel cycle as cover for developing nuclear w eapons if weapons states such as russia and the united states used plutonium for power generation according to this argument it would be more difficult to persuade nonweapons states not to do so however russia has expressed little interest in the permanent disposal of plutonium noting that the material could have great value for its civilian power program the united states initially intended to pursue both options however after reviewing us nonproliferation policies in 2001 the bu sh administration concluded that this approach would be too costly instead it outlined plan for the united states to convert almost all its surplus plutonium to mox fuel congress appropriated 152 million for fy2003 to begin construction of three facilities in sa vannah river sc to pursue the mox option and the fy2004 request included 416 million for construction and 194 million fo r operation and maintenan ce for the us surplus plutonium disposal program the fy2005 budget request reduced funding for the

million for this program in fy2006 but congress appropriated only 34 million agai n questioning the timing for the start of the project the administration requested 347 million for fy2007 for this project both the house and the senate armed services committees have expressed wideranging and deep concerns about this program in particular russia has indicated that it may not pursue the mox program to eliminate its plutonium opting instead for the construction of fast breeder reactors that could burn plutonium directly for energy production the united states might not f und this effort as many in the united states argue that breeder r eactors which produce more plutonium than they consume would undermine nonproliferation objectives as result of these concerns the house armed services committ ee deleted all funding for this program in russia in the fy2007 defense authorization bill th senate armed serv ices provided the funding but fenced it pending report from the secretary of ergy the conference committee adopted this approach cong ress has also questioned the value of continuing with the us mox program nd has reduced funding for this effort as well the bush administration did not request any additional funding for this program area in fy 2008 in late november 2007 the united states and russia announced that they had reached agreemen t of how they would proceed with this program105 generally the united states has agreed that russia can burn some of the plutonium in breeder reactors but that the reactors will be modified so that they will not produce more plutonium than they burn at the same time the united states will continue to fund constructi on of the mox fuel plant and russia will convert some of its plutonium into this fuel the bu sh

these are disc ussed in detail in crs report 971027f nunn lugar cooperative threat reduction programs issues for congress some of these issues have grown out of concerns with specific projects as has been the case with the dispute over the chemical weapons destruction facil ity at shchuchye others have derived from broader concerns about whether threat reduction assistance to russia and the other former soviet states rves broader us national security goals the question of whether us threat reduction and nonprolif eration assistance represents defense by other means as former secretary of defense william perry used to argue or foreign aid as some in congress often assert continues to echo in debate s about these programs so program critics and some members of congress also continue to question whether us assistance allows russia to divert its own resources to the development and production of new weapons that could threaten the united stat secretary of fense rumsfeld raised this question during his nomination hearing in january 2001 on the other hand as us threat re duction and nonprolifer ation assistance to russia moves through its second decade ma ny of the issues discussed during the debates over the programs refl ect new concerns raised dur ing assessments of how the programs performed in thei r first decade and how they might improve in the second many of these issues also reflect the growing focus of the programs on the potential link between weapons of mass destruction that might leak out of russia and terrorist organizations that might seek these weapons to attack the united states and its allies the discussion below reviews many of thes issues describing concerns raised by those who support and those who criticize the programs the discussion

continuedorganization and coordination as was noted above ctr implementation was slow during the programs early years the need to negotiate umbrella ag reements with russia and to establish culture of

coordination problems remain today even though each of the three ke agencies dod doe and state funds and manages its own projects these agencies still need to coordinate their efforts to avoid duplication and in some cases to sh are resources and expertise in addition with the programs spread among three agen cies one in the us government takes the lead in setting policies and priorities for us threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance or in servin g as an advocate for these programs in interagency debates some members of congress and analysts outside government have proposed two specific solutions that they believe will imp rove implementation of us threat reduction nd nonproliferation assistance the creation of strategic plan and the designation of an overall program coordinator strategic plan many analysts both inside nd outside the us government believe that us threat reduction and nonprolif eration programs would benefit from the development of governmentwide stra tegic plan some officials and analysts expected the bush administration to develop more comprehensive strategic plan for these programs during its review of us nonproliferation assistance to russia in 2001107 that review just identified those programs that would receive greater resources and expanded mandates but according to senator pete domenici these programs frequently are inte rtwined and interrelated in various complex and difficult ways108 according to one analyst who has participated in both dod and doe programs the growth in us programs has been by and large organic with each agency pursuing its own contacts and relati onships in recipient countries assembling and justifying its own budget implementin g programs based on its own culture and approaches and

chaired by representative of the national security council this progra m coordinator would set consistent direction by setting priorities resolving competing demands for budgetary resources eliminating overlap and redundancy and coordinating implementation across agencies this individual would also raise the political profile of the programs bringing consistent political leadership that many analysts believe is lacking they argue that continued coordinated success for the programs requires active political engagement at the white house cabinet and subcabinet political appointee levels in the us government110 neither the clinton nor the bush ad ministrations accepted proposals for single highlevel program coordinator ar guing that interagency coordination already occurs

rams and ensuring that they adequatelycrs50 113 the bakercutler report notes that russian official point out that transparency and access matters are far from routine in russian bureaucracy russia

up the same theme it would establish an office of the united states coordinator for the prev ention of weapons of mass destruction proliferation and terrorism within the executive office of the president this advisor would among other things lead in teragency coordination of us efforts to implement its wmd nonprolifer ation strategy and would oversee the development of comprehensive and coor dinated budget for programs and initiatives to prevent wmd proliferation and terrorism ensuring that such budget adequately reflects the priority of the challenges and is effectively executed and carrying out other appropriate budget ary authorities most analysts agree that the budget res ponsibility addressed in this legislation would be critical to the success of this new policy position white housebased nonproliferation czar may be able to co mmunicate highlevel interest and political commitment to the programs however unless this individual could control the budgets of the programs involved to ensu re that funding vels matched stated priorities and unless the individual could implement corrective actions to ensure that programs achieved their objectives it seems likely that he or she would be able to establish priorities and enforce them across government agencies highlevel committee might have greater success creatin g consensus about priorities because each agency would have representative at the table but it might still find it difficult to match funding levels to th priorities because each agencys budget would still reflect the overall priorities and missions of the agency access and transparency many analysts and government officials note that the primary barrier to successful implementation remains the need to gain access and transparency from officials in the recipient nations particul arly russia as was noted above russia was slow to provide the united states w ith access to nuclear weapons storage areas which delayed the implementation of security improvements at these facilities it has not provided complete information about or access to facilities in its biological weapons complex and in spite of more than seven year s of negotiations the united states and russia still have not completed transparency agreement for the facility in mayak that will store fissile materi als removed from weapons furthermore russia has not provided the united states with access to many facilities in russias nuclear weapons complex leaving large holes in the us ability to improve security for the nuclear materials at those facilities although many analysts note that russia s interest in prot ecting secret details about its nuclear weapons programs is unde rstandable most also argue that this secrecy and the resulting delays in pr ogram implementation serve to undermine support in the united states for threat reduction and nonprolif eration programs while most agree that russia must step forward to solve this problem113 they

implementation of these programs the report is to both identify these impediments and outline us plans to overcome them problems with access to russian facilities is one of the impediments cited in the reporting requirement liability protections and the umbrella agreement in 1992 the united states and russia si gned an umbrella agreement that outlined the rights and responsibilities assumed by each of the parties when implementing programs funded by us threat reduction ssistance this agreement provides the legal framework that allows for program implementation if it were to lapse the united states could not awar d any new contracts for projects funded by us assistance the original agreement was set to last for seven years the two parties agreed to extend it fo r another seven years in 1999 it was again set to expire in june 2006 at the time it was signed this agreement applied only to those programs funded by the depar tment of defense but the department of energy has adopted similar agreem ents to cover many of its programs in the former soviet union the most contentious elements of the umbrella agreement are the provisions that cover liability for accidents or incide nts that might occur during project implementation in the original agreemen t russia assumed all liability freeing us contractors from the threat of legal acti on or the possible need to pay fines and penalties if accidents were to occur ho wever in recent years russia has objected to these blanket liability provisions arguing at minimum that us contractors should be held liable for accidents resulting from sabotage as was noted above this disagreement impeded the conclusion of new implementation agreement for does plutonium disposition program when resolv ing this dispute the united states was reluctant to ease its stand that us cont ractors receive blanke t liability protection incrs52 115 fiorill joe hopes pressure rise for end to usrussian stalemate on liability in nuclear

press secretary cooperative threat reduction agreement with russia extended june 19 2006part because it was afraid that this would set an unacceptable precedent during negotiations on the broade r umbrella agreement however by the middle of 2005 the ited states and russia both recognized that failure to resolve the liability debate stalling the plutonium disposition program could eventually lead to failure to resolve the dispute in negotiations over the umbrella agreement this in turn could stall or stop nonproliferation program that most experts agreed had made great strides to secure w eapons and materials in russia conversely if the two states could find an acceptable solution for the doe programs agreement it might ease efforts to conclude new umbrella agreement during this process contractors partic ipating in the doe program reportedly noted that they would not object to provision that placed liability for accidents resulting from sabotage onto the us companies they noted that this could expose them to russias legal system but they also noted that the united states might address this through separate international treaty or by focusing on russian liability law rather than by pressing for blanket liability protection115 the two sides reached agreement on the liability provisions for the doe programs during the g8 summit at gleneagles scotla nd in july 2005 reports indicate that in exchange for the us giving up its insistence on blanket liability protection in future contracts the two c ountries would set up separate process for addressing any situations that mig ht arise as result of sabotage116 in midjune 2006 the united states and russia reached agreement on liability protections and extended the umbrella agreement for another seven years117 this concluded the agreement just days before the existing agreement was due to expire reports indicate that the new agreement retains the original agreements blanket liability protections for existing projects but will address russias concerns when implementing future projects hence us contractors could be liable for damages caused by sabotage or other accidents in some circumstances certifications and waivers the nunnlugar amendment contained si x exclusions that set out conditions the recipients had to meet before receiving us threat reduction assistance the united states could not provide assistance until the president certified to congress that each recipient nation was committed to 1 making substantial investment of its resources for dismantling or destroying such weaponscrs53 118 pl 102228 sec 211 paragraph b 119 for detailed review of the history of the ctr certification requirements see crs memorandum for congress certification requirements affecting the nunnlugar cooperative threat reduction program by amy f woolf december 23 20022 forgoing any military modernization program that exceeds legitimate defense requirements and forgoing the replacement of destroyed weapons of mass destruction 3 forgoing any use of fissionable nd other components of destroyed nuclear weapons in new nuclear weapons 4 facilitating united states verification of weapons destruction carried out under section 212 5 complying with all relevant arms control agreements and 6 observing internationally recognized human rights including the protection of minorities118 congress expected the president to exercise his judgement when deciding whether to issue the certifications for example the legislation states that the recipient nations must be committed to the policies listed in the six exclusions standard which can be less manding than one that requi res precise behavior the clinton administration certified russia for several years even though the united states had questions about russias co mpliance with chemical and biological weapons agreements because russias president yeltsin had offered verbal assurances of his commitment to resolve the outstanding questions using the same information the bush administration wit hheld russias certification in addition the exclusions do not define many of their terms for example they state that recipient must make substantial inves tment of its own resources but it does not define level of investment that would be necessary they also state that the recipients must forgo military modernizati on programs that exceed legitimate defense requirements but it does not ban all military modernization or indicate how much would be too much congress has debated dding new or modified exclusions to the ctr legislation several times over the life of the ctr program in some years some members have sought to provide more preci standards of behavior for the recipient nations in others they have sought to add new requi rements linking receipt of assistance to greater number of policy areas congress has rejected many of these efforts particularly if they appeared certain to cut off us threat reduction assistance to russia instead it has usually crafted requirements with language that provides the president with the flexibility to balance u s concerns about the recipients policies against the us interest in continuing efforts to contain and eliminate weapons of mass destruction119 congress did add new certifi cation requirements relate d to the construction of the chemical weapons destruction fac ility at shchuchye in fy1998 and fy1999 these stated that funds authorized to be appropriated under th is or any other actcrs54 for fy1998 for cooperative threat reduction programs may be obligated or expended for chemical weapons destruc tion activities until the president submits to congress written certification that russia is making reasonable progress toward the implementation of the bilateral destruction agreement b the united states and russia have made substantial progress toward the resolution to the satisfaction of the ited states of outstanding compliance issues under the wyoming memorandum of understanding and the bilateral destruction agreement and c russia has fully and accurately declar ed all information regarding its unitary and binary chemical weapons chemical weapons facilities and other facilities associated with chemical weapons however congress permitted the president to submit an alternative certification which stated that the nationa l security interests of the united states could be undermined by united states policy not to carry out chemical weapons destruction activities under th cooperative threat reducti on programs but when congress resumed funding fo r shchuchye in fy2002 after two year prohibition it restored the certificati on requirements without the alternative provision the united states could not provide funding fo r chemical weapons destruction activities in russia until the secretary of defense certified that there has been 1 information provided by russia that the united states assesses to be full and accurate regarding the size of the chemical weapons stockpile of russia 2 demonstrated annual commitment by russia to allocate at least 25000000 to chemical weapons elimination 3 development by russia of practical pl an for destroying its stockpile of nerve agents 4 enactment of law by russia that provides for the elimination of all nerve agents at single site 5 an agreement by russia to destroy or convert its chemical weapons production facilities at volgograd and novocheboksark and 6 demonstrated commitment from the international community to fund and build infrastructure needed to support and operate the facility the bush administration announced in april 2002 that it could not certify that russia was committed to its arms control obligations under the chemical weapons and biological weapons conventions th is decision stalled many ongoing ctr projects by precluding the signing nd implementation of new contracts furthermore in an effort to balance its stated support for ctr with this decision the administration asked congress to provide it with the authority to waive the certification requirements so that it could continue to fund ctr programs in russia most members of congress agreed with the administrations view that the ctr programs continued to serve us national security interests and the house andcrs55 senate each included waiver authority in its version of the defense authorization bill the senate provided the president with permanent waiver authority once passed the authority would remain available to the president in all future fiscal years the house sought less generous provision providing the president with the authority to waive the certification re quirements only in fy2003 the conference committee in section 1306 hrept 107 436 provided the president with the authority to waive the certification requirements for three years but this waiver only applied to the original six exclusions not the separate certifi cation for shchuchye congress included one year of waiver au thority for that project in the fy2003 defense appropriations b ill pl107248 the fy2004 defense authorization bill pl 108136 and the fy2005 defense authorization bill pl 108375 the three years of waiver authority in the fy2003 defense authorization act expired at the end of fy2005 the house in its version of the fy2006 defense authorization bill provided the presiden t with another three years of waiver authority the senate in contrast provided the president with unlimited waiver authority the conference committee adopted the senate position the president must still present waiver each year if he cannot certify russias compliance with the requirements but this authority is ava ilable to him every year in its version of the fy2007 defense authorization bill the senate approved lang uage that would have eliminated the certifica tion requirements from the ct r legislation the house rejected this approach although the final ve rsion of the bill continues to provide the president with unlimited waver authority the bush administration has indicated that it believes that the combination of certification requirements and presidential waivers is an essential part of its effort to use the ctr program to encourage great er openness in russia and to transform russian behavior they allow the united states to signal to russia that it will hold it to high standard and although the pres ident can waive the certifications he does not have to if russian behavior does not meet us standards some in congress support this approach they agree that the ctr program should be afforded high priority but they note that it cannot proceed in vacuum without consideration for russian behavior in other policy areas some however disagree with this appro ach they believe that us threat reduction assistance to russia should be of the highest priority and although russian policies in other areas are important they should not interfere with the elimination and containment of weapons of mass destruction so of these members have proposed that congress amend the ctr gislation to remove the certification requirements altogether ot hers believe that congress should provide the president with permanent waiver authority so that this debate does not stop the program as it did in 2002 again in the future some in congress however believe that russian policies in other areas such as russian nuclear cooperation with ira n russian military modernization and the lack of russian compliance with arms control can create new threats to us security and therefore are of higher prio rity than threat reduction assistance they argue that the president should have onl limited ability to waive the certification requirements crs56 120 us department of energy the secretary of energy advisory board report card on the department of energys nonproliferation programs with russia howard baker and lloyd cutler russia task force january 10 2001 p 20the 110th congress has addressed this issue again both the house and senate versions of the defense authorization bill would eliminate the certification requirements from the ctr program the conference report accepted this provision and as result us assistan ce under the ctr program will longer be subject to the certification requirements that have been the cause of so much debate funding and focus of the programs funding the bush administration has indicated through the us commitment to the g8 global partnership described below that it plans to request around 1 billion per year for us threat reduction and nonpro liferation programs in russia and the other former soviet states these programs expanded sharply in the latter half of the 1990s when the ctr program receiving little less than half of the total appropriation and the doe programs growing to consume majority of the funding yet many analysts argue that the united states should commit far greater sum to these efforts the bakercutler re port for example released in january 2001 argued that the united states should spend up to 30 billion over the next 10 years on does programs to secure nuclear materials120 this amount did not include funding for dod or state department prog rams which could to tal another 5 billion over the next 10 years if spending continues at the current level most analysts agree that added funding will not necessarily accelerate all us programs they acknowledge that implement ation problems such as the absence of access to many facilities and th us failure to certify russia for receipt of ctr assistance for most of 2002 slowed progre ss and left significant amounts of money unspent on the other hand they have identified numerous programs that might achieve greater results with increased fundi ng these include the science centers in moscow and kiev where the united states and its partners have had to limit the number of scientists who receive research grants because of limits on the available funds this list at one time also included the program to dispose of plutonium in russia where added funding might have sp ed construction of the mox facility and hasten the elimination of weapons grade plutonium and the program to eliminate russias plutonium producing reactors where greater funding is now leading to the completion of replacement energy plants export and border control programs might also accelerate their progress with added funding leading to the installation of improved equipment and procedures at greater number of border crossing points the bush administration generally agrees with the need to add funding to some programs to accelerate their progress and it took this route with several programs such as the science centers and export nd border control programs during its first term it has also called for added inte rnational funding to help accelerate the shutdown of russias plutoniumproduc ing reactors and to speed security improvements at storage sites for russian nuclear warheads however analysts note that with fixed budget of around 1 billion per year the united states will be able to expand these programs and introduce new programs only if it reduces funding forcrs57 121 the most effective approach to reducing th risk is multilayered defense designed to block each step on the terrorist pathway to th bomb but securing nuclear weapons and materials at their source is the single most cr itical layer of this defense where actions that continuedother programs but other programs such as the effort to help russia dispose of its weaponsgrade plutonium c ould consume rapidly increasing sums in the future consequently the administrations plans for fixed budget could force tradeoffs between projects for example in its budget request for fy2004 doe sought to add funding to accelerate the blenddown of high ly enriched uranium and to fund the new program to identify and secure radiological sources at the same time it has reduced funding for mpca projects in ru ssias nuclear weapons complex on the other hand some current progra ms may finish their missions in the coming years allowing increased funding for other programs many of the capital intensive construction project s funded during the 1990s fall into this category as is evidenced by the reduced budgets for stra tegic offensive arms elimination and the construction of the chemical weapons destruction facility some have even noted that as these large projects conclude the united states might find it difficult to fulfill its commitment to spend 1 billion each year dods ctr budget is already declining and doe has noted that its funding for programs in russia is likely to decline in the next few years as it completes many of the security upgrades at nuclear weapons storage facilities these changes could pave the way for added funding for new projects in the former s oviet union or they could re lease funds for use on other projects with an antiterrorism focus po ssibly outside the form er soviet union if recent trends continue however it seems qu ite likely that while the us budget for nonproliferation and threat re duction assistance may hold st eady or even increase little funding for programs in the former soviet union could decline in the near future focus us threat reduction and nonproliferation programs have pursued number of different types of projects trying different so lutions to different problems however most have followed one th eme these projects have sought to consolidate contain and destroy weapons and materials and to consolidate and contain weapons knowledge so that they would not leak out of the former soviet union in essence the united states has sought to identify materials and knowledge that might leak out of russia and to contain them at their source several of the new projects identified by the bush administr ation such as the wmd proliferation prevention project at dod and doe second line of defense take different approach instead of improving security at the source they seek set up barriers outside the nuclear weapons complex to prevent these resources from leaving the territory of the former soviet union these two approaches can be compleme ntary and provide layered defense against the leakage of weapons material s and knowhow however in an era of constrained budgets they might also compete for funding and political support furthermore many analysts believe that the most effective approach to keeping nuclear materials away from terrorists is to protect them at their source at facilities in russias nuclear complex121 the bush administrations budget request reducescrs58 121 continued can be taken now will do the most to reduce th risk of terrorist acquiring nuclear weapons and materials

cochairman of the nuclear threat initiative reducing the threats from weapons of mass destruction and building global coa lition against catastrophic terrorism moscow russia may 27 2002or holds steady funding for mpca progra ms while increasing funding for other types of projects consequently cong ress may address the issue of focus and priorities in its deba over us threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance globalization and international cooperation there is nearuniversal agreement both within the bush administration and among analysts outside the us govern ment that the potential proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to rogue nations or terrorist groups presents global problem that requires an international re sponse while the legacy of the soviet unions weapons programs may create the most immediate and largest threat other nations also possess materials weapons or knowledge that could leak out beyond their borders to those seeking their own nuclear chemical or biological weapons122 in addition although the united states has spent more than decade trying to help russia and the other former soviet states s ecure their weapons materials and knowledge other nations can contribute to this effort with f unding and cooperative programs the following section addresse s three characteristics of the proposals for the globalization of threat reduction and nonproliferation ssistance the first the g8 global partnership against the spr ead of weapons and materials of mass destruction is an initiative to expand the list of countries contributing to threat reduction nd nonproliferati on programs in russia the second is an initiative to extend us threat reduction assistance to nations outside the fo rmer soviet union the third is more general approach to encourage all nations to better account for and secure their weapons of mass destru ction and materials that might become attractive targets for terrorists seeking their own weapons of mass destruction the g8 global partnership during the g8 summit in kananaskis canada in july 2002 the united states ru ssia and other g8 leaders agreed to establish longterm program the g8 global partnership against weapons of mass destruction to stop the spread of weapons of mass dest ruction and related materials and technology under this program known as 1010 over 10 the united states has pledged to provide 10 billion over 10 years to sustain ongoing threat reduction programs in russia this amount of 1 billion per year is equal to current us spending on threat reduction and nonpro liferation programs in russia so the us commitment would not necessarily sign an increase in the us commitment the other g7 nations have also agreed that they will provide together up to 10 billion over 10 years russia has agreed to contribute 2 billion of its own money it has also agreed to adopt set of guide lines that will allow it to receive assistancecrs59 123 the g8 global

in receiving assistance under this program the united states w ould also like the global partnership to contribute to programs designed to redirect sc ientists in iraq and libya during their 2004

each of these project areas at the same time though the global partnership will not rely on si ngle coordinating body to either identify new projects or set priorities among compe ting projects each nation will allocate its own funds to those programs that it views as highpriority endeavors with central authority this process could leave some programs with too little funding and others with too much funding extending ctr beyond the former soviet union in the debate over the fy2003 defense authorization bill the senate approved an amendment proposed by senator richard lugar that would allow

however objected to this ex pansion of ctr and the language was removed in conference the bush administration requested similar authorization in its emergency supplemental appropria tions bill for fy2003 the senate again approved the request and the house again rejected it it was removed from the final version of the bill the bush administration again requested the authorization to spend up to 50 million in ctr funds outside the former soviet union in the fy2004 defense authorization bill the senate again ffered its unqualified support for this measure the house in contrast argued that these types of programs w ould be better managed by the state department than the defense department it authorized the transfer of up to 78 million in ctr funds to the st ate department n onprolifera tion and disarmament fund for use in threat reduction efforts outside the fo rmer soviet union the conference committee in its report on the fy2004 defense authorization bill pl 108136 approved the presidents re quest and permits the use of up to 50 million in ctr funds outside the former soviet union however in deference to the house concerns the committee language indi cates that this funding could be used only for shortterm projects it also states that the pres ident should determine whethercrs61 129 warrick joby albanias chemical cache raises fears about others washington post january 10 2005 p a1dod is the agency that is most capable of implementing the planned project the conferees stated that they would expect the president to assign the project to the most appropriate agency the bush administration exercised this authority for the first time in mid2004 when it provided assist ance to albania for the elimination of chemical weapons129 in its version of the fy2006 defense aut horization bill the senate sought to alter the provision so that the secretary of defense rather than the president could approve expenditures outside the former sovi et union the senate argued that this change would streamline the procedure nd make it easier for the united states to respond to s udden and emerging proliferation problems the house however objected and the conference committee di d not accept the senate provision the 110th congress addressed this issue ag ain both expanding the authority to spend ctr funds outside the former soviet union and to streamline the process of identifying and approving potential project s as was noted above congress added 10 million to the ctr authorization to f und these programs further it eliminated the requirement included in the fy2004 authorization act pl 108136 that limited the program to shortterm proj ects that addressed sudden emergency proliferation concerns instead the c onference report hrep t 110477 s ec 1303 specifies that ctr programs outside the former soviet union are defined in similar way to those inside the form er soviet union they woul d be programs designed to facilitate the elimination and the safe and secu re

to nations such as pakistan where insecure nuclear material s might be at risk of theft or diversion by government officials or represen tatives of terrorist organizations130 others however question whether program lik ctr can be applied successfully to nations outside the former s oviet union they note that these nations might not be willing to allow the united states access to facilities that house nuclear materials or weapons that they might prefer to enhance rather than reduce the threat posed by their weapons of mass destruction and that us assistance in securing weapons might actually make it easier for the recipien t nations to deploy and use the weapons some have also questioned whether the ited states can legally provide assistance under us and international law to nations that are not parties to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty131 global recognition of national responsibility one of the key themes in recent reviews of the proliferation threat and the potential link to terrorism is the recognition that nuclear chemical and biol ogical materials reside in many nations around the world nations with research f acilities for these materials often lack the basic accounting security export and borde r control systems that the united states has spent more than 10 years trying to bring to russia although few of these materials would be useful to those seekin g to build nuclear weapons they could be of use to those seeking ra diological dispersal device d irty bomb or chemical or biological weapon there is growing c onsensus that the international community and individual nations should take steps to address probl ems with these materials beyond those already in place under the in ternational atomic energy agency132 the united states would not necessarily need to adopt new programs and appropriate new funds to ddress this problem some believe as was noted above that efforts to expand ctr programs be yond the former soviet union could help address the problem but many believe that the iaea with the support of the united states could take steps in this direction through its existing programs that help countries secure and acc ount for radiological materi als the chemical weapons convention also provides mechanism that might help nations secure and account for chemical agents and materials consequently at least initially the effort to address this global problem could be more diplomatic and political than technical with the united states and others using th bully pulpit to encourage other nationscrs63 to recognize the problem and take steps within their own systems to address their own vulnerabilities in essence this new global focus may serve to shape the second decade of us threat reduction and nonprolifer ation assistance during the first decade the problem was dominated by concerns over the poten tial for the loss of control over nuclear materials and weapons in the former sovi et union and the solutions were dominated by us programs to bring technical assistance to the former soviet states in the second decade the problem is likely to be dominated by concerns about the potential acquisition of nuclear chemical and biologi cal materials by terrorist organizations the solutions may be dominated by growing sense of global cooperation in identifying and addressing weaknesses in greater number of countries us funding and technical assistance may still pl ay dominant role but other nations may also step in to offer their experien ce expertise and financial resources
