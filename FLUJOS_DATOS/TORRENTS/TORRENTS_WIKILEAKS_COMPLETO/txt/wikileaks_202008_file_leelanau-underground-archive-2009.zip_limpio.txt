are in the hands of you and your minds you are only limited by your own creativity cunning and pure love for freedom please take the time to read this as i took the time to write it and apologize never forget those who came before you always try and be better than them i didnt always have the right ideas i didnt always have the right tactics and i hurt lot of people in the process of fighting for them perhaps the person i hurt the most was myself i destroyed myself at boarding school towards the end of the year i snapped on people started fights for reason and left my friends behind to those who were hurt by that i apologize i let jealously hate rage anger depression and my own selfdelusion consume the adb you knew then wasnt the real adb its the person that i became the person that i became when i turned to drugs to keep myself sane and dull the pressure to dull the pressure of wanting to do something to live without walls or boundaries to speak and act when i saw injustice to be free for those who i betrayed when i cut deal with the school and agreed to silence myself in exchange for my get away with anything pass i apologize of all the things i regret in my life that is my biggest regret i dont ask for forgiveness because theres nothing to forgive and its the past i only say this because its something i want you to hear as i said in the last time i addressed crowd at leelanau to those i hurt im sorry to those who had fun times with for whatever its worth thank you there are some closedminded individuals who can only consider one set of viewpoints and are unable to see others even when their own are challenged they are unable to accept the mere existence of alternative ideas trying to stamp them out because they fear that one day they might have to accept them they have put the nails in their own coffin avoiding what makes us all so interesting that were all different they stereotype people try to monoculture them and try to make us all in their own image standing from their own position to criticize others without looking back into themselves i called those people out to anybody who was hurt by that you brought it on yourself by keeping secrets letting them eat you up inside and building walls of them these walls were so tough and so old and so thick that when they fell nothing could be seen beyond them because nothing was left i do not apologize for calling people out for challenging authority and for resisting i dont apologize for breaking the rules or for refusing to take for an answer when it came to my own freedom for those who tried to exert power over and control whom i fought tooth and nail and conspired to bring down i do not apologize for my behaviour for those who looked on in awe now is your time for those who questioned now is the time to act on those questions props and respect to those who have helped make dreams into reality and for those still waiting for their chance this is it life is now if you are waiting for it dont live in the moment think for yourself struggle fight love cry laugh and chase after your dreams always question your own belief system what youre told what you think and why you think what you do dont take things for granted including how you believe the world has to work things come and go people and ideas live and die but one thing that has always been alive is the struggle for justice i hope it is as alive in your minds and hearts as it was as it is and as it always will be in mine never ever give up adb this letter was printed out and delivered to every member of the school administration faculty and dorm staff following the walkout this was while back yes i know there are few gramaticalspelling mistakes it wasnt perfect and neither was the walkout im pretty much dropping this issue now and ill say some more along with what was in the briefcase of mystery once i graduate letter to the leelanau community the 2007 walkout and what it means for the past few years students and staff have seen the school policies head down an extremely conservative path that has restricted student rights and caused student grievances to be ignored or diverted while we cant speak for the entire community we can speak for ourselves and in part for those who supported us today since the start of new year at the leelanau school sweeping change has occurred in school policies staffing and attitude towards the community that is contrary to the student bodys beliefs these shifts in policies have crippled student speech the social environment and the freedom of students students have the right to be treated with respect be given the opportunity to learn from their mistakes and be able to trust in the confidentiality of the conversations they have with school counselors the mounting pressure between the students and the new policies hit tipping point the night before when student stood up for his rights and inspired others to do the same while sitin was not our first choice of action all of the other avenues for airing our grievances had been exhausted and further work within those channels would not have accomplished anything students love and respect school whose views are in line with theirs many of us are here for that reason because leelanau believes in different style of educational learning that promotes and fosters true growth this growth is not only evident in academic arenas but also in individual and social wellbeing we love this school because of what it offers us and because the facilitators in this community sincerely care about us as individuals even though we have disagreements regarding rules and policies we have always respected the work of those who keep us in line and force us to grow the people who work at this school comprise family of which we can be proud and supported by because we see leelanau as this amazing place where anything is possible we are concerned about the direction the school is heading in we had lot of issues to bring to the table many of which should have been fixed long time ago we assembled list of the six things that we thought needed to be changed first we all went back to class except for alex b justin patrick m dylan r and duncan who had been elected by the group to speak with mr friley they met with mr friley at 1145 and were alloted 10 minutes to present their points and discuss them when mr friley looked at the list he got upset with the students and started shouting at them while they peaceably tried to engage him in rational discussion at point did the students raise their voices or get upset once things had calmed down mr friley agreed to have meeting with mr odell president of the school and have the students attend mr friley also said that all the absences would remain unexcused and that those students who participated would have study hall during the thursday field trip as of fifth period all of the students had returned to their regularly scheduled classes on wednesday the policy was changed and only those students who left before the spanish presentation had to attend the additional study hall we did not want to miss the spanish presentations and many of the people attending the sitin did in fact wait for the presentation to be over we had planned earlier to make the walkout during tuesdays quiet period and we believed it was our only opportunity people were excited to stand up for their rights and take action against the mistreatment that had been feeling and much of that enthusiasm could have been lost we created new forum for speech that needed to exist because the school administration knew of our plans we were concerned that they would prematurely end quiet period directly after the presentation in order to avoid the walkout for that reason it was spontaneously decided that it would occur then and students demonstrated by standing up that they supported that decision when we left everybody who left with us did it voluntarily if people felt pressured by their peers that should be considered positive peer pressure because they were encouraged to use this rare opportunity to speak and be heard some staff members had talked to students during quiet period before the walkout and told them there would be consequences statements of that nature were made by us it is unfortunate that we had to miss the spanish presentation and the two periods before lunch but as we have stated before we had exhausted all other possibilities we did not leave to disrespect the teachers or administration but to make sure that our voices would be heard it is unfortunate that the climate forced us speak in this way and hopefully in the future things will be handled differently afterwards there were lot of questions from students staff and the press as to what exactly we wanted we have issued this statement to help resolve some misconceptions about what happened we wrote down the top six issues we want fixed and they are as follows 1going into glen arbor without gold card on weekdays the school is taking away privilege one of the things that makes this school so great it that it causes students to grow and in order to grow we must be able to make our mistakes and learn from them the new set of policies dont even give students that chance students should be given privileges and have them revoked if they make mistakes instead of making them earn those privileges students also need an opportunity to get groceries and supplies for the week that they cant get at the school store this new rule represents the direction that the schools policies are taking 2web filtering needs to be fixed around third quarter last year critical change was made in the school web filtering policies the school moved from blacklisting system to whitelisting system in blacklist the filter blocks every site that is has been rated inappropriate whereas in whitelisting system every single site that hasnt been reviewed and deemed appropriate is blocked the whitelisting system is used during the academic day from quiet period until after sports and has caused problems with the college applications for seniors when site is blocked students can click link to have the site reviewed however many times upon clicking it they are told that they have exceeded their daily limit for submitting sites the whitelisting system is defective by design because by design it blocks the majority of the internet students also want myspace and facebook to be unblocked during free time while it is true that social networking sites can be used to harass and intimidate people so can email message boards the united states postal system and verbal communication to name few there is difference between sending message over facebook and sending one through email this issue has been brought to mr begg and mr friley on innumerable occasions 3vitamins should be allowed in rooms in order for any type of medication to be in students room the student needs to obtain approval from the school nurse many students have already obtained permission for medications like tums and vitamins but requiring them to obtain permission is an unnecessary restriction on their freedoms and hassle vitamins have recreational use and many parents of the students dont have issues with having vitamins in the dorms this issue has been brought to mr friley mr sonnenberg and mr bravehearts attention multiple times 4students want the internet to work for more hours many times students work late into the night on projects and the internet shuts off at eleven which many times makes it difficult for them to finish if the internet were turned on again at 500 as opposed to 700 then those projects could be better completed furthermore the internet should not shut off before twelve because lights out is not until then there is reason not to turn on internet two hours early as long as students are using it responsibly 5maintenance requests should be filled there are number of maintenance requests that havent been filled some of these represent risk to student health and safety in pinebrook there are rodent and heater problems in kindel the lint filter is broken as well as some doors that will not open properly because of lock or hinge problems both of which are fire hazards there is also problem with fruit flies in the dorms and cafeteria this issues have been brought to mr friley mr odell and mr sonnenberg on multiple occasions while some problems have been worked on they are not solved 6academic freedom the decisions to take and drop classes should rest with the student many students have asked to drop the lrc program and have not been allowed to do so in one case student is not be able to graduate on time because lrc took up class slot that could have been filled with the final science credit this issue has been brought up by individuals to mr himburg mr friley and mr palmer furthermore this issue was brought to mr himburg when the senior girls met with him the academic future of students should be their decision especially when the schools actions stop them from having the one they want decisions like this can affect college applications in seriously detrimental way all of the things on that list were presented during the ten minute meeting with mr friley and every single thing had been brought up multiple times to the appropriate staff and brought through the official channels one thing that we had intended to include on this list that got lost in all of the commotion was that students need to have confidentiality with school counselors multiple students leveled serious accusations against mr jarvis and westie for breaking confidentiality failing to inform students about confidentiality and misrepresenting confidentiality while it is true that counselors have legal obligation to act when they are told plans by person to harm others or themselves this is completely separate situation as counselors they have legal and moral obligation to keep confidentiality and many students do not feel that they are fulfilling them unfortunately or very little action was taken on these issues because these issues are important to us and some of them represent risk to personal safety we believe it is critical that they are addressed in timely fashion as we have said since the beginning walkout was not our first choice for airing our grievances but when they were repeatedly ignored we were left with other choice than to make sure our voices could not be ignored hopefully in the next meeting with mr odell they will have heard our grievances and act on the things we have been requesting of them for almost year we love leelanau and the people who make it the special place that it is and thats why we did this we did this because we are fighting to maintain the great community that gives us an opportunity to grow and we did this to foster an open discussion about the problems that lead to the walkout we are all at leelanau for different reasons but not single one of us would choose to leave because of the great value it holds to all of us leelanau talk is shutting down for now and the leelanau school administration must be thrilled at the age of 16 i helped organize school walkout something on scale that the school had never seen before before that i was working quietly to get shit changed meeting with administrators making deals keeping an eye on student council giving people clean urine helping get people out of trouble giving out proxies helping the lup and some things that nobody will ever know were connected to since then i have been constant problem for the leelanau school parents would call up and ask about what was on my site why kids staged walkout etc this isnt my imagination this is something i have both verified with parents and staff members this isnt about just myself being pissed and talking about myself or bitching about odell keep reading it was all there theres nothing students couldnt do to change the conditions they lived in i put myself my diploma and my future on the line i got pulled in to frileys office and blamed for everything they could come up with hacking must have been him flyers must have been him contraband suddenly appearing or disappearing must have been him so why didnt anything happen was it my organizing style the lack of student interest intimidation by the school administration im not going to answer that question here everybody has their opinion on it including myself and it doesnt really matter what i think anyways as im not going to be involved from here on ive slowly realized that my effort here has been pretty much wasted nobody gives fuck who actually has the power to anything the students themselves it felt great to shoot first but very few shot second this isnt to say there isnt value in what i did or what is on the site just that the idea of students doing shit about the school was always farfetched lets face it most kids at leelanau are rich fuckups im not as rich as most of them but i came from the same situation they dont give fuck about freedom their rights or anything like that because when it comes down to it daddy will pay the right amount to the right people and bail them out theyre stuck in the cycle of nihilism the belief that they are powerless to change things or that things wouldnt be any better if they magically were changed besides who would risk their diploma to change shit when the social drama is so intense that they dont even have time to deal with their own personal problems that landed them here in the first place theres good quote from lord of the rings movie that i generally despite but i think it applies here indeed in nothing is the power of the dark lord more clearly shown than in the estrangement that divides all those who still oppose him for every little thing we fight about amongst each other we become further divided this works to the schools advantage as they realize that the further divided we are over our own social shit and the further they can make us turn on our friends by threatening us in their offices the less likely we are to be able to seriously challenge them on any terms let alone our own ill give it to you falling right into this was major fault of mine this type of divide and conquer is classic law enforcement tactic thats been used from the roman empire to cointelpro to groups im currently involved with im not saying that people should put up from abuse from other students but what im saying is sort that shit out and get back to what matters most if you have to ostracize somebody for being an asshole do it but dont get so involved in it that its all you think about theres some seriously fucked up stuff that ive seen go down on the leelanau school campus all the way from snitching to sexual assault and gangstyle beatdowns for reason at all and were all going to have to deal with these problems on our own as community instead of turning to the school for help when we feel in over our heads honestly the school doesnt fix shit and we all know that we all know that social drama doesnt magically stop when something is said at quiet period about it we know harassment doesnt end at the doors to the academic building if were going to take down leelanau or even change single part of it were going to have to do it on united front and put aside our differences for something better if we want to help kids when they get fucked by the school or suddenly cant graduate for financial reasons were going to have to work together not everybody can be united such as students that snitch or rat people out but thats not the majority of kids and if it ever is start small and build from there for years ive been paying to host this website and its just not worth it anymore fuck leelanau yes but more importantly fuck those who did nothing about it fuck you if you snitched on and fuck you if you got away with shit because of my assistance but did nothing on your own fuck you if you saw students mistreating each other and did nothing about it if youre one of those people i hope you take that to heart to stand by while your friends are getting busted or hurt isnt smart nor it is safe its cowardly there are people out there struggles going on for life and death and i was wasting time on my old boarding school theres real problems out there bigger than leelanau more changeable than the leelanau school more important than leelanau at least for at the moment im shutting down the site for good and im not working on this anymore im not paying for po boxes anymore and im not bailing you out anymore i dont even know half of the kids who go there anymore and those who i do know are for whatever reason not doing anything if stuff is going to change its going to change without ive taken everything from this site and put it into big file if somebody wants to really start fucking shit up at this school they can take my old work and build off from there if somebody really wants to make the administrators shit their pants they can do it
