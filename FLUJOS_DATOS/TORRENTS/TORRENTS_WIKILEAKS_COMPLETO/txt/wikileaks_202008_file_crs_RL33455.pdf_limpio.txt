lakes if appropriate permits have continueddrilling in the great lakes background and issues introduction the debate over how to regulate offshore oil and gas drilling in the united states has generated public and congressional interest much discussion has centered on existing and potential drilling operations along the outer continental shelf the debate has also reached specific regions within the united states including the great lakes the question of whether to allo w oil and gas drilling under the great lakes has been contested within states bordering the great lakes and in congress some opposed to drilling under the great lake s are concerned about the potential environmental economic and public health consequences of drilling they contend that drilling will raise the risks of oil sp ills hazardous gas leaks and pollution that may harm lakeside residents and the great lakes ecosystem proponents of drilling contend that the risks of oil spills and ot her accidents are extremely low due to new technologies that drilling would not be nvironmentally harmful and that it would lead to the generation of revenues em ployment and domestic energy supplies obtaining permits for drilling under the gr eat lakes has largely been banned by various state and federal laws great lakeswide ban may have initially been driven by the signing of statement of principle against oil drilling in the great lakes by eight great lakes governors in 19851 all states viewed this nonbinding agreement as prohibiting drilling for natu ral gas in the lakes and except for michigan as being directional drilling2 various states have enacted permanent or temporary bans against drilling the fede ral government became involved in banning drilling in the great lakes when the congress enacted temporary ban on the federal and state issuance of permits for drillin g under the great lakes in 2001 pl 10766 title v 503 extended in 2003 and then extended again through 2007 some also proposed permanent ban against drilling in or under the great lakes permanent ban on issuing federal or state permits for new directional slant or offshore drilling in or under the great lakes was included in the energy policy act of 2005 pl 109 58 section 386 specifically st ates that federal or st ate permit or lease shall be issued for new oil and gas slant directi onal or offshore

formation drilling fluids are mixtures of natural clays andor polymers weighting agents and other materials suspended in water or oilbased material water encountered during the drilling process is termed produced water produced waters can contain organic hydrocarbons phenols and organic acids among other thingseconomic benefits such as j obs and revenue for the owner if deposits are not found and drilling is not fully implemented these benefits may be shortterm if deposits are significant and drilling commences and expands local and state governments would benefit from revenues generated from permits leases and taxes on the quantity of oil and gas sold in some great lakes states revenues from oil and gas leases potentially benefit the environment for example in michigan some revenues from leasing rights to drill under the great lakes would go to the michigan department of natural re sources trust to purchase and protect environmentally sensitive areas22 drilling operations will also generate employment depending on their scope and number according to the bureau of labor statistics there was national average of 57 jobs generated per 10 million of sales by oil and gas producers in 200223 if oil and gas extraction from wells that drill under the great lakes from 2004 yields similar to producti on levels in 2006 the revenue would approximately be 70 million which could yield roughly 40 jobs potential economic costs from drilling under the great lakes may stem from drilling infrastructure and oil and gas releases the presence of infrastructure may lower tourism and recreationa l opportunities harm the great lakes ecosystem affect scenic vistas and lower property values24 if spills occur in areas near or within the lakes economic costs could come from lower water quality and environmental mitigation lost recreational and tourism opportunities and reduced development environmental consequences the potential environmental consequences of oil and gas drilling have been the primary driver in opposition to oil and gas drilling under the great lakes during the process of drilling environmental problems can occur through leaks spills and blowouts among other things leak or spill can occur from pipeline rupture containment failure or from drilling mud pit blowout occurs when drill reaches formation with unusually high pressure and results in the explosive discharge of the wells contents spills and leaks can also occur during transport in addition drilling wastes or byproducts such as drilling muds or cuttings drilling fluids and produced waters25 can potentially harm the environment if released into streams or onto vegetationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33455crs9 26 directional drilling is done at an angle from the vertical plane of the well by deflecting the drill bit directional wells are often drilled to reach an oil or gas reservoir where drilling cannot be done such as beneath shipping lane in the ocean 27 fitch 28 ibid 29

effects of directional drilling26 directional drilling is considered to have less potential hazard than offshore drilling due primarily to its location onshore27 see figure 3 directional drilling beneath the great lakes in michigan for example target s the niagaran reefs formati on which is four to five thousand feet below ground at this dist ance there is an impermeable barrier between the hydrocarbon deposits and the lake28 according to an evaluation of the potential environmental impacts of directional drilling there is little risk of contaminating the great lakes through spills at the reservoir and well however the study states that there is potential risk associated with leaks at the wellhead which would be located onshore29 this study also recommended that directional drilling under the great lakes be done at least 1500 feet from the shoreline and prohibited in sensitive natural areas potential ecosystem effects shortterm direct exposure to spills can kill organisms and alter ecosystems longterm chronic exposure to spills and discharges such as those from leaking pi pelines offshore production discharges and nonpoint source pollution can result in longt erm changes to an ecosystem although some contend these changes have been difficult to quantify and are subject to debate30 some have also expressed concer n over the longterm effects of buried drilling wastes and injected production wa ter on ecosystems drilling wastes are generally buried onshore and in some cases produced water is injected in drill holes for storage both substances

such as in wetlands in lowflow areas spills can persist longer and damage vegetation and other organisms that use these habitats36 in the great lakes water flow is variable and therefore spills can have different impacts for instance water that enters lake superior takes approx imately 182 years to be comple tely replaced this could be considered lowflow area compared to lake erie and lake ontario which take approximately three and six years respectively to replace water history of oil and gas releases in the great lakes between 1973 and 2001 there were an averag of 135 oil spills per year in the us great lakes ranging from 11 gallons to 179912 gallons37 the average total amount spilled per year in the great lakes is approximately 41121 gallons38 however these spills originate from variety of sources including watercraft shipping vessels and power plants and are not necessarily associated with drilling to put these statistics in perspective during the same period in the united states there was an average of 1712 spills per year in harbors along the eastern and western coasts of this country39 in the state of michigan there have been oil or gas spills associated with the 13

approach states would hold title to some us portions of the great lakes this approach is confirmed by th federal submerged lands act sla50 the sla declares that states are vested with title to both

the commerce clause of the constitution to regulate both the navigable wate rs and oil and gas development69 while congress likely possesses the authority to regulate or ban oil nd gas drilling in or under the great lakes such action might also constitute taking of private property for which just compensation would be required70 the legal analysis court would undertake in determining whether taki ng has occurred is described below preliminary issue is whether federal ban on oil and gas leasing or permitting would be covered by federal navigational servitude as st ated in the sla states title to the navigable waters is subject to the navigational servitude meaning that the property interest held by the state is subject to dominant federal right to act in the interests of navigation71 thus under its commerce clause authority when congress regulates waters for their navigability property right is not taken within the meaning of the fifth amendment and compensation is due72 the exact limits of the navigational servitude and whether the regulation or banning of drilling in or under the great lakes is sufficiently relate d to navigability are unclear the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit has held that when regulating the navigable waters the navigational servitude applies despite regulatory purpose that is unrelated to navigation73 under this broad interpreta tion the current ban on oil and gas leasing or permitting in or under the great lakes may not constitute taking however the court of appeals for the fede ral circuit as well as the supreme court has held that the navigati onal servitude applies only wh the government has bona fide navigational grounds for its regulation74 it is arguable that drilling ban could be based on navigationa l grounds certainly the army corps of engineers has claimed that it has regulatory authority over both directional and vertical drilling in the navigable waters under the rivers and harbors act which authorizes the corps to permit obstructions to navigability75 as the case law varies among the courts that have examined the issue and as it is not immediately clear whether ban on drilling would fall under the navigationa l servitude it is unclear wh ether this doctrine would prevent taking from occurringhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33455crs17 76 two threshold matters must exist before successful taking claim can be established the action alleged to constitute taking must be authorized by congress and must be for public use both of these conditions would likely be satisfied in the case of congressional ban on great lakes drilling in general the public use requirement has been deemed relatively low hurdle and will likely be met if the govern ment action is in the public interest see for example kelo v city of new london 125 sct 2655 2005 the public use requirement is rarely an issue when takings are performed by the federal government along these lines it seems likely that multiple justif ications for banning great lakes drilling would satisfy the test such as the encouragement of more efficient oil and gas production or the prevention of environmental harm 77 penn central transp co v city of

preclude fifth amendment taking additional analysis becomes necessary76 taking can occur in variety of manners and ban on leasing or permitting and thus potential drilling like other forms of government regula tion could arguably constitute taking generally for court to find regulatory taking the regulation must result in sufficient deprivation of pr operty interests77 the extent and nature of regulation necessary to establish taking under these circ umstances is however debatable78 as stated in the supreme courts penn central decision these determina tions are generally to be made on casebycase basis focused on analys is of several particularly significant factors namely the nature of the gove rnment action the economic impact of that action and the extent to which the re gulation has interfered with distinct investmentbacked expectations 79 in addition it would appear that generally the economic impact and interference with investmentbacked expectations must be severe for regulation to constitute taking80 takings analysis in this particular context is complicated by the numerous entities with existing property rights in great lakes oil and gas resources the current leaseholders who may or may not be presently engaged in drilling and the states themselves person who acquired lease pr ior to the enactment of the federal ban has obtained right as expressed in the ase that is considered property for fifth amendment purposes81 assuming that the navigati onal servitude does not preclude taking total ban on drilling which would effectively re nder an oil and gas lease valueless might constitute taking as in general the more narrow the property right held the easier it is to prove that taking has occurred however the federal ban currently in pl ace does not appear to affect leases or permits issued prior to the enactment of the 2005 energy policy act thushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33455crs18 82 in michigan for example oil and gas drilling permits are valid for two years if they were obtained after 1995 and if drilling occurs if drilling occurs the permits remain valid until the well is sealed 83 the supreme court has held that the referenc to private

how state courts have interpreted and applie d the decision from tahoesierra preservation council inc v regional planning agency 36 univ of toledo law review 405 414 2005leaseholders with permits in place that are now or might soon begin operating would not appear to have been subjected to taking of any property interest still it is arguable that permit renewal might now be banned by federal law82 further permits necessary for oil and gas development would likely not be issued to current leaseholders who had not obtained permits prior to the ban in these situations the leaseholders may be able to successfully argue that their property interests as expressed in the lease have been rendere d valueless and thus been subjected to taking whether this is the case however would depend on the facts specific to each of the leases whether the current federal ban on lease or permit issuance constitutes taking of the states property right appears more complex83 certainly the states hold title to portions of the great lakes the lake bed and the minerals unde rlying the lakebed it is also arguable that the federal ban on future leasing effectively renders any oil and gas accumulations valueless unless oil and gas can be extracted by nonlease arrangement eg contracting thus if court were to define the relevant property interest for purposes of takings analysis as the oil and gas estate alone it might conclude that taking would occur by virtue of leasing ban however this analysis may be complicated by the application of the whole parcel rule the whole parcel rule as explained by the supreme court in penn central states that taking jurisprudence does not divide single par cel into discrete segments and attempt to determine whether rights in particular segment have been entirely abrogated84 thus in that case regulation affecting only portion of the plaintiffs property leaving the rest unaffected did not constitute taking85 it is thus arguable that taking of the mineral interest does not result in fifth amendment taking because the whole parcel the totality of states rights in the great lakes remains otherwise unaffected while the whole parcel rule is backed by considerable precedent courts have been willing to sever certain propert interests for takings analysis purposes and among those interests is the subsurface mineral estate86 most recently in tahoe sierra preservation council the us supreme court s indicated that it rejects conceptual severance of property rights lthough this case did not address severancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33455crs19 87

taking of state property would be found as result of the current oil and gas leasing ban finally there is another possible argu ment for concluding that any ban on leasing permitting or drilling in or under the great lakes is not taking based on the supreme courts holding in lucas v south carolina coastal commission 88 under lucas taking does not occur even if th total value of property is eradicated by government regulation if the regula tion could have been imposed under the background principles of property and nuisa nce law existing when the property was acquired89 it is arguable that drilling in or under the great lakes could result in pollution or damage that could be re gulated as nuisance under common law several great lakes states ve addressed the issue albe it in different contexts from the present scenario as to whether oil and gas drilling constitutes nuisance these cases would seem to indicate that oil and gas drilling is not nuisance per but that the right circumstances could result in finding that drilling constitutes nuisance90 thus it may follow that the ban on leasing or permitting activities could constituteregulation of nuisance and that ta king has occurred however whether nuisance would exist in this case would ppear to depend on the specific issues drilling ban is intended to address conclusion oil and gas drilling under the great lakes is opposed by many who contend that the potential environmental risks associated with drilling do not justify the potential economic gain proponents of drilling however contend that risks associated with drilling are not high due to advances in drilling technology and safety and that drilling would provide jobs and income for the states where it is done congress has weighed in on these issues and enacted permanent ban on the issuance of new federal or state leases or permits for il and gas drilling in or under the great lakes this ban would only affect drilling in uscontrolled waters of the great lakes and would not affect canadian production
