ing it the federal governments first performancebased organization improving student aid delivery fsa manages and administers all federa lly funded student financial assistance programs authorized under title iv of th higher education act when congress enacted the hea in 1965 two new financial aid programs were also created guaranteed student loans and education pportunity grantsand administration of the federal workstudy program was assigned to the office of education over the years congress established additional f ederal financial aid programs which produced an operation that annually provide s an estimated 55 billion in grants and loans to students and interacts with pproximately 5300 school s 4100 lenders and 36 guaranty agencies4furthermore this operation uses 13

committee on education and the workforces report on hr 6 higher education act amendments of 1998 the need for this provision creating pbohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32098crs3 arises from the inability of the department of education to adequately manage over 40 billion in student financial aid also the departments budget for student aid information systems has tripled over the last 5 years and instead of consolidating its existing data systems the department has i ncreased the number of system contracts that cannot share data with each other t he committee maintained that converting fsa to pbo managed by chief operating officer coo would significantly improve the efficacy and efficiency of student aid delivery and make it less expensive as noted in the hea section 141a2 fsas purposes as pbo are to improve service to students and ot her participants in the student financial assistance programs au thorized under title iv including making those programs more understandable to students and their parents reduce the costs of administering title iv programs increase accountability of the persons responsible for administering the operations of these programs provide greater flexibility in the management of the student aidprograms integrate the information systems supporting the student aidprograms implement an open common integrated system for student aiddelivery and develop and maintain student aid system that contains completeaccurate and timely data to sure program integrity fsa operates as discrete management unit within ed but the secretary of education maintains responsibility for the development and promulgation of policy and regulations relating to these programs however the secretary is directed to consult with the chief operating officer of fsa in developing policies and regulations that pertain to these progra ms discussed later in this report fsa maintains independent contro l of its budget allocations an d expenditures personnel decisions and processes procurement and other administrative and management functions organization upon receiving pbo designation all of the operations and employees from the office of postsecondary education ope that pertained to student financial assistance were relocated to the newly created pbo congress specified that fsa should be headed by nonpartisan indepe ndent chief operating officer each coo is to be appointed by the secretary of education and serve for term of not less than 3 years and more than 5 years however heshe can be reappointed for subsequent terms with the same time restrictions the coo is expected to have demonstrated management experience and ability in inform ation technologyand fi nancial systems the coo serves under the terms of presp ecified performance agreement that identifies measurable goals and expected resultshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32098crs4 as mentioned earlier as pbo fsa s sole discretion over its personnel decisions the coo is authorized to determine the number of senior mangers that heshe needs as well as make appointme nts the selected senior managers are appointed without regard for the provisions of the federal governments competitive service rules under the first coo greg woods fsa was organized into channels that focus on types of customers as opposed to programs the channels are schools students and financial partners by organizing the offices and services by customer types as opposed to program areas customers receive single point of contact for all financial aid matters which is expected to improve customer satisfaction for example the schools channel is responsib for all aspects of the financial aid process that pertain to schools such as fina ncial aid originatio n and disbursement each of the channels is headed by general manager who is responsible for overseeing all of the activities in hisher respective channel congress also required that the newl appointed coo select student loan ombudsman who is responsible for providing assistance to student loan borrowers the ombudsman is charged with informally resolving complaints regarding student loans and compiling and analyzing data and making policy recommendations as necessary to support the efforts of all of the newly established divisions an enterprise service division was created this divisio n consists of offices such as human resources that are re sponsible for h iring new personnel training and developing current personnel and acquiring technolog equipment similar to private sector corporations fsa also has chief finan cial officer cfo who is responsible for management of fsas finances and chi ef information officer cio who handles the acquisition and management of the information systems within fsa as illustrated by figure 1

varied different systems were required to cater to each channels respective customers in addition to aligning the offices and therefore the programs within each office to address the needs of its customers gen eral manager was appointed to each channel and given specific and measurable objectives to improve service for example in the 2003 annual plan the cfo was charged w ith addressing the

2001 the average annual score for federal agencies is 6898 employee satisfaction the initial coo greg woods believed that employees had become mechanical in dealing with the work they were performing he felt that many employees viewed their jobs as simply processing loan and grant papers rather than helping their cus tomers realize their dreams after he developed mission statement we help put america through school he sought to ensure that all employees understood how th eir job contributed to the overall mission and became more dedicated to their work woods utilized fsas score from survey conducted by the national performance review fsa ranked 33 out of the 49 participating federal agencies in terms of how employees viewed the agency as benchmark to gauge the state of employee satisfaction when he arrived woods was the director of npr at the time the surve was conducted the npr survey also indicated that only 60 of fsa employees were satisfied with their jobs one out of four could not identify any of the organizations goals that related to satisfying customers and half of the respondents indi cated that they needed more training9 one of the solutions fsa implemented to deal with the disconnect between employees understanding of hisher positio n and the agencys overall mission was the use of balanced scorecards balanced scorecards enable the agency to retain traditional measures of success such as re duction of costs and supplement them with nontraditional measures such as employee satisfaction fsas model consists of the original three measures of success customer satisfaction employee satisfaction and reduced unit costs added together the output is the performance score it is expected that byplacing equal emphasis upon each measure all employees including senior managers will work to ensure success is achieved in all three areas in addition to emphasizing balance the scor ecard also includes roster of the names of all persons working on particular project the scores they received in previous years on each of the measures and delineated list of all projects that the team is working on the scorecards are intended to provi concise and unambiguous measure of how the group is performing and how each employees work relates to the agencys mission in 2000 fsa began utilizing the ga llup survey of workplace management instead of the previously used npr survey th last reported gallup survey score for 2001 was 374 out of possible 5 the private sector average is 36 reducing costs reducing costs is measure of performance that did not

many state forms of assistance must complete and submit the free application for federal student aid fafsa the fafsa can be submitted via webbased application paper form or electronically with the assistance of s chool financial aid administrator the information that students and parents provide on the fafsa is utilized to determine their eligibility for financial assistance10 in an effort to reduce the costs associated with administering federal financial aid programs webbased financial aid application was introduced the webbased application allows applicants to complete and submit their financial aid application online in addition the webbased application has internal endofentry data edits built into the application that eliminate many of the mistakes associated with the paper version the internal edit system prevents applicants from omitting essential information that is used in calculating the expected family contribution and reduces the possibility of entering illogical information for example if family has an adjusted gross income of 25000 it is not possible to have paid the same amount in taxes the internal edits force the applican t to resolve these inconsistencies prior to submitting the application as result ed spends less money processing multiple applications and returning applications due to errors in draft performance plan for fsa it was noted that electronic applications are as much as 25 times less likely to contain errors than paper applications11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32098crs8 12stephen burd education department offi cial prods

systems integration holds promise gao027but the conversion to the webbased fafsa has not gone smoothly at the 2001 national association of student fi nancial aid administrators annual conference the coo urged administrators to stop ordering so many paper applications and to instead direct their s tudents to the internet greg woods stated that because colleges and universities continue to request the same quantities of paper applications as they had in previous year s students are not being encouraged to use the webbased application this in turn prevents fsa from reducing the number of applications produced12as result of this and other contributing factors such as increased student participation the costs of administering the financial aid programs have actually increased in 2002

aid programs at different times pr oduced multiple nonintegrated tec hnology systems to operate the programs as well as multiple contractors to manage the systems because the systems are nonintegrated they cannot co mmunicate with each other which requires fsa to access multiple systems to retrieve accurate information for each applicant and in many instances there is informa tion redundancy this is also true for the institutions utilizing these systems ins titutions are often required to access multiple systems to enter and retrieve student fina ncial aid data for one student in 1993 the national student loan data system nsl ds was developed as way to integrate these data and simplify the process howe ver nslds functions as repository for each of the separate d atabases as opposed to one integrated database because the systems cannot communicate with each othe r each database must first be updated n dt h nt r n s f r r dt on s l d s n dw i t h different contractors and different scheduled database upda tes conflicting data are still possibility maintaining multiple systems with several contractors also significantly contributes to the costs of administering the financial aid programs rather than purchase one system that could manage all title iv programs an expensive alternative fsa opted to utilize middleware middleware is system that serves as conduit between multiple technology sys tems and enables them to communicate with each other if used in conjunction with webbased interface middleware presents the user with an integrated view one of the most important features of middleware is that data can be retrieved from multiple sources in timely manner fsas technology modernization effort s taken several steps to achieve full integration and interoperability

sel ected program and policy matters policymaking and promulgation authority title i part d section 141b of the hea states that the secretary shall maintain responsibility for the devel opment and promulgation of policy and regulations relating to the programs of st udent financial assistance under title iv this language has been interprete d to define fsas responsibilities as programmatic oroperational and eds or more specifically opes as policy oriented in the early development stages of the pbo some c oncern was expressed that the delineated roles for the pbo and ope were being blurred16offices such as guarantor and lender oversight service were moved to t he pbo although these offices clearly dealt with policy and promulgation subse quently many of the offices were moved back to ope however few offices with po licymaking and promulgation functions such as institutional eligibility remain in the pbo the advisory committee for student financial assistance acsfa contends that all policymaking functions should reside with ope in letter to senator kennedy january 10 2002 acsfa recomme nded that all policy functions should be returned to ope but that the assistant secretary of ope should consult with fsa to ensure that proposed policy decisions s upport the operations of the financial aid programs alternatively former secretary riley maintained that having the

footnote 13 according to the afor ementioned gao report employees of both fsa and ed admitted that the absence of mou between the two under the current administration has presented struggle over the pbos independenc and how it fits into the agencys structure fafsa on the web fsa promotes the usage of fafsa on the web as means of reducing the costs of administering the financial aid programs in addition because the webbased application provides an efficient and reliable way to complete and submit the financial aid application institutions and applicants are stronglyencouraged to utilize the online application while the number f online filers continues to increase yearly there are still numerous families tha t do not have access to the internet in recent pew internet and american life survey april 2003 it was f ound that individuals with lower incomes and less education are still significantly less likely to use the internet students from families with lower incomes and less education are also more likely to need financial assistance to attend college the advisory committee on student financial assistance recommended that ed continue to make the paper fafsa available ed must continue to make the paper fafsa available in timely and efficient manner firstgeneration college students and their families may be uncomfortable completing the webbased form and prefer to complete the paper form19 the tension that the pbo confronts is between cost reduction and ensuring that the financial needs of lowinc ome students are addressed
