effects on working caregivers employers and federal policy march 3 2003 linda levine specialist in labor economics domestic social policy division congressional research service the library of congress family caregiving to the elderly by employed persons the effects on working caregivers employers and federal policy summary many trends have combined to prompt concern about whether the supply of family caregivers to the elderly will be sufficient to meet demand one trend the increased commitment of women to the labor force has proved worrisome because of their major role in unpaid caregiving caregiver to frail elder is quite often married woman who is middleaged daughter if her mother is deceased although studies tend to confirm that paid work lessens the likelihood of daughter becoming an informal caregiver many employed women nonetheless assist older relatives friends and neighbors some analyses find that fulltime work in particular decreases the time spent caregiving the reduction in caregiving hours could be mitigated if care users have multiple unpaid helpers however the comparatively low fertility rate of the baby boom generation suggests that there will be fewer potential caregivers per recipient in the coming decades elders could hire home care workers to compensate for needs longer being met by unpaid caregivers but this might strain their budgets and cause them to enter nursing homes which could raise government spending coverage of home care services could be expanded to offset reduction in family caregiving but this too would affect the governments budget despite their multiple responsibilities employed caregivers spend many hours assisting elders in order to do so they often make workplace adjustments eg arrive lateleave early and take leave just as accommodation of employees informal caregiving to paid work may affect the budgets of elders and of government so too might the adjustment of work to caregiving affect various parties the productivity of caregivers could be reduced by their concern over frail parents living alone for example caregiving could also increase employers costs if they must replace employees who take leave or quit the earnings and retirement income of caregivers who choose to sharply cutback their supply of labor could be reduced as well this might not only diminish their own standard of living but also lead to increased government dependency slower growing labor force also could curb the rate of economic growth and hence of the nations standard of living congress passed legislation to encourage caregivers to continue working by making it easier for them to fulfill their many commitments the family and medical leave act fmla provides jobprotected unpaid leave to eligible employees at covered employers so that they might among other things care for parents and spouses with serious health conditions in addition congress turned to the tax code to offer employees incentives to start or continue caregiving the dependent care tax credit and the dependent care assistance program caregivers to the elderly regardless of employment status also may receive assistance through the national

the elderly by employed persons the effects on working caregivers employers and federal policy family members most often fulfill the nonmedical needs of frail older adults who live in their own homes or those of relatives in the first half of the 1990s for example family members accounted for 72 of unpaid and paid caregivers to functionally impaired persons over age 70 living in the community1 in particular women often wives daughters and other female relatives comprised 58 of informal unpaid caregivers to the noninstitutionalized population age 65 or older who required longterm care2 yet over the last several decades women have become more attached to the paid labor force as result the rate of fulltime employment rose from 230 in 1984 to 275 in 1994 among female primary caregivers to chronically ill or disabled elderly parents and spouses living in the community the share of female secondary caregivers employed fulltime rose from 492 to 5603 the reallocation of womens time among family and household obligations paid employment and leisure could affect the availability and intensity of informal caregiving to elderly relatives friends and neighbors indeed between 1984 and 1994 the share of potential spouse and adult child caregivers who actively provided longterm care to chronically ill or disabled elders declined4 some analysts have argued that given womens greater labor force participation and other sociodemographic factors that could constrain the future supply of family caregivers eg lower birth rates in addition to the expected increase in demand for elder care

or disabilities comprised the potential caregiving population crs2 aging babyboom generation we can longer expect to rely on informal caregivers to bear the burden of longterm care without support structures and incentives in place eg respite care services and preferential tax treatment5 observers often focus their attention specifically on the sandwich generation of caregivers which is term applied to those trying to meet the demands of their children and older relatives the babyboom generation now in its late 30s through mid50s is the group most likely to be devoting time and financial resources to care for older and younger family members while also holding jobs some babyboomers delayed childbirth and consequently are raising children while their aging parents are still alive for example 44 of babyboomers between 45 and 54 years old reported in 2001 that they had at least one child under age 21 and living parent6 in contrast the cohort that preceded the babyboomers is less likely to have many working members given their ages and for the same reason to have both dependent children and living elderly relatives although generation x parents also are less likely to have functionally impaired older family members more of them could well become caregivers as their babyboom relatives age7 thus informal caregiving to the elderly often has been characterized as an intergenerational issue rather than as womens issue per nonetheless the trend toward greater employment among women has spread the impact of elder care beyond caregivers and care recipients to include employer organizations from the employer perspective elder care will be to the 21st century what child care was to the last few decades8 some companies have modified their human resources programs to reflect employees family responsibilities and thereby to maintain productive workforce among other things family friendly employers have made such adjustments as initiating flexible work schedules providing elder care resource and referral services and offering longterm care insurance9 the effects of employees assisting older relatives friends and neighbors extend beyond the workplace if for example informal caregivers sharply reduce their hours of employment in order to strike better balance between work and family responsibilities the supply of labor would be reduced as would the employed caregivers earnings the former could limit the rate of us economic growth and hence of improvement in national living standards the latter could diminish caregivers retirement income which in turn might decrease tax revenues and 5 linda s noelker the backbone of the longtermcare workforce generations spring 2001 and lisa alecxih the impact of sociodemographic change on the future of long

government if publicly funded programs were substituted for once free home care services this report begins with discussion of the size and characteristics of the population providing unpaid help to frail older adults living in the community and then narrows its focus on subset of this population namely employed informal caregivers the report next expands upon the abovementioned implications of unpaid caregiving for the employees providing assistance their employing organizations and society it closes with an overview of the approaches that employers and the federal government have taken to help employed elder caregivers the size and characteristics of the informal elder caregiving population in order to determine the number and characteristics of informal caregivers to older adults living in the community one first must have definition of caregiving the choice of definition greatly influences estimates of the number of family caregivers the magnitude of burden on individuals families employers and the society and the costs of different policy options10 consensus on the definition of informal elder caregiving is lacking however caregivers have been defined by their relationship to care users eg exclude friends and neighbors caregivers also have been defined based on the amount of assistance provided eg limit helpers to those who provide the most assistance namely primary caregivers in addition the characteristics of care users have served as criteria eg setting minimum age for care users definitions have been framed as well in terms of the timing of the help eg when the survey is being administered or at some point during the preceding year further the definition of care has ranged from broad to narrow an example of the latter is specifying that the older adult cannot perform without personal assistance one or more basic or instrumental activities of daily living adlsiadls adls include eating dressing bathing and toileting iadls include doing housework and laundry preparing meals shopping taking medications and managing finances how many are there due in part to the absence of commonly shared definition of elder care estimates of the size of the elder caregiving population range from between 59 10 robyn stone defining family caregivers of the elderly implications for research and public policy the gerontologist vol 31 6 dec 1991 crs4 million and 7 million individuals11 to 224 million households with at least one care provider12 the surveys from which these estimates were developed differ in many respects some of which are identified below the lower figures were derived from the governmentfunded 1994 national longterm care survey nltcs the nltcs is nationally representative household survey of medicare beneficiaries age 65 or older who live in the community and who must have assistance in order to perform one or more adls or iadls because of illnesses or disabilities that have lasted or are expected to last at least 3 months ie chronic conditions13 members of the nltcs sample are asked to identify the primary and secondary informal caregivers currently assisting them who then are queried14 informal help means providing handson assistance to the disabled elder eg performing light housework15 and supervising their performance of adls or iadls eg reminding them of the order in which clothes should be put on the higher figure was developed from nationally representative telephone survey of englishspeaking households that was sponsored by the national association of caregivers nac and aarp it asked in 1996 whether there was someone in the household who was currently assisting or who had within the past 12 months assisted persons age 50 or older who needed help caring for themselves minimum duration of impairment is required therefore the higher estimate includes caregivers to individuals with acute but shortterm conditions eg the flu16 the survey has broad definition of help as well eg respondent could identify herself as caregiver if she visited an elderly person to check on them 11 spector et the characteristics of longterm care users and us department of health and human services informal caregiving compassion in action 1998 hereafter cited as hhs informal caregiving 12 national alliance for caregiving nac and aarp family caregiving in the us findings from national survey june 1997 hereafter cited as nac and aarp family caregiving in the us 13 if respondents say that they do not usually perform particular iadl but could if they had to they are not counted as being limited in that activity the adls common to both nltcsbased studies are eating getting inout of bed dressing bathing toileting and getting around indoors the iadls common to both nltcsbased studies are light housework laundry meal preparation shopping getting around outdoors money management taking medications and using the telephone 14 the core nltcs which was administered in 1982 1984 1989 1994 and 1999 asks less indepth information about informal caregivers than is gathered through the surveys less frequently administered companion the informal caregiver survey 15 both nltcsbased studies excluded care recipients who only required help performing heavy housework according to spector et the characteristics of longterm care users the estimate of care users would have been 75 higher had these individuals been taken into account 16 more than onetenth of caregivers in the nacaarp survey reported that their care recipients illnesscondition was expected to last less than 3 months crs5 the difference of approximately one million between the two lower estimates of caregivers illustrates the importance of definitions in estimating the size of the family caregiver population one of the iadls asked about in the nltcs is transportation ie the ability to go places beyond walking distance the estimate of 59 million caregivers excludes older care users who only had difficulty with transportation and hence excludes their caregivers the estimate of more than 7 million caregivers includes them17 what are their characteristics number of elements affects who becomes an informal elder caregiver and particularly who becomes the primary helper these elements include whether an individual has time available to provide care whether he or she is willing to do so on an uncompensated basis how much the potential helper is concerned for the well being of the person in need and how close he or she lives to the care recipient18 not surprisingly then the marital status of care users is an important indicator of who will be their primary family caregiver when available spouse provides the majority of care in the absence of spouse daughter is most likely to assume the role in the absence of daughter will assume the role although there is considerable evidence that sons transfer many care tasks to their spouses in the absence of offspring more distant family members become responsible the person designated to be the primary caregiver also tends to be the person with the fewest competing family or work obligations19 marital status affects other characteristics of the informal caregiving population if spouses provide assistance they more often live with the care users20 typically spend longer hours 4060 week on average providing care and more often perform such tasks as meal preparation and personal care eg bathing and toileting in contrast adult children generally spend fewer hours 1530 week on average and their efforts are concentrated on such activities as shopping and 17 crs discussions with the reports authors determined this to be the likely explanation for much of the discrepancy between the two nltcsbased estimates 18 marc cohen maurice weinrobe

washington sept 2001 hereafter cited as montgomery and kosloski change continuity and diversity among caregivers 20 spousal caregivers who accounted for 234 of all primary and secondary caregivers to communitydwelling chronically disabled elders in 1994 all lived with their mates according to spector et the characteristics of longterm care users in contrast 151 of all caregivers were adult children living with the care recipient and 106 more distant relatives coresiding with care users crs6 transportation21 although not as often living with their care users they tend to reside nearby22 nonspousal caregivers also are more likely to be working perhaps 24 times more likely according to one estimate23 spousal caregivers typically gave retirement as their reason for longer working thus their withdrawal from the labor force probably was more related to age than to their caregiving obligations24 typically the share of elder caregivers with paid jobs decreases with age according to the nacaarp survey slightly more than threefourths of caregivers between 18 and 49 years old worked compared to 60 of those between 50 and 64 years old and to 12 of those age 65 or older25 the kinship relationship between primary caregivers and elderly care users may be affected by the availability of private longterm care insurance as shown in table 1 private insurance claimants more often had spouses as their primary caregivers compared to uninsured frail elders 53 and 38 respectively because spouses can supplement their caregiving efforts with those of home care workers the authors suggest that these spouses could be better able than the uninsured to avoid shifting to others eg daughters the major role in informal care provision26 however while both samples included similar proportions of married couples there might have been other differences between the two groups that influenced the kinship relationship between care user and caregiver27 21 montgomery and kosloski change continuity and diversity among caregivers 22 according to the nacaarp survey excluding the 21 of care users age 50 or older who lived with their care providers 55 resided within 20 minutes while only 6 resided more than 2 hours away 23 metropolitan life insurance company the metlife study of employed caregivers does long term care insurance make difference 2001 hereafter cited as mlic the metlife study of employed caregivers 24 cohen et informal caregivers of disabled elders 25 caregivers in the nacaarp survey tend to be younger than those in the nltcs due to their different definitions of care users as result the share of caregivers with jobs is likely to be higher in the former survey the average age of caregivers in the nacaarp survey was 46 years old the age distribution of elder caregivers in the nltcs is shown in table 2 26 cohen et informal caregivers of disabled elders 27 for example if relatively more marriedcouples in the longterm care insurance claimant sample were younger more spouses in the insured group than in the noninsured group might have been capable of assisting their mates thus age could have affected the kinship relationship

least 65 years old and identified by their insurance companies as having already received at least one payment for homecommunity based services the claimants and the primary informal caregivers they identified were surveyed between november 1997 and february 1999 b recipients not likely to be privately insured were derived from the 1994 nltcs specifically they were medicare beneficiaries age 65 or older who required assistance with at least two of six adls or who were cognitively impaired consistent findings across surveys reveal that married women particularly daughters often are informal primary and secondary caregivers see table 228 among primary caregivers in contrast spouses are more prevalent than daughters see table 1 between 1984 and 1994 sons share of primary caregivers to frail elderly parents and spouses rose by 50 nonetheless in 1994 sons comprised just 15 of primary caregivers compared to the daughters share of 3529 in addition to their gender adult childrens marital status influences whether they assist their parents and the amount of care they provide unmarried children more often help their parents and they generally spend more hours doing so30 leaving aside marital status and other potentially intervening variables eg the care users degree of disability women spend significantly more time than men caring for older adults 188 and 155 hours per week

derived from the 1994 nltcs were medicare beneficiaries at least 65 years old who needed assistance performing one or more of six adls or of eight iadls crs9 one discrepancy between surveys in caregiver characteristics is the prevalence of the sandwich generation which is probably most related to the varying minimum ages used to define care users caregivers identified by surveys with higher age cut offs are older themselves the older the providers in turn the less likely they are to have competing child care responsibilities for example 41 of caregivers to persons age 50 or older had children under age 18 living at home31 alternatively only 6 of primary caregivers to private longterm care insurance claimants age 65 or older had children under age 25 living with them32 similarly 79 of primary caregivers to chronically ill or disabled parents or spouses age 65 or older also had children under age 1533 studies of workers found relatively few members of the sandwich generation among them according to families and work institute survey the minority of working parents 20 who provided care to children and to someone age 65 or older were estimated to account for 9 of employed us wage and salary workers34 another analysis similarly concluded that 9 of the workers at 33 employers who were surveyed belonged to the sandwich generation35 employed informal caregivers to the frail elderly the implications of individuals having work and family commitments could intensify if the share of workers with elder care obligations grows as anticipated according to one estimate 42 of us wage and salary workers expected to provide informal elder care during the 19972002 period up from the 25 who had done so at some time in 199636 work and elder caregiving empirical analyses of employed caregivers to the elderly typically study women given their predominance in the general caregiver population the focus of studies often narrows to adult daughters who are more likely to be employed than women from earlier generations these analyses tend to conclude that daughter having paying job reduces her probability of caring for parent with the daughter who 31 nac and aarp family

all informal caregivers to older adults are working with 64 estimated by the nacaarp survey to have paying jobs nonetheless employed elder caregivers represent minority of us workers the size of the minority ranges widely one fourth of us employees had provided special attention to or care for someone 65 years or older at some time during the year before administration in 1997 of the families and work institutes nationally representative telephone survey of households with wage and salary workers age 18 or older38 the survey found about half as many workers 13 were providing informal help at the time of their interviews researchers who examined 17 studies from the 1980s that measured the prevalence of informal elder caregivers in the us workforce concluded that the wide range of estimates from 19 to 460 was associated with bias due to nonresponse and with differences in definitions of caregiving tentative reestimate of the studies findings narrowed the variance in the proportion of employees who are elder caregivers to between 74 and 11839 unlike in the overall caregiving population and unlike the findings of some other studies of employed caregivers the families and work institutes survey showed women and men comprising fairly equal shares of employed elder caregivers 52 and 48 respectively hours of caregiving and of employment despite the claims on their time made by paid work and familyhousehold obligations employees spend many hours providing unpaid services to older adults they average 11 hours per week assisting elderly relatives friends and neighbors according to the families and work institute survey the survey also found that employed women and men spend similar amounts of time in this endeavor in contrast other sources estimated that working women devote significantly more time than men to elder care after variety of mediating factors are taken into account eg personal and jobrelated characteristics 37 maaike g h dautzenberg jos pm diederiks hans philipsen fred cj stevens frans tan and myrra jfj vernooijdassen the competing demands of paid work and parent care research on aging vol 22 2 mar 2000 38 some other studies estimated

force population research on aging vol 14 3 sept 1992 crs11 of the caregiver characteristics of the care recipient and characteristics of the caregiving situation40 there has been particular interest in elder caregivers with fulltime jobs because they could have more difficulty reconciling their multiple roles the nacaarp survey found that small majority of all caregivers work fulltime 52 when the sample is confined to primary caregivers to frail parents and spouses however the rate of fulltime employment was estimated to be much lower 27241 this disparity is perhaps due to primary elder caregivers often being spouses who are themselves elderly and thus likely to be retired42 indeed fulltime jobholding was estimated to be more than twice as prevalent among secondary caregivers 589 who often are middleaged children43 although fulltime employment also appears to be more common among longdistance caregivers than among all caregivers on average over 60 and over 50 respectively most employed longdistance caregivers say they have family members or friends living within an hour of the care recipient who help them with caregiving44 if individuals can share elder caregiving responsibilities then fulltime workers might more easily balance their family and work responsibilities however the comparatively low fertility of babyboomers suggests that the pool of potential family caregivers per recipient will shrink in the next 2030 years45 for this reason some believe the unmet needs of elders could grow in future years all else remaining the same one means of employees reconciling their work and caregiving obligations would be to cut back the amount of informal help given to elders some empirical studies found little difference in the time devoted to care regardless of the caregivers employment status or hours worked but others came to the opposite conclusion based on data from the 1989 nltcs informal caregiver survey for example employed female primary caregivers to elders unable to perform adls and iadls provided 18 hours per week of assistance on average 16 hours by fulltimers and 21 hours by parttimers female primary caregivers who were not working for pay helped an average of 33 hours per week the disparity between the amount of care 40 see for example margaret b neal berit ingersolldayton and marjorie starrels gender and

population cosponsored by the national council on aging and the pew charitable trusts defined longdistance caregiving as requiring the caregiver to travel at least one hour to reach the care recipient caregiving was defined as providing or managing care services or financiallegal assistance of persons age 55 or older 45 spillman and pezzin potential and active family caregivers crs12 provided by employed and nonemployed caregivers narrowed when other variables were taken into account despite the diminution in the gap working women particularly those employed fulltime were found in this analysis to provide significantly fewer hours of care however the care recipients of employed female primary caregivers were able to completely offset the 666 fewer caregiving hours per week by relying more on informal secondary caregivers and on formal caregivers46 another study similarly found that the fulltime employment of primary mostly female caregivers to very disabled elders reduced caregiving time by 25 hours per week in 1982 and by 22 hours per week in 1989 the 3hour difference was not statistically significant nor was the increase in the share of primary caregivers employed fulltime from 158 in 1982 to 193 in 1989 at least during the 1980s then the adverse effect of fulltime employment on caregiving hours appears not to have intensified these findings suggest that fulltime employment of primary caregivers has not worsened unmet need for assistance47 the researcher noted two factors on the demand ie need side that might compensate for decreases in the future availability of family caregivers namely rise in the use of assistive equipment and decline in the disability rate of the elderly48 the effects of elder caregiving employees employees may reconcile their work and caregiving obligations by cutting back hours of employment according to the nacaarp survey 54 of employed caregivers to older adults make some type of workplace adjustment to accommodate their elder caregiver role changes to the daily work schedule are the most frequently noted with 49 of employed elder caregivers arriving late or leaving work early far fewer stop working briefly 11 took leave of absence or permanently 6 quit and 4 retired early about 7 take other measures to reduce workplace demands such as switching to parttime jobs studies based on more restrictive definitions of caregiving yield similar results49 46 doty et the impact of female caregivers employment status 47 boaz fulltime employment and informal caregiving in the 1980s 48 kenneth g manton and

the potential working caregiver population was composed of those who were employed or who said they would be employed had they not been providing care crs13 results are mixed concerning the impact of these workplace adaptations on the supply of labor by caregivers ie rate of participation in the labor force and number of hours worked and on their financial condition the differences among studies could be related to such factors as whether the caregiver resides with the care user the number of caregiving hours the relationship of the caregiver to the care user and the sex and age of the caregiver50 wages and retirement income one recent analysis based on data from the health and retirement study nationally representative longitudinal survey looked at women and men who ranged from 53 to 65 years old in the mid1990s and who were caring for parent51 it estimated that daughter who assisted her parents either with adls or iadls for at least 100 hours in 12month period significantly curtailed her supply of labor by 459 hours year the cutback by who similarly helped parent was virtually the same at 462 hours year given the gender difference in total hours worked the figures represented 28 reduction in paid work hours for men and 43 reduction for women fairly few people nearing retirement in the mid1990s spent 100 or more hours providing care to parents during the course of year however the opportunity cost was high for those who did the researchers estimated that the reduced hours of working women who devoted great deal of time to parental care late in their worklives produced an average loss in pretax wages of about 7800 year in 1994 dollars the opportunity cost of providing informal assistance could extend beyond caregivers working years social security benefits might be depressed due to lower lifetime earnings and fewer total years of employment52 private pension benefits might be reduced for similar reasons these costs have rarely been quantified the nac and national center on women and aging at brandeis university attempted an estimate utilizing information gathered from indepth interviews of small subset of participants in the nacaarp survey

nonpecuniary impact employed caregivers to the frail elderly could experience other financial costs which might in turn have nonpecuniary effects employees report paying for such things as the food transportation and medication needed by care recipients some say these outofpocket payments on behalf of elders mean less money for their own savingsinvestment and for current expenses55 although caregiving seems to be less of financial hardship for working than for nonworking caregivers56 the results of study of female elder caregivers at 37 workplaces suggest that such economic consequences may significantly affect whether employees feel carerelated strain57 gender appears to be an important moderator of elder caregivings potentially adverse impact on the wellbeing of unpaid helpers for example an empirical analysis of elder caregiving among universitys workers determined that women feel significantly more role strain family work and personal and more caregiving strain physical emotional and financial than men58 other studies concluded that women particularly daughters and daughtersinlaw are more apt than men to make workplace adjustments59 and that these accommodations significantly increase caregivers burden emotional physical and time strains60 working caregivers are less likely than others to experience physical or mental health problems due to elder care

caregivers included in one study reported other positive effects including elder caregiving making them more sensitive to the feelings and needs of their customers and co workers or by helping them to feel more competent in their ability to handle difficult problems for most respondents combining work and caregiving seemed to have both positive and negative implications62 employers in addition to curtailing their hours of employment to accommodate elder care commitments employees sometimes conduct care activities while at work they may use work time to telephone care recipients or to search the internet for elder care information these activities could diminish job performance as could having difficulty concentrating fully on the task at hand because of concern about parent living alone for example it is widely acknowledged that workplace adaptations to elder caregiving impose financial burden on employers cost estimates have rarely been made because of lack of good data in order to develop an estimate the metlife study of employer costs for working caregivers pulled together data from variety of sources eg nacaarp survey respondents employed fulltime who performed at least two adls and at least four iadls and 1995 study prepared for the metropolitan life insurance company on the prevalence of workplace adjustments among respondents to three employerbased surveys according to the analysis elder caregiving cost employers over 11 billion per year 1142 per employee due to its impact on employee productivity and managementsupervisory time the total is the sum of the expense of replacing workers eg recruiting and training costs as well as the lower productivity of newhires compared to experienced workers 49 billion of full and partday absences 886 million of ordinary workday interruptions eg work time spent in carerelated telephone calls 38 billion and workday interruptions prompted by crises eg parents having to move into an assisted living facility 11 billion and of supervising employed caregivers eg providing them with emotional support arranging coverage for their absences and advising them about available benefits 805 million63 some believe this to be conservative estimate because it does not consider such things as leaves of absence and the increased utilization of health services by employees due to their caregiving duties the estimate also excludes caregivers employed parttime longdistance caregivers and those who provide less intensive assistance to older adults if all these additional employed caregivers were included in the calculations the total costs to us business of employees having elder care responsibilities would exceed 29 billion per year64 61 fredriksengoldsen and scharlach families and work 62 andrew scharlach

ibid crs16 another study examined the cost to business of one health condition closely associated with the elderly namely alzheimers disease ad the authors note that because they base business cost upon the 4 million people currently estimated to have the disease they believe it to be conservative figure in light of the large baby boom cohort not yet having reached the typical ages of vulnerability65 some research has found evidence of declining cognitive impairment among older persons however66 in 2002 ad caregiving was estimated to cost business 611 billion67 this is double the aforementioned figure of at least 29 billion caregiving to ad patients by employees estimated at 365 billion represents the largest portion of the 611 billion total of the 365 billion 102 billion is associated with absenteeism 180 billion with lost productivity due to absenteeism 63 billion with replacing caregivers employed fulltime and parttime who permanently leave their firms each year 07 billion with the fees paid to agencies for temporary replacement of caregivers on leave who usually work fulltime and 12 billion with continuing the insurance of these caregivers and 006 billion with the additional utilization of employee assistance programs by those caregivers employed fulltime who have access to the programs the remainder of the cost to business 246 billion largely comes from estimated employer payroll and corporate tax payments to medicare and medicaid for example for the health care costs of persons with ad 244 billion society as previously discussed individuals may reconcile their work and elder caregiving roles by making adjustments to one or both obligations that is to say they may cut back the amount of labor andor of unpaid caregiving supplied the economic consequences of individuals reducing their employment are borne not only by their families eg lower incomes and lost health benefits but also by society slowdown in the rate of labor force growth absent productivity improvement would dampen the rate of increase in the production of goods and services and hence in the us standard of living in addition the forgone earnings and retirement income of employed caregivers who substantially reduce their work time or totally withdraw from the labor force could translate into reduced tax revenues and increased government dependency if employed caregivers take the latter course namely greatly limiting the amount of elder care provided both older members of society and government could experience financial impact if the frail elderly had needs that longer were being met by family members they might try to hire home care workers group already considered to be in short supply at present government programs typically cover limited amount of inhome assistance to the nonpoor elderly which suggests that 65 michael j moore carolyn w zhu and elizabeth c clipp informal costs of dementia care estimates from the national longitudinal

dementia care crs17 the budgets of low and moderate income elders could be the most strained by reduced supply of unpaid caregivers without an ample supply of free or publicly subsidized home care frail elders living in the community presumably would have to move into more expensive settings where substantial percentage of the cost would be borne by taxpayers to forestall elders making moves that would be costly to the public the government could expand coverage of home care services but replacing the free assistance that families provide to older adults would not be without considerable expense there are differing estimates of the economic value of informal caregiving the variability stems from among other things the care recipient population under consideration some analyses look at all adults or only older adults with particular disease eg cancer or alzheimers68 among studies that developed an economic value for broader group of care users eg all adults regardless of the condition giving rise to their need for assistance results differ because the researchers used varying estimates of for example the number of hours of informal caregiving and of the hourly wage rate applied to caregivers time eg the federal minimum wage or the average wage of home health workers according to one analysis the economic value of informal caregiving to adults in 2000 was 140 billion 257 billion or 389 billion depending upon the number of caregivers 254292 million caregiving hours 2427 billion and the proxy for their hourly wage rate 515124669 other researchers put the market value of informal assistance to adults who need help with adls or iadls at approximately 166 billion they estimated the number of caregiving hours to be 187 billion and used 9 as the hourly wage rate which was between the federal minimum wage of 515 per hour and the average wage of home health workers 11 per hour in 199670 thus the economic value of informal care provided to adults is estimated to greatly exceed the cost of either formal home care 32 billion or nursing home care 92 billion 68 moore zhu and clipp in informal costs of dementia care noted the wide range of estimates of the annual cost of informal caregiving to alzheimers patients living in the community from 12730 to 57937 per patient they included in their own estimate not only caregivers time but also their lost income outofpocket expenditures for formal services and caregivers excess health care costs the authors found that the average value of informal assistance to communitydwelling alzheimers patients totaled 18385 per person in 1998 the largest component costs were caregivers lost earnings 10709 and the cost of caregiving time 6295 which varied based upon the severity of dementia 69 presentation by peter

employers and public programs in the interest of such things as maintaining productive workforce holding down turnover costs offering competitive benefit package and being responsive to aging employees needs some employers have changed their human resources policies benefits and services to accommodate the caregiving roles of employees in some instances labor unions have negotiated with management to attain these changes for the workers they represent employers and unions sometimes have invested in communitybased services in order to increase the availability of elder care caregiver advocacy groups have encouraged the enactment of legislation that supports all individuals who provide unpaid assistance in recognition of the cost savings to taxpayers of family caregiving and of the need to promote an ample supply of labor from the smaller cohorts that antedated the babyboom generation congress has enacted legislation to facilitate familywork balance and to otherwise promote informal assistance to frail elders workplace initiatives generic workplace policies that can be useful to elder caregivers include flexible and compressed work schedules parttime hours job sharing leave time telecommuting and management training in worklife issues employers also provide benefits that similarly can be useful to elder caregivers among other employees eg counseling commonly offered through employee assistance programs flexible benefitspending plans and longterm care insurance the provision of services is another means by which employers can assist specific groups of employees including elder caregivers services include providing educational information through onsite libraries and seminars for example sponsoring resource and referral services as well as wellness programs and establishing or subsidizing day care and respite care71 the prevalence of elder care programs has been on the rise although companies may prefer to expand the availability of programs that are useful to elder and child caregivers as well as to other members of firms workforce according to hewitt associates analysis of salaried employee benefit plans 49 of 960 major us employers had elder care programs in 2002 in contrast 74 of employers offered alternative work arrangements including flexible work schedules and parttime jobs paid time off from work has long been the benefit most commonly offered by employers eg vacations holidays and to lesser extent sick leave however one form of time off family leave is much more likely to be offered on an unpaid than paid basis72 the most common elder care benefit is widely reported to be resource and referral services for example the hewitt study found that 32 of major companies offered contract referral services and another 6 had inhouse resource and referral 71 neal and wagner working caregivers 72 us bureau of labor statistics employee benefits in medium and large private establishments 1997 crs19 services perhaps 25 of workers had access to elder care resource and referral services according to the families and work institute survey although 40 of employers actually offer dependent care spending accounts to pay for elder care expenses according to hewitt the accounts rarely are used for this purpose because of eligibility requirements in federal law these taxfavored accounts are discussed in the following section perhaps reflecting one studys finding that the availability of longterm care insurance increases the likelihood that elder caregivers will remain in the labor force73 27 of major companies offered the benefit in 2002 according to hewitt in the public sector the federal government began to offer longterm care insurance as benefit effective in 2003 employees and eligible family members who opt to enroll must pay the entire insurance premium according to us bureau of labor statistics national compensation survey data for 2000 7 of employees had access through their private sector employers to longterm care insurance employees of firms with at least 100 workers who worked fulltime in professionaltechnicalrelated occupations were more likely to have access to the insurance access differs from enrollment however more than two thirds of nonenrolled employees at nine firms of varying size and type that offer longterm care insurance stated they would be more interested in enrolling if their employer contributed to the policy premium and almost three out of five non enrollees said if the government allowed them deduction from income tax for premium costs it also would increase their participation74 just as cost influences the inclination of employees to elect longterm care insurance coverage it also affects the willingness and ability of employers to offer direct services to elder caregivers making such professionals as geriatric case managers and lawyers available to assist caregivers could prove expensive if their services are paid entirely by employers the differing needs of working caregivers also may make it difficult for firms to determine the services that are worthwhile investments eg relatively few caregivers in given workforce might want to enroll care users in onsite adult day care75 73 according to mlic the metlife study of employed caregivers caregivers to communitydwelling persons age 65 or older who have limitations in at least two adls or who are cognitively impaired are almost twice as likely to be employed if the elder has long term care insurance all other things being equal 74 health insurance association of america who

metropolitan life insurance company dimensions of family caregiving look into the future papers presented at national conference in washington dc sept 12 2000 crs20 federal government initiatives mandated leave the federal government has taken number of paths to make it easier for workers to continue their elder caregiving and other commitments one such avenue is the family and medical leave act fmla it requires private employers with at least 50 employees and public employers regardless of size to extend jobprotected unpaid leave to employees who meet lengthofservice and hoursofwork eligibility requirements the 12weekperyear leave entitlement is available to covered eligible employees to care for their own spouses childs or parents serious health condition or to care for their newborn newly adopted or newly placed foster child accrued paid leave eg vacation generally can be substituted for leave under the act employers must maintain group health benefits while employees are on fmla leave according to us department of labor survey workers do not often use fmla leave to care for seriously ill parent employees reported attending to their own health as the predominant reason for taking leave under the act in the late 1990s 378 with caring for parent involved in only 106 of fmla leaves this nonetheless represents an increase from an earlier survey when there were too few instances to report accurate figures76 some states have enacted familymedical leave laws and some employers offer familymedical leave benefits that are more expansive than those provided through the fmla eg cover smaller firms and additional reasons for leave employees in those jurisdictions and at those employers are entitled to the more generous benefits tax policy the dependent care tax credit dctc is available to taxpayers with earned income for the workrelated expenses they incur caring typically for children the credit also may be claimed by employed taxpayers who have dependents living in their homes or spending at least 8 hours day in their homes and who are physically or mentally unable to care for themselves these restrictions represent significant barriers to the use of the program by those caregiving to older adults who are for the most part residentially and economically independent77 the dctc is nonrefundable which means its value is limited to the filers income tax liability families with tax liability that it is entirely offset by their standard deduction and their personaldependent exemptions would not benefit from the credit for example marriedcouple with young child and dependent frail elder in their household having an income of up to 19850 in 2002 would have tax liability due to these factors 76 for more information see crs report rl30893

link between personal troubles and public issues research on aging vol 32 3 may 2001 crs21 qualifying expenses cannot exceed the earned income of the taxpayer or the earned income of the lower paid spouse in the case of married couple for 2002 the dctc is equal to 30 of qualifying expenses up to 2400 for one dependent 720 and up to 4800 for two or more dependents 1440 the subsidy rate is gradually reduced for taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes agi that exceed 10000 until it reaches 20 for taxpayers with incomes over 28000 beginning in 2003 taxpayers will be able to claim credit of 35 of qualifying expenses up to 3000 for one dependent 1050 and 6000 for two or more dependents 2100 the stated subsidy rate of 35 will gradually fall for taxpayers with agis above 15000 until it reaches 20 the dependent care assistance program dcap enables employees to exclude from gross income up to 5000 annually 2500 for marriedcouples filing separately in employer dependent care assistance when determining their income tax liability the excluded amount is not subject to employment taxes of the employee or employer the exclusion applies to both care provided by employers and to arrangements whereby employees are reimbursed for their qualifying expenses the latter is the more common approach both arrangements often are funded through salaryreduction plans that enable employees to pay care expenditures with pretax dollars as in the case of the dctc it has been said that dcaps are of limited usefulness for employees caring for disabled adult because irs regulations require that the dependent must spend at least eight hours day in the employees home be unable to care for himself or herself and must be financially dependent on the employee78 the care must be performed by person who is not dependent of the taxpayer eg someone other than nonworking spouse the amount of the exclusion cannot exceed the earned income of the taxpayer or the earned income of the lower paid spouse in the case of married couple both the dctc and dcap can be used in the same year but the maximum qualifying expenses for the dctc must be reduced by the amount of the tax exclusion grant programs congress created the national family caregiver support program nfcsp as an amendment to the reauthorization in 2000 of the older americans act it has five components information to caregivers about services help with gaining access to services individual counseling assistance with developing support groups and caregiver training respite care and supplemental services eg
