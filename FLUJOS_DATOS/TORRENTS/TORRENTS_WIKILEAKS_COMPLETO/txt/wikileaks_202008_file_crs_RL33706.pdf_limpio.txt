time has come and that this legislation is crucial to the publics awareness of supreme court proceedings and their impact on the daily lives of all americans2 public opinion surveys indicate incr

airing radio broadcasts of old oral arguments for several years in few cases the court has released audiotapes the same day as the oral arguments occurred eg bush v gore in 2000 addition some advocates of electronic medi coverage of federal court proceedings have said that advanced technology can give americans virtual front row seat in courtroom via television and other electronic formats such as the internet they contend that in technical sense opening the courtrooms to the public by electronic means is now perhaps more feasible eg through the use of small and unobtrusive cameras5 opponents of such coverage howev er are concerned that it could have detrimental effect on court proceedings and could raise security and privacy concerns6 this report begins by discussing the cu

views of proponents and opponents on myriad issues in the electronic media coverage debate democratic values of government transparency separation of powers due process integrity of court proceedings

courtroom to cover its proceedings however opinions and transc ripts of oral arguments are posted on the supreme courts website nd audiotapes of oral ar guments and opinions are available to the

and would benefit from the views of his colleagues on july 13 2006 chie f justice roberts appearing at the 2006 ninth circuit court of appeals judicial conference was asked which he thought the public would see first the televising of federal civil jury trial or supreme court proceeding the chief justice replied as follows thats tough question in either case theres concern about the impact of television on the functioning of the in stitution both the civil trial and the supreme court argumentall of the justices view themselves as trustees of an extremely valuable institution one that we think by and large functions pretty well the oral argument is valuable nd important part of that and were going to be very careful before we do anything that will have an adverse impact on that and i think that same perspective applies to the civil trials i appreciate very much the argument that the public woul d benefit greatly from seeing how we do things he also said that the expedited release of audio recordings of oral arguments in number of cases this year has had ge nerally positive effect because people are learning little about how the supreme court functions however the chief justice also expressed some reservations we dont have oral arguments to show people the public how we function we have them to learn about particular cas in particular way that we think is important so thats certainly something th at we have to look at very carefully in the same token that i think the judicial conference has to look at very carefully when it comes to civil trials as well8 district courts and courts of appeals9 television and other electronic media covera ge of federal dist rict trial court proceedings is prohibited in criminal cases under current federal rules and for civil and criminal proceedings under the policy of the judicial conference of the united states since 1946 federal rule of criminal procedure 53 has prohibited the district courts from allowing the taking of

from the panel hearing the case 15 whether courts of appeals may allow electr onic media coverage of both criminal and civil appeals appears to be somewhat open to interpretation criminal rule 53 has been interpreted to legally preclude the televi sing of criminal direct appeals 16 each circuit has its own judicial council c onsisting of the chief judge of the circuit and an equal number of court of appeals and distri ct judges from that circuit the judicial council has authority to make all necessary and appropriate orders for the effective and expeditious administration of justice within its circuit 28 usc section 332d1 in september 1994 the judicial conf erence considered recommendation by its court administration and case management committee11 to authorize the photographing recording

tested the efficacy of electronic media coverage of civil proceedings in six district and two appellate courts14 criminal trial proceedings were not covered as part of the pilot that fjc study recommended that federa l courts of appeals and di strict courts nationwide be authorized to allow camera access to civil proceedings however on the basis of the data presented the conference concluded that the intimidating effect of cameras on some witnesses and jurors was cause fo r concern and declined to approve the recommendation to allow cameras in civil proceedings under judicial conference policy dopted by resolution on march 12 1996 each court of appeals was authorized to decide for itself whether to allow the photographing and radio and levision coverage of appellate argu ments subject to any restrictions in statutes national and local rules and guidelines the conference might adopt15 the judicial council16 of each circuit was urged to adopt orders reflecting the conferences decision to da only the second and the ninth circuit courts of appeals have chosen to allow cameras into their courtrooms with each having established guidelines for its respective circuit

of judge diarmuid f oscannlain of the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit on behalf of the judicial conference of the united states nov 9 2005 senate hearing p 46 22 in 1972 the judicial conference had dopted prohibition against broadcasting televising recording or taking photographs in the courtroom and areas immediately adjacent thereto that applied to both civil and criminal trial proceedings in canon 3a7 of the code of conduct for united states j udges in 1990 the canon was struck from the continuedcamera coverage of all open court proceedings except criminal matters17 similarly the ninth circuit permits cameras in civil proceedings including habeas corpus cases but prohibits cameras on direct appeals of criminal cases18 the second circuit guidelines authorize the panel assigned to hear the oral argument to prohibit at its sole discretion camera coverage of any proceeding and normally to use this authority upon the request of any panel member in practice the presiding judge makes the decision but often confers with the other panel members in making the decision19 the ninth circuit guidelines provide that the presiding judge of the panel may limit or terminate coverage to protect the rights of the parties or to ensure the orderly conduct of proceedings in the 1996 resolution the conference so strongly urged 1 each circuit judicial council to adopt an order reflecting this decisi on with regard to appellate court proceedings and 2 each circuit judi cial council to adopt an order reflecting the september 1994 conference decision not to permit the taking of photographs or radio and television coverage of court proceed ings in district courts and to abrogate any local rules of the court that conflicted with the decision20 most judicial councils have either adopted resolutions prohib iting cameras in the district courts or acknowledged that there is already prohib ition in given circuits district courts21 the guide to judiciary policies and procedures provides guidance on the policies promulgated by the administrativ office of the us courts and approved by the judicial conference the guides policy on the use of cameras in the courtroom

1751 in every congress since the 105th congress although hr 1280 in the 105th congress did not include provisions to obscure the images faces and voices of witnesses andor jurors which were included in some of the later versions sen charles grassley with sen charles schumer sponsored s 829 similar to hr 2422 and hr 1751 s 829 is identical to other bills sen grassley has sponsored in each of the past three congresses since the 106th congress sen arlen specte r sponsored legislation s 1768 to require the televising of supreme court procee dings which is identical to the bill he first introduced in the 106th congress s 3086 over 25 years ago in the 96th congress rep frank j guarini jr sponsored resolution hconres 4 44 to express the sense of congress that the supreme court should televise its oral arguments to broaden the publics access to them but action was taken on the resolution the conferences position on televising court proceedings was applied to pending legislation on may 25 2006 in letters to senate judiciary co mmittee chairman specter and certain other committee members the director of the administrative office of the us courts expressed the conferences strong opposition to pending legislation s 829 b ecause it would allow the use of cameras in federal trial proceedings its opposition was based on concerns that broadcasting the court proceedings could have an intimid ating effect on litigants witnesses and jurors in addition the conference stated its concern that some participants in the proceedings might grandstand and that the pr ospect of televising could also be used as negotiating tactic in pr etrial settlement discussions eg party might choose not to exercise the right to go to trial because the trial would be televised the conference maintained that s 829 could imp air the fundamental right of citizens to fair trial and also could undermine the safety of judges and trial participants the conference further opposed the legislati on because it would change the current practice of leaving the decision to be made by each court of appeals legislation in the 109th congress in the 109th congress four bills hr 2422 hr 4380 s 829 and s 1768 have been introduced related to televisi on or other electronic media coverage of federal court proceedings another bill hr 1751 as introduced did not provide for electronic media coverage of judicial proceedings but was later amended to do so the five bills differ substantially regarding number of issues including which courts are covered just the supreme court or district nd appellate cour ts as well the types of media that are included just television or other type s of media as well and whether the electronic media coverage is simply authorized thereby leaving it up to the individual courts to decide or generally required the five bills are similar or identical to legislation introduced in previous congresses since at least the 105th congress23

party to the case would have hisher face and voice be obs cured during testimony hr 1751 would also extend to jurors the same right in addition the language in hr 1751 provides that the presiding

httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33706crs11 27 nov 9 2005 senate hearing p 14arguments for and against electronic media coverage whether to allow television and other ectronic coverage of supreme court and other federal court proceedings is debate that essentially balances the concerns about the adverse impact cameras could have in the courtroom with those about greater public access to judicial proceedings several issues are involved including democratic values of gove rnment transparency separa tion of powers due process integrity of court proceedings security and civic education although the following discussion separates the opponents from pr oponents it should be noted that many believe there are legitimate arguments on both sides in fact some who have taken position on one side of the issue recognize that the other side has valid reasons for taking the opposite view opponents potential for adverse effects on judicial proceedings the supreme court has noted that pretrial publicity can cause tensions to develop between the right of the accused to trial by an impartial jury and the rights guaranteed others by the first amendment nebraska press association v stuart 427 us 539 551 1976 this suggests the possibility that ex cessive publicity coul d give rise to due process problems in particular situati ons and to permit cameras in courtroom during trial would arguably cause excessive publicity in some cases the judicial conference of the united states has opposed televising federal court proceedings due to concerns that the f undamental right of citiz ens to fair trial might be impaired and because of the in timidating effect it mig ht have on litigants witnesses and jurors in both civil and criminal trial proceedings moreover the conference has

grandstanding senator orrin hatch said judges are not politicia ns they should not be making speeches from the bench senator jeff sessions sa id that political pressure should not be placed on the courts and that there was strong opposition to cameras in courts from judges prosecutors and defense lawy ers senator tom coburn noted concern that televising proceedings would focus on the performance of lawyers not the defendants and said that it will ruin the third branch of government in relation to the intimidating effect cameras could have on litigants witnesses and jurors senator sessions expressed the need for caution as the televising issue was considered he said the supreme court obviously has begun to loosen up some they have allowed their arguments to be taped and produced but they likewise have given this consideration quite number of times nd have concluded that they do not wish their lawyers and the process to be levision show and they would prefer it to be focused on the law of the casethat in the evaluation of it i think the least detrimental would be the supreme court the next least detrimental consequences perhaps would be the courts of appeals and the most detrimental from my perspective would be the trial courts30 judge edward r becker former chief j udge of the us court of appeals for the third circuit expressed concern th at judges might

the ad ministration be lieves section 22 has the potential to influence court proceedings unduly and to compromise the security of participants in the judicial process the administration looks forward to continuing to work with congress to address constitutional issues raised by certain provisions of this bill and to enhance judicial security through this bill and other measures33 separation of powers concerns particularly with regard to legislation mandating coverage of the s upreme court some believe the decision as to whether the courts proceedings should be televi sed should be decision for the court to make not one that congress should legi slate justices anthony kennedy and clarence thomas have both expressed concer ns about the possible effect of such mandate on the separation of powers for example justice kennedy said it is not for the court to tell congress how to conduc t its proceedingswe feel very strongly that we have intimate knowle dge of the dynamics and the mood of the court and we think that proposals mandating and directing television in our court are inconsistent with the deference and etiquette that should apply between the branches34 potential for misinterpretation some believe that televising oral arguments or portion of the proceedings could lead to misinterpretation of the way the courts operate justice kennedy and others have said that oral arguments do not give the complete picture of the suprem courts work and constitute only small portion of its decisionmaking process the justices do most of their work in solitude reading writing consid ering voluminous documents before deliberating with the other justices in conference justice scalia expressed similar concerns that even if proceedings were televised gaveltogavel the vast

exchange between justice and lawyer simply doesnt convey that idea at all and i think also in some jurisdictions where they have tried televi sing theres feeling that it affects the way at least the lawyers behave and i suspect it may affect the way judges behave too35 former chief judge becker also believed that televising proceedings could mislead the viewer who might not fu lly understand the dynamics of the oral argument process he explained the oral argument process is very intense rigorous its rough judges play devils advocate sometimes you deride counsels argument so as to bring him or her out and to test the argument you do it to both sides security and privacy concerns at the april 2006 house subcommittee budget hearing justice thomas maintained that televising the courts proceedings could result in the justices losing degr ee of the anonymity that they now have and that the loss could raise security issues36 these concerns arose in the context of larger security concerns about court security some mainta in that security is serious concern for judges prosecutors witnesses jurors and court staff involved in both civil and criminal trial courts as evidenced by recent violent attacks on judges and court personnel veral highprofile shootings and murders of judges court personnel and their families just ce the beginning of 2005 underscored the gravity of the security issue death thr eats made against justi ces and other judges have continued to ge nerate great concern37 the judicial conference opposed s 829 in part because of concerns that court security could be undermined the conf erence said it believed that broadcasts showing images of judges and court empl oyees would make them more vulnerable as targets because they could be more easily identified and could result in increased threats against judges lawyers and other pa rticipants in the courtroom including law enforcement officers and personnel such as us marshals us attorneys and

television which for almost everyone is the closest thing to actually being in the courtroom some also contend that open proceedings lead to fair trials and further strengthen democratic society among

concluding observations the debate on televison nd other electronic media c overage of supreme court and other federal court proceedings continue s the issue is far from being resolved given on the one hand the strong advocacy of the sponsors of the legislation and the media and on the other nd the oppositi on and reservations expressed by some supreme court justices and others with respect to legislation concerning television or other electronic media coverage of federal court proceedings c ongress could consider range of options for example the legislation could address coverage of only the s upreme court only other appellate courts only federal district courts or some combination of these courts include only civil cases only criminal cases or both civil and criminal cases either authorize or require such coverage or vary depending on the type of court for example such coverage could be encouraged for supreme court proceedings but mandated for all other federal courts where electronic media coverage is not required allow the presiding judge eg the chief justice of the supreme court to decide whether to allow such coverage permit majority of judges on court to decide or allow single judge on an appella court to bar such coverage provide for only television coverage of federal court proceedings or allow or require other types of electronic media coverage eg photographing audiotaping or combination of such options other options such as live cove rage or delayed broadcasting for release the next day or at some future predetermined date might also be considered mandate that electronic media coverage of federal court proceedings require obscuring the images faces andor voices of all litigants witnesses and jurors when requested to protect their identities or only some of these persons eg only witnesses another option to provide measure of security nd privacy could be to prohibit televising closeups of judges ttorneys court personnel and law enforcement officers including us marshals and court security officers at all proceedings make television or other electr onic media coverage permanent or limit the coverage to specific time period or number of sessions per year for example pilot program for the supreme court couldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33706crs19 provide for live audiotaping of set number of proceedings or televising three oral arguments during court term for release at the end of the term both types of broadcast could be followed by an assessment of the experiences include provisions for the establishment of guidelines for the management and administration of electronic media coverage of federal court proceedings for example the judicial conference of the united states could be required to promulgate guidelines based on recommendations by its committees eg the committee on court administration and case ma nagement other options for formulating the guidelines coul d include input from the federal judicial center and th judicial council of each circuit guidelines could also be modeled after those already established by the second and ninth circuit courts of appeals the guidelines could be advisory or mandatory for all cour ts or could leave the decision to each circuit potential costs and implementation issues the congressional budget office concl uded that s 829 and s 1768 would not have significant impact on the federal budget nevertheless implementation of legislation requiring televisi on or other electronic media coverage of federal court proceedings is likely to have some associated costs with those costs varying according to the nature and scope of the legislation eg whether the requirements apply to only the supreme court or to all fe deral courts it is unclear whether the courts would be expected to absorb thos costs or whether they would be borne by the media also unclear are various relate d implementation issues including whether the courts or the media would provide and control the equipment and personnel needed to provide the prescribed coverage if the courts provided these resources would they provide pool feed to all dia or only selected media eg cspan or court tv if the media provided thes resources how would they be selected and what authority would the courts have to control camera movement or to enforce any prohibitions regarding security policie s and procedures these and other issues would have to be resolved before television or other ectronic media coverage could begin other potential approaches to the extent that further information and reflection are needed regarding the impact that television or othe r electronic media coverage could have on federal court proceedings various options are available for example congress could establish bipartisan commission to examine the potential impact of televising federal court proceedings the commission could compri members from both the judicial and legislative branches and could seek the vi ews of the media public citizens groups and scholars as well as retired judg and former members of congress likewise to address concerns that television coverage could lead to misinterpretation of the way the courts operate efforts could be made to educate thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33706crs20 51 for example sen specter has been schedulin g lunch with the justices to discuss issues of mutual interest see

reenactment or simulation and what path cases take in the two to three months following the oral arguments as the courts work progresses until decisions are made and opinions are written then publicly read such contextual approach in the justices own words to characterize the work of the supreme court could provide an educational experience for the public congress and the supreme court have expr essed desire to st rengthen relations between the legislative and judicial branches as evidenced by statements of members of congress and the chief justi ce as well as efforts made by both members and justices to meet more frequently to discuss issues of mutual concern51 such discussions could further mutual understanding and perhaps lead to some common ground for addressing the concer ns of both members and justices about televising the proceedings of the nations highest court
