method by which committees collect and analyze information during the legislative policymaking process whether confirmation hearingsa procedure unique to the senatelegislative oversight investigative or combination of these all hearings share common elements of preparation and conduct senate rule xxvi sets forth many of the hearing regulations to which committees must conform including the quorum requirement advance submission of witness statements the opportunity for minority party senators to call witnesses of their choosing and procedures for closing hearing to the public senate committees guided mainly by their chairmen have broad discretion in how they conduct hearing in part because the committees adopt their own rules of procedure these rules may supplement senate rules but they can not contravene them committee customs and leadership style not embodied in rules also vary considerably among committees and influence hearing procedures committees usually plan extensively for hearings early planning activities commonly include collecting background information preparing preliminary hearing memorandum for the chair and members discussing the scope of the hearing and the expected outcome scheduling and providing public notice of hearing selecting w itnesses determining the order and format of their testimony and preparing questions or talking points for committee members to use in questioning witnesses other considerations include preparing briefing books determining whether the hearing will be broadcast and alerting the media and attending to the many administrative arrangements such as reserving hearing room scheduling hearing reporter and arranging for there to be video or audio recording of the proceeding or written transcript that will be available to the public soon after the event on the day of the hearing committee needs quorum to proceed with testimony while the vast majority of hearings are open to the public committee can vote to close hearing for specific reasons stated in senate rules senators typically make opening statements at the beginning of hearing then witnesses are introduced and may be sworn by the chair witnesses present oral testimony in accordance with an arranged format this testimony generally is summary of written statement submitted in advance the question and answer period that follows is an opportunity for committee to expand upon witnesss statement and gather information to support future actions following day of hearings committee staff may prepare summary of testimony draft additional questions for the days witnesses and begin initial preparation of the transcript for printing while not required hearing transcripts commonly are printed along with additional materials approved by the committee this report will be updated as events warrant httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30548g10g142g138g155g146g151g144g156g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g23g495g21g495g561

xxvi in particular details hearing procedures each committee is required to adopt and publish written rules of procedure consistent with senate rules committee can expand upon rule xxvi committees rules also generally apply to its subcommittees but may also contain procedures that apply specifically to subcommittees the rules of many committees contain provisions for hearings and this report gives examples from the 109 th congress these examples are illustrativ intending to show variations in particular areas in some cases several committees have similar provisions but only one committee is presented as an example this report does not attempt to list comprehensively all provisions of committee rules that apply to hearings further the summaries of both senate and committee rules are not intended to capture every nuance and detail of the rules senators and staff are advised to consult the text of the appropriate senate or committee rule in addition to senate and committee rules this report covers common practices in planning and holding hearings which may vary significantly among committees senators and staff are advised to contact specific committees for detailed information on their rules and practices the report is organized into four main sections this introduction addresses the role of hearings in the committee process types of hearings and broad organizational issues committees plan carefully and deliberately for hearings section two of this report preparation for hearings discusses the planning process among other topics this section covers deciding whether to hold hearing sources that assist committees with hearings obtaining supplemental staff by contract or detail holding joint hearings prohibitions on when committees may meet

techniques committees use in policymaking and oversight congress benefits from hearings in variety of ways they inform senators staff and the public about issues and legislative proposals and orchestrate public support and attract visibility for an issue they also serve to mon itor government programs and activities and expose problems congress may seek to remedy finally hearings give citizens an opportunity to participate in the policy process and help build public record senate committees hold hearings on measures referred to them committees can also hold hearing absent any specific legislation as oversight an investigation or simply to inform for number of reasons senate committees act on relatively small portion of the measures introduced and referred to them for instance committee often receives many proposals in the major policy areas within its jurisdiction but ultimately chooses if it decides to act on only limited number of measures in policy area when committee does act it can send bill to subcommittee for initial consideration although this is not required by senate rules committee may decide to send bill to subcommittee for initial scrutiny because of the technical nature of the issue the history of prior referrals and political factors among other reasons when committee or subcommittee considers measure it generally may take four actions as described below where subcommittee initiates some of the four actions the extent

committees from issue to issue and according to time and workload pressures the sequence of actions assumes the committee favors measure but that can change and at any time the committee may discontinue action first committee may seek agency comment by sending copy of the measure to the executive departments or agencies having relevant expertise soliciting their written evaluation of the proposal the executive agency typically sends the measure and draft comments to the office of management and budget omb to determine if it is consistent with the presidents budget and legislative program second committee may decide to hold one or more hearings further committee action without hearings is the exception although committee hearings have sometimes been bypassed in order to move legislation more expeditiously or because of action on related bill in previous congresses the importance of the hearings stage is stated by congressional scholar walter j oleszek the decision to hold hearing is often critical point in the life of bill measures brought to the floor without first undergoing the scrutiny of hearings will likely receive sharp criticism the importance of the committee stage is based on the assumption that the expertsthe committee memberscarefully scrutinize proposal and hearings provide demonstrable record of that scrutiny 2 third committee may meet to mark up or recommend amendments to the legislation in part based on information received at hearings markup is the critical stage where committee decides how the language of the bill should appear when it is presented to the senate for consideration while committee amendments must be ratified by the full senate committees have the important prerogative of shaping legislation prior to senate floor consideration fourth the full committee may report the legislation to the senate floor when committee reports measure it is common but not required to issue written report that describes and explains measures purposes and provisions and presents the committees case for the measure g22g162g153g142g156g561g152g143g561g10g142g138g155g146g151g144g156g561 all hearings share common elements of preparation and conduct some of these are governed by senate rules particularly senate rule xxvi at the same time procedures and practices among committees may differ for number of reasons first each committee must adopt its own rules of procedure each congress rule xxvi paragraph 2 these must be consistent with senate rules but may also expand or elaborate on them committee rules often contain provisions regulating hearings second customs not necessarily reflected in committee rules vary among committees for example committees differ in how they recogn ize senators and accord them

purpose hearings can be grouped into four broad classes legislative oversight investigative and confirmation sometimes one may serve multiple purposes eg both legislative and oversight committees hold legislative hearings on measures or policy issues that may become public law sometimes committee holds hearings on multiple measures before ultimately choosing one or more vehicles for further committee and chamber action hearings provide forum where facts and opinions can be presented from witnesses with varied backgrounds including members of congress and other government officials interest groups and academics as well as citizens likely to be directly or indirectly affected by the proposal oversight hearings review or study law issue or an activity often focusing on the quality of federal programs and the performance of government officials hearings also help ensure that the execution of laws by the executive branch complies with legislative intent and that administrative policies reflect the public interest oversight hearings often seek to improve the efficiency economy and effectiveness of government operations significant part of committees hearings workload is dedicated to oversight for example on single day september 30 2004 subcommittee of the senate committee on commerce science and transportation held an oversight hearing on internet domain names the committee on governmental affairs held subcommittee oversight hearing on college savings plans and the committee on energy and natural resources held an oversight hearing on is sues related to lowlevel radioactive waste many committees oversee existing programs in the context of hearings on related legislation or routinely perform oversight when it is time to reauthorize program so oversight hearings may be combined with legislative hearings 3 investigative hearings share some of the characteristics of legislative and oversight hearings the difference lies in congresss stated determination to investigate usually when there is suspicion of wrongdoing on the part of public officials acting in their official capacity or private citizens whose activities suggest the need for legislative remedy congresss authority to investigate is broad and it has exercised this authority since the earliest days of the republic its most famous inquiries are benchmarks in american history credit mobilier teapot dome armymccarthy watergate and irancontra investigative hearings often lead to legislation to address the problems uncovered judicial activities in the same area of congresss investigation may precede run simultaneously with or follow such inquiries4 confirmation hearings on presidential nominations are held in fulfillment of the senates constitutional advice and consent responsibilities each senate committee holds confirmation hearings on presidential nominations to executive and judicial positions within its jurisdiction 5 these hearings often present an opportunity for oversight into the activities of the nominees 3 see also crs report rl30240 congressional oversight manual by frederick m kaiser et 4 see also crs report 95464 investigative oversight an

hearings are routine some are controversial6 similarly the senate as required by the constitution must consent to the ratification of treaties negotiated by the executive branch with foreign governments on june 17 2004 for example the committee on foreign relations held hearing on series of law enforcement treaties on march 23 2004 the committee on environment and public works held hearing on the united nations convention on the law of the sea although not as numerous as confirmation hearings these hearings also allow the senate to meet its constitutional responsibilities in an important area of public policy field hearings are congressional hearings held outside washington the formal authority for field hearings is found implicitly in the chamber rules senate rule xxvi paragraph 1 states that committee is authorized to hold hearings at such times and places during the sessions recesses and adjourned periods of the senate as it sees fit in the 109 th congress on may 2 2005 the committee on indian affairs held hearing at the north dakota state capitol on youth suicide prevention field hearings are often held in geographic area where the subject matter of the hearing is particularly relevant for example on july 5 2005 the committee on commerce science and transportation held field hearing in anchorage alaska on alaska aviation while field hearings may involve some matters different from washington hearings most of the procedural requirements are the same fundi ng for committee travel however must meet regulations established by the senate committee

evaluate the policy matters or political message it wishes to communicate and then determine whether hearing is the best approach for achieving its goals hearing agenda is influenced by several factors including the salience of issues to the nation the importance of policies to interest groups and matters of significance to the president senate leaders committee leaders and particular members programs under committees jurisdiction that need to be reauthorized generally receive committee scrutiny as do instances of reported waste fraud or abuse each committee receives dozens sometimes hundreds of proposals for possible examination and may study matters not embodied in specific legislation given the context of its overall workload committee must decide whether holding hearing is the best use of its resources committee must also consider whether and how hearing w ould fit into its overall agenda committees with broad jurisdictions often struggle to allocate limited resources and balance the political and policy demands of its membership 6 see also the confirmation process section in crs report rl30240 congressional oversight manual by frederick m kaiser et

presents multiple witnesses with diverging viewpoints as panel it is practice in these cases for all the panel members to make statements then for committee members to pose questions to the panel some

adopt resolution allowing the senate legal counsel to obtain court ruling deciding whethe r an individual must comply with subpoena committee staff commonly consult with experts to gather information in preparation for hearing more formal means of obtaining informa tion for investigative hearings in particular is through the use of depositions under this method committee staff will commonly take

how hearings are broadcast some committees provide minimal formal guidance for example the committee on appropriations provides that if member of an appropriations subcommittee objects to photography or broadcasting of an open hearing the matter is referred to the full committee for decision the rules of the committee on energy and natural resources provide that the media must position their equipment so as not to block staff or senators or otherwise interfere with the orderly process of the hearing other committees have more fully developed rules the committee on finance requires that hearing broadcast must be approved by the co mmittee chair following request filed with the staff director at least day before the hearing the committees rules also cover installation of broadcasting equipment and additional lighting in the hearing room and the right of witnesses to decline to be photographed or have their images televised select committee on ethics rules require that personnel providing broadcast coverage be accredited by the radio and television gallery and that photographers be accredited by the press photographers gallery committee press aides usually are responsible for planning media coverage for hearing and they typically employ number of techniques for attracting and managing the media in some cases press aides in senators personal offices take similar actions on behalf of individual and committee members often an early objective is to seek the assistance of the senate daily press gallery the periodical press gallery the radio and television gallery and the press photographers gallery the mission of the gallery staffs is not only to facilitate coverage of senate activities on behalf of the media but also to assist committee members and staff with their media responsibilities gallery staff can assist committees in variety of ways by distributing

involving camera crews and making pool arrangements for maximum television coverage some committees routinely mail calendars informing the media of upcoming events the information typically includes list of hearings and description of each emphasizing why the hearing is important for each hearing these calendars provide the date time and location as well as staff contact press releases are standard format for informing journalists of newsworthy committee activities in addition to committees press list press releases also can be distributed to committee and personal offices and the senate press galleries the radio and television gallery requests 25 copies of news releases notices of committee meetings and hearings and notices of press conferences the senate daily press gallery requires 4050 copies of press releases if the release is regional in scope the periodical press gallery requests 25 copies of press releases language from press releases can be used to draft dear colleague letters and statements for use in committee and on the senate floor committee staff often prepare media packets prior to hearings the packets can include variety of material such as statements by the committee chair and other members list of witnesses and copies of written testimony and background material such as press clippings and support agency studies as the day of hearing approaches reporters often will seek out staff for information many committees prefer that journalists discussions with staff be on background and not for attribution speaking for attribution usually is limited to committee members press conferences are common technique for personally informing journalists of issues in an upcoming hearing and for clarifying issues i mmediately following hearing some senators prefer to meet informally with reporters others prefer more structured environment formal press conferences may be held in the multimedia studio in room s325 in the capitol press secretaries are advised to contact the radio and television gallery staff in advance to ensure that the desired studio time is available according to the 1996 edition of the us senate handbook 11 only members of the press can reserve studio time and press secretaries should contact an accredited member of any congressional media gallery to secure an invitation to the studio ordinarily only members of congress may be in terviewed in the studio exceptions must be authorized by the executive committees of the congressional galleries when studio appearance is scheduled notice is posted through the senate electronic bulletin board and displayed in all of the congressional media galleries senators also may schedule appearances in the senate daily press gallery although television cameras are not permitted there these appearances do not require an invitation from members of the press 12 in recent years committees have publicized their hearings on their committee websites see

made before hearing and these usually are handled by committees administrative staff two important matters are reserving hearing room and arranging early in the planning stage for reporter of debates if committees own hearing rooms are unavailable committee may request room from another committee or senate office while rooms may be occupied or administered by other offices or committees they are subject to the rules and administration committees policies for the use of senate rooms senate committees are authorized to hire reporters of debates and other stenographic assistance from private firms pursuant to 2 usc 68c the committee on rules and administration determines the rate of pay for these services and provides guidelines for their employment the committees regulations are printed as regulations governing rates payable to commercial reporting firms for reporting committee hearings in the senate and copies are available from the committee under new rule adopted by the senate in the 110 th congress all committees and subcommittees must take care to obtain either video or audio recording or transcript of the hearing which must be available on the internet later than 21 business days after the event occurs this rule applies to business meetings as well this rule does apply if the hearing is closed or if the committee or subcommittee obtains waiver from the senate committee on rules and administration based on technical or logistical reasons such transcripts and recordings are to remain available until the end of the congress following the meeting 13 many administrative details concern the physical setup of the hearing room these include arranging items on the dais such as nameplates writing materials water and ice supplying the chair with gavel block and timer providing the chair and other members with materials not included in the briefing books such as copies of committee and senate rules reserving seats for the press staff witnesses or other individuals and arranging for audio consoles microphones and lighting if necessary security during the hearing can be provided by the capitol police sufficient copies of materials such as statements of senators and witnesses should be provided for distribution during the hearing g8g146g142g149g141g561g10g142g138g155g146g151g144g156g561 field hearing presents administrative and planning considerations different from those for washington hearings these include identifying the city district or state and the specific location for example federal building school or private venue where the hearing will be held it may be necessary for staff to travel to the field location day or more before the hearing to make certain arrangements are to the committees satisfaction including the specific layout of tables and chairs 13 this is the new section to the senates standing rule xxvi 5e2 also found in sec 513 of pl 11081 formerly s 1 the honest leadership and open government act of

system and the technicians to operate it security personnel also need to be arranged funding for committee travel must meet regulations established by the rules and administration committee and compiled in chapter ii appendix d of the us senate handbook of particular importance to committee holding field hearing is section vif hearing expenses this section authorizes committees under certain conditions to pay the expenses of official reporters for travel to the site of the field hearing where field hearings involve oversight of federal agency it may be possible under committees oversight authority to request that the agency provide transportation for committee members and staff usually such requests require letter from the committee chairman to the agency head expenses incurred by senator or staff aide attending field hearingincluding transportation lodging meals and incidentals such as parking chargesare reimbursable by the committee holding the hearing automobile rental s are also reimbursable providing the car is only used to transport senators and committee or personal staff authorized by the committee for travel for other matters relating to expenses and reimbursement for travel to and from field hearing staff should consult senate regulations or the rules and administration committee g5g152g151g141g158g140g157g146g151g144g561g10g142g138g155g146g151g144g156g561 as discussed above hearings involve considerable preparation by the day of the hearing senators and staff expect that important requirements of senate rules such as publicly announcing hearings have been met critical decisions such as choice of and format for presenting witnesses have been made necessary research has been conducted and relevant materials assembled in briefing book briefings may have been conducted for senators staff witnesses and the press administrative issues ch as arranging for reporter of debates have been addressed with thorough and careful preparation most hearings can be expected to proceed routinely senators and staff sometimes confront unanticipated events that require change in plans such as need to call additional witnesses or to close session to the public g19g158g152g155g158g150g156g561 each committee can determine the number of members required for taking testimony in hearings rule xxvi paragraph 7a2 with few exceptions senate committees allow one senator to take sworn and unsworn testimony for instance the committee on appropriations permits one senator to take unsworn testimony but sworn testimony requires three senators however one senator is sufficient to take sworn testimony at an appropriations subcommittee hearing the committee on armed services requires three senators to take sworn testimony one of whom must be from the minority party unless majority of the committee orders otherwise the committee on health education labor and pensions allows one senator to conduct hearing with the approval of the chair in order to ta ke sworn testimony however three members of the committee are required although with the concurrence of the chairman and the ranking minority member one senator may hear subpoenaed witnesses or take sworn testimony the committee on rules and administration requires two senators to take sworn testimony and one senator to hear unsworn testimony

meetings may however be closed for specific reasons stated in senate rules rule xxvi paragraph 5b committee may close hearing if it 1 involves national security information 2 concerns committee personnel management or procedures 3 invades the personal privacy of an individual damages an individuals reputation or professional standing or charges an individual with crime or misconduct 4 reveals identities or damages operations relating to law enforcement activities 5 discloses certain kinds of confidential financial or commercial information or 6 divulges information that other laws or regulations require to be kept confidential the senate rules also contain specific procedure for closing hearing by motion of any senator if seconded committee may close session temporarily to discuss whether there is need to close hearing for any of the reasons stated above if so the committee can close the hearing by majority roll call vote in open session by this procedure committee can close hearing or series of sessions on particular subject for more than 14 calendar days g25g146g157g151g142g156g156g561g20g146g144g145g157g156g561 witness may refuse to testify on the grounds that such testimony may tend to disgrace him or otherwise render him infamous 2 usc 193 witnesses at senate hearings receive protections mainly through their rights under the constitution and rules adopted by individual committees constitutional protections include the first fourth and fifth amendments while committees may seek documents from witnesses the fourth amendment prohibits unreasonable search and seizure to obtain information the first amendment protects witnesses who may seek to refuse compliance with committee subpoena by claiming that the committee has infringed on the witnesss right to free speech assembly or petition under the fifth amendment protection against selfincrimination witnesses cannot be compelled to give evidence against themselves unless granted immunity among committee rules several provide witnesses with right to counsel the committee on homeland security and governmental affairs allows counsel to be present and to advise witnesses of their legal rights if witness is an officer or employee of the government or of corporation or association the chair may determine that representation by counsel from the government corporation or an association repr esenting other witnesses creates conflict of interest and may order that the witness be represented by committee staff or by personal counsel several senate committees have rules that prohibit the release of confidential testimony unless it is authorized by majority of the committee the finance committee gives witnesses the right to request that cameras be turned off if they do not wish to be televised while testifying 14 14 see also constitutional and common law testimonial privileges of witnesses section in crs report 95464 continued

the chair the ranking member of the majority party is authorized to preside rule xxvi paragraph 3 the rules of several committees provide that if neither the chair ranking majority member nor any other member of the majority is present then the ranking minority member present may preside the committee on homeland security and governmental affairs provides that if the chair or his designee is absent 10 minutes after the scheduled time of the hearing then the ranking majority member present can preside if member of the majority is present then with prior approval of the chair the ranking minority member present may open and conduct the hearing only until member of the majority arrives to begin the hearing the chair commonly makes an opening statement introducing the subject and purpose of the session the chair may describe important events leading to the hearing and key contemporary issues he or she also may outline the committees approach to the issue procedure for interruptions such as for roll call votes and the schedule of future hearings when finished the chair generally recognizes the ranking minority member to make an opening statement and may then recognize other senators since debate time in the senate is generally unrestricted senators recognized for opening statements may under the rules speak as long as they wish the chair may however request that in the interest of time senators limit the length of their statements

following opening statements the chair customarily introduces each witness in accordance with the arranged order and format in some cases for example home state witness committee member other than the chair might introduce the witness procedure for administering an oath for sworn stimony to witnesses is not addressed in senate rules although by statute any senator is authorized to administer an oath to committee witness 2 usc 191 most committee rules provide further guidance in this area commonly committee rules provide that an oath may be administered when the chair or ranking minority member deems it necessary for example the select committee on intelligence requires that all testimony be given under oath the select committee on ethics requires that all witnesses testifying at adjudicatory hearings be sworn less the senator presiding decides otherwise in practice most other committees rarely require testimony under oath swearing witnesses is most common at investigative hearings and hearings dealing with sensitive subject matter sometimes witnesses at confirmation hearings are also sworn in 15 continued investigative oversight an introduction to the law practice and

testimony in practice some committees cap the time allowed for witnesses to make their presentations since witness testimony generally is available to the committee in advance and in the interest of time it is usually not necessary or desirable for witnesses to read their entire prepared statement the rules of several committees including banking housing and urban affairs finance and foreign relations limit oral presentations to ten minutes the select committee on intelligence rules state that oral presentations shall not exceed reasonable period of time as determined by the chairman or other presiding members some committees employ system of lights to guide witnesses in their oral presentations green light tells the witness that time remains to co ntinue presentation yellow light warns the witness to begin to conclude oral testimony and red light informs the witness that the presentation should end

that follows w itnesss statement presents an opportunity for senators to clarify assertions made in testimony to expand upon witness statements and sometimes to question the veracity of statements moreover it offers an opportunity for the committee to build public record and to obtain information to support future committee actions committee staff sometimes prepare questions or talking points for committee leaders and other members in some cases witnesses may be informed in advance of the line of questioning the committee intends to pursue under senate rules when recognized senator may in general speak as long as he or she wants most committees do not restrict this right of debate for questioning witnesses several committees however have imposed rule limiting senators to five minutes to question each witness until all committee members have had the opportunity these include agriculture nutrition and forestry energy and natural resources and select indian affairs the committee on banking housing and urban affairs limits questions to each witness to five minutes when five or more senators are present and 10 minutes when fewer than five are present where committee rules are silent on this procedure the chair or senator presiding commonly sets ground rules for questioning either at the start of the hearing or after witnesss oral presentation whatever the stated procedures

senate rules as well as those of most committee are silent on the matter of the use of staff to question witnesses unless specified by committee rule it is commonly the prerogative of the chair often in consultation with the ranking minority member to determine the circumstances under which staff may question witnesses the committee on small business specifically permits such procedure the committee on energy and natural resources and the committee on indian affairs allow the committee leadership to appoint one staff member to question witnesses staff may only question witnesses after all senators have completed their questioning or at other times agreed upon by the committee leadership the rules of the permanent subcommittee on investigations of the committee on homeland security
