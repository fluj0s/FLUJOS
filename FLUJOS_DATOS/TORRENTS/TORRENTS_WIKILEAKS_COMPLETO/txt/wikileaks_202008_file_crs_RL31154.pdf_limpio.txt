until the taxing authority expired on december 31 1995 the law directs epa to assemble national priorities li st to identify the most serious sites requiring cleanup cercla makes waste generators transporters who select the disposal site and disposal facility owners and operators liable for performing or paying for the cost of cleanup cercla requires cleanups to meet the standards of other environmental laws and establishes preference for permanence and treatment when possible as opposed to burying wastes in landfill g or leaving them in place untreated federal agencies are subject to

when produced as byproduct of air pollution control and any chemicals derived from coal two new taxes were imposed by the 1986 law imported chemical derivatives are taxed at rate equal to the amount which would have been imposed on the feedstocks used in the manufacture of the derivative if the feedstocks had been sold in the united states for that purpose if the importer does not furnish

per 10000 of taxable income in excess of 2 million and is imposed on corporations in addition to taxes and appropriations from the treasury the trust fund earns interest on its balance which is invested in treasury bills because of the time lag between the obligation of funds to speci fic projects and the actual expenditure of those funds there can be substantial inve sted balance which yields significant amount of interest for example in fy2002 the fund earned 179 million in interest it also receives reimbursements from po lluters for amounts expended by epa for cleanup and other

detailed in the nationa l contingency plan 40 cfr part 300 the environ mental protection agency epa is the lead agency except for spills in coastal areas and inland waterways where the coast guard assumes responsibility there are two types of governmental res ponse 1 shortterm removals where emergency action is required fo r example to avert fire or explosion or to prevent the imminent contamination of water body and 2 longterm remedial actions taken at sites on the national priority list removals are limited to 1year effort and the expenditure of not more than 2 million remedial actions are of longer term are more expensive and frequently i nvolve extensive engineering at the sites to ensure that the most serious sites are addressed the law calls for national priorities list npl to be assembled epa developed hazard ranking system hrs to construct the npl which scores such factors as the quantity and nature of hazardous wastes present the likelihood of contamination of ground water surface water and air and the proximity of th site to population and sensitive natural environments as of december 2002 th npl contained 1293 proposed and final sites the total listed since the begi nning of the program is 1499 of which construction has been completed at 846 56 267 sites have been removed from the npl before remedial action is undertaken at sites where superfund money is used the state must assure 1 that it will provide future maintenance of the site in cases of ground or surface water cleanup the 100 state maintenance requirement is delayed for 10 years 2

in state courts epas enforcement costs are collectible from potentially re sponsible parties prps as well as its cleanup costs the above limits to liability do not apply if the hazardous substance re lease is due to misconduct negligence violation of any safety construction or operating st andards or regulations or when cooperation and assistance requested by public official in connection with response activities is denied triple punitive damages may be imposed for failure to comply with cleanup order without sufficient cause all federal agencies are subject to the act owners and operators of vessels and facilities are required to show evidence of financial responsibility such as insurance for vessels exceeding 300 gross tons except nonselfpropelled barges not carry ing hazardous

for sudden accidental events for nonsudden accidents coverage must be at least 3 million per occurrence with an annual aggregate of 6 million the 1986 law added provision limiting insu rance companies liability to the amount of coverage specified in the policy previously some courts had held them liable for higher amounts sara also aut horized companies to form risk retention groups as means of insuring themselves title iv protection from cerclas liability regime has also been extended to several groups in addition to insurers the 104t h congress passed the asset conservation lender

less than 200 pounds of solid material at an npl site are exempt from liability if the wastes were disposed prior to april 1 2001 also exempt are residential property owners small businesse s and small nonprofit organizati ons that sent only municipal solid waste msw to npl sites prior to ap ril 1 2001 for either category if party other than governmental entity brings legal action the burden of proof is on the suing party to show that the micromis or msw contributor does not qualify for the exemption further in the case of an msw but not micromis contributor if the nongovernmental party bringing an action does not show that the msw contributor does not qualify fo r the liability exemption it must pay the legal costs of the defendant the 2002 enactment added two other new liability exemptions and clarified third the new exemptions are for prope rty owners whose land abuts superfund site and for prospective purchasers of property known to be contaminated the clarifying exception

cases of public hea lth emergencies is now obsolete since phs hospitals were closed in the mid1980semergencies and periodically conduct surveys and screenin g programs to determine the relationship between exposure to toxic substances and illness5 the superfund amendments of 1986 created new duties for atsdr the agency and epa were directed to prepar list of at least 275 of the hazardous substances most commonly found at np l sites and atsdr was to prepare toxicological profiles of them at rate of at least 25 per year as of november 2002 it had published or deve loped as final or draft for public comment 261 of them where there is insufficient informati on on substance atsdr is to conduct research the costs of which are to be bor ne by the manufacturers and processors of the hazardous substances in question in pr actice this payment has often been carried out in the context and as part of the cost recovery activities of epa and the department of justice cercla also directs atsdr to perform health assessment at each facility within 1 year of its proposal for listing on th npl the health assessments assist in determining whether or not to take dditional steps to reduce human exposure to hazardous substances and whether to ga ther additional information through for example epidemiological studies or health surveillance programs citizens may petition atsdr for

general cleanups must assure pr otection of health and the environment and be costeffective in both the longter m and the shortterm sara requires that cleanups meet the standards of federal nd state environmental laws but epa may waive requirement when the action is part of larger remedial action that will meet the standards compliance would result in greater risk than alternative options compliance is impractical from an engineering perspective an equivalent standard of performance is attained httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31154crs9 in the case of state standard the state has not consistently applied the standard elsewhere or meeting the standard does not provide balance between the need for protection of health and the environment at the facility and the availability of amounts in the fund to respond to other sites that also present threat the law specifically requires cleanups to meet the safe drinking water acts recommended maximum contaminant levels rmcls and the clean water acts water quality criteria the agency is di rected to choose perm anent remedies when possible as opposed to burying wastes in landfills or leaving them in place untreated if nonpermanent treatment is employed ep must review the site every 5 years to see if the remedy continues to protect human health and the environment if not appropriate steps must be taken to ensure protection states are given the opportunity for an active role in choosing the cleanup method federal facilities cercla made federal agencies subject to the law in the same way as any nongovernmental entity and required them to clean up any hazardous waste sites they owned or operated th superfund trust fund is not available to them and the cost of cleanup is to be funded from the agencies appropriations the one exception to this rule is that the fund may be used to provide alternative water supplies in cases where there is groundwater contaminati on outside the boundaries of federally owned facility and there are other potentially responsible parties beside s the federal agency two provisions of sara attempted to accelerate the cleanup and to resolve questions of jurisdiction that have aris section 120 sets out timetable and requires participation in the planning and cleanup selecti on process by state and local officials and the public where federa l agency and epa disagree on the proposed remedy to be undertaken at site epa is to make the selection although subsection g prohibits the transfer of epas author ities under this section to any other agency or person an executive order signed by president reagan on january 23 1987 gives the office of management and budget the final authority in cases where epa and another federal agency disa gree on the remedy selection nevertheless in may nd june 1988 epa came to rms with the department of defense dod and the partment of energy on mode l language to be inserted in all federal facility cl eanup agreements at superfund sites owned

generated within the state for the next 20 years provision of pl 107118 directed epa to generally defer listing site on the npl at the request of state if the state or another party is cleaning up the site under state program or if the state is pursuing cleanup agreement with the party if after 1 year the state is not making reasonable progress toward cleanup or an agreement has not been reached

to overcome situations eg l onglatency diseases such as cancer where party is barred from bringing lawsuit because the statute of limitations expired before the injury was discovered enforcement epas principal enforcement tool is the authority to order potentially responsible party prp to take actions at site that presents an imminent and substantial danger to the public health or welfare or the environment from an actual or threatened hazardous subs tance release failure to obey an order may make prp liable for triple punitive damages cercla also gives epa informationgathering powers and
