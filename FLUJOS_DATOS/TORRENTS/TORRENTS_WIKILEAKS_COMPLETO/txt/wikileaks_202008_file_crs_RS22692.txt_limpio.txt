economies in central europe and indeed in europe as whole1 its real gross domestic product gdp grew by 114 in 2006 and 99 in the first quarter of 2007 due to its use of currency board that strictly

union in 2004 estonia continues to try to bring its armed forces up to nato standards and has maintained defense spending at over 2 of gdp estonia was perhaps the best prepared of the candidate states in central and eastern europe to join the eu due to its successful economic reforms however estonia still lags behind most eu members in many areas and receives substantial eu funding to address such issues as border security public infrastructure and the environment estonia has had to put off plans to adopt the euro as its currency until 2011 due to an inflation rate above the eus strict httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22692 criteria for euro zone membership estonia enjoys close relationship with its baltic neighbors and the nordic countries it has acted as an advocate for democratic and pro western forces in belarus ukraine moldova georgia and other countries bordering russia estonias relations with russia remain difficult russia claims that estonia violates the human rights of its

estonian society despite estonian government efforts to deal with the problem some 130000 russianspeakers in estonia are stateless about 10 of the population over 100000 more have adopted russian citizenship they are denied estonian citizenship by estonian law because they or their ancestors were not estonian citizens before the soviet takeover of estonia in 1940 and they have not successfully completed naturalization procedures which require basic knowledge of the estonian language as result significant portion of estonias population cannot vote in national elections and lack some other rights and opportunities accorded to citizens in addition at least part of the russianspeaking population suffers from higher unemployment and lower living standards than ethnic estonians do due to variety of factors including inability to speak estonian which is required by estonian law for many jobs2 russia has also expressed irritation at natos role in patrolling the airspace of estonia and

floor in addition to environmental concerns they fear russia will gain additional political and economic leverage over the region once russia has an alternative to key energy infrastructure that runs through their territories bronze soldier controversy and cyberattacks on estonia russo estonian relations deteriorated sharply in april 2007 when estonia moved the bronze soldier world war iiera statue of soviet soldier from park in the capital tallinn to another location along with the bodies of red army soldiers buried nearby the move provoked furious reaction among some ethnic russians in estonia and from russian government leaders who viewed the action as dishonoring red army soldiers who liberated estonia from the nazis for their part many estonians see the liberation as the exchange of nazi domination for soviet one and not worthy of prominent commemoration httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22692 in addition to harsh verbal attacks from moscow harassment of estonias ambassador to moscow by youth groups with close ties to the kremlin and violent demonstrations by hundreds of ethnic russians in estonia estonias internet infrastructure came under heavy attack from hackers in late april and early may estonian officials said some assaults came from russian government web servers although many others came from all over the world these cyberattacks were particularly damaging to estonia which has integrated the internet into public life perhaps more than almost any country in the world estonia has asked for russias cooperation in investigating the origin of the cyberattacks the russian government has denied involvement in the attacks at the invitation of the estonian government nato cyber experts visited estonia in the wake of the attacks to assess their scope and discuss with their estonian counterparts how to deal with possible future attacks estonian officials have called for greater cooperation in the eu and nato to find practical ways of combating cyberattacks they note that the eu and nato have yet to define what constitutes cyberattack and what the responsibilities of member states are in such cases russia also appears to have imposed unannounced economic sanctions on estonia estonian railway officials reported sharp drop in freight traffic from russia and russia limited traffic over key highway bridge between the two countries russia attributed these actions to repair work and safety concerns observers have noted that these actions fit pattern in russian foreign policy toward neighboring countries of interrupting energy transportation and other

again whether threatened by old new or virtual threats3 usestonian relations the united states and estonia enjoy excellent relations the united states played key role in advocating nato membership for estonia and the other two baltic states against the initial resistance of some european countries which feared offending russia us officials have lauded estonias support in the usled war on terrorism including its deployments in afghanistan and iraq estonia has deployed 105 soldiers to afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force significant force for small country two estonian soldiers were killed there in june 2007 there are 40 estonian soldiers deployed in iraq two estonian soldiers have died in iraq4 estonia also contributes troops to eu and natoled peacekeeping

allows persons to visit the united states for business or tourism for up to 90 days without visa in order to join the program country must have visa refusal rate of more than 3 year and must also have or plan to have tamperresistant machinereadable passport and visa documents estonia does not currently meet these standards although it is attempting to do so some believe that estonians should enjoy visafree travel to the us in part due to their countrys status as an eu member and to their troop contributions in iraq and afghanistan5 after meeting in washington dc with president ilves on june 25 2007 president bush said that ilves had pushed him very hard on the visa waiver issue president bush added that he would continue to seek congressional action on extending the visa waiver program to
