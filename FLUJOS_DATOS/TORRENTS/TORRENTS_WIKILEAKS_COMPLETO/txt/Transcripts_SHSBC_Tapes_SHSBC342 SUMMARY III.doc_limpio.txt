summary iii about level iv auditing lecture given on 26 september 1963 well how are you today audience good fine well this is the last of these lecture seriesnot that im going to stop lecturing but i mean you have to keep up with it to find out whats been changed but this is the last of the review tapeslets just sort of bring you up to date and orient you with regard to scientology and this is the what audience twentysixth seventh september theres disagreement here whats the date audience twentysixth of september twentysixth of september ad 13 saint hill special briefing course youve had routine 3 now since 19what was it61 and this has gone through many vagaries and many vicissitudes and one of the reasons it hasit is just about the most complicated tightrope that anybody ever tried to walk across the grand canyon on do not underestimate scientology iv goals and pcs actual gpms and thats the first word i can give you about itdo not underestimate the difficulty that you encounter in these just dont underestimate it the thing which saves the bacon today is r3sc which permits the discovery of the pcs goal on pc who is too overburdened for the goal to read the reason the pcs goal cannot be found is of course the ease is too overrestimulated by present time exigencies for the auditor to get any kind of reads on the actual goal channels thats why goals dont bang and rocket read when you first come close to them its just too much restimulation now getting the service facsimile out of the road which means softening up the two top ris which are the most restimulated ris in the bank by r3sc brings us into position then to have numerous category of things against which to list present time goals im talking about raw meat pc and the finding of those goals is the mosthas been the most timeconsuming activity but with r3sc you get variety of things which you call service facsimiles and all you want to know is what goal do they fit and you will wind up if youve got five or six things which youve found as service facsimiles on the pc the one which produced the most tone arm action is the one you want to list goals against and it wont be really the ri you understand of that goal but it will give you the entrance point to the goal now let give you an actual example we get without too much brainwork or fortuitousness or something of that sort but just using your routine assessments for r3sc we get some category such as auditing we get insects and we get bodies and we get gathering data now these are the things which were run with rightness and wrongness and which produced tone arm action on the pc and we look at these things and we find the one that seemed to be in for the long haulwell it was tie between gathering data and bodies and gathering data however is picked off list and wasnt assessed so it is somewhat questionable but the other actually was listed to you know in other words it was chosen more carefully and although the goal was not found by this system it was quite obvious that if one had asked the pc to have listed goals against bodies which gave excellent tone arm actionthe pc of course would have come up with the goal to be dead which was the present time goal its quite obvious you see the pcright there on the verge of cognition dont you seewhatswhat goal would relate to bodies and well thered be to live to be alive to kill everybody to be dead and that would be your rocket read and away youd beaway youd go get the idea so the r3sc opens the door on goals finding such as weve never had it opened before because it carries with it thethe deletion ofof the restimulative factors so that you take the the fact goals werent easily findable was the overrestimulation of the top ris of the pcs actual bank now thats why goals were not easily findable and thats also why you couldnt get nice big gorgeous rocket reads on your pc because of the overrestimulation of those two top ris of the present time pcs actual gpm and its elementary dont you see the more beefed up those two top ris are theyre sitting right there in present time and the more havoc is being created in the pcs environment because of the fixed ideas in there naturally the more out of session the pc is just for that you see hes not under the auditors control hes too worried about his present time problems and all that sort of thing now to parallel what the mind is doing is again and always has been the basic mission of processing find out what the mind is doing and then parallel that with processing and youre going to get large quantities of results so what is the mind doing the mind is holding in the pcs two postulated ris which are based on his last goal and hes just busy busy busy busy busy see and those two ris are right here in present time and lets say one is blackboards you see and the other is chalk to be nonsensical about it dont you see now out of that we will have locks such as teaching school instructors you get the idea studyingall of these kinds of thing will come off of it we findsee we dont have to find the ris we have to find the goal they fit to you see and blackboards and chalk arelets say those are two top ris to use something nonvery banaland we eventually get studying see and we get instructors and we get some other things as service facsimiles well all the time were doing this were taking charge off those two top ris you see now theres whats causingthey are whats causing the present time difficulty but of course whats supporting them in place is the goal to which they are attached which is earlier than them and we find out that here they are blackboards chalk but we get studying instructors that sort of thing well we eventually listand we get school and so forthand we eventually look at these things and we find out that school produced nice healthy tone arm action when we were handling it on r3sc you see that was very healthyvery healthy so we just list some goals against it we just say what goals might relate to schools you see or something like that and the pc comes up with to be ignorant and that is the present time goal and then because youve underyou see youve taken off the burdening that was on top of itthat burdening of course permits this goal now to rr otherwise you might not get that goal to rr dont you see so then you know the goal for sure and you can recognize it easily and if you miss on that goal and you pick up as is quite common an earlier goal on the track that is rring your checkout and so forth of that goal will then lead you in the position where you can oppose that goal with lists and get the present time goal see so you can tackle this thing in various ways and it enters in various channels and it is not uncommon toafter youve listed your r3sc service facs that you have found socalled youve listed those thingsand its not uncommon to pick up such goal as let us say to know andhoho i dont think this is present time goal you see i dont think so but you check this out as i will take up in moment and you find out that it is not the present time goal but you still have entered the goals channel youre still now in very very fortuitous position because all youve got to do is oppose it see get new goals list you come up with another goal checked thats the pt goal its not so you oppose that and check another one you know and oppose that you know and checkyou know you get the idea matter what goal you find then matter what goal you find youof the pcs actual gpmsyou can oppose it and walk up the bank and find the present time gpm and then you can find by listing the two top ris and your pc goes off like welloiled bomb why because youve walked him back in to the guts of the service facsimile and youre taking off the case rapidly all of the restimulative factor of present time at one fell swoop crash and if you dont think that wont give you tone arm action you see the system of programing your mission is to get onto the goals channel and once youre on the goals channel to goal oppose until you get the present time gpm and when youve got that you want the topnow listen carefully because this is changeyou want the top terminal this is the way you handle truncated gpm because that top one is the hardest one to find the two top items for because it is not completed so therefore the goal hasnt spent itself out its very easy to get the top ri of formed goal because the oppterm of course is some direct conduct of the goal and the terminal the pc now has turned against the goal and so itd be some antigoal thing see thats very easy on completed bank but on these banks which are present time gpms these things maybe have been formed in very recent times there may be only few ris formed in the thing and you dont know where to hit it you dont know where to hit it but it is easier to hit it as terminal for this reason you can ask the pc what are you in present time dont you see what are you in present time that relates to to be ignorant see and he can list that but you say what would to be ignorant oppose you see youre just asking him whats the whole bank or what is the last itemtop item of to be ignorant or something like that that is in opposition and well what is it you see it might be version of the goal clear up at the top dont you see it might be down to the middle just where the thing is turning dont you see some innocuous indifferent thing this is too hard to do but you can say to the pcbecause youre telling him to go to the drugstore without telling him what town he s in dont you see andvery hard to do so the truncated gpm gives you very special case its special case on all other actual gpms you can list for the top oppterm but not on the present time one there you want the top terminal and if you list for the top terminal youre actuallyhe will hobsonjobson it over and ask thisanswer this question what am i in present time that represents this goal just now see thats more or lessand he can list that because you dont have to send him to the drugstore to find the drugstore you say well who is going to the drugstore and he can find that see you dont have to ask him well where are we sending you to from noplace and youll find the pc gets very baffled at this type of action so then you can now take that from the top and go on down the bank to the bottom and take out the bottom plus one you may have to find the next goal to get the bottom opposition terminal of the bank but you want that discharged you want the goal as an ri discharged you want that reliable item totally flat and you want what it opposes totally flat and you want the pc out of that bank before you then repair the bank why because the goal as an ri of course and its opposition hold everything fixed and rigid in the bank until they are gone so the proper programing to take on any actual gpmprogram of an actual gpm for any gpm seeany actual gpm matter where it is locatedis to find the top ris the last ris and theyre very easy to find i dont care whether you list for an opposition terminal or the terminal you see on an ordinarily totally formed gpm dont you see doesnt make much difference but it makes lot of difference on that present time one so you find the top ris and go down the bank go down the bank clear to the bottom and clear it all out all the way down as best you can and then turn around and inspect the whole plot again to find out if anything is still ticking that you have found anything youve listed for and found as part of that gpm is it still ticking and if you have one that is still ticking you assumenow get this very carefullyyou assume that the list from which it came is incomplete you see it is not that it has not been properly opposed yes its been properly opposed but its still ticking so that says it came off list which was incomplete now let give you the idea youve got the item blackboards ticking and youve got blackboards you see by saying who or what would chalk oppose see and you listed that but youve got blackboards still ticking so that means who or what would chalk oppose is incomplete this sometimes doesnt show up by the way until after youve done the whole gpm i mean you thought you had it at the time but you come back later and you find out you have something still ticking well students who had bit of trouble with thistrying to get this straightso ill just tell you that is point of trouble so make sure youyou get this one if you find something ticking on the repair of bank it means the list from which it came is incomplete you dont try to do anything with that item actually you abandon that item and you complete the list from which it came and now you will get whole new series to do in the bank and you get whole bunch of them now and they go back and forth and they carom this way and that way and you say my god how could i have missed this many ris in this bank well you could of course because they were all fixed in place by the bottom ris now what is in actual fact the reason we dont go from the bottom of the bank to the top that is quite important its because the goal is germane part and parcel to every ri in the bank so therefore if you start listing on the goal and opposing from the goal up you tend to beef up the whole bank do you understand you tend to throw every ri in the bank aliveas you start from the bottom up you tend to throw all the later ones alive and the pc cant reach them and he will have heavier bank he will have heavier going and hell have far more difficulty because hell just miss miss miss miss now youd look at it at first glance youd say well look youve got your hands on the goal its very easy to oppose the goal and get the next item and whats all this thing about oppterms or terminals theyre very hard to find and so forth well all thats very reasonable everything is reasonable about it except it doesnt work you could theorize on it until the cows come home and youll find out that you always have bad time trying to go from the bottom of an actual gpm to the top and you have rather easier time going from the top to the bottom and one of the reasons for this is the pc is trained on running gpms by this time by implant gpms which are all backwards he isnt putting his own gpms in backwards now but hehe rather tends to get the idea that you can go down them but not up them because of course hes literally had thousands of implant gpms put into him backwards well thats one slight reason not the real reason the real reason is when you start in from the top you are taking the burden off the actual gpm its the same thing as youre straightening up present time before you find backtrack hed always be more interested in those that are closer to present time which is top the later ones hes almost more interested in the later ones than the earlier ones so hed get many more cognitions and going down the bank this way you get some of the most gorgeous tone arm actions and blowdowns which you ever cared to see in your life going down the bank but you dont get that same action coming up the bank its stickier now its hard enough to find the top of gpm and go down the bank this is hard enough without complicating it by making the whole bank beef up by trying to run it backwards you very often will be in the horrible position of going up from the bottom and then going back to the bottom and think you are going on up the bank when you are not going on up the bank you turn around and go down toward the bottom again and all kinds of wild variations occur now what occurs when you do it properly which is from the last formed ris to the goal do it in that fashion as your first pass what happens in that particular case is the pc will just go on down and youd utterly be amazed at how many ris he can miss on his progress down but you have kicked the stuffings out of the bank by the time youre at the bottom of it and that thing is limp you probably cant even get the goal to read you probably cant even get it to do anything industrious at all youre handling relatively inert proposition now and your listings and so forth aretheyrei shouldnt use the word easier the listings are not so difficult so the program on pcs actual gpm is something like this from rawmeat person get into the channel the goals channel through what you found as service fac listing goals against but get into that goals channel by goals channel i mean your pc has thirty or so goals he doesnt have very many and hes got these goalsmight be more than that or less than that from pc to pcbut hes got these gpms and if you can get onto the sequence of the gpms anyplace you can then do goal opposes and bring the pc up the line and list the one in present time now of course that restimulates the pc more than if you found the present time gpm in the first place but nevertheless this is acceptable and doable and you will get an enormous amount of tone arm action ordinarily in doing this which is quite interesting but you throw the bank more alive its little harder to handle if you find something well on the backtrack but thats all right thats still acceptable so long as you so long as you dont go completely knuckleheaded and try to run the farbacktrack gpm if you run anything in farbacktrack gpm you are committed to completion of it and you will now have hell on your hands youre running this fellow at trillions hundred with reality on anything and it doesnt have any application to his modern life and here he is sitting here trying to solve his lumbosis and the trouble with him in that lifetime is he was having trouble with his lightning bolts you see they never quite went on target and honest he doesnt have this as present time gpm his present time gpm is how not to get shocked when he puts his finger in the mains dont you see and hehell hobsonjobson it over but because his interest is so much closer to present time he then tends to list on wide sweeps and he will give you present time ris on this past goal and it just gets to be the awfullest mess you can bring him through it and hell survive somehow but it is very very very hard it actually compounds the difficulty of running so great that it has been known for people just to back off and not audit the process its just too too strainy and that strain comes from auditing the pc too far from his actual zone of interest now why did you find this early early early gpm in the first place well it must be lock of some kind the present time gpm of course is j lock on it but there must be some restimulative characteristic it may be dichotomy see maybe his present time gpm is to be slave you see and this very ancient gpm this very ancient ancient ancient gpm so forth is something on the orderis to free see or something of this sort well to free will lock up on to be slave so you find to free because itsi4right there available and its alsoseems to the pc to be safe to offer something up which is that far from anything that is wrong with him see its safe action now if you started to run to free and you just went pocketapocketapocketa started to run this thing oh man youre going to be in trouble its going to be difficult in the first place youll have to complete it and itll be very hard to do and all of the pcs present time problems and worries are not being solved by auditing all during the time you are running it so hes worried about his lumbosis in present time and the gpm youre running has to do with getting people out from underneath lightning bolts or something like this and doesnt have any application you see so thereforetherefore any goal that you find puts the pc in his goals channel and then dont run anything until you are sure that you have the pt goal and go ahead and work now to obtain the pt goal and when youre pretty sure youve got the pt goal start running and still be totally prepared to the horror of finding youre running goal three back see still be prepared to find out that youve still erred here but remember to finish the goal you started to run dont do anything else dont go off and leave it just because you found it was three back go ahead and run it but you understand that its going to be more difficult now you can move up into pt and move hisand find his actual pt goal and run it dont you see be as careful as you can to find that present time gpm do everything you can to find that present time gpm and then sit down to run something which you hope is it and then if it turns out not to be it suddenly you go on and run what you found you go ahead and find the present time gpm but you run what you started to run otherwise youre going to have your pc in trouble now programing then comes up to that point offind any goal move it on up with goal oppose till you get the present time gpm be fairly sureas sure as you can bethat youve got the present time gpm and then run it and if it isnt the present time gpm but the present time gpm now turns up well you go ahead and run what you started to run and you finish that off and you come back and find what youve now found as the present time gpm you understand all right and your next action is to start in listing listing from the top and if its the present time gpm youd better start listing the opptermthe terminal terminal dontdont list the oppterm on that first one list for the terminal and now move on down the bank as best you can on down to the bottom and get out the whole bottom of it that is to say the goal as an ri what it opposes its opposition into the next gpm which requires that you will have found the next goal so the actual fact is you clean out the whole bottom find the next goal oppose the top oppterm of the next goal you understand now because youre listing now for the top oppterm of the next goal but thats very easy its just who or what would the goal as an ri oppose you have to have the goal in order to list that normally in other words youre going to find the next gpm and youre going to make sure that you got all the items at the bottom of the gpm youre working on and then you going to roll up your s eves in spite of the sales talks of the pc in spite of all of his answers about how hes now interested in to be snip and hes longer interested in what youve just done of course that looks dead and flat to him recognize that youve probably got 50 percent of its ris unfound and youre going to go back up now and youre going to find anything in it that ticks and youll find something that ticks inevitably and recognize that the list from which it came is incomplete complete that list it will give you now rocket reading item nice rocket reading ri use that and start crossopposing inside that bank and i frankly dont care whether you go up or down because you very often will think youre going up and youre going down and very often think youre going down and youre going up and you will be very surprised to suddenly find yourself in present time when you thought you were getting down to the bottom of the bank all sorts of wild things happen on these repairs but repair is essentially very easy action the only thing that is difficult about it and so on is the pc sometimes becomes very exasperated because he doesnt seem to be able to get the item on the list and thats just an auditor liability that youll just have to face up to and come over with and be persuasive pc was not really arc breaking the pc was just going to pieces from exasperation as ive already told you about but ive put it on the list its on the list half dozen times you know so on tone arm has not given an adequate blowdown youre still getting ticks youre still getting dialwide slashes that might be rocket reads and might not be and so on as he lists obviously the list is incomplete have to keep him listing somehow or another but youll find youll eventually get that whole bank clean that whole bank will all clean up and be very gorgeous and so forth then if you want to really polish the fingernails of the whole thing and so forth why give the auditing of that bank prepcheck and give the goal prepcheck too just polish it all up see youll get terrific tone arm action terrific gains every once in while youll find your tone arm goes up and sticks very hard and sometimes it sticks very hard simply because the pcs interest is in the next bank below and the pc is busy selling and all you have to do is call this to the pcs attention and the tone arm will come down again in other words you already have found the top crust of this next gpm all the time you were doing this other action so therefore youre going to get sales talk and the pc will go out of session wondering what it iswhat it is that confronts onearmed paper hangersor something like this you see and just what is it and so on they come back into session well you just realize that his interest is actually on that next gpm why well actually youve got all the kick out of the one youre doing and its just dog work finishing it up you see but if you dont finish it up its going to give you trouble from here on out then when youve got it all cleaned up and so forth go on down to your next gpm and do exactly the same thing with it go from the top of it to the bottom of it and then come back up and clean it now if theres two items ticking always take the higher item in aon repair if theres two itemstwo or more items ticking take the one that is the highest in the bank the closest to the top lets say youve got three items ticking in this bank as youyou survey your line plot you read your line plot back to the pc see of this gpm that youre doing and theres three items in it that go tick now dont put your mid ruds in on these items dontdont try anything like that because if an items got enough in it to hold the mid ruds out it stillits something wrong with it see mid ruds read because the things they are reading on are charged so youve got three items youre going over this line plot this line plot is all finished by this time as far as everybody is concernas far as the pc is concerned rather oh heshes through with this hehes got to get on to this next goal you see and that sort of thing well youre just very bad workman if you just leave it like that so you go over that and you find that theres three items in it that are ticking as you read the line plot of items already found you see to the pc three tick and if you want to make your choice amongst these things take the top one the high one the one thats closest to the top of the bank and youll find that if you do that you wont have to worry about the other two because as you go clang clang back and forth from one item to the next and so forth these things will fly off and cease to be part of the list you know youve caught them on some other list as you went down the bank again dont you see and you still have to check over the existing line plot now for ticking items but very shortly you wont have anything ticking in that gpm itll be really dead itll be gone story itll be history now is the time to do the next one now youre working back with this from present time into the past gpm by gpm i could call your attention to lot of lectures about gpms people think maybe theyre ideas and they think theyre this and that well so is block of concrete an idea if you had an idea of an electric blanket beautifully shortcircuited that was about 35 feet long by about 3 feet thick by about 15 feet wide or 10 feet wide if you had an idea of that coalblack or fuzzy black with gray undertones and sometimes gray and so forththis object which you actually could build out ofhere out of plaster of paris or something or something that looked just exactly like one you see this object is pcs actual gpm thats not the series of gpms thats one actual gpm prettypretty remarkable now he gets these out of sequence sometimes and you as an auditor in listing can yank them out of sequence and maul them around most gorgeously so let us say we have carpet of these electric blankets laid out here which stretches about mile theyre distantone from each otherbut weve got this straight carpet reaching here and here is present time and back at the bottom of that is the earliest past you see now you start listing and you start making bunch of mistakes and you take the firstthe one thats third from the beginning of track see you take that one and you yank it up into present time and insert it between the last two from present time back see now weve got sort of three sitting here now we crisscross items and make big mistake in accepting the wrong item and its from another gpm and that sort of thing and it turns out that we have an item from the fourth one back now we pull that one and we pile it up on top of these three up here in present time now you do nice case analysis on the thing you straighten all this out and thosetwo of those three separate out and park over here to the left you see about 25 yards away from the pc theyre sort of sitting there quietly now as you start doing some more you find some more wrong items on the one thats ten back dont you see and accidentally get into it as you list goals the pc gives you one thats ten back he doesnt give you the third one back see he gives you one ten back so you industriously run this you see and you find the wrong items in it and then it sort of goes out of gear and he says thats very far in the past so actually he tries to push that into the past so it goes back there now where these three that are out here 25 yards away should be you get the idea i mean you think youre running thought but youre not its just longshore sort of work and you find them in wrong sequences and you will they pile up on the pc this way and that way and they jam this way and that way and they go here and they go there now in the course of livingness he very often has found new use new use for the goal to be god see he joined church or somethingand he found new use for this thing and so on and he pulled it out of line somewhere in the thing and he ishes sort of using some of its ris you see and its been hauled up grossly over the track and it sits up here in present time also so hes been at it and an auditor in the process of being at it he gets at it and the next thing you know we dont have these big blocks of something or other lying out here to mile or two away you see weve got these things scattered all over the doggone place and if you do bad job on that this one is halfrun that ones quarterrun this one is over here restimulated there are four chunks missing out of that one and then the pc is stuck squarely in the middle of the fifth one back while youre running the second one back and itits all very interesting but it is mechanical proposition its as though you took the pc and maybe you made these things out of india rubber you see and poison gas or something and youyou had them stacked around actually theyre quite innocuous but its something like diving into tar pits you know oror something like this its that physically fact see youre not running an idea see youre running thing and this thing has mass man and it has location in space and everything else now the big joy is when you do this thingprogram rightyou have the right goal you found the items and so forthyoull see this meter start going pssww pssww pssww psswwevery once in while its just repeating rocket reads rocket reads whats happening there one of these blankets is folding up and its very funny once in while the pc as his perception riseshell eventuallyhe runs stoneblind on this you know he just thinks theres this room here you know and theres nothing else in the universe sometimes you getyou run two three gpms before he starts seeing these things you know theres this great big cogthe further they are back on the track by the way the bigger they are these present time ones are little dinky thingswoolworth you know and heshes looking at this and theres this hugehuge mass and its going bzzzzzz shake shake shake quiver quiver quiver quiver zzzzzz its discharging out there its not discharging fortunately through you through his meterthrough the meter and his body see but its going bzzzzzzzzzzzquvvvvvshuuugggg you know andand its sort of just wisping away you know then itll stop doing that and youll find another item you know and its at it again you know and he feels likesometimes hes been sitting in blownup toy balloon and somebodys letting the air out of it and so forth the physical sensations of these things going down are quite remarkable and these things go shuddershuddershake and they disappear and fly off into the far horizons and theythey eventually disappear but when you halfrun one you halfleave one it only shakes out to point of where it went bluzzz and its still got left on it bluuuhhh see and you sometimes dont get that last bluuhh until you prepcheck it or repair it you see sometimes if you repair it youll get it sometimes when you prepcheck it youll get it but eventually itll just all go iluyyyaahh and it isnt what happens to the mass the marvel of it is that it stayed suspended in time to this degree and thats all under the heading of how gpm is formed of course thats postulatecounterpostulate the anatomy of the problem the basic way these things were scouted out and discovered empirically all of that material is germane to this thing but theres these black islands and the earlier they are on the track the bigger they are and of course its much better to have the pc tackle small island apply scientology zero than it is something he cant even see the other side of now sometimes hell look down the track when hes looking when he shouldnt have been you know and he looks down the track and youve just been listing something or other youve been listing some goal oppose list and he sort of reaches down the track to see what that is and i do mean reach you know justjust looking wont do too much but he sort of reaches down and all of sudden one of these things will appear back there see and its about fifty yards long and so onits backtrack and its almost frightening the whole thing goes alive you see because he raked his thetan paw across it you can do this same thing to an implant gpm its standing there all beautiful theres these little poles i dont know at what cost you know and what industry its the devotion of these fellows you knowits marvelous god laboring out there in the hot sun day and nightanyhow these little poles all along and the little path and that sort of thing and it looks quite innocent in the facsimile see and the pc will stand there and look at it and then youll ask him what goal is down at the end of it and hell sort of rake his paw through it down to the end of it and it all goes black what hes done is reactivate his own suppress in the thing and all the items go live all the way down to the end of the thing and it looks like black carpet has suddenly been laid out here between these two poles and if he does it again why even the poles will disappear it isnt very heavy it isnt very massive its fairly easy to handle as you know in running aimplant line plot but you get the same effect in your actual gpms except in your actual gpms it is not just somebody throwing some old black cloth out on the road you seeits something on the order of nonexistent island that nobody ever heard ofblack writhing and vicious suddenly appears in the sky of the pcs own environment whered it come from so forth actually hes usually quite tame about these things the only time pc normally gets nervous after hes up to being able to see themof course his confront must have been fairly well raised before he does thatthe only thing that makes him nervous is to be sitting in one that is warped around him in some fashion and he can feel the creak and youll probably hear more of that word because nothing else describes it its all the corners are going out of adjustment of everythingcreak and its just creak you knowand hes sitting inin the middle of this thing and theres another one over there someplace and theres another one over there someplaceand he feels his face is sort of dividing in half and he can feel this fantastic tension and stress something is trying to go south while something else is trying to go north ooooh he feels his chin is being worn on his forehead you see or something like this you know its all creeak he can feel these fooorces you see thats under the heading of bypassed charge of one kind or another its nonidentified charges in his immediate vicinity the only thing that really permits you to run an actual gpm is whata new subject entirely and youll hear more of this because youll get the list called case analysis analysisjust lets call it analysis because theres broad case analysis there is gpm analysis that is the state of the case versus gpms and goals and that sort of thing theres that broad case analysis then theres the analysis for one goal theres the analysis foryou know about its itemsand all this sort of thing then theres the analysis of an item analysesthis is word that youre gonna gonna hear lot of because its saving grace and its new development which you will just thank your stars for just like you have often thanked your stars for an arc break assessment list so youll thank your stars even more so for one of these because the pc isnt necessarily arc broke hes just in trouble and you dont know whats going on and man these things are so complicated that its just thisaaahh makes your brains creak but actually the questions which you ask are very few the number of things are very very brief so if you find an ri you do an ri analysis on it oh you give it to the pc and let it blow down and everything else but before you do anything with that riyou let the pc accept it and cognite on itbut before the auditor accepts that thing hes got to do an ri analysis hes got to find out about this thing he wants to know if hes bypassed any ris he wants to know if it came off an incomplete list he wants to know if the wording in it is correct or if the wording in it is incorrect he wants to know if it is in its proper position in the bank in other words he wants to know all about this ri and if he gets bigcracking big read then hes saved himself from more grief than you can shake stick at he wants to know if its from proper goal he wants to know if itmake sure it doesnt belong to some other gpmget the idea its little list of about eight or ten questions and you just rattle those off at the pc and the pc will thinkyoull think at first that its invalidative of the pcs item well it may be invalidative of the pcs item but it saves the pcs life and youll find all of the problems which we had with running actual gpms before evaporate under this analysis idea because we dont then find an item from the gpm thats threequarters of the way down the track and pull it up into pt dont you see and then oppose that crosswise and then get that wrong way to and pull all the mass in on the pc thats because we want to know all about this item before we use itwant to know all about the thing similarly goalwe want to know all about this goal we want to know if its an implant goal or its an actual goal we want to know if its also an implant goal you seeand an actual goal because we might be running into something here sooner or later because the pc inevitably will start to list out of the implant goal sooner or later and hell give us some item or two out of the implant goal and if were running an actual gpm we dont want that other item just because its rocket reading of course thats small matter but its got creak in it if hes got the actual gpm it is also hung up against the implant gpm youre not going to bother with the implant gpm but you want to know its there because its bypassed charge if it isnt i can see you now with raw meat pc sitting down in fatherly fashion on this dear old lady that youre running actual gpms on and say well now well now mrs smith i think its about time i told you about the birds and bees once upon time long time ago some people probably got mad at everybody or did something or other and they put goal in just like this but which isnt your goal and youll see tone arm blowdown on the thing then you can do such thingscase analysis is vital because you can get intoeven with case analysissuch an idiocy as this you start into the next gpm you suddenly find outbecause its behaving wildlyyou think you find out that its wrong goal and then you do some more and then you get some charge off by finding some more items off of some other gpm dont you see and then you come back and find out that it was right goal in the first place see soso analysis saves the pcs life but dont expect an analysis to be totally completely validand let show you for this reasonim not trying to invalidate an analysis where an analysis reads there is something wrong thats for sure let show you something now letslets take this here is whyheres why an analysis doesnt work now im going to hold this crayon here and you cant see any crayon here above this meter at all now can you see all right now theres just this much of the answer showing and it isnt going to register on your meter worth darn because lookahere you see youve just got this little tip showing see that all right now if you ran some more and got some more charge off this would happen oh you say its crayon see or you say oh oh oh ohyes see the more charge more charge more charge these things are more visible so you get the idea the case totally charged you dont seeeven see the tip of this crayon see tip at all see you see nothing so you ask the meter is this right goal is there goal does the pc have an actual goal blank blank blank blank blank blankyou see theres nothing i mean theres not enough charge of it off the thing is still too heavily burdened for even the meter to see much less the pc the meter sees before the pc in any event and then we finally get up to here and were doing case analysis or were doing goal analysis or something and actually its just the burden is off of it just to the point where you can just see this little tip over the edge of the meter see over the edge of this box here see youve just got this tip showing now you tell if you didnt know already what is that tip see whats thiswhats this scrap of metal that is showing above this box edge see well you can ask is it right goal is it wrong goal is it an upsidedown goal is it an earlier goal is ithave we bypassed goal and so forth we might even know you knowwere assuming that it might even be something that we dont even know what it is because you see it isnt enough in view but if we keep running and keep getting tone arm action on the case these things then well you get it up this highyou get it up this high you say its crayon see its now visiblevisible to the meter see now visible so you read your analysis you see is it right goal is it wrong goal you see is itwe bypassed gpm here and so forthand everything reads and smartly is this correct goal you know bang everything reads like mad its all gorgeous so forth of course you unburden it just little bit further and the pc can see it and tell you see its totally in sight so the more case is overburdened the more case is restimulated the less visible it is to analysis see so if your case isif your analysis goes until you get an arc break youve got the violence of the arc break riding on top ofsee its just problem in overrestimulation see youve got this riding on top of something that wasnt very visible in the first place see you say is this right item is this an oppterm is this terminal is this your own item or is this something you oppose and so on and the meters just going zzz and zzz and zzno answers on the thing and there is nothing happening dont you see i mean itits hard to tell its hard to tell about this got the idea so youll find that the only time analysis is trying to you is you havent got enough in sight you havent taken enough burden off the case got it so therefore we get rule for this and other reasons we already have an auditors code thing about flattening the process inyou know not too much change of process you can put one there to complete given available time to complete process cycles of action begun on the pc and youll see that in that wording or otherwise added to the auditors code this is this importantgiven available time to complete process cycles of action begun on the pc well that probably could take fivehour lecture all in itself see but ill tell you what it is and ill justjust put it down here in terms of emphasis rather than verbosity this little demonstration i gave you might not look like much but itll look like an awful lot to you sitting there someday trying to sweat it out on the meter trying to ouijaboard this meter is this correct goal an incorrect goal what have we done have we bypassed gpm pcs going creeeeeak you know and ohhhhh my god and theres force and power and hes upset and so forth remember that if you can get this case little less restimulated in that particular area by removing charge your meter will read better so you get rule of thumb actiona rule of thumb action and your rule of thumb action must always amount to do case analysis and then complete what you are doing before you did it very important if you can understand that it will save you more grief than anything else i know of in doing actual gpms for the pc pcs going creeeeeak youre listingyouve been listingyou were opposing catgut in the goal swiddlepump see and here you are and youre listing for that and the case is going creeeeeak uhhhhh awful timeawful time man you now do case analysis and it tells you youre running wrongly worded goal goal is wrongly worded now to run wrongly worded goal makes it very difficult very very difficult in fact itll be upsetting what you want to do is get the right wording of the goal if you possibly can if you can do it rapidly its just like arc break assessment see get the right wording of the goal and then go back to opposing catgut you got that now this isthis doesnt sound like much to you right now see i give you broader application out of this the pc says haha it must have been wrong item for this and it must have been wrong item for that you werethis was where he was hung up you got enormous amount of relief and you say all right well the goal was tothe goal was toto spoodlepaf not to squidledunk you see so oh well we better list for the top oppterm now of the new goal to squidlepaf you know uh the new goal oh brother that pc will be in more trouble and wrapped around more telegraph poles why just the factor of overrestimulation youre encouraging overrestimulation by not completing i cycle of action it requires some judgment but this item was already supposed to be in that goal and it probably is it is and that sort of thing but youve got halfcompleted list there you havent completed the list there it is it now belongs to differently worded goal but its there its there and its catgut that you complete do case analysisremedy rectify or identify any charge you care to and then go back and do what you were doing and the only real serious trouble you will have from running pcs actual goals and making an ot will be at those minutes when you knuckleheaded and you did case analysis and followed the case analysis you did case analysis and then followed out the actions of the case analysis then you did case analysis and you followed out the actions of the case analysis now we got half bank lineplotted here on gpm and then all of sudden the pcs going creeeeak hes got the creaks you see hell go mad rrrrr and we do case analysis we analyze this thing is this the present time gpm is it actually not the present time gpm hoho seethud see oh theres another present time gpm this thing showed as the present time gpm well there was some reason it showed as present time gpm there was some reason you were fooled about this and you didnt find out about it until you removed some charge off the case you know we took the burden off by running the gpm we thought was the present time gpm dont you see so now supposing we got half of this line plot of what we thought wasand we find theres new present time gpm thatstheres later one and we depart we depart from the one which is two back from present time and we start now listing the new gpm and we leave the other one undone oh oh oh it might have occurred that you did this and you audited perfectly fine the next day and you did perfectly all right the day after and then about the fourth or fifth day something starts going quite wrong with the session things just arent running right and you dont look back there four days to the point where you abandoned gpm that was halfrun you dont look back there you look into youryou see i mean you would ordinarily just look interiorized into the session youre running you see to that degree and youd be looking into this to find out whats wrong and what have we found wrong and that sort of thing and we do another case analysis and wedoesnt show up on the case analysis and we dont know what to do and its not running well and we dont seem to be able to find the pt gpms dont you see its itemsand we dont seem to find its items well you get the idea the answers back there four days you half ran one sometimes you get into nervous fit of throwing away the pcs line plots and you start in with the top oppterm and you carry the bank down about ten items and then you find out there was something wrong with it all and you start in all over againthrow away that line plot see and then you start in with the next one and you find high item and you go all the way down with that high item then you find out theres something wrong with the thing see so you throw away that line plot and what you dont realize is every time you throw away the pcslook look they were his items they might not have been the central ris or something of the sort but they were his items and youre just bypassing that much charge on the pc just by the action of throw away his items if you dont believe it sometimes take lock item that you have found on the pc and you thought it is and put it down in front of the pc written on piece of paper and x it out say well that isnt your item im very sorry thatthat wasnt it and watch the arc break arc break the pc just like that he didnt care anything about biannuated coffee grinders see he cared nothing about this right up to the moment when you said it wasnt his item see because you bypassed any residual charge that was in it it isnt his superownership of the item youve just bypassed the charge you invalidated the item you said it didnt exist so youve hung him up in just that much charge well it was already wrong item so you hung him up in the charge of wrong item now youve hung him upnot only the charge of the item but you know the additional charge of the wrong item take pcs line plot sometime after youve listed lot of lock items accidentally and say well thatsthats that and wad it up and throw it on the floor and youll just watch the pc go straight through his skull he wont know whats hit him well thats just one of the reasons you shouldnt throw away the pcs line plot but when you donow youve got this new thing called case analysis see and heres what auditors have been doing because it pushes into sight what has happened to actual gpms and this is by the way is not an isolated malady this malady was good and broad and this malady was sufficiently broad to make it impossible really almost to make an ot it was good and broad they would do case analysis however they did it theyd find out you see that it wasnt seein some jackleg fashion find out there was something wrong see and then follow the analysis see whenever they found out something wrong then theyd follow the analysis and only go on from what they found in the analysis perfectly all right to put right what you found wrong in the analysis dont you see perfectly all right as long as you remember to come back and complete the action you were doing before the analysis was done you must alwaysi appeal to your humanity and if youre upscale high enough so you havent got any of thatto your good sense and ifif youre feeling awful shy on that during some session i appeal to your allergy of randomity and if your tolerance of randomity has gotten very very high indeed so that you dont worry about that particularly welli appeal to your intentions to do some good for the pc and all it does is add up to just this and nothing more that ease analysis is there to take the creak out its not there to follow its like an arc break assessment were doing this goal to free weve done four items out of it notmisguidedly we did the bottom and the top or something stupid see we got the two at the bottom and the two at the top or something thats pretty wild thatll turn blankthat triesa gpm will never come around totally circle but it will pick it up and bend the whole act lets say weve done something like this and then we do case analysis and we find out that there are several goals up to pt and the goal up there is to be slave and we drop to free and we do and start in on the slave tell who is going to destimulate what you have just done youre now running with all that extra charge in the bank it isnt going to wreck your pc its just going to make your pc feel horrible however and its going to make him hard to audit hes going to sort of be draggy about it hes going to feel like life just isnt worth living theres lot of things thatll go wrong but they all go wrong from this single thing they dont always go wrong simply because youve done wrong actions pcs can live through wrong action or two see they can live through some wrong actions but they cant live throughin this actual gpm runningleaving cycles of action incomplete it can get awfully awfully awfully grim so the rule of thumbthe rule of thumb on it isis do case analysis do an item analysis do any other kind of analysis that youre doing and then go back and do what you were doing find out anything you want to by case analysis straighten out these things and sometimes the creak is so great that you cant progress unless you do case analysis of some kind or another anything anything that you want to do in the line of case analysis is straighten up the case straighten up this thing and after youve done all of that go back and complete the action you were doing before you found it out and man you will be in very very small quantities of trouble compared to the enormous difficulties that you can get into otherwise now all those difficulties actually stem not so much from the auditor inability to follow the process or read the meter we assume those things exist dont you see but its just from the fact that hes always chasing hes supposed to be after the deer and by god those rabbits cut across that deer track and there he goes and another rabbit cuts across that rabbits deer track you know that rabbits track and away he goes on that track and then all of sudden deer track crosses that rabbit track you see so hes after that deer and then dog crosses the deer track and hes after that dog and the next thing you know he isnt even in the woods and he looks up and there isnt even pc in front of him and he wonders what happened well what happened was is he just didnt complete cycles of action if theres any difficulty generated in any case why its from that now theres knuckleheaded way of following this rule this rule can be followed in very knuckleheaded fashion determine after you have not completed the cycles you were doing but did follow the case analysis lets say youve been following case analysis and doing everything the case analyses have been doing on case so youve done some kind of case analysis and then youve done what it said and then you followed the ease analysis and done what it said and so forth and youve been doing this for long time and you decide at this particular time to now be good youre going to be good and youre going to do right and so forth and you abandon halfdone list on halfdone gpm and go back and do the first unfinished cycle of action that you can find this too can produce chaos pc by this time has had that earlier action pretty well destimulated it sort of drifted out by reason of time or something you see and yet all of sudden youll find out the pc will stop running the tone arm will freeze up and everything else because youve added that to the restimulation of what youre just abandoning and whatwhat you see in this knuckleheaded way of following it is you dont realize that youre abandoning the largest zone and area of charge dont you see to go back and put his attention on charge he now doesnt have so repairing caserepairing case over series of goofedup actions on the basis that you must take the first time the case was goofed up and repair that now as means of answering up to this rule youll find out that doesnt work youll just get in more trouble than you can shake stick at so you should complete the cycle of action which is most ready to hand in which the pc seems to be interested if youve got that kind of case and youll get that kind of case because youre saint hillers here and theyre going to be dragged in ambulances backing upthat sort of thing come in on crutches and theyll be wanting to knowtheyll be wanting to know and youll find out that an auditor in 1962 find the goal to spit and then listed it all backwardsand it mostly has in it items from the goal to catch catfish and the pcs been doing very very poorly since and itll be great temptation on your part to say well lets finish up this goal to spit and get this thing straightened out because thats the earliest incompleted cycle of action well that is all very well but remember the pc is halfway through the bank to spat or to not spit right at the present time dont you see the thing to do when youre faced with quandary of that character is just take an assessment of interest wheres the pcs interest seem to be and then make the auditor be good from there on you see theres point where you start completing cycles of action thats my whole point to you here and you can get so knuckleheaded as to make this an unworkable rule see lets complete the cycle of action of 1950 what engram wasnt run on the pc and completed in 1950 pcs halfway through gpm of course put in those terms it becomes absolutely ridiculous but nevertheless it can be ridiculous at lesser gradient you say well now im going to be good im going to take the firstfirst gpm that was found on this pcnow im going to stop working on these gpms that weve been working on and trytry to find the present time goal i think what i really ought to do with this pc is go back and finish off this goal that was first run on this pc in 1962 dont blame if you find yourself with handful of overrestimulation and stuck ta you pick these things up in turn the way to do that is to go back and finish them off as they turn up just go on and run the ease youll find out these old flubs will turn up in their own order somebody has run the goal to be stircrazy theyve run it quarter of the way they ran it that way got lot of wrong stuff in it messed it all up so forth itll eventually turn up on the track after all youre going back down the track itll eventually run into the goal to be stir crazy youll repair it when it turns up you can defeat the rule then by causingmaking the rule the reason why you wont complete the cycle of action youre involved with you have to use some good sense as guide in this thing now of course theres some more judgment involved in such rule is you find the item you were listing against is wrong item go ahead and try to complete that cycle of action thats too intimate an error dont you see youre trying to do this item roofs and its actually chimneys am i listing against wrong item well yeah youre listing against wrong item obviously the incomplete list was the one which was not completed just before this see you have to complete that list before you can complete your cycle of action you see in order to follow it through you got the idea so theres some judgment used in this but you find your main trouble comes from doing an analysis and then abandoning the cycle of action on which youre engaged and then following the analysis and youll find that in training auditors and in handling auditors here and therethat youll find out thats to be their worst crime theyre rabbit chasing theyre just rabbit chasing they do case analysis and they find out that oh theres wrong item in this bank you see and my god its clear back up to the top of the thing see and thats why the pcs arc broke or something of the sort got some creak wrong item up at the top of the bank see all right they want to go right upleave this item which theyre doing down here toward the bottom of the banktheyre almost to the bottom of this thing see almost got this first program step out of the road seeand theyre going back up and theyre going togoing to complete that item up there uhuhuhuhuhuhuhslap naughty naughty well they say if the pcs going creak and hes all arc broke well all right just tell him theres wrong item up there he says i wonder which one it is well all right ill tell you its tatatatatatatatathat one that onewagon wheels we didnt complete list the list wagon wheelsnow wagon wheels is your item but there happens to be more fundamental item from the list all right now were going back down here and were going to complete this next to the last item that we were doing see its just that thats all you do see all right theres three more goals to present time well what are they what are they what are they that wasnt part of the bargain man if you dont have to know them dont find them thats just adding restimulation youve got three goals toward present time this wasnt your present time goal that wasnt your present time goal the one were doing right now isnt your present time goal theres three more up to present time oh there are what are they oh gee see big sell big sell you always get this you see big sell what are these things well youyou put the pcs attention on it see what are these things what are the goals what are the goals oh letswellgoshouldnt we list look iive got some items right here iive got some goals right here ihereheres some goals heres some goals you see and you say good illmake sure you make note of those but the creak will disappear and thats all you want to get rid of you thought you were doing the pt goal there are three more goals between where you are working and pt you go right on then point this out straighten it out straighten out anything you want to do with it you know pat it in the head square it around let him tell you what he wants to do about it and go on and complete the gpm you were doing i dont care how much creak there appears to be on it youve got that one out of the roadremember there was some reason it was in your road there was some reason why it turned up first and in making any case analysis remember there was some reason why you got the wrong item you got the goal out of sequence see theres some reason for this must be that the visibility was awful poor that morning it must have been that the restimulation to which the case was susceptible at that particular zone or area threw this goal up before it threw up the present time goal so this goal must be in more restimulation than the present time goal you get the idea youre going off and leave this thing oh hell man dont do things like that make nervous just the thought of it as long as you remember thatthat guiding principle do case analysis an item analysis goal analysisanything you want to do straighten out anything you want to straighten out by reason of the analysis so long as it doesnt take too long and doesnt bring much restimulation onto the ease always the restimulation is factor youve got to figure here see youre trying to get rid of restimulation so youre trying to destimulate you do too much about it and youre going to restimulate more than you had before and then dont follow the analysis go back and complete your cycle of actionand if you keep doing that man youre going to be an auditor and youre going to get terrific results because your pc is running these actual gpms we are blessed with case analysis we are cursed with rabbitdogism you see the pcs interest goes to the case analysis dont you see theres lots of thingsreasons why an auditor is persuaded not to do this pcs interest goes there the auditors interest is there that damn thing is in my road it was justthe case was just in the pcs road up till this time see now what he finds its in his road as an auditor this is what was making the case go creak they had this goal lying crossways up here or something like that see and the auditor he tends to fixate on this and of course hes always interested in new things and he doesnt want to go back and do hard work you knowjust carrying up brickshe wants to get bricks up or make it all look pretty you know that sort of thing and theres lots of reasons the pc will sit theresell sell sell sell sell sellgod youd think theyd taken course at dale carnegie sometimes oh well if i just really knew what this goal was if i knew what the next goal was that would be much better and then so forth and so forth and so forth agree with them perfectly keep their itsa line in and complete the cycle of action you were already on and boy you wont be in very much trouble pc is in heavy state of restimulation as he starts to climb this hill its very steep hill to climb anyhow and therefore must be climbed with considerable care now the processes we are doing at the level of going to ot are not processes that are handled clumsily or badly somebodyscant audit you know and youve got him doing something like this man its just wowcant make it see this is skilled operation as you go to ot and i dont care how much you emphasize that skill because the amount of gain that you can get on pc at level ii or at level i is now greater than its ever been by these most elementary processes so you have perfectly rightgood right to demand that somebody run the process with which they can get gains and that an auditor be confoundedly awful doggone good before he starts climbing this hill of the actual gpms you let somebody do that hes going to have nothing but loses pcs going to be wrapped around telegraph poles and so forth this is skilled area this is skilled operation of magnitude you got r1c you got r2h you got r3sci dont know how long they could run on r3sc you got your lower levels and so forth what can be done today in the field of healing is absolutely phenomenal staff auditor has beenhes getting intolerably insouciant if he keeps this up were going to be in very bad condition around here we wont have auditing rooms or anything else theyll be standing out here on stretchers see the last couple of rawmeat eases that we tackledmedical miracles and his insouciance is going to the point of running r1c with little black and white processing thrown in i think thats very cute thats insouciance got rid of somebodys arthritissolution to the illness is all you see that sort of thingbang bang bang were getting very hot in these particular departments well now look if partially trained auditor has processes of that character available to him and if achievements of that level can be attained through lowerlevel processes such as weve covered in this particular series of lectures i see reason whatsoever why somebody would want to commit suicide by trying to walk the hill of an actual gpm without proper training as an auditor so im asking you to discourage it im asking you to snap and pop and get right up there to point of where you can do it but im also asking you to just trod thoughtfully on the instep of auditors saying oh ive got to find somebodys goal and so forth weoh goals is really find goals find goals man well why dont youwhy dont you cure some broken legs or something like that you know theres plenty for you there to do you have plenty of ways to get gains why do you want to tackle this hill why dont you get some wins and learn how to audit and that sort of thing and then well let you find some goals and go upstairs thats the way to handle this sort of thing otherwise youre going to have lots of casualties because this is the area where casualties are made this is the raw living lightning that youre handling and you start going up this hill and you start letting somebody go up this hill who hasnt yet found out how you grasp the handle of the toy wagonhes not going to have trouble hes going to have armageddons he is going to be living in the middle of the worst catastrophes possible that you could hand out with scientology 0 so dont minimize it weve developed processes which are above the level of the pc to tolerate errors made in were awful good at it weve got this stuff grooved it cant be done without training and good sense all right well thats the wrapup of the lot the only thing we havent covered is scientology v weve covered that to some tiny degree we said it was that level of scientology from which all other levels of scientology came thats good enough so that actually gives you total roundup of this thank you very much
