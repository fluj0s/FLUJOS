arctic ice conditions and polar bear impacts usgs addressed the uncertainties in the models but stated climate model simulations are in universal accord that greenhouse gas increases will cause arctic sea ice cover to decline with the greatest reductions occurring at the end of the summer melt season further consistency in climate simulations is the uneven latitudinal distribution of global warming which always has its greatest simulated impact in the high northern latitudes this polar amplification and associated sea ice decline have been consistent climate simulation features at least si nce the early simulation of manabe and souffer 1980 since chapman and walsh 1993 declines in arctic sea ice with the largest trends in september have also been consistently reported in observations20 however links between climatemodel predictions and threats to polar bears are characterized as tenuous by many scie ntists who point to the limitations of correlational studies and the hypothetical

increases in global temperatures25 loss of sea ice could affect surviv and reproduction of polar bears by shortening the season during which ice is available to serve as platform for hunting ringed seals26 increasing the distance between the ice edge and land thereby making it more difficult for nearshore female bears that prefer to den on land to reach preferred denning areas reducing the availability of sea ice dens for gestating pelagic femalebears requiring nearshore bears to travel through fragmented sea ice andopen water which uses more energy than walking across stable ice formations 27 reducing the availability and accessi bility of icedependent prey such as ringed seals to nearshore populations28 and requiring nearshore bears to spend more time on land thereby increasing the potential for adverse humanpolar bear interactions29 in addition to changing sea ice conditions others have expressed concern that climate change could affect the integrity of polar

2005 p 123although some scientists predict the extinction of polar bears under potential climate change scenarios not all seaice changes would harm polar bears for example reduced sea ice thickness and c overage in far northern regions could improve polar bear habitat by increasin g the availability and accessibility of ice dependent prey such as ringed seals31 others remind biologists that climaterelated changes to species distribution may not necessarily lead to changes in abundance32 contaminants three main groups of contaminants are implicated as potentially threatening polar bears petr oleum hydrocarbons persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals moreover climate change may alter contaminant pathways through increased precipitation increasing the potential threat to polar bears33 polar bears are particularly vulnerable to oil spills because oil damages polar bear fur decreasing the bears ability to thermoregulate and because of oil ingestion poisoning via grooming andor eating contaminated prey34 although elevated concentrations of some persiste nt organic pollutants have been discovered in polar bears it has been difficult to determine what biological effects these chemicals might have on polar bears weakened immune systems and reduced reproductive success are among the concerns35 some persistent organic pollutants are endocrine disruptors and are thought to cause pseudohermaphrodism and aberrant genital morphology in polar bears36 mercury is particular concern because of its toxicity at low concentration nd its magnification nd accumulation through the food web however polar bears appear able to demethylate ie alter the chemical form and biological reactivity of mercury and accumulate somewhat elevated levels of mercury without harm37

managed at sustainable harvest levels under the native to native agreement between the inupiat alaska and inuvialuit canada agreement the harvest levels in the chukchibering seas for the past 1015 years 150200 bearsyear which include the legal harvest in alaska and an illegal harvest in chukotka russia are probably unsustainable this harvest level is clos to or greater than the harvest levels during the sport hunting era prior to 1972 approximately 178 bearsyear38 there is particular concern for the chukc hibering seas population due to anecdotal evidence that unregulated harvest by russi an natives on the chukotka peninsula may be reaching unsustainable levels39 some have suggested that habitat alteration from climate change may interact with subsistence and sport harvest to increase polar bear mortality for example they believe that large adult male bears more likely to be targeted by hunters could also be more at risk from the effect of climate change on prey availability since larger bears require greater amounts of food othe rs counter that habitat conditions and prey availability for polar bears could improve as climate warms as result of increased marine productivity in regions currently dominated by multiyear ice40 also male bears represent thr eat to cubs and juvenile bears41 consequently any factor such as sport and subsistence hun ting which often target adult males that reduces the population of adult males may increas cub and juvenile survivorship and therefore may exert positive influence should bears become nutritionally challenged in the future

jeopardize the speci or adversely modify designated critical habitat if jeopardy or adverse m odification would occur fws offers reasonable and prudent alternatives within the authority of the action agency that would permit the action to go forward without jeopardy or adverse modification72 key questions in the fws consu ltation process are the severity of the effects of the proposed action and th number of polar bears that would be affected these requirements are in the st atute and adoption of special rule under 4d cannot modify them cr itics of the special rule argue that polar bear conservation cannot be addre ssed without addressing c limate change since loss of arctic sea ice is acknowledged as one of the chief threats to the species opponents of addressing climate change in efforts to recover the polar bear hold that the was not intended to serve as lever for addressing climate change and that in any case fws is not equipped to handle the myriad consultations that would result the discussion of the special rule for pol ar bears addresses variety of other issues as well as consultati on under 7 and takings under 973 these issues include subsistence handicrafts inte

under the stricter st andards imposed by the mmpa it is also permissible under the with respect to the polar bear76 under 9a1g of takings of threatened species which violate any regulation pertaining to any threatened species are illegal some environmental groups filed notice of an intent to claiming that limiting protections against takings to more than those available under the mmpa was illegal and that take under offers more habitat protection than mmpa77 consultation under section 7 in consultation fws must determine whether the agencys actions would jeopardiz the continued existence of the species or adversely modify habitat that has been designated as critical an agency action is defined in 50 cfr 40202 as all activ ities and programs of any kind authorized funded or carried out in whole or in part by federal agencies in the united states or upon the high seas th same provision includes as examples ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33941crs17 such actions the promulgation of regulati ons the granting of leases easements and rightsofway and actions directly or indirectly causing modifications to the land water or air under 7 as the special rule notes the determination of whether consultation is triggered is narrow that is the focus of the effect analysis is on the discrete effect of the proposed agency action the federal agency evaluates whether consultation is necessary by analyzing what will happen to the listed species or critical habitat with and without the proposed action for some actions eg plants that would be inundated in new reservoir or nests that would be removed in timber sale the affected ar ea is obvious in other cases including effects on species or its habitat some distance away fws must consider the effects caused by the action under cons ultation that are reasonably certain to occur 50 cfr 40202 some argue that all power plant emissi ons should be considered when dealing with the impacts of climate change on polar ice in discussing the breadth of the consultation requirement visa vis emission of ghgs the speci rule states that the need for causal connection between the fe deral action and an effect on polar bears narrows section 7 consultation requirements to listed species and critical habitat in the action area rather than to all listed species or all designated critical habitats this interpretation according to the special rule avoids the possibility that every agency action that would produce greenhous gases would result in consultation while this provision in the special rule could limit the number of consultations regarding polar bears it is less clear that it would limit their breadth for example if an agency were issuing permits relating to emissions of ghg at specific site the rules discussion states there is currently way to determine how the emissions from specific project under consultation both influence climate change and then subsequently affect specific listed species or critical habita t including polar bears as we now understand them the best scientific data currently available does sic not draw causal connection between ghg emissions re sulting from specific federal action and effects on listed species or critic habitat by climate change nor are there sufficient data to establish the required causal connection to the level of reasonable certainty between an acti ons resulting emissions and effect on species or critical habitat the rule suggests that the action agency need not consult on the permit on the grounds that the causal link between the agen cys action and an effect on polar bears is too weak however if the agency we re developing regula tions that applied to emissions for all such sites or emitters one might argue that implementation of the regulations may affect polar bears and th eir habitat consultation would appear to be necessary in that case since the causal link between regulations for all of the permitted ghg emissions and effects on polar bears might be stronger in addition while the causal connecti on between emissions of single ghg source and polar bear habitat loss is currently tenuous or minimis according to the best scientific data currently available what might happen if scientific analysishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33941crs18 78 center for biological diversity v kempthorne 055191 jsw nd cal filed december 15

current climatic change at the end of the last ice age the northern hemisphere entered an extended period of rapid warming with temperatures in arctic regions eventually reaching levels veral degrees warmer than t oday at that time the sea ice above north america is known to have retreated substantia lly allowing arctic species such as bowhead whales and walrus to move northward into areas of the

entirely during either of these warm periods whic h were of equal or greater warming than predicted by the intergovernmental panel on climate changes climatewarming models nor did any icedepende nt species become extinct102 polar bears and their primary prey existed before the last i ce age and significant populations of them remain today the tight association of pol ar bears and their prey species with moving sea ice may give them flexibility that landbased carnivores do not have critics however counter that polar bear s today are not coping with changing climate alone but also face host of other humaninduced factors including shipping oil and gas exploration contamin ants and reduced prey populations that compound the threat to their continued existence103
