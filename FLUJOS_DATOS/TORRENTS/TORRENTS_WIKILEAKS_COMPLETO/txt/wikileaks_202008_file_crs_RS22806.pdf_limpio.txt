background tropical forests and the impacts of defore station on tropical forest ecosystems have been of international concern for decades1 as part of the carbon cycle tropical forests are substantial

contend that some forms of forest degradation may result in standing dead forests or forests with little or regenerative capacity in these forests once the adult trees are dead or harvested the forest

biological diversity3 many believe that pres erving tropical forests preventing deforestation and forest degradation is important for maintaining biodiversity and regulating climate deforestation is the removal of trees from an area generally with replacement by pasture or crops tropical rainforests are commonly cleared to harvest timber as well as to establish farms and pastureland for local communities in many tropical countries the causes of deforestation vary regionally around the globe nd often combine to exacerbate the effects for example roads for comme rcial wood extraction ma allow settlers into previously inaccessible areas to clear forests and plant crops access to forests also allows settlers to harvest wildlife nd wood for consumption and trade such pressures for deforestation are often driven by domestic needs to accommodate expanding human populations and to offset rising trade deficits the pressure to clear tropical rainforests has in part led to cerns over protecting them forest degradation is similar to deforesta tion although usually only some of the trees are removed sometimes leaving the forest as an altered ecosystem devoid of some of its original ecological characteristics deforestation and forest degradation have numerous generally undesirable impacts the most obvious and immediate damages ar to the original ecosystem and its biodiversity deforestation reduces wildlife habitat and tree cover directly lowering biodiversity these changes may also lower regeneration ie growth of seedlings and saplings and tree growth4 and reduce water quality nd soil retention crop and livestock production in moist tropical areas can also deplete soils which are naturally low in nutrients and depend on litter from vegetation leaves uneaten fruits seeds and seedpods etc and wildlife dung fires used to burn cover vegetati on to replenish soils before and after crop cycles also lead to forestation fires ofte n go beyond the intended fields and burn untouched forest s displacing wildlife and polluting the air some have reported that the combination of deforestation and fire cycles will lead to permanent losses of tropical forests5 deforestation and loss of wildlife also can lead to the displacement of native peoples who depend on the forest for subsistence less obvious impact of deforestation with potentially significant global consequences is decline in transpiration also called evapotranspiration trees bring water from the soil to their leaves to r eact with sunlight and carbon dioxide to pr oduce sugars used for growing leaves stems roots and fruits and seeds some of the water is lost to the atmosphere through the same pores that allow carbon dioxide to enter the leaves in the tropics transpiration is significant source of tmospheric water vapor which forms clouds and leads to precipitation substantial loss of tropical forest cover thus can reduce regional precipitationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22806crs3 6 see

actions by susan r fletcher and larry parkerfinally deforestation and forest degradation have impacts on the global climate they release the carbon and eliminate the vege tation that has served as carbon sink some carbon may continue to be sequestered in wood pr oducts and cover crops but large share of forest carbon returns to the atmosphere through direct burning plant decomposition and soil disturbance6 many scientists acknowledge that worldwide deforestation is responsible for the largest share of co2 released to the atmosphere from land use changes and is approximately 20 of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions7 much of the deforestation responsible for co2 releases occurs in tropical regions which are substantially located in developing c ountries such as brazil indonesia and the democratic republic of the congo scientists estimate that tropical deforestation and other land use changes were responsible fo r releasing approximately 16 gtc gigatons or billion metric tons of car bon per year to the atmos phere in the 1990s and may be contributing similar amounts of car bon to the atmosphere today8 tropical deforestation was one of many global concerns the led to the earth summit in rio janeiro brazil in 1992 negotiati ons under the auspices of the united nations environment programme led to two treaties being opened for signature in rio the convention on biological diversity and th united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc negotiations under the latter treaty led in 1997 to the kyoto protocol establishing legally binding ma ndatory emissions reductions of greenhouse gases ghgs including carbon dioxide by 38 developed nations over the period from 2008 to 20129 the treatment of carbon sinks was cont entious issue in kyoto and continues to present challenges the protocol only ma ndated emission reduc tions in developed countries listed in annex i of the unfccc only few of which eg canada and the united states have substantia l forest carbon sinks and none of which have substantial tropical forests certain forestry and land use activities were included as eligible for offsets to protocol mandates such as afforestation planting trees on sites with trees and reforestation planting trees on sites where trees had recently been removed but the means for measuring the additional carbon benef its of such efforts and for incorporating such benefits into countrys obligations has re mained unsettled outcomes from the bali negotiations negotiations of the 13th conference of the parties to the unfccc cop13

goals and actions controversies continue over the ghg reduction commitments by developed and developing nations and whether the commitments would be legally binding all parties espouse the unfccc principle of common but differentiated responsibilities but disagree on how to incorporate differentiated re sponsibilities into specific commitments the bali negotiations led to three outcomes bali action plan for future negotiations of ghg mitigation and commitments an adaptation fund to assist the least developed nations that are most vulnerable to climate change impacts and decision on deforestation the action plan calls for mitigation deep cuts in global emissions adaptation to clima change financial assistan ce to developing countries and technology transfer the action plan sp ecifically addresses forestation including among actions to mitigate climate change10 iii policy approaches and positive incentives for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries and identifying the role of conservation sustainable ma nagement of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries bali decision on deforestation of greater significance for forestry is the bali decision on deforestation11 the decision acknowledges th at deforestation and forest degradation contribute to ghg emissions but th at the problem is complex with differing national circumstances and multiple causes it notes that while actions to reduce deforestation and forest degradation are occurring there is an urgent need to further reduce ghg emissions from these sources and th at such efforts could complement the aims and objectives of othe r relevant international c onventions and agreements the decision includes num ber of possible actions it invites all par ties to voluntarily support and st rengthen efforts to reduce deforestation and fo rest degradation it encourages parties to support cap acitybuilding technical assistance and technology transfer for data collection monitoring and reporting and for institutional development it encourages range of actions opti ons and efforts to address the causes of deforestation and

deforestation and forest gradation for demonstration projects and for capacitybuilding assist ance and technology transfer it proposes an internet platform for information exchange notes that policy approaches and incentives fo r reducing deforestation and forest degradation are to be further c onsidered under the action plan and suggests that such consideration should reflect the results of the demonstration projects and other ac tions to reduce deforestation and forest degradation in sum the decision encourages various efforts including demonstration projects to reduce ghg emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and encourages financial and technical support for those effo rts from the parties to the convention and from others it also seeks to improve the measurement and reporting of ghg reductions that result from such efforts observations on the bali decision the bali action plan and decision on forests were broadly hailed as major step forward in addressing climate change in contrast to the kyoto protocol reducing missions from deforesta tion and degradation commonly called redd is now included for future efforts to negotiate obligations and commitments to ameliorate carbon emissions in addition veloping nations can earn credits for reducing carbon emissions by halting or slowing deforestation nonetheless some observers are concerned with some of the limitations of the agreements one group noted that the decisi on did not include financial mechanism for potentially compensating developing c ountries for reducing deforestation12 this might be partly addressed by ne w world bank program to pay so developing countries not to clear forests13 some suggest that this fund will provide the financial means for redd efforts14 others question

avoided deforestation could also harm indigenous peoples by displacing them or their use of the forest there is danger that funding provided to national g overnments for halting deforestation will not benefit local people and could lead to loss of their land tenure rights and rights to use forest resources16 furthermore some contend that payments to developing nations may not address the diverse causes of deforestation industrial needs infrastructure projects agricultural subsidies governmental corruption and more and thus may be ineffective or push deforestation elsewhere17 while the decision on forests clearly brings deforestation issues into the unfccc and kyoto negotiations it does not impel acti on it encourages invites requests and proposes but does not require any action or binding commitments from parties further the decision focuses efforts to be undertaken in developing countri while desirable in many respects some cont end that rewarding countries for reducing deforestation and forest degradation could dive rt money and attention from th necessary efforts to reduce carbon emissions in the developed world18
