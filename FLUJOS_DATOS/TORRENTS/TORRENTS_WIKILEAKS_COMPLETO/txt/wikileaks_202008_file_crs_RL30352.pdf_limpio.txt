initiated by members of congress since the enactment of the war powers resolution summary article i 8 of the constitution confers on congress the power to declare war modern presidents however have contended that notwithstanding this clause they do not need congressional authoriz ation to use force partly in response to that contention and because of widesp read concern that c ongress had allowed its war power to atrophy in the korean nd vietnam conflicts congress in 1973 enacted the war powers resolution wpr the wpr inter alia requires the president to report to congress any time us military fo rces are introduced into hostilities or situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances once such report is submitted the wpr requires that the forces must be withdrawn within 60 days 90 days in specified circumstances unless congress declares war or otherwise au thorizes their continued involvement nonetheless subsequent pr esidents have continued to maintain that they have sufficient authority independent of congress to initiate the use of military force and all presidents from nixon to bush have viewed the wpr as trenching on their constitutional powers congress has on four occasions enacted authorizations specifically waiving the 6090 day limitation on the use of force otherwise imposed by the wpr but in six other instances

requirements of the resolution or to otherwise recognize congress war powers seventh suit recently decided sought to enjoin the president from using military force against iraq on the grounds such an action would exceed the authority conferred by congress in the statute it adopted in october 2002 in every instance to date with the exception of part of the last decision the courts have found reasons not to render decision on the merits of the suits the courts have variously found the political question doctrine the equitableremedial discretion doctrine the issu of ripeness and the ques tion of congressional standing to preclude judicial resolution of the ma tter although not ruling out the possibility that conflict over the use of force betw een congress and the president could

initiated by members of congress since the enactment of the war powers resolution introduction seven times since the actment of the war po wers resolution in 19731 members of congress ve filed suit to force various presidents to comply with its requirements or otherwise to recognize congress war powers under the constitution seven times the federal courts have refused to render decision on the merits2 in four instances the suits have foundered on the political question or equitable discretion doctrines which the federal courts use to insulate themselves from essentially political disputes in anothe r case the suit failed on grounds of standing and in two cases the suits f oundered on the ripeness doctrine article i 8 of the constitution confers on congress the power to declare war and congress has enacted such declarations eleven times in american history it has also enacted number of authorizations for the use of military force not rising to the level of declaration of war3 nonetheless concern that congress had allowed its war power to atrophy in the contexts of the cold war and the wars in korea and vietnam led to the enactment in 1973 ove r president nixons veto of the war powers resolution wpr the legisla tions supporters hoped that its enactment would ensure that national consensus pr ecedes the use of us armed forces in hostilities abroad accordingly the resolution requires the president to consult with congress in every possible instance prior to introducing us armed forces into hostilities and to report to c ongress within 48 hours when absent declaration of war us armed forces are introduced into hostilities or situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clea rly indicated by the circumstances4 unless congress authorizes

other authorization the wpr requires that us troops be withdrawn at the end of 60 days 90 days in certain circumstances5 presidents from ford to bush have s ubmitted more than 100 reports to congress giving notice of the involvement of u s armed forces in hostile situations6 but because all of these presidents have objected to the war powers resolution as unconstitutionally trenching on their constitutional powers their reports to congress on the involvement of us troops in hostilities overseas have generally avoided using language that would trigger the time limitation and the consequent need for congressional authorization for continued involvement7 that practice has frustrated numerous lawmakers and has led some to pursue other avenues including litigation to compel the president to recognize the legal necessity of obtaining congressional authorization for the use of force although both the white house and the members who have initiated the suits have claimed that each will u ltimately prevail if the courts ever pass on the merits of the controversy neither thus far has taken steps that w ould give the courts viable statutory or constitutional issue to resolve rather than policy dispute on the one hand despite periodic administr ation claims that it would welcome court test the justice department has consistently raised threshold obstacles to court challenges such as member standing to sue and the political question doctrine obstacles which have so far successfully fore stalled judicial rulings on the merits on the other hand litigation by members of congress to

unquestioning adherence to political decision already made or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question id at 217 salvador in crockett v reagan8 in 1982 16 senators and 13 house members asked federal district court to declare that milita ry aid supplied to the government of salvador by president reagan usurped congress war powers under the constitution and violated the war powers resolution and the foreign assistance act in particular the lawmakers charged that the unreported dispatch of 56 members of the us armed forces as military advisers to warracked salvador constituted violation of the resolution the reagan ad ministration moved to dismiss the action on the grounds the suit involved political ques tion and the district court granted the motion the us court of appeals for the district of columbia affirmed examining the categories of political questions set forth in baker v carr 9 the trial court rejected the administrations arguments that judicial resolution was inappropriate because it would interfere with executive discretion in the foreign affairs field or because the suit involve d the apportionment of power between the executive and legislative branches howeve r it concluded judicial resolution was inappropriate because there were j udicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolution of the case the questions as to the nature and extent of the united states presence in salvador and whether report under the wpr is mandated because our forces have been subject to hostile fire or are taking part in the war effort are appropriate for congressional not judicial investigation further in order to determine the application of the 60day provision the court would be required to decide at exactly what point in tim us forces had been introduced into hostilities or imminent hostilities and whethe r that situation continues to exist this inquiry would be even more inappropriate for the

and expertise which are accessible to the congress to resolve disputed questions of fact concerning the military situation in salvador10 the trial court contrasted the situati on in salvador with the conflict in vietnam noting that the latter conflict had persisted for seven years resulted in more than million deaths including ove r 50000 americans and involved the expenditure of 100 billion in salva dor the court noted the american military personnel were relatively few in number and had suffered casualties accordingly the court concluded the stion of whether us forces had been introduced into hostilities in salvador was less obvious than vietnam and the subtleties of factfinding in this situati on should be left to the political branches11 the court declined to speculate about the kind of congressional actions that might give rise to judicially manageable issue noting simply that congress has taken absolutely action that could be interpreted to ve that effect however it did state that were congress to pass resolution to the effect that report was required under the wpr or to the effect th at the forces should be withdrawn and the president disregarded it constitutional impasse appropriate for judicial resolution would be presented12 on appeal the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia affirmed the dismissal in brief per curiam opinion for the reasons stated by the district court nicaragua in sanchezespinoza v reagan13 in 1983 twelve members of the house of representatives 12 nicaraguan citizens and 2 united states citizens sued for damages injunctive relief and declara tion that president reagan and other executive officials had violated various federal statutes including the war powers resolution by supporting paramilitary opera tions designed to overthrow the government of nicaragua federal district court dismissed the litigation as raising nonjusticiable political questions and the us court of appeals for the district of columbia again affirmed the district court stated as predicat that the separation of powers doctrine affords the judiciary very limited role in matters related to foreign policy and national security stating that such matters are largely if not exclusively entrusted to the political branches the court then examined various benchmarks established by the supreme court for application of the political question doctrine and foundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30352crs5 14 568 f supp at 600 15 id 16 id 17 id the court noted in footnote that anothe r reason for dismissing the suit lay in the doctrine of

and the suit repres ents as consequence circumvention of the process of democratic decisionmaking see 568 f supp 600601 n 5 18 770 f2d at 210three of the criteria established in baker v carr supra for determining whether question falls into that category to be particul arly relevant in accord with the crockett decision the district court held that resolution of the issue raised by the congressional plaintiffs called for factfinding that exceeded its competence in political question terms the court said that resolution of the issue raised by the lawmakers was difficult if not impossible because of the lack of judicially discoverable nd manageable standards14 according to the court the circumstances before it were even more egregious than those in crockett since the covert activities of cia opera tives in nicaragua and honduras are perforce even less judicially discoverable than the level of par ticipation by us military personnel in hostilities in salvador15 in addition the court stated in light of the wide differences between the president and congress concerning nicaraguan policy second reason for finding this matter non justiciable is the impossibility of our undertaking independent reso lution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government16 finally the court averred because administration polic was under constant review at both ends of penns ylvania avenue attempts at resolution by the judiciary presented real danger of embarra ssment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on the stion of us involvement such an occurrence it said would undoubtedly rattle the delicate di plomatic balance th at is required in the foreign affairs arena17 the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia affirmed on appeal with respect to the claim of the congressional plaintiffs that the assistance given the contras by the executive branch violated the boland amendment forbidding the cia and the department of defense from providing any such assistance the court noted that the boland amendment was an ppropriations rider and had expired at the end of fiscal 1983 as consequence it he ld that the claim had to be dismissed as moot with respect to the congressional plaintiffs claim that the assistance to the contras amounted to waging war and that as consequence they had been deprived of their constitutional right to participate in the decision to declare war the appellate court citing crockett held that the war powers issue presented nonjusticiable political question18 justice ginsburg filed an opinion concurring in the latter ruling on the grounds the issue was not ripe for judici review she stressed that the political branches had not as yet reached constitutional

with respect to the applicability of the war powers resolution and the wisdom of the escort operation the district court observed although styled as dispute between th legislative and executive branches of government this lawsuit evidences and indeed is byproduct of political disputes within congress regarding the applicability of the war powers resolution to the persian gulf situation22 the

the case was not yet ripe for decision on the one nd it noted majority of the congress had taken action on the matter of whether congressional au thorization was needed in this instance the plaintiffs it observe d represented only about 10 percent of the congress on the other hand it said it was also not yet irrevocably certain that the president intended to initiate war against iraq both elements it asserted were necessary before court could address the constitutional issue it said that majority of congress had to request relief from an infringement on its constitutional war declaration power and the executive branch had to be shown to be committed to definitive course of action appeal was taken from this decision natos air war in kosovo and yugoslavia in campbell v clinton30 in 1999

1999 the date nato began bombing yugoslavia unless congress authorized continued us involveme nt federal distri ct court dismissed the action on the grounds the members lacked standing to bring the suit and the us court of appeals for the district of co lumbia affirmed on the same grounds the supreme court denied reque st to review the decision the district court noted that the house and senate had take n number of actions with respect to natos offensive in yugoslavia on march 23 1999 the senate had approved concurrent resolution authorizing the president to conduct military air operations and missile strikes in c ooperation with our nato allies against yugoslavia by vote of 5841 on marc h 24 the day the attacks began the court said the house approved resolution stating that it supports the members of the united states armed forces who are engaged in military operations against the federal republic of yugoslavia and reco gnizes their professionalism dedication patriotism and courage by vote of 4241 on april 28 the house defeated joint resolution declaring war on yugoslavia by vote of 2427 rejected the concurrent resolution that had been approved by the senate on tie vote of

2 usc 691 34 521 us at 43that congress had enacted supplementa l emergency appropria tions bill on may 20 providing funds for the conflict in yugosl avia but had not stated as required to satisfy the war powers resolution that the measure constitute d specific statutory authorization for the continued i nvolvement of us armed forces the trial court stated that the lawsuit raised especially grave separation of powers issues and observed that courts traditionally have been reluctant to intercede in disputes between the political branches of government that involve matters of war and peace31 it rejected the argument however that courts can never adjudicate disputes that involve foreign relations but it said that in this instance it did not need to determine whether the case was properly subject to judicial decision because the congressional plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the suit while the dc circuit had in the past followed fairly relaxed standard with respect to congressional standing it said the supreme court in raines v byrd32 had dramatically altered the legal landscape in that case it asserted the court had held that members of congress who vot ed against the line item veto act33 lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the act because they retained political remedy namely the repeal of the act or the exemption of individual appropriations from its purview any injury they suffered with respect to their votes on future appropriations bills and to the balance of power between congress and the president the court had ruled was wholly abstract and widely dispersed and lacked the particularity and conc reteness necessary to confer standing thus the court said it was not suffici ent in this case for the congressional plaintiffs to allege simply that the president had ignored the declaration of war clause of the constitution or the war powers reso lution nor it held was it sufficient to allege that congress had taken actions in this instance which the president had nullified or ignored by initia ting and continuing us i nvolvement in the nato campaign for members of congress to have standing the court said there had to be genuine constitutional impasse had congress directed the president to withdraw us forces and he had refu sed to do so or d congress refused to appropriate funds for the air strikes and the president had used other funds for that purpose the court suggested that likely would have constituted an actual confrontation sufficient to confer standing on legislative plaintiffs34 but the congressional votes here the court stated did not provi the president with such an unambiguous directive but instead sent distinctly mixed messages the court concluded where as here congress has taken actions that send conflicting signals with respect to the effect and significance of the allegedly nullified votes there is nohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30352crs10 35 id at 44 36 307 us 433 1939actual confrontation or impasse between the executive and legislative branches and thus legislative standing35 the court also noted that the 26 plaintiffs in this case had not been authorized by the house to institute the suit on february 18 2000 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia affirmed on standing grounds the court noted that in coleman v miller36 the supreme court had ruled that state legislators who claimed their votes had been sufficient to defeat the ratification of constitutional amendment had standing to challenge the actions of the kansas secretary of state in authenticating the amendment as approved because the effect of the authentication was to nullify the effectiveness of their votes in campbell the appellate court interpreted coleman to mean that the legislators had standing only if they had legislative remedy whatsoever but in this case it conclude d appellants continued to enjoy ample legislative power to have st opped prosecution of the war congress certainly could have passed law forbidding the use of us forces in the yugoslav campaign congress always retains appropriations authority and could have cut off funds for the ameri can role in the conflict and there always remains the possibility of impeachment should president act in disregard of congress authority on these matters this reasoning the court said applied to the plaintiffs claims regarding both the war powers resolution and the constitutional allocation of the war power each of the three judges on the appellate panel filed concurri ng opinions as well judge silberman stated that in his opinion the plaintiffs claims and apparently any other war power claim should also be dismissed on grounds of nonjusticiability because we lack judicially discoverable and manageable standards for addressing them and the war powers clause claim implicates the political question doctrine the 60day withdrawal mandate of the war po wers resolution he st ated is triggered only if us forces are engaged in hostilities or are in imminent danger of hostilities but that standard he cont ended is not precise enough and too obviously calls for political judgment to be one suitable for judicial determinations similarly he asserted there is constitutional test for determining what constitutes war or when declaration of war is necessary and the judiciary is illequipped to engage in the factfinding involved in making such determinations fina lly judge silberman said such issues are necessarily ones of the greatest sensitivity for our foreign relations on which conflicting pronouncemen ts by the different branches of government ought to be avoided judge tatels concurring opinion took issu with this assertion that the case presented nonjusticiable political question determining whether war exists or not he contended is more standardless than any othe r question regarding the constitutionality of government action and he said c ourts have frequently madehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30352crs11 that determination moreover he asserted the plaintiffs claim regarding the war powers resolution did not even require the court to make that determination but only whether us armed forces were introduced into hostilities one of the most important functions of article iii courts he said is determining the proper constitutional allocation of power among the branches of government claims that case involves issues of foreign relati ons and risks the danger of government speaking with multifarious voices judg tatel concluded should not prevent court from determining whether the president exceeded his constitutional or statutory authority by conducting the air campaign in yugoslavia if in 1799 the supreme court could recognize that sporadic battles between american and french vessels amounted to state of war and if in 1862 it could examine the record of hostilities and conclude that state of war existed with the confederacy then surely we looking at similar evidence could determine whether months of daily airstrikes invo lving 800 us aircraft flying more than 20000 sorties and causing thousands of enemy casualties amounted to war within the meaning of article i section 8 clause 11 finally judge randolph contended that the court had misapplied the supreme courts decisions in coleman and raines but that the case still s hould have been dismissed on the grounds of standing and so of mootness the plaintiffs lacked standing he said not because they retained legislative remedies for what they claimed to be the presidents illegal actions but because their votes had not as required by raines been completely nullified in fact he said their vote against declaration of war deprived the presiden t of the greatly expanded powers he obtains under number of statutes in declared war and deprived him as well of the authority to introduce ground troops into the conflict thus he asserted plaintiffs votes against declaring war were not for naught and for that reason they lacked standing to sue the reasoni ng of the majority opinion was wrong he contended because it confused the right to vote in the future with the nullification of vote in the past in addition he said the case was moot because hostilities had ended at least by june 21 1999 if the issue were one capable of repetition yet evading review judge randolph noted it w ould not be moot but neither element was satisfied here the dc circuits prior decision in conyers v reagan supra he stated had held that wars initiated without congre ssional approval are not matters that inherently evade review moreover he said it was doubtful that the statutory claim that the president continued th war for more than 60 days without congressional authorization met the capable of repetition element president clinton he noted was the first presid ent who arguably violated the 60day provision and the plaintiffs them selves stated that in modern times most us attacks on foreign nations will be over quickly by which they mean less than 60 days the congressional appellants sought furt her review in the supreme court but on october 2 2000 the

invasion of iraq would exceed the authority granted by the authorization on february 24 2003 federal district court held the suit to raise nonjusticiable political question and dismissed the case on march 13 2003 the us court of appeals for the first circuit affirmed on the basis that the issues in the case were not ripe for judicial review and that the october authorization did not constitute an unlawful delegation of congress constitutional authority citing baker v carr supra the trial court held that judicial resolution of war powers issue would be appropriate only when the actions taken by congress and those taken by the executive manifest clear resolute conflict the constitution it said commits the conduct of the nations fo reign relations to the political branches of the federal government as consequence it stated absent clear abdication of this constitutional responsibility by the po litical branches the judiciary has role to play in this instance the court ruled there was

said mixes various mutually reinforcing constitutional and prudential considerations one it stated is to prevent rulings on abstract disagreements second is to avoid unnecessary constitutional decisions third element simply recognizes that courts can benefit from focus sharpened by particular facts in this instance it asserted many important questions remain unanswered about whet her there will be war and if so under what conditionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30352crs13 even if the plaintiffs assertion that the october authorization does not authorize the use of force against iraq is granted it sai d it is impossible to say yet whether or not those commands will be obeyed if courts may ever decide whether military action contravenes congressi onal authority the court conc luded they surely cannot do so unless and until the available facts make it possible to define the issues with clarity the court did however reach the merits of the issue on the plaintiffs other claim namely that the discretionary authority to use force conferred on the president by the october authorization unconstitutionally delegated congress power to declare war that issue might be clearly framed the appellate court stated if congress gave absolute discretion to the president to start war at his or her will but it said the mere fact that the october resolution grants some discretion to the president fails to raise sufficiently clear constitutional issue even with respect to the exercise of powers that are entirely legislative in nature it noted the supreme court has upheld enactments which l eave discretion to the execu tive branch as long as they offer some intelligible principle to guide that discretion moreover it stressed in the area of foreign affair s the court has made clear that the nondelegation doctrine has even less applicability in addition it said there is clear evidence of congressional abandonm ent of the authority to declare war to the president for more th an decade it noted congress has been deeply involved in significant debate activity and authorization connected to our relations with iraq the october resolution itself the cour t said spells out justifications for war and frames itself as an author ization of such war these circumstances the court concluded do not warrant judicial intervention on march 18 2003 the appe llate court rejected an emergency petition for rehearing of its decision the court stated although some of the contingencies descri bed in our opinion appear to have been resolved others have not most importantly congress has taken action which presents fully developed dispute betw een the two elected branches thus the case continues not to be fit for judicial review conclusion historically the courts ve been reluctant to act in cases involving issues of national security and foreign policy the enactment of the war powers resolution in 1973 does not appear to have altered that situation seven efforts by lawmakers since enactment of the resolution eff ectively calling upon federal judges to put traditional scruples aside ve proven to be unavailing in each and every case brought to resolve the presidentialcongressional impasse over the law andor the constitutional division of the war power since the wprs enactment the courts have concluded that the factors calling for abstention outweigh those in favor of involvement the courts ve variously relied on the po litical question doctrine the equitableremedial discre tion doctrine ripeness m ootness and congressional standing in the one ruling arguably on the merits the us court of appeals for the first circuit ruled that discretionary grant of authority to the president to use force under specified circumstan ces does not constitute an unlawful delegation of congress power to declare warhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30352crs14 the courts have made clear however that while formidable none of the aforementioned procedural barriers c onstitutes an insurmountable obstacle to resolving the statutory or constitutional issues concerning war powers all of the opinions to date indicate that the barrier to the exercise of jurisdiction stems from the posture of the cases not some institutional shortcoming if the courts are to be believed both statutory and constitutional war powers issues can be judicially determined if legal as distinguished from political impasse is created it has been suggested that this can come about by congressional action that directs the president to take particul ar action or bars him from doi ng so and by presidential noncompliance absent such an irreconc ilable conflict however it seems unlikely that the courts will venture into this politically and constitutionally charged thicket
