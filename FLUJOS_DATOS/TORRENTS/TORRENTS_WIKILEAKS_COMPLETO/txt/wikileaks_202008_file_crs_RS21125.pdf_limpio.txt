challenges facing the department of homel and security excerpts from the fy 2006 dhs performance and accountability report december 2006 oig0712 p 21issues for congress potential issues for congress concerni ng the coast guards homeland security operations include among others the following the sufficiency of coast guard fundi ng assets and pe rsonnel levels for performing both homeland and non homeland security missions the division of the coast guards budg et between homeland security and nonhomeland security missions whether the coast guard is achieving sufficient interoperability andcoordination with other dhs federal state and local authorities involved in the maritime aspects of homeland security including coordination of operations and coordination and sharing of intelligence monitoring compliance with the facility and vessel security plans that thecoast guard has reviewed and approved how the coast guard assesses secur ity risks to various ports and prioritizes these risks for llocating portsecurity funding completing foreign port security assessments implementing longrange vesseltr acking system required by mtsa implementing automatic

or general on majo r dhs management challenges stated to implement the maritime transportation security act of 2002 in timely and effective manner uscg must balance the resources devoted to the performance of homeland and nonhomeland security missions improve the performance of its homeland security missions maintain and recapitalize uscgs deepwater fleet of aircraft cutters and small boats restore the readiness of small boat stations to perform their search and rescue missions and increase the number and quality of resource hours devoted to nonhomeland security missions for example while overall resource hours devoted to uscgs homeland security missions grew steadily from fy 2001 through fy 2005 uscg continue s to experience difficulty meeting its performance goals for homeland security missions5 july 2006 report from the dhs inspect or general on coast guard mission performance in fy2005 stated since fy 2001 more coast guard resour ce hours have been dedicated to homeland security missions than for nonhomeland security missions however after an initial drop in fy 2002 nonhomeland security res ource hours have increased every period and have now returned to within 3 of baseline levels the coast guard has been more successful in meeting goals for its traditional nonhomeland security missionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21125crs4 6 us department of homeland secu rity office of inspector general annual review of mission performance untied stat coast guard fy 2005 july 2006 oig0650 p 1 7 government accountability office coast guard observations on agency priorities in fiscal year 2006 budget request gao05364t mar 17 2005meeting 22 of 28 goals 79 where measurable goals and results existed but still leaving room for improved performance not including the ports waterways and coastal security mission by far the largest user of resource hours of any coast guard mission the coast guard achieved only 26 of its homeland security goals 5 of 19 growth in total resource hours has veled off since resource hours are based on the limited and finite number of available assets the coast guard will be unable to increase total resource hours without the acquisition of additional aircraft cutters and boats consequently the coast guard has limited ability to respond to an extended crisis and therefore must divert resources normally dedicated to other missions to improve performance within th eir overall constraints the coast guard must ensure that comprehensive and fully defined performance management system is implemented and that experienced and trained personnel are available to satisfy increased workload demands6 in march 2005 the government account ability office gao testified that the maritime transportation security act of 2002 charged the coast guard with many maritime homeland security responsibilities such as assessing port vulnerabilities and ensuring that vessels and port facilities have adequate security plans and the coast guard has worked hard to meet these requirements gaos reviews of these efforts have disclosed some areas for attention as well such as developing ways to ensure that security plans are carried out with vigilance the coast guard has taken steps to deal with some of these areas but opportunities for improvement remain7 prototype port security system and ais december 30 2007 press article on prototype port security system in miami called project hawkeye and the ais states in part coast guard plan to combat terrorism by creating the maritime equivalent of an air traffic control system in the coastal waters here test for nationwide effort has fallen far short of expectations the coast guard installed longrange surveillance cameras coastal radar and devices that automatically identify approach ing vessels to help search out possible threats but the radar it turns out confuses waves with boats the cameras cover just sliver of the harbor and coasts and only small fraction of vessels can be identified automatically officials acknowledge the limited progress that the department of homeland security and the coast guard have made toward creating viable defense here in miami or at harbors nationwide against maritime attack despite the billions of dollars invested since 2001httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21125crs5 8 eric lipton security effort by coast guard is falling short new york times dec 30 2006miami was selected to serve as laboratory for the maritime domain awareness project the surveillance effort in miami known as project hawkeye was intended to search out vessels that might present thr eat allowing the coast guard to try to foil an impending attack using radar the coast guard would track boats larger than 25 feet within 12 miles of shore smaller vessels as little as jet ski would be tracked with infrared cameras up to five miles offshore the surveillance would cover an area from fort lauderdale to the florida keys to identify which vessels among the thousands might pose danger the coast guard would rely on sophisticat ed software that would assemble and analyze all this data under the plan coast guard official s would be alerted when boats entered restricted waters loitered in vulnerable spot or displayed an unusual course or speed the cameras have at times proved helpful allowing the coast guard to investigate how ship went aground or to monitor security contractors at the cruise ship terminal to make sure they are doi ng their job said ca pt liam slein deputy commander of the miami sector but the cameras it turns out are not powerful enough or installed widely enough to track small boats approaching the many inlets in the miami area the radar system is so unreliable mistaking waves for boa ts splitting large ships in two or becoming confused by rain coast guard staff personnel have been told not to waste much time looking at it and technology the coast guard has required for large ships and wants installed on commercial fishing vessels devices that automatically identify an approaching ships name location and course has also provoked concerns the automated identification system as it is known was first developed as collision avoidance measure not security system and was not made tamperproof captain or crew wanting to hide or disg uise their location could simply turn the system off or enter data that transm itted false information about the vessels whereabouts and identity most critically the software system inte nded to make sense of all the collected data has not yet been installed in miami that means that very little of what the cameras are filming or the radar is tracking is ever used or even watched the data is of such limited value that at least for now the coast guard has assigned only volunteers to deal with it surveillance system similar to the one in miami is supposed to be installed at as many as 35 ports but given the challenges here and the unwillingness of congress to finance the stillunproven effort the coast guard has delayed expanding the effort to other ports until at least 20148httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21125crs6 9 ronald d white system to keep tabs on ships angeles times mar 31 2007vessel tracking system march 31 2007 press artic about privatesector vessel tracking system called the automated vessel tracking system states in part the automated secure vessel tracking sy stem has proven itself to businesses around the world it gave realtime informa tion to oil companies as hurricane katrina raged in 2005 helping them follow oil plat forms that had been torn from their moorings it has tracked ships in distress far out to sea but the system is getting more attention these days because of who isnt using it the coast guard juneau is one of the few coast guard district headquarters that subscribes to the system congress ordered the coast guard to begin testing by sunday system that would track all ships approaching us ports the coast guard says system will be in place but critics are concerned that it will prove to be insufficient the coast guard and maritime transportation act of 2006 says the coast guard part of the department of homeland security must begin threeyear pilot program of system capable of tracking 2000 ships at once to aid maritime security and response to maritime emergencies some lawmakers are trying to convince the coast guard that the answer already exists in the maritime industrys vessel tracking system the coast guard has been relying primarily on radiobased tracking system its new system is expected to use satellite technology but not immediately and then only on limited basis schumer said the system being pushed by senator schumer representative sanchez and other members of congress however has be used to monitor ship movement for the last five years by coaliti on of nonprofit maritime organizations the system relies on emergency beacons that already are fixtures on most commercial vessels software program p ings the ship via satellite and retrieves data such as the name of the vessel its owner its latitude and longitude its speed and its course it can also track ships route across the ocean allowing observers to know whether the ship stopped and met anothe r vessel at sea or diverted to port that wasnt on its usual route the tracking system was created in 1999 by small familyrun company called yukon fuel co in anchorage to keep tabs on its tugs and barges as they supplied fuel and freight to isolated alaskan villages fi shing camps and mining sites the software proved so popular that the family sold yukon and formed secure asset reporting services inc to market the system said clayton shelver the companys chief executive the coast guard isnt the only player that still needs convincing most major shipping companies havent signed on eith er so far only taiwanbased evergreen marine corp has agreed to test it9
