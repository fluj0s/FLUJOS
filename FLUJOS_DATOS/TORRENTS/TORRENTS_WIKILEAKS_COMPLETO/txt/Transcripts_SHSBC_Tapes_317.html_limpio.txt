between lives implant between lives implants lecture given on 23 july 1963 all right okay whats the date audience 23rd twentythird well what do you know all right 23rd july ad 13 saint hill special briefing course i had two choices here im working on an assembly line process for you im trying to smooth out your dating problems and that sort of thing im collecting lot of information on that all of it very important as far as tone arm action is concerned i followed through that wrong date or bad dating or misconception of date is the reason the tone arm action is and i found out that the pcs time sense is his basic aberration and therefore im orking like mad to get you processes that rehabilitate pcs time sense of course the most exaggerated statement you could make is the time for pc to run engrams is when he can call the date and if you did that if you did that itd be absolutely sure that the pc would be getting tone arm action on r3r see and discovered new rundown of r2h youre using an r2h in training pattern right now well r2h exists of course as highly therapeutic process too prac more or less the way youre doing it but ive been refining it refining it getting it down to about tenstep action which gives the maximum tone arm action aims straight i looked around for something i could use you see to rehabilitate pcs time sense and there it was lying right in our laps and so im refining that to just rehabilitate pcs time sense and it does wonders for case and finally found that i may be looking at oneshot ot process and simple as though it as it is actually it becomes much simpler as process to run than the one youre running right now as r2h but that is not quite ready to release there are couple of questions that are being still kicking around about it such as what happens when the pc gets into an engram and you say when was that and he is very surprised indeed to be in this engram and then you say well its bypassed charge is soandso and soandso and he has to put that together for you while sitting in the middle of one engram all very interesting ive got to answer couple of questions like that and then ill release it the common denominator which is what ive been looking for of case levels is simply that and more its just the time sense of the individual that doesnt mean its how welltimed he is or this doesnt mean that gene krupa and so forth thats rhythm sense but just time sense the whenness of things and the deterioration of this sense is what gives you the case levels and that is about the end of that theres tremendous ramifications to this there are lots of other things that can make the pc unhappy or aberrated or significances by the ton but common denominator of case levels is time sense and knowing that then you could probably establish case levels which we were trying to do by test short time ago by some kind of test of time sense the whenness of things as simple as this whats your earliest memory in this lifetime you see and the pc says well lets see i can remember back to when i was twentynine and so forth youve probably got case level probably case level 7 or something like that you see we got case level 6 something like that and you say well whats the farthest back you can remember and so forth and hes trying to puzzle around and he looks awful cloudy and you wonder what hes puzzling about so hard and hes trying to find out if he can remember back to breakfast well youve got case level 8 dont you see or if he cant grasp what youre asking him but it is an indication here of this type of thing your best your best case programing however is discussion with the pc about what process because youre dealing mainly with longtime pcs what process have they been most interested in and youre liable to get very interesting ramification out of the pc is that they have never been interested in the higherlevel process they were really making gains when they were running and they will give you some other process and that merely gives you the class of process you know that doesnt give you just dont continue to run the process necessarily that they were running that they were interested in but it tells you where the interest of the pc is along the case levels and therefore you can run the pc and he will feel that he can do these processes and you may be running pc who is uncomplainingly and actually unaware of it himself running processes he doesnt feel he can do you understand you may be doing something like this you see and the pcs sitting right there slugging and trying and sweating at it and that sort of thing and you just start being just discussion of interest see interest discussion thats all and the pc says well they soandso and soandso and they were really interested as they were doing some 8c at one time or another and they found that was terribly interesting and actually theres process more interesting than that 8c dont you see youve got your answer right there now theyve done an objective an objectivetype process is one that they feel they can do these are all on the lines of estimation of cases dont you see but right now i have little assignment for you is just have discussion with your pc on this basis theres bulletin will be out tomorrow on this subject thats scheduled to go to hgcs but you will find it considerably interesting and it tells you more about this discussion but actually more or less just what ive just told you just have discussion with your pc as to what process has been the most interesting to him and what does he consider an interesting process and all that sort of thing and put it down in your auditors report and dont necessarily shift his gears but this is might be very revelatory to you and also to the pc now i have reality on doing process that is too steep ive never had this reality before and this is the subject of todays lecture and i got confused and didnt much appeal to process was just bit too steep thats brandnew experience for but i can sympathize with the guy whos wading along now and doing that sort of thing running something thats bit over is ead and i had some adventures recently that im going to tell you about in this lecture and if any of you faint or anything like that why fall straight back in the chair not into the aisle and so forth and if you start screaming or anything why the i think the pavilion speakers are on arent they you can go out there and scream anyway the difficulties the difficulties of exploration are based on the fact that you can most easily go when you know and i think the british motorist deserves the gold medal amongst all gold medals for knowing before they go i remember one time getting routing from the royal automobile club for an african trip and they gave little cards and everything was measured off in tenths of mile and i read these cards all over you went over the top of brow of hill you see and there was small cairn of stones to the right and that was 17 miles from the point you had just left you see and then down at the bottom there was small bridge and it had barn on the right you see and that was 185 miles you see and that going along and i read all these cards and didnt bother to take the trip because it was but exploration has its disadvantages definitely has its disadvantages because more than once why one finds himself out at the end of ridge and theres way back he cant get up the sheer surfaces hes come down and he looks in front of him and he finds theres way down and that is it and so it can be too much of good thing not knowing before you go you actually cant know too much about where youre going before you go when youre doing anything like exploration of the time track and ive been fronting up on this for some little while and i find very few times have i had any faint heart or upset along that until just recently and i got the creeps frankly and well it starts like this it starts like this i was up in the van allen belt this is factual and i dont know why theyre scared of the van allen belt because its simply hot youd be surprised how warm space is get down amongst the clouds and so forth it can get pretty cold and damp but you get well up and sunlight shining around and that sort of thing its quite hot and the van allen belt was radioactively hot lot of photons get trapped in that area and so forth and i was up there watching the sunrise well that was very interesting and my perception was very good and i was taking look at norway and essex and the places around you know and getting myself sort of oriented and then something happened to that i didnt know quite what had happened to i thought some facsimiles must have appeared in front of but they didnt look like facsimiles and some other things happened and i had feeling like i might possibly go into the sun and few other little uncomfortablenesses there where that wasnt what awed but i got confused i got confused because the sun was suddenly larger and then it was smaller and somehow or another i was doing change of space process that i myself was not familiar with and it made sort of bite off my thetan fingernails just little bit you know and i said well id better look this over little more thoroughly and proceeded to do so and bit later that day why i did some reach and withdraw on the polar cap and so on orientation and we got quite bit out of this because i was able to establish some reach and withdraw process i knew how the world must look to somebody who was in body and had pictures appearing in front of them and that sort of thing i knew they could get kind of queasy about this situation well that wasnt what overawed what overawed was when i found out i hadnt been looking at pictures that was upsetting becau i was invalidating my own perception it didnt look like pictures dont you see and i was busy invalidating my own perception and so on and i wondered why i was nervous that was what was really puzzling what was this all about and i couldnt quite figure out what had happened and then i finally did find out what had happened and i had actually appeared in dispatchers tower on venus and had appeared back where i was above here and had done it like that with volition on my own part at all that was upsetting you start doing appear and disappear you see automatically and you say whats happening whats happening you mean to say im going to be prowling around in the stratosphere and all of sudden find myself appearing and disappearing elsewhere without any volition on my own part actually i didnt think all this through until later but i thought well prowling around up here is little bit over my head just now and id better know little bit more before i go so that was some weeks ago and since that time ive been exploring around and finally found out what i was looking at and you talk about fellow hes brought home this nice pet tame variety of snake you see and hes put it in box and then snakeologist comes along and he says good heavens man where did you find that king cobra thats the way i felt id been looking at where you go every time you die see and i finally found out what this planet is and why life is so loopy now weve got some of this back in 52 dishing it out intellectually i had good intellectual reality on it wed talk about between lives area and wed dished all this off the cuff this is not data which is unknown to us dont you see but that isnt the same as going there that isnt the same as going there with your eyes wide open and realizing that all you had to do was to be there at the exact point which youre supposed to appear at and willynilly you would have gone over niagara falls through the implant you see and that is what has happened to last few weeks and so ive been studying this situation very hard and as i say ive come up with the data with regard to it of all the nasty mean and vicious implants that have ever been invented this one is it and has been going on for thousands of years its the most complete memory wipeout system and the biggest bunch of lies that anybody ever had anything to do with now your understanding is that when you die why somehow or another about fifteen minutes later you appear in another body lets look at this thing from time disorientation basis that is lie it takes sixtynine days plus more than sixtynine days and you very often go see this has upset some of our calculations weve wondered what has happened to some of our people why they didnt show up again immediately that sort of thing youve gone as long as eight or nine years between death and birth now what happens ill just give you fast rundown on this situation what happens is is youve got compulsion to appear this was why this yoyo see you got compulsion to appear at the between lives returnpoint and of course you just do disappear at death and an appear there you dont travel to there see its all nicely implanted and youre supposed to arrive at this exact point and having arrived at this point you go through the works and the works consist of false death given to you in pictures youre caught there and beamed in and you get bunch of pictures which they have taken these arent your pictures and it tells you all about the death you just died only thats not the death you just died they give you completely false death now this gives us moment of pause right at this point this is alleged by the way to be fifteenday time track it isnt it isnt its days but it isnt fifteen days and it says its fifteenday time track see and this is fifteen days from where you last were it starts with repetitive picture which gets you good and lost in other words they keep giving you this same picture and this same picture and this same picture so that when you try to back out of the incident you keep running into the same picture and you keep thinking that youve got the beginning of the incident and you havent youve got picture in the incident see and then you go to an earlier picture and you think youve got the picture now that starts the incident and thats wrong too so the trick is to get ahead of it but that is can be varied one way or the other and i neednt go on about this but usually you see an actual scene and then you see picture of scene so then you cant really get outside the pictures in order to begin the incident see so you cant find basic on the incident thats all that amounts to all right well this whole series of pictures represented as happening in the space of fifteen days counted off day after day gives you your death which is false death and its not the right death at all matter of fact in scouting this in session i found death whereby i got ead blown off about 1150 and they showed picture of death by exploding bombards it was very interesting because they didnt have bombards in 1150 get the idea they didnt have them for another couple of hundred years see they werent common so they slip but these pictures they show of your death are all earth pictures i dont know how we explain this it could be explained by them coming down and taking some pictures id hate to explain it so esoterically as they pick up somebodys photograph and photograph his facsimiles because in this particular character it wasnt possible either that or they in some fashion preordain the destination of the society at that point and expect your pictures will be concerned with that dont you see but they are earth pictures and they compare to the historical periods of earth for instance death at 750 you get knocked off your horse or something of the sort or die in bed with your boots off and you go up there and find yourself having died in battle amongst knights and have helmet sitting on cross as your grave and so forth thats not your grave but its norman helmet interesting you see messed up like fire drill in other words they give you the wrong death thats the way it begins now you move up to point called the year zero and thank god theyve got year zero because you can always date the incident by dating the year zero because there is year zero on your time track so when you want to look take one of these incidents apart for dating always look for hole look for hole in the incident you see and youll find something like well theres year zero there well good date the year zero for gods sakes dont date the incident and ill show you why in just moment because they give you future history of your life this is going to be your life television program this is your life has bearing on the thing at all but i often wondered why i could never bear the stinking program but this is this will be your life and they now give you from the year zero which they communicate to you as the year zero this is given in another room this is given in room alongside another chamber see your first fifteenday period that all finishes up see alleged fifteen days see then you go to the year zero and this is great big room great big room and this screen is whitish colored screen surround whitish surround to copper grid this copper grid is many feet long i wouldnt havent tape measured it didnt have tape measure im not really up there very high yet i cant carry things around with anyway its oh i dont know at guess seventyfive feet hundred and twentyfive feet hundred and fifty feet something like that copper grid and its very long and high but its much narrower than it is long dont you see be on the order of about three feet high and seventyfive feet long or five feet high and hundred and fifty feet long something of that sort you see and this has some compulsive effect upon the thetan and the whole thing is to make him make pictures and they dont show you your future life at all they show you your what happened to you at the year zero at the time you entered the universe now it so happens that there are lot of incidents where people have told you you entered the universe and some happened not so long ago and some happened long time ago and there can be such thing as guard room or something like that and theres bunch of angels sitting around in the guard room and you walk in in doll body at the beginning of the universe you walk in in doll body you see slight discrepancy there youre madly out of valence you see thats you over there but its facsimile of some kind or another and the year zero usually takes one of these facsimiles now there isnt really picture in the whole sequence of the next section of this there arent any pictures you understand except yours so what actually happens is from the year zero to the year one trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion years in the future youre given compulsion to mock up your own track on this screen and date by date by date by date by date from the year zero forward to one trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion years youre given compulsion to put your time track up there and all thats very interesting you finally come to the second significant date which is one trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion years in the future this is the wrong date the wrongdate cake if there ever was any but you actually have put your own facsimiles from your own year zero forward to that far from what you considered the year zero of course this makes scramble too but theyre just your own pictures remember there wasnt single picture in the whole thing except what you put there but what did you put up there man you put up the early implants you put up the glade the bear the gorilla the helatrobus implants you put up the whole lousy lot entrapments and everything else and you just did that and this was probably in the course of the next sixty days not fifteen minutes sixty days long time isnt it sixty days of restimulation and wrong dates those are all your pictures you scan somebody through that sequence and what are you scanning him through youre scanning him through the misdated helatrobus implants youre scanning him through anything and everything that you can think of all misdated so youd say well all right you cant scan through these things so its impossible to get through it and this was about the time i started to feel queasy and felt that i was just being run just little bit over my head i was scanned through it twice and i felt that was little bit over my head because to take at gulp scan through all of the goals of the helatrobus implant in one single pass it made feel just little bit odd and i felt this is little bit too steep for id better find some way to take this thing apart so it can be taken apart all right so theres this middle period thats in the main room the middle period and how thetan is moved through there i dont know yet i think he must be moved there through there on very slow endless belt proposition very slowly fantastic slow speed because he spends sixty days going past this cottonpicking screen see its not that big putting his pictures on it now we get to the third sequence and this is far more interesting because they furnish all the pictures which i think is very sweet of them they dont now try to pick up any pictures they throw you usually nearly always the same sequence this is very very stable sequence its bunch of pictures and they have some theres they use wavelength communication system by the way thoughtconcept wavelength communication system is all i can make out of it not words but you do hear some sound and part of it is baby crying and they show you picking up body and so forth and then they show you departing and of course you depart and then you get another picture of departing and you get another picture of departing so you really never get out of that one either see and then they show you picture of being sent directly down to earth and channeled straight into the body of newborn baby i think its awfully nice and you even hear the baby cry i think thats good thats good its very clever and part of this and all through this thing youve got false emotion of were just good joes and were doing our best for you and you get the feeling well weve i can imagine theres one thought concept in there which is terribly interesting which i imagine you girls have occasionally been startled at which is weve treated you like gentleman remember weve treated you like gentleman anyway you want to know why the girls are always wearing mens sweaters and so on but the whole idea and the whole emotional tone thats shot at you all during the rest of this duress knockabout restimulation misdating scrambleup washout is were being nice see as matter of fact youll find that this ill bet that youll occasionally get pc who will say well they treated well i couldnt get along without this you know that sort of thing because thats the prevailing emotion anger theres nothing there the light touch see the most effective possible touch anyway you then see picture of yourself separating from this planet and how they explain that i dont know but its sort of its just thrown in for good measure because it said so on the blueprint i suppose youve already been sent to earth you see in the thing is kind of mixed up and you even get picture of yourself being scooted across desert on earth with yucca trees down under you and that sort of thing and there you are youre on your way and youre going down to pick up this baby and everything is fine see you couldnt pick up kid without them you know hahahaha you couldnt do that so on magic you see they have all these babies beamed you know and all they do is ride you down the beam and you pick up the baby and youre all set and there you are and so forth and this thing then with the multiple end so that you cant find the end of it easily you know the end and then the end and then the end and then the end which is the end and so forth finally winds up with what actually happens to you youre simply capsuled and dumped in the gulf of lower california splash to hell with you and youre on your own man and if you can get out of that and through that and wander around through the cities and find some girl who looks like shes going to get married or have baby or something like that youre all set and if you can find maternity ward to hospital or something youre okay and you just eventually just pick up baby youre strictly on your own man in state of total amnesia and gahh having been lied to to this degree with your track all scrambled see well in this sequence youre given compulsion that the next time you die you must appear on the landing stage and thats it thats the whole ruddy lousy cottonpicking lot this is an interesting an interesting thing because this is the most vicious engram i have ever seen set up to scan through that thing is asking you to scan through restimulation of trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion years of your own time track just asking you to do it like just like that see oh thats all right just scan through it you know hoho cant do it man and to find the beginning of it well there are other ones with false beginnings and false endings so that you cant get out of them easily but the time lie this is specifically fifteen days this is your last fifteen days you see on earth you know only it isnt and its not even fifteen days and then the last section tells you that its hundred days long you get hundred days counted off to you in there but it isnt hundred days its more like about nine days and then having channeled you squarely into the head of your new body they dump you in the gulf of lower california very interesting because by the time you get out of that this is type of facsimile that cant be run nobody has ever been able to approach even looking at it so it gives you enough queasiness so that you just tend to back right straight off from the thing how the devil can you undo that now because youve been given such such compulsion to appear there here i am up in the van allen belt and i take look around and i see the sun and i get myself oriented and im just spotting myself around you know getting ready to flex bicep or something like this and i just glance in the direction of venus and i go im on the landing stage see the compulsions shift in space i didnt stay on the landing stage still i went up and looked around the airport took look around the airport i found oddly enough that id gotten curious about this place before some hundreds of years ago and had simply hung around for while and hadnt gone through the implant but this has been going on for as long as youve been on this planet theres lots of these they run somewhere in the neighborhood of two to three per century if youve been on this planet ten thousand years youve got what quite few of them figure it out for yourself thats how many of these confounded things you got and as far as i know it hasnt changed an iota i could im saying little bit more than i know now but i think it it apparently was simply set up and its continued on theres been vast change of pattern as far as i know but im prepared to amend that when i start looking at few early facsimiles on it which i havent yet the point is this the helatrobus implants the gorilla implants the bear implants way back thetan fights and all of this kind of thing you got through all that you got through all that and you were still ot they used to say about that id never been the same after the second helatrobus you know i used to occasionally snarl at people more than i used to earlier but before i hit this place i was on the same post for eighty trillion years same post same name give you some idea of stability of identity mary sue gave the cue on this thing she said look at how hard they have to work to keep you from being ot hey now thats quite thought isnt that quite thought hm now you look at this you look at this now the complete idiocy of it somebody sits up on venus there are probably some other stations around up in the system this ones on venus i notice that we all believe that venus has methane atmosphere and is unlivable i almost got run down by freight locomotive the other day didnt look very uncivilized to im allergic to freight locomotives theyre always running into you now we notice that mars doesnt have any atmosphere either and wont support life in spite of the fact that it turns green and red and purple with the seasons it doesnt support life we understand theres lots of things we understand about this system hehheh isnt it but this is carefully maintained station and spaceopera meatbody type society maintains it very carefully they have hospital theres space craft hanging around there dispatcher stations landing platforms this type of thing its all highly civilized but they carefully maintain this one and its very interesting they maintain this one theyve maintained it for thousands of years without any change why its fascinating why are they maintaining this thing why why is it so important to them dont be deluded by the atmosphere they pump into you the emotion they pump into you during the implant that its all for the best in this best of all possible worlds man it might be that weve treated you like gentleman but the fact of the case is i classify that as dirty trick why is it so interesting whether or not somebody gets off this planet well frankly your answer is practically as good as mine i could make few guesses on this but thats about all but the rest of this universe isnt run this way its question of where are we why well i know this that onto this planet theres great deal of dumping has gone on stuff from the nearby galaxy not this galaxy but from the next galaxy over and so forth is going on here i know they take political prisoners and guys who they dont want around but its less personal than you think they just have excess population so they start to get rid of their excess population you see theyve got revolt or youre on the wrong side of war or something like that and they pick you up in droves and icecube you and throw you into sea someplace i know this planet has been subjected to that and several planets in this immediate end of this galaxy have been subjected to that that i know but somebody must have taken great deal of interest in this fact and somebody must be awfully afraid somebody must be awfully afraid you could almost say it isnt so many how many are here but it might also be question of whos here think of the cost now lets think of it in terms of just society you see think of the cost of maintaining huge station or several stations its maintenance light power wages think of maintaining it on basis of hard work because it is look at the volume that station handles how many people die on this planet in any given day well thats how many guys are started in on the beginning of that line in any day thats lot of people man thats something on the order of two and half billion implants every halfcentury thats quite volume of course somebody may not say thats great volume but look at the length of the implant now if it were twosecond implant i would say well yeah anybody could handle that but it i know that its more than sixtynine days and i know the stuff is ferried back here why i think thats all very interesting that this is this looks to like very expensive proposition and remember this has been going on since before the days of egypt way back without any change what industry what enthusiasm so we ask these various questions whos here and who are we see we can ask lot of questions out of this i dont pretend to have the answers to these questions theres interpretation im giving it particularly beyond the interpretation same interpretation im telling you about the room you live in ive seen the room and youre just beginning to look at it now the amount of duress necessary to produce continuous degraded state can be measured thereby look at the hard work to keep people aberrated now few months ago i was telling you about if you were just left alone for while youd snap out of it remember if you were just left alone for while youd snap out of it the universe itself is therapeutic but look at how hard they have to look at it i know that in any given situation somebody has to be awfully active to maintain the situation in bad state situations have to be maintained in bad state they just dont naturally exist in bad state and thats very definitely true of people if you were left alone even if you could put in two or three hundred years at it youd start to snap out of your hop see you have to pick up the next baby anyhow all off your own bat well supposing you just picked up the next baby without the between lives implant to slow you down well i find that would be quite interesting quite interesting thought because right there youre looking at world clearing we got several ways that we can whip this situation were actually talking about an existing situation were talking about the situation that your pc is sitting in in that pc chair in an auditing session there is his ptp how the hell is he going to get out of here well i know how to get out of here i could have went as matter of fact just dont appear in this immediate vicinity of the solar system go back and find your friends and bring some battle cruisers in but the point im making here is the key is the second you find yourself free to appear dont you see well i appeared and i said to hell with that and stepped back up above here again said now what the hells happened here whats this funny compulsion and ran that on down thats it well actually it doesnt take much to get rid of the compulsion now in exteriorization it is very easy for thetan to exteriorize if you have him be in some place hes familiar with now supposing scientologists just elected place to be when they kicked the bucket and supposing why we simply ran out and actually its just section of this implant and even though it jams the case up who cares run out that compulsion even by repeater technique dont you see we can do that see run that compulsion to appear over there you see and then tell the guy very strong and hard well now where is good place that youre very familiar with well when you die appear there now remember that when you die appear suchandsuch place different place two or three hundred years even with processing youd be free in other words youd live it out look at the amount of time thats just been bought because frankly it wouldnt take more than couple of hours to do this job on anybody if you simply told thetan to be in place where he was familiar with or liked to be he would exteriorize you can ask somebody what hes familiar with he gets tangled up sometimes thinks hes gone into facsimile when hes actually gone into locale dont you see as far as thats concerned you see you could use saint hill providing you didnt providing you ran out all your arc breaks on the subject but the point here is elementary if guy has got to pick up his own body on his off his own bat anyway well he might as well just pick up body off his own bat anyway nobody else is going to do anything for him in fact if youre going to give him you know very well that if what would happen to somebody if he had an engram and you gave him another engram on top of it and said that his engram didnt exist you know how therapeutic that would be and then you misdated everything hes got and then told him bunch of lies and then pulled an emotional switch on him you can imagine the state your pc would be in if you did these things so supposing you just deleted that out of the subject of death and somebody just was in place they were familiar with and didnt go back through the between lives area and im telling you true that in two or three hundred years you would have lived it out youd be flexing your biceps anyhow relieved from that situation youd be starting to take long breath because there must be considerable fear connected with this perhaps the fear of death is mainly the fear of the between lives area may not be fear of death at all certainly oblivion takes place during that period now economic chaos would ensue at once if people kept coming back and demanding their toys back im sure that youd get lot of people who would argue against this and say this was not the best for this best of all possible worlds theyd say well well they could say lot of things about this im frankly not very interested in what they would say about this but now as scientologists supposing we just started tabbing people on the shoulder and giving them this twohour treatment which deleted the compulsion to return to the between lives area instead of that appeared in yankee stadium or something and took off and went and found new body you see the only service performed it gives you place to be when youre dying see and spares you some of the agony of death see it gives you place to be as the only service performed all the rest of them cut your throat see well you can easily perform that service next thing you know you start cutting down their customers now couple of things stand in the road of all this you should know this couple of questions are unanswered here how close is the liaison between these jerks i mean these nuts i mean these fellows and earth how close liaison do they maintain do they care anything about earth at all they must have seen space probe going by the other day they must be aware of some interplanetary action taking place right here what they going to say about it when in the last two weeks ive seen full armored spaceship sitting on landing port with mine own eyes what they going to do i dont think theyll do anything i think theyre hung with their own petard the moment they appear they blow the show i dont think theyd do anything i just think they get fixed on wrongness and theyre continuously executing this wrongness they continuously so they insist on its rightness and they think thats going to solve everything im interested that jamming the track to this degree and giving so little time period amongst incidents as they do to the person is giving people weird time zzzzzzzzz so that you have fanjob airplanes only occupying third of century where as matter of fact in most societies theyll be happy and content with the fanjob airplane for anything up to billion years somebody invented fanjob airplane fine thats good over here over here weve got jet planes now weve got supersonic planes now weve got spaceships you see pocketapocketapocketapocketa its this acceleration ive interest been interested in that because ive seen it as quite different here than it is in any other place ive ever been and this could be the primary factor they give you your time track such fast jam together that everybody gets an idea of more accelerated motion of the way progress has got to occur there could be other explanations there could be an explanation such as base is being created here for takeover of this particular galaxy since this type of implant is not native to this galaxy inspecting your own track you will see that is the case its the next galaxy these could be an enemy to this galaxy sitting there quietly letting manufacturing or production base build up for an attack into this galaxy these could be simply prison guards and with tacit consent from one and all far and wide why any of you agitators that cut up fuss or didnt join the local ama or something like this they capsulized you and threw you down here and they know very well that this is prison now i know that this is known in some peculiar way because bulletin board notices exist all over the place with regard to this planet they say landings on earth why does everybody comply with this i got here why accidentally landing here up in the himalayas but why does everybody comply with this why is this planet stayed away from i dont know how many visitors did alcatraz have see this is about where we sit with regard to this situation now theres another factor another factor here thats quite interesting if they have pictures of earth in order to show you how you died did they get them on earth or are they picking them up on some weird mind reading fact off of beings as they come up there have they have they actually figured out how to photograph facsimile if theyve figured that kind of thing out why then thats explained but how do they know whats going on here that is not finally answered dont you see now they havent done anything about these space probes the boys have been at it here shooting stuff off into the heavens for the last several years and nothing has been done about this now knowing very well i suppose that any time they exceeded certain zone or area they know very well that an armored cruiser could blow anything that this planet could build like kids toys out of the sky so maybe theyre not worried about it or maybe theyre counting on decimation of population destruction of industry in atomic war another question is how thoroughly do these people influence the affairs of earth we can understand that earth is very very strange planet ive never seen populations behave with the same hecticness and weirdness and of course if people who were rather revolutionary or upset or nonconformist were picked up uniformly and concentrated on one planet youd get almost an ungovernable situation which i think rather tends to explain maybe what this is all about ive seen other planets go nutty but only when they were in external stress of great magnitude otherwise they were rather peaceful the days before the helatrobus implants on some of the planets attacked by those people you couldnt maintain government it was everything going to pieces all the time but thats an interesting question all right what degree of influence is exerted against this planet then now astrologists may have something the astrologists may have something in their favor when you realize that these planets swinging closer to earth would be easier to travel would make it easier to travel to earth and further from earth youd have less traffic or less this or that and so youd have less things happening on earth dont you see the proximity of planets combinations of planets or that sort of thing maybe just to the degree of the interspacial relationships of the thing and so on maybe this has some influence on the situation i wouldnt know im just discussing here points now heres another point where do we sit i think between thee and thats the point were interested in yeah well theyre maybe counting on an atomic war wiping out space opera and so forth space probes already may have excited their curiosity there may be some purpose in this but that they took action when the first space probes passed them either says theyre back of space probing or says some other explanation exists for that so we can neglect all that what is the what is the role which we occupy in this this is very very very interesting now that i release this might be source of great worry to you but remember its been in book one of the books carefully seized by the fools and druggists the fools and drug addicts thats the new name ah thats good name isnt it the fools and drug addicts anyway was what to audit and the between lives area are described in the book what to audit this is not unknown what to audit is many many years old its been kicking around for long time been available to almost anybody and look nothings happened in other words the information has already been released when the publicity on the subject of dianetics was at much higher pitch than it is on the subject of scientology so what is this if we really started to run with the ball and so forth we expect couple of meat bodies in the usual white jumper that comes along with the space opera except those guys by the way wear khaki its an oddlooking uniform we expect them to appear on the front doorsteps and say are you scientologist well theres the spaceship and they take you up and throw you in the can in at pluto or something is this kind of action here that we might expect or is it situation where we are threat to them itll all sort of pass away or are they in state where this covert action going forward for so many years would tolerate almost anything before they would disclose themselves or do they count absolutely on the exact camouflage which we have we are ridiculed thats our camouflage i should think i should think if anybody was in the know or any liaison line existed between these two systems maybe kennedy and other presidents find this out the moment they step in the white house you know maybe thats what makes them look so old in two or three years the way they cave in maybe they find out well you boys are slaves you see and i dont think anything like that happens but supposing supposing you did get liaison line between this society and them what would be their best reports on us oh fraudulent bunch of quacks the space opera science fictioneers bums the very best authorities the ama the fools and drug addicts the newspapers which is where they get their news radio broadcasts television broadcasts all forms of news represent us as being totally unimportant ridiculous and so forth i think they could have all of our books sitting on desk up there right this minute and laugh themselves silly without bit of worry about the whole thing theyd certainly not blow the show for it and theyd have to blow the show you understand theyd have to appear not covertly you dont bring spaceships down in dew linemonitored society privately must be getting very hard for these characters to deliver the goods these days were past the radar screens and that sort of thing i think they could be sitting there with the whole library in front of them and they wouldnt have any impulse to do anything theyd say well few of them and so on and its not important and so forth and you wouldnt really want to do that and after all we never have done anything like this and besides the atomic war is coming right up and theres danger from these people because theyre bunch of frauds anyway theres always some madman you know gets some kind of an idea like this and it all passes away and so forth look at the buddhist we let him conquer three quarters of asia and he was trying to end this lifedeath cycle and keep from coming through our carefully maintained plant and he never made it never did anything so theres your precedent nothing happened nothing happened nothing happened but i was standing on their landing stage the other day nothing happened the funny part of it is is lot of us have friends thats interesting too and if you have to work this hard to keep somebody aberrated and working this hard you still arent successful in preventing breakthrough the way we have made in this society in spite of all of the cockeyed contrary propaganda lies and nonsense which are leveled at this society we are making progress and if this continues we will make progress all the way were polite gathering and it is time to indulge in threats or violence or anything like that so i wont describe any future plans with relationship to these people but i think the one thing they must be afraid of is having their planet rolled which of course is the one thing that will happen to them anyhow the situation the situation is much more favorable to us it shows that aberration is very difficult to maintain it shows that its being actively maintained as far as the validity of this and the possession of one of these series of implants in your pc is concerned ill vouch for it you may not be able to run it but its there you can certainly cut swath out of the back end of it that stops the thing but to run somebody through it before hes got the track nested up is impossible so look at what we got here were going along our own way the first thing we ought to do is give some attention to preventing further implantations of scientologists ive already given you program by which this can be done your next action on the thing is dispose of them and i can see tomorrow i can see tomorrow the chinee he appear on landing stage to go through his false death and he hear words thoughtwave as follows be on earth support your local scientologist there is further reason to upset you this time youve been good boy and show him an s and double triangle and there he goes actually youd only have to do this for two or three hundred years and earth would start to go clear on its own because it wasnt getting this continuous assistance the only other source of action is the psychiatrist with his prefrontal lobotomy and his transorbital schizophrenia and this bloke and his avidity for doing everybody in if you just left you know if you just leave psycho alone why hell come out of it but youve got to leave him alone got to let him have rest thats the best treatment for psychosis dont do anything with psychotic you see well i think all of sudden through finding the worst news we also not pollyannaishly find some good news but actually find the answer to our problem as far as the clearing of this planet is concerned that is the easiest end of it the hardest end of it is right now right here and so forth now how can you run this incident that must be burning through your wits right now well what you do is get your gpms out of the road theyre the only thing you cant scan through and get your basics on this type of incident if you run those two things then the incident can be scanned and we already have the tools by which the incident can be run the only thing youve got to do is make sure that your pc gets lots of ta action in session and very shortly matter if you ran implants or didnt run implants or something like this they will be jumping up there ready to be run and the fact that they are and this gave bad turn for day or two is i thought are all the things i have run simply jammed into this and have i been running them at wrong point in time because theyve been properly dated ive been running them at right point in time even though they were then jammed in this particular incident ive been running them out of the right and i found out that not all of them had been restimulated there in fact very small portion of them had been restimulated there just to make it impossible to scan through the thing but you run down gpms you date them on the time track youre running them at that time on the time track youre not running them out of the group see dont worry about that but sometimes pc will give you date now were dating years ago and their dating are years into the future these two dates do not conflict their dates are wrong our dates are right so redating gives you of any incident strips it out of this so any time you find an engram properly dated on the pc youre away see the amount of false track at first i blanched i thought the amount of false track i have must be fabulous and i tried to get away rid of all the discreditable incidents by saying they were simply false track and then i had to run out all the invalidations because they were my own track i thought well this is wonderful way out of it theres that time when i sat incapacitated for long period of time and didnt feel strong anymore and so on that was obviously just false track it happened to be real theres very little unreal incident on the track very little unreal incident when you finally get something durationed exactly and right you can tell whether or not its one of these types of implants but the track is not the same track its corny track its theres something goofy with it the pictures you run out of the pc by and large are the actual pictures of the pc and when you cant run pictures on the pc youve got wrong date or wrong duration so if you get right date and right duration you can run the picture and the picture that can be run that way turns out to be what it is it turns out to be real picture or bad picture only the pc can tell you if youve got the right date and the right duration so simply by carrying on with r3r without the slightest change carrying on with r3n without the slightest change you then get the time track into the kind of shape that pc perforce could actually scan through one of these implants matter what type or part of his time track had been takes less number of hours than you would think youve got the weapons with which to do it you get the basic series of implants off of any chain of implants that is to say you get the basics on these things out and youll find very rapidly and very readily that the rest of them tend to fall away and they desensitize for instance if you get the first two items lets say weve got the same items firing twelve times in row and if you got the first two fires clean the rest of them wont even click isnt that interesting whereas if you got the twelfth one it takes you about fifteen minutes to get all the rocket reads of it off and then you get the eleventh one youve got all the rocket reads to take off of it and so forth in other words weve got the mechanism which turns the time track right side to and it takes the charge out of the place where it counts weve got these various mechanisms solved in other words what we know already can put somebodys time track in shape so that the person eventually can run straight through one of these incidents and damn the torpedoes in fact without having all of my time track beautifully cleaned up i was playing tag with one of these things my last session and i was terribly intrigued by the fact that i had become bit contemptuous of it i have moved around i know what it is its been crossdated it suddenly occurred to all right so if i find i cant scan through something here ill just redate it and sure enough it disappears on the back track the second you do so so you could probably take it from the year zero and redate everything that appeared on the screen in front of the pc and throw his time track back and the next thing you know the thing would be gone as an incident particularly if you were running basic on the incident you can run the beginning of it off selectively you can run the end of it off selectively the last quote hundred days unquote the first fifteen days unquote without running the pc through any of his own time track restimulation so theres many ways this thing can be handled were over the hump on this situation but this thing must exist pretty well as present time problem for every pc audited he must be afraid of death he must be trying to keep his body from getting sick and disappearing simply and solely because he doesnt want an implant at the end of this life all right if you were to solve that problem by stripping out his compulsion to appear in the implant stage and tell him to appear someplace else youve probably solved present time problem of great magnitude on the part of the pc the truth never hurts its only lies that aberrate the very fact that this is prison planet that it is being monitored this carefully right this minute right this instant as im talking here some joe off this planet has appeared on that landing stage and is being told how he just got through an airplane crash whereas the guy probably died of pneumonia see right this minute you see and this instant another guy did in other words this is continuing situation thats going on and on and on and on and on gives you an understanding of whats happening we couldnt have run them in yesteryear we can run them today the best answer is to first put the pc in shape so that he can run engrams and gpms by making sure you can get good tone arm action running those things on the pc the next thing to do is to run engrams and run implants gpms on the pc until he can go over his track rather comfortably and he can come on back on the backtrack and pick up this other type of time dislocation implant scan through those things and knock them out in other words weve got it made theyve been looking down the backs of our necks and we didnt know it for thousands of years each one of us as person and as society as whole and i just want to point out to you that the other day i was looking down the back of theirs thank you very much
