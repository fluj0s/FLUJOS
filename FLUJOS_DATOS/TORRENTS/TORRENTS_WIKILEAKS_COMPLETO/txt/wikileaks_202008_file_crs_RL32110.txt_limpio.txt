agriculture in the usdominican republic central american free trade agreement drcafta summary on august 2 2005 president bush signed into law the bill to implement the dominican republiccentral american free trade agreement or drcafta pl 10953 hr 3045 drawing much attention during congressional debate were the agreements sugar provisions to allow additional sugar from the region to enter the us market to assuage concerns expressed by some members the administration pledged prior to senate passage to take steps to ensure that all sugar imports including those under drcafta do not exceed trigger that could undermine the us department of agricultures ability to manage the domestic sugar program sugar producers and processors responded that usdas pledge did not address their longterm concerns and continued lastminute efforts to defeat the agreement in drcafta the united states and six countries will completely phase out tariffs and quotas the primary means of border protection on all but four agricultural commodities traded between them in stages up to 20 years the four exempted products are as follows for the united states sugar for costa rica fresh onions and fresh potatoes and for the four other central american countries white corn the dominican republic salvador guatemala honduras and nicaragua have approved the agreement costa ricas legislature is currently considering it as it takes effect on rolling basis the us agricultural sector will over time gain free access to the six highly protected markets on reciprocal basis matching these countries current dutyfree entry for nearly all their agricultural exports to the united states other provisions establish safeguards for specified agricultural products to protect us and the regions producers from sudden import surges prohibit the use of export subsidies between partners and establish mechanism to address sanitary and phytosanitary barriers to agricultural trade drcaftas provisions once fully implemented are expected to result in trade gains though small for the us agricultural sector the us international trade commission itc estimates that 328 million in additional exports primarily grains meat products and processed food products would be offset by 52 million increase in imports largely reflecting additional access granted for sugar and beef from the six countries of the 27 billion increase in total us exports that the itc projects under drcafta 12 would be attributable to the us agricultural sector most us commodity groups agribusiness and food manufacturing firms and the american farm bureau federation general farm organization supported dr cafta expecting to benefit from the guaranteed increased access to these six markets cotton producers announced their support only after one major textile trade association came out in favor of it the us sugar industry strongly opposed the additional access for sugar imports from these countries fearing its economic impact on domestic producers and processors two cattlemen trade organizations held differing positions on the agreements beef provisions the national farmers union general farm organization opposed drcafta

2005 the office of the us trade representative ustr announced that the united states will implement the dominican republiccentral american free trade agreement drcafta on rolling basis as countries make sufficient progress in completing their commitments under the agreement steps include each countrys adoption of relevant new laws and regulations necessary to put drcafta into effect and the completion of final review of implementation details with the united states to date ustr has confirmed the completion of these steps for four countries accordingly president bush issued proclamations to implement us commitments under drcafta with respect to salvador effective march 1 2006 honduras and nicaragua effective april 1 2006 and guatemala effective july 1 2006 observers expect the dominican republic to be added to this list later this year and costa rica likely early in 2007 if its legislature approves the agreement on july 10 2006 the us department of agriculture usda issued report examining the economic feasibility of converting sugarcane sugar beets raw cane sugar and refined sugar into ethanol the study concluded that while such conversion would be profitable with current high demand for ethanol and record ethanol prices it would be unprofitable when compared to ethanol prices projected for mid2007 this report reflects usda commitment made during last summers drcafta debate to study alternatives for sugar imported under this and other free trade agreements that could add to us sugar supplies and depress domestic sugar prices us agricultural trade with drcafta countries exports us agricultural exports in 2004 to the six countries covered by the drcafta costa rica the dominican republic salvador guatemala honduras and nicaragua totaled 17 billion and represented almost 3 of us worldwide sales see table 1 these countries combined represented the seventh largest export market for us agricultural products after canada japan mexico china south korea

world trade balance the united states in 2004 recorded an agricultural trade deficit of 761 million with the six countries covered by the drcafta however if shipments of bananas and coffee two tropical products produced in very small amounts domestically are excluded from us imports from this region bilateral trade with these countries would have resulted in an agricultural trade surplus of 394 million in 2004 entries under two unilateral us trade preference programs the caribbean basin initiative and the generalized system of preferences accounted for almost 47 of us agricultural imports from the six countries in 2004 meaning they crs3 entered duty free practically all other agricultural imports primarily tropical products such as bananas and raw coffee entered at mfn zero duty rates1 though imports of certain commodities sugar beef dairy products peanuts tobacco among others that the united states protects using tariffrate quotas trqs generally entered dutyfree amounts allowed to enter were limited by quotas2 barriers to agricultural trade used by central america the dominican republic and the united states the united states and the six countries primarily use tariffs and trqs to protect their agricultural sectors the five central american countries and the dominican republic committed under the multilateral uruguay round agreement on agriculture uraa to bind their average tariffs on agricultural imports at relatively high levels ranging from hondurass 35 to nicaraguas 73 compared to the us commitment to bind its average rate at 123 however in practice the six countries generally have imposed much lower average tariffs on agricultural imports with applied tariffs ranging from 67 in nicaragua to 233 in the dominican republic and at times have allowed larger amounts of commodities than spelled out in their trq minimum commitments to enter duty free or at lower duty4 the average us applied tariff on imports from these six countries is very low 02 when us trade preference benefits are taken into account see table 2 these 1 the united states grants eligible developing countries unilateral preferential tariff treatment under these two and other programs meaning imports are eligible for lower than mfn most favored nation rates in practice zero or very low duty such treatment gives their products competitive advantage in the us market the trade preference programs and mfn shares are derived from the us international trade commissions interactive tariff and trade dataweb 2 trq combines two policy instruments that nations use to restrict imports quotas and tariffs in trq the quota component works together with specified tariff level to provide the desired degree of import protection imports entering under the quota portion of trq are usually subject to lower or sometimes zero tariff rate this inquota amount represents the minimum that country has committed to allow to enter under multilateral or other trade agreements imports above the quotas quantitative threshold referred to as abovequota face much higher usually prohibitive tariff 3 the global average bound tariff on agricultural imports is 62 us department of agriculture usda economic research service profiles of tariffs in global agricultural markets january 2001 p 11 bound tariff rate represents the maximum that country agrees to impose on the value of imports of particular product and is based on the outcome of negotiations under the last multilateral negotiations the uruguay round these bound rates are incorporated as an integral component of countrys schedule of concessions or commitments to other world trade organization members however for various reasons country may decide to impose lower or applied tariff rate 4 for example for 2005

agricultural imports from the rest of the world though will continue to be subject to the tariff levels and quotas negotiated under the uraa or under separate bilateral ftas each has entered into with other trading partners crs5 negotiating objectives for agriculture us objectives in negotiating drcaftas agricultural provisions were to 1 eliminate central american and dominican republic tariffs quotas and nontariff barriers to trade 2 provide adequate transition periods and relief mechanisms for the us agricultural sector to adjust to increased imports of sensitive products from the region 3 eliminate any unjustified sanitary and phytosanitary sps restrictions imposed by the six countries and seek their affirmation of their world trade organization wto commitments on sps measures and 4 develop mechanism with its fta partners to support the us objective to eliminate all agricultural export subsidies in the wto and free trade area of the americas ftaa negotiations5 the us position called for product or sectoral exclusions from the final agreement us officials also repeatedly made clear that the issue of us farm support or subsidies which the central american countries sought to place on the negotiating table should only be addressed in wto multilateral negotiations almost all of the agricultural exports to the united states from the fta partner countries already enter duty free under trade preference programs or at mfn zero rates consequently the six countries were most interested in securing unrestricted market access for those commodities now subject to us trqs sugar and certain sugarcontaining products beef dairy products peanuts tobacco and cotton however central american and dominican republic negotiators expressed fears that opening up their markets to us corn and rice would undermine the regions small subsistence farmers unable to compete against subsidies that us producers receive under current farm programs though these countries had pressed to include the subsidy issue on the negotiating agenda they eventually did accept the us position that this issue should be addressed multilaterally in the wto context 5 the wto doha development agenda dda rounds objectives for agriculture are to substantially improve market access for agricultural products reduce and phase out export subsidies and substantially reduce tradedistorting domestic support for more information see crs report rl33144 wto doha round agricultural negotiating proposals by charles hanrahan and randy schnepf for an explanation of agricultural trade liberalization in the last multilateral agreement see crs report rl32916 agriculture in the wto policy commitments made under the agreement on agriculture by randy schnepf the ftaas stated objectives are to reduce and eliminate barriers to trade in goods including agricultural commodities and food products and services facilitate cross border investment among others to allow 34 countries of the western hemisphere excluding cuba to trade and invest with each other under the same rules participating countries initiated formal talks in 1998 with target of creating hemispheric free trade area by january 2005 which was not met many observers do not expect the ftaa process to proceed further until substantial progress occurs in the dda round negotiations for additional background see crs report rl30935 agricultural trade in the free trade area of the americas by remy jurenas and crs report rs20864 free trade area of the americas major policy issues and status of negotiations by jf hornbeck crs6 drcaftas main agricultural provisions in the agreement the united states and the six countries agreed to completely phase out tariffs and quotas the primary means of border protection on all but four agricultural commodities and food products in seven stages either immediately or over 5 10 12 15 18 or 20 years the four most sensitive commodities fresh potatoes and fresh onions imported by costa rica white corn imported by the other four central american countries and sugar entering the us market will be treated uniquely after specified period the size of the quotas established for these four commodities will increase about 2 each year in perpetuity in other words cap limiting imports will always be in place the tariff on entries above the quota level frequently referred to as the overquota tariff will not decline at all but stay at current high levels to keep out abovequota imports in order to protect producers of the four commodities for all other sensitive products that fall into any of the over10year transition periods negotiators on all sides agreed to provide some measure of protection while details vary by commodity and food product these will take the form of tariff rate quotas effective only during the transition to free trade long tariff and quota phaseout periods nonlinear tariff reductions and the use of an import safeguard mechanism nonlinear refers to practice known as backloading where most of the decline in tariff occurs in the last few years of the transition period safeguards will serve to protect agricultural producers from sudden surges in imports triggered when quantities increase above specified levels when triggered an additional duty temporary in duration is applied to provide protection according to detailed terms found in annexed schedules each country negotiated its own list of agricultural products eligible for safeguard protection countrys right to use safeguards will expire at the end of the transition period all countries commit under drcafta not to introduce or maintain agricultural export subsidies to sell commodities or food products to each other such subsidies though are allowed to counter the tradedistorting effects of exports subsidized by third countries if an exporting country and an importing country fail to agree on counter measures rules of origin specify what is required for product to be considered to have been produced or processed in country that is party to trade agreement they are used to determine whether product benefits from an ftas preferential terms eg dutyfree andor additional quota access the agreement commits all countries to apply the sciencebased disciplines of the wto agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary sps measures to facilitate trade6 should disagreements arise working group will serve as forum for 6 this multilateral agreement includes understandings or disciplines on how countries will establish and use measures to protect human animal or plant life or health taking into account their direct or indirect impact on trade in agricultural products it requires countries to base their sps standards on science and encourages countries to use standards set by international organizations to guide their actions the agreement seeks to ensure that continued crs7 consultations and resolving technical issues the text precludes the use of dr caftas dispute settlement provisions to resolve differences when sps problems cannot be resolved market access for us agricultural products sold to central america and the dominican republic the drcafta will grant immediate dutyfree status to more than half of the us farm products now exported to the six countries according to the office of the us trade representative ustr7 such treatment will apply to highquality beef cuts cotton wheat soybeans certain fruits and vegetables processed food products and wine destined for the five central american countries us exports of corn cotton soybeans and wheat to the dominican republic will benefit also from immediate dutyfree treatment central american tariffs and quotas on most other agricultural products pork beef poultry rice other fruits and vegetables yellow corn and other processed products will be phased out over 15year period longer transition periods will apply to imports from the united states of roughmilled rice and chicken leg quarters 18 years and dairy products 20 years dominican republic tariffs and quotas on most other us agricultural products beef pork and selected dairy and poultry products will be eliminated over 15 years however 20year transitions will cushion the impact of the entry of us chicken leg quarters rice and certain dairy products cheese and milk products8 an overview of these countries drcafta commitments with respect to imports from the united states of selected commodities appears in the section us agriculture and food sectors views on drcaftas agricultural provisions below with salvador guatemala honduras and nicaragua designating white corn as their most sensitive agricultural commodity produced by subsistence farmers and used as staple to make tortillas negotiators agreed to establish quota ie equal to the current import level that increases about 2 annually in perpetuity compared to all other commodities imported from the united states there will be reduction in the overquota tariff for white corn us exports of fresh potatoes and onions to costa rica would be subject similarly to quotas that increase slowly in perpetuity but face permanent high overquota tariffs 6 continued countries will not use sps measures to arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate against the trade of other wto members or to adopt them to disguise trade restrictions 7 ustr free trade with central america summary of

crs8 ustr further states that us agricultural products will have generally better access to the central american countries than is given to similar imports from canada europe and south america the six fta partners also agreed to move toward recognizing export eligibility for all us plants inspected under the us food safety and inspection system market access for central american and dominican republics agricultural products sold to the united states almost all agricultural imports in value terms from the six countries already enter the us market duty free drcafta according to ustr will consolidate those benefits immediately and make them permanent for the us sensitive agricultural products sugar sugarcontaining products beef peanuts dairy products tobacco and cotton us negotiators granted dutyfree access in the form of countryspecific preferential quotas these quotas would be in addition to ie not carved out of the existing agricultural trqs established by the united states under its existing wto commitments which the six countries have taken advantage of historically to export to the us market because of its sensitivity the united states will similarly treat sugar imports as the four central american countries protect white corn imports the new sugar quotas would expand gradually each year but the high and prohibitive overquota tariff will remain unchanged in perpetuity details on the us provisions for sugar and other selected commodities are provided in the section us agriculture and food sectors views on drcaftas agricultural provisions below potential impacts of drcafta on agricultural trade and sectors in an economywide quantitative analysis of the drcafta the us international trade commission itc projects that 12 of the agreements overall export gains would flow to us agriculture twothirds of the export gains would be realized by the us manufacturing 36 and textile 30 sectors see table 39 9 us international trade commission itc uscentral americadominican republic free trade agreement potential economywide and selected sectoral effects publication 3717 august 2004 available at httpwwwusitcgovwaispub3717pdf this summary is based on tables 44 and 45 pp 7576 and the accompanying text this assessment used general equilibrium simulation to look at the impact of the agreements market access provisions on all us economic sectors taking also into account each sectors relative economic importance because the itc used two different data and analytical frameworks this quantitative assessment is not directly comparable to the sectoral analyses for the grains and sugar sectors the latter involved itcs qualitative analysis of the agreements detailed provisions which are summarized in the following paragraphs crs9 textile imports from the six countries would account for almost all of the growth in total us imports under full implementation of the agreement according to the itc additional us agricultural imports would represent almost 2 of the import change under drcafta the itc analysis shows small negative changes in imports of manufactured products energy and other raw materials and services see table 3 increases in us sugar meat and dairy imports due to the expansion andor elimination of us agricultural trqs under drcafta would be offset to some degree by drop in imports of vegetables fruits nuts processed food and tobacco products and other crops imported from the six countries according to the itc these small declines would largely reflect the movement of labor and resources in the dr and central american countries away from producing the latter products which already benefit from preferential dutyfree access to the us market to the more profitable textile apparel leather products and sugar sectors which expand output to take advantage of the agreements openings in the us market under dr cafta us agricultural imports from the six countries would increase 13 table 4 this 52 million in net imports would equal onetenth of 1 of total us agricultural imports 73 billion according to the itc itcs qualitative analysis examined how two agricultural commodity sectors would be affected over time grains and sugar us corn and rice exports to the region would see little change in the short term but would rise as the six countries quotas expand once quotas are fully phased out us grain exports are expected to increase substantially the itc estimates that by the end of the 1520 year transition period annual us grain exports to the region likely would increase by at least 20 120 million based on 2003 prices broken out among corn 75 million rough rice 35 million and milled rice 10 million though the impact of these additional sales in the long run is small equal to 12 of 2003 us grain exports worldwide the itc views the potential increase as offering significant market opportunities for us corn and rice producers the itc further found that the us grains sector would of all economic sectors experience the most noticeable positive changes though very small grain output revenues and employment would rise between onequarter to onethird of 110 the itc expects that the drcaftas sugar provisions likely would result in small increase in us sugar and sugarcontaining product scp imports from the region equal to the quantities spelled out in the new preferential quotas prices calculated to drop by about 1 due to increased imports likely would have an adverse impact on production and employment for us sugar producers at the same time lower prices likely would benefit production and employment for us producers of certain scps particularly of those containing high sugar content the itcs analysis further shows that the us sugar manufacturing and sugar crops sectors would both experience the largest percentage decrease of all sectors in domestic output and employment more than 211 10 ibid pp 5152 7879 11 ibid pp 4647 7879 crs10 table 3 impact of drcafta on us

agribusiness and food firms and the american farm bureau federation general farm organization supported this trade agreement expecting their producermembers and exporters to benefit from the increased access guaranteed to the central american and dominican republic markets supporters in the spring of 2005 formed the agricultural coalition for dr cafta to present and argue their position to members of congress the us cotton sector initially opposed the agreement primarily reflecting the concerns of textile firms but in early may 2005 came out in favor following the decision by major textile trade association to support it other commodity groups concerned about the competitive pressures they expect to face under drcafta opposed the agreement these include the sugar industry and one livestockbeef trade association the us sugar industry strongly opposed the additional access given to sugar fearing its economic impact on domestic producers and processors sugar producers and processors greatest concern was that drcafta sets precedent for including sugar in the other ftas that the bush administration is negotiating position that the industry strongly opposes one trade organization representing cattlemen with concerns about free trade agreements in general opposed drcaftas beef provisions the national farmers union general farm organization opposed the agreement commodity and food trade associations many us agricultural commodity and food organizations supported drcafta expecting their producermembers and exporters to benefit from the market openings negotiated to increase sales to the six countries on march 22 2004 coalition of 39 groups sent letter to president bush to underscore their support for this trade agreement their letter contended the agreement will expand us agriculture exports and put us agriculture on an equal footing with its competitors in these markets that already have ftas with other countries they argued that if cafta is not implemented agricultural trade with these countries would continue on nonreciprocal basis with us farm exports facing significant barriers while over 99 of us agricultural imports from these countries would still receive dutyfree treatment similar coalitions sent nearly identical letters on september 3 2004 and february 1 2005 to each member of congress12 processed foods food manufacturers view the six countries as strong markets for us processed food products pointing out that such exports already account for some 25 of their total food imports and are increasing faster than any other us agricultural export with processed foods facing average tariffs of 15 in the central american countries and 20 in the dominican republic an analysis 12 available at httpwwwuscaftaorgarticlesviewaspid34 httpwwwuscaftaorg policyviewasppolicy_id81 and httpwwwuscaftaorgpolicyviewasppolicy_ id112 crs13 prepared for the grocery manufacturers association gma estimated that the elimination of tariffs and quotas on key food products could result in an 84 increase from 359 million to 662 million in us exports to the region one year after dr cafta is fully implemented growth is foreseen in particular in exports of snack foods confectionary products and soups gma expects other longterm benefits for its member companies with the adoption of new rules that will lead to stronger more predictable business climate in the region examples cited are dealer protections that give manufacturers more flexibility and efficient product distribution enhanced intellectual property and investor protections that are viewed as better protecting trademarks and providing more secure business environment for increased sales of branded products and impetus for further integrating the regions market that results in economies of scale for production and distribution and increased demand for us food products13 rice the usa rice federation supported drcafta noting it achieves market access gains for us rice producers millers and exporters it pointed out that the agreement improves existing access to an already leading market for us rice exports reduces high import duties remedies tariff discrimination against certain forms of rice and extends preferential duty treatment that is not available to any other riceexporting country in particular drcafta preserves existing access for us rough unmilled rice and provides for immediate guaranteed access for milled and brown rice the central american countries agree to establish separate trqs for rough and milled rice the dominican republic created trqs for brown and milled rice totaling almost 407000 metric tons in year 1 increasing slowly over 18 to 20 years to almost 609000 mt this compares to us rice exports to the six countries of 714000 mt in 2004 valued at 184 million inquota rice imports from the united states would longer be subject to applied tariffs ranging from 29 to 99 the separate trqs the rice federation notes will allow end users in these countries to chose between rough and milled rice and over time enable us exporters to sell highervalue rice to these markets14 pork pork producers represented by the national pork producers council nppc supported drcafta because of the immediate benefits created through negotiated market openings each country agrees to create dutyfree trqs for pork cuts totaling 13613 mt in year 1 which then annually rise slowly to equal 29040 mt in year 15 after which quotas and tariffs disappear altogether in 2004 us pork sales to all six countries totaled 8442 mt valued at 16 million inquota pork imports from the united states during this transition will longer face applied 13 gmas statement to the house ways and means committee april

to accept pork from any usdainspected facility15 corn and corn products the national corn growers association ncga viewed the drcafta as creating new export opportunities for us corn farmers and locking in the current us market share in the region it expects the agreement to stimulate us exports of corn coproducts like corn gluten feed and meal distillers dried grains ddgs corn starches corn oil and sweeteners eg high fructose corn syrup hfcs the six countries will reduce tariffs on some corn products such as hfcs within 15 years with tariffs eliminated immediately on corn gluten products starch oils and ddgs the corn refiners association cra also supported the agreement seeing excellent export prospects for these valueadded products that have averaged 19 million in recent years cra notes that the sweetener provisions in drcafta are unambiguous unlike those in nafta which have led to the total loss of market for usproduced hfcs16 tariff and quota provisions on access for us corn in these markets distinguish between yellow and white corn four countries agree to establish dutyfree trqs for yellow corn used primarily as feed for their livestock sectors totaling 115 million metric tons mmt in year 1 rising to 174 mmt at the end of transition periods 10 years for guatemala and 15 years for salvador honduras and nicaragua in 2004 all us corn exports to these four countries totaled 122 mmt valued at 150 million corn exports to costa rica and the dominican republic were 124 mmt 147 million current tariffs imposed by the four countries on yellow corn ranging from 1545 will disappear by the end of the transition period access to costa rica and the dominican republic will be dutyfree in the first year because of its sensitivity and symbolic status as staple food negotiators agreed to treat white corn differently the same four central american countries will also create dutyfree trqs for white corn totaling 84660 mt in year 1 growing slowly to reach 116200 mt in year 20 thereafter each countrys quota except nicaraguas would increase by about 15 each year in perpetuity but the 1045 tariff on overquota imports depending upon the country would remain in place indefinitely costa rica would eliminate its tariff on us white corn over 15 years the dominican republic will continue current dutyfree treatment poultry the national chicken council national turkey federation and the us poultry and egg council supported the agreement the agreedupon provisions largely reflect framework that the us poultry sector developed with the poultry sectors in central

by some of these countries can range up to 164 according to usda us poultry exports to the six countries in the 20002004 period averaged each year just above 73000 mt and were valued at 51 million chicken leg quarters accounted for some 55 of the value of all us poultry sold to these countries under drcafta the six countries will provide immediate dutyfree access on chicken leg quarters each country will create trq on leg quarters that slowly increases as tariffs are eliminated in 17 to 20 years depending on country costa ricas trq of 330 mt in year one would grow by 10 each year the other central american countries each with its own minimum quota level will establish regional trq of 21810 mt in the first year which would rise slowly through year 12 beginning in year 13 the trq would be not less than 5 of regional chicken output the dominican republic agreed on an initial trq for leg quarters of 550 mt growing by 10 annually all countries tariffs on other poultry products eg wings breast meat and mechanically deboned chicken will be reduced at faster pace with many eliminated within 10 years the dominican republic will also establish separate trqs for mechanically deboned chicken phased out over 10 years and for turkey products with 15year phaseout dairy products the national milk producers federation the us dairy export council and the international dairy foods association supported dr cafta they viewed this agreement as providing an opportunity to export more us dairy products to the region on dutyfree basis while minimizing imports from these countries the dairy industry noted that us export access to the six countries offsets the market access that us negotiators granted to australia major dairy exporter under that fta18 the agreements provisions largely reflect the outcome of discussions held between representatives of the us and central american dairy sectors the longest transition period to free trade in drcafta applies to dairy products traded in both directions with provisions structured to provide nearly reciprocal access in the amounts traded between the us and the five central american countries during the 20year transition period us dairy exporters though will receive more access to the dominican republic market than the other way around the us dairy sector pointed out that the agreements declining tariffs and

dominican republic will increase by 10 annually for nonquota products the united states gains immediate dutyfree access in these markets for whey and lactose from 2000 to 2004 us dairy exports some products subject to quotas others not to the six countries averaged 20700 mt 52 million annually according to usda in return the six countries together would receive in year 1 dutyfree quota access to the us market for over 6800 mt of specified dairy products us quotas would each year grow by 5 for the central american countries and by 10 for the dominican republic in 20002004 us dairy imports from these six countries totaled an annual average of 18290 mt valued at 74 million sugar the new preferential quotas offered by the united states for sugar from the six countries are in addition to the minimum level of dutyfree access they already have to the us market together they are allowed to sell each year minimum of 311700 mt of raw cane sugar under their respective shares of the us sugar import quota this represents 28 of the 1117 million mt market access commitment that the united states has entered into with some 40 countries around the world under drcafta costa rica salvador guatemala honduras nicaragua and the dominican republic each will receive varying levels of dutyfree access for combined additional 109000 mt of sugar in year 1 35 increase over their current level

quotas combined will increase by almost 2 2640 mt annually in perpetuity the us overquota tariff calculated by the itc to be 78 in 2003 will stay at the current high level indefinitely and not decline negotiators agreed upon compensation mechanism that the united states can exercise at its sole discretion in order to manage us sugar supplies if activated the united states commits to compensate the six countries for sugar they would not be able to ship to the us market under the above market access provisions the us sugar industry producers of sugar beets and sugarcane and processors of their crops opposed drcafta claiming that the additional sugar imports allowed under its provisions combined with those envisioned in additional ftas being negotiated will destroy the domestic sugar industry and overwhelm an already abundantly supplied market it also viewed drcafta as setting precedent for including sugar in the other free trade agreements that the bush administration is negotiating the industry has continually advocated that sugar trade issues be instead addressed multilaterally in the wto trade negotiations its membership wrote to president bush january 14 2004 and the lead us agricultural trade negotiator march 23 2004 to restate its opposition and to request crs17 that the bush administration reconsider the sugar access commitments offered the central american countries and withdraw the access commitment granted to the dominican republic19 in response the ustr pointed out that the additional access granted all six countries will equal about 12 of current us sugar consumption in year 1 and 17 in year 1520 the trade representative argued that the sugar sector will be protected by the sugar compensation mechanism prohibitive tariff on abovequota imports and the prohibition on thirdcountry transshipments of sugar through any of the six countries to the us market the sweetener users association sua composed of industrial users of sugar and other caloric sweeteners and the trade associations that represent them supported the drcafta it argued this agreement will enhance competition in the us sugar market increase export opportunities for other us food and commodity sectors in the six countries and have positive employment effect on the us confectionery and other sugarusing industries by reducing incentives for them to relocate offshore to take advantage of lowerpriced world sugar21 the international dairy foods association and the national confectioners association similarly favored the agreement because of the access provided for additional imports of sugar imperial sugar company an investorowned sugar processor supported drcafta since it relies almost completely upon foreign sugar for the raw sugar refined at its cane refinery in savannah georgia its president argued that the ability to secure imported sugar is critical to maintaining our competitiveness and ability to provide buyers with sufficient supply of refined sugar22 responding to the itcs analysis of drcaftas impact on the us sugar sector see page 10 the american sugar alliance asa speaking for producers and processors stated it seriously underestimates the danger of the agreement for our industry the itc report according to the asa did not take into account the us commitment under nafta to allow free access to sugar imports from mexico starting in 2008 and potential obligations to open the us sugar market to imports from other sugarexporting countries with which the united states is negotiating free trade agreements sugar import obligations in addition to those in cafta asa argued would cause lower prices more bankruptcies and lost jobs the sweetener 19 american sugar alliance us sugar industry rejects proposed cafta

markup by the senate finance committee on june 14 2005 prompted commitment by secretary of agriculture johanns to sit down with members to discuss their concerns about the agreements sugar provisions members of congress from districts and states where sugar crops are grown subsequently met with usda and white house officials to discuss options proposals presented by some members on behalf of the sugar producers and processors reportedly included 1 earmarking the additional sugar imported under drcafta and any future trade agreements for the production of ethanol by us sugar processors to be subsidized by the federal government 2 an immediate resolution of the ongoing trade dispute about mexican sugar access to the us market and 3 commitment to continue the current features of the sugar program23 on june 22 usda secretary johanns responded with proposal to members that would have usda administer the domestic sugar program through fy2008 when current authority expires so that total us sugar imports would never exceed 1532 million short tons this is the statutory level that triggers the suspension of marketing allotments mechanism agreed to by sugar processors to limit sales of domesticallyproduced sugar to ensure that the total supply of sugar available to meet domestic demand does not result in market prices falling below effective support levels should allotments be triggered the sugar industry argued that the stocks of sugar they would be free to release into the market when added to the additional imports would depress prices low enough to result in usda acquiring sugar as price support loans came due this would result in program outlays and usda not able to meet the nocost objective called for by the 2002 farm bill24 to keep imports below the trigger level usda proposed to donate surplus commodities in its inventories or make cash payments to compensate sugar exporters in central america or mexico for sugar they would not ship to the us market

resolution to their concerns the secretarys june 29th letter to the chairmen of the house and senate agriculture committees pledged to preclude the entry of additional sugar imports if they will exceed the trigger and place the sugar program at risk by 1 making payments using agricultural commodities to sugar exporters in other countries in return for their not shipping sugar to the us market and 2 purchasing or diverting excess imported sugar for restricted nonfood use such as ethanol he also committed to completing study to be submitted to congress by july 1 2006 on the feasibility of converting sugar into ethanol26 the sugar industry early in the talks had proposed sugarforethanol program based upon the availability of federal subsidy administration negotiators rejected that request opting instead for to use surplus sugar imports for ethanol if needed and to conduct study reactions by members to the letter were mixed with some skeptical about the assurance and others remaining opposed in part because of the possible costs that usda might incur in meeting its pledges the us sugar industry rejected the administrations repackaged shortterm offer stating that it did

continuation of the features of the current sugar program after fy2008 spokesman for the asa vowed to work to defeat drcafta27 congressional budget office estimate in its analysis of the drcafta implementation bill hr 3045 s 1307 cbo estimated that the domestic sugar program will likely cost an additional 500 million over the 20062015 period as result of the agreements guaranteed access for sugar from the six countries cbo based its estimate on its march 2005 assumptions about sugar market conditions over this period taking into account other trade agreement commitments particularly those with mexico under naftas sugar provisions however the cbo analysis acknowledges that current sugar market conditions indicate costs would likely be lower in 2006 and possibly lower in 2007 with significant change in later years usda official responded that this analysis was unrealistic adding that there would be virtually cost in 2006 and 2007 under the agreements sugar provisions spokesman

also urged the administration to address the us cotton industrys trade priorities seeking in particular action on increased textile competition eg from china the council initially opposed drcafta and had called upon congress to defer considering the agreement until its textile provisions were thoroughly reviewed and significantly improved the nccs reversal followed the decision of the national council of textile organizations ncto on may 5 2005 to support drcafta29 two other trade associations representing textile firms the national textile association and the american manufacturing trade action coalition opposed this agreement though the ncc favors reciprocal liberalization in cotton fiber trade it has pointed out that textile and apparel provisions in trade agreements can have as much or more of an impact on the domestic cotton sector than simply their agricultural provisions in other fta negotiations to date the ncc has sought naftatype rulesoforigin that directly benefit us textile workers and firms as well as those in fta partner countries but not those in third countries for the most part nafta rules require that the cotton used in yarn the fiberforward rule and the yarn used in cotton textiles the yarnforward rule must originate in the united states or in the partner country for the product to qualify for preferential trade treatment any relaxation of such rules of origin the ncc argues opens the us cotton and textile sectors to unfair unbridled competition from third countries that transship textile goods through fta partner country to take advantage of its dutyfree access to the us market because of its less restrictive rules of origin the ncc initially opposed the drcafta referring to its tariff preference levels tpls and cumulation provisions for

on imports of us prime and choice cuts of beef an objective sought by the us beef industry all countries will phase out tariffs on imports of all other beef products in 5 10 or 15 years certain countries tariff reduction schedules are backloaded for the more sensitive beef products meaning most of the tariff reduction is delayed until the last few years of the transition period the dominican republic salvador and guatemala will create dutyfree trqs for other beef cuts totaling 2265 mt in year 1 which will expand slowly to equal 4110 mt in the year just before quotas are completely eliminated in 2004 us sales of beef to all six countries totaled 1134 mt valued at 42 million usda has noted that all six countries are working to recognize the us meat inspection and certification systems so as to facilitate us exports the united states will create separate dutyfree trqs for beef imported from all countries except guatemala currently the us tariff on such imports is 26 in year 1 the quotas would total almost 23000 mt rising slowly each year to 37962 mt before eliminated in year 15 us beef imports from nicaragua the leading supplier in the region costa rica and honduras totaled 31258 mt almost 82 million last year in elaborating on its position rcalf pointed out there are safeguards for us beef imported from the region while two countries are allowed to impose special safeguards against us beef exports it is concerned also that the rule of origin for beef imports could allow cattle born and raised in argentina and brazil but slaughtered for meat in central america to qualify for preferential tariff treatment when sold to the us market though rcalf acknowledged that the united states obtains immediate dutyfree access for prime and choice beef cuts its spokesman stated that demand in the six countries for these products is limited because the region is small market and many consumers cannot afford such cuts31 30 continued used to produce finished

beef exports now face in the region while providing for adequate protections it pointed to the long transition periods safeguards and the stipulation that countryspecific beef trqs can be filled only after the us beef trq under its wto commitment is filled32 general farm organizations the american farm bureau federation afbf backed drcafta stating that us agriculture has much to gain in an economic analysis of its agricultural provisions the afbf projects that the agreement will result in an estimated net gain of 144 billion for us agricultural trade once fully implemented in 20 years in 2024 it projects us agricultural exports to the six countries will be 152 billion higher than under continuation of current trade policy its analysis acknowledged the us sugar industry will experience costs as result of the increased access to the domestic sugar market granted to these countries by 81 million in year 2033 four statelevel farm bureaus colorado louisiana north dakota and

authorized by the trade act of 1974 these committees provide the views of the private sector to ustr on trade and trade policy matters and serve as formal mechanism through which the us government

quotafree access on essentially all products most of the commodityoriented agricultural technical advisory committees atacs for trade favored the agreement pointing out the benefits associated with increased market access in the region the sweeteners atac reported mixed views sugar industry representatives expressing the majority opinion opposed the increased access to the us market the five countries receive for their sugar pointing out its effects on us sugar producers and the threat posed to the domestic sugar program the sugar users in the minority supported the agreement acknowledging the modest but meaningful improvement in central american sugar access these committees issued separate reports on the agricultural provisions in the fta with the dominican republic on april 23 200435 observations because full implementation of the drcafta will result in reciprocal trading relationship large portion of the us agricultural and food sectors will benefit slightly from expanding exports over time as the six countries eliminate their tariffs and quotas on practically all us commodities and food products the projected increase would represent very small share onehalf of 1 according to the itc of total us agricultural exports to the world this outcome largely reflects the small population of the six countries combined 44 million in 2003 and low per capita incomes when contrasted to the much larger markets in asia where average incomes are higher and agricultural import demand is growing rapidly at the same time the market openings granted these countries could place additional pressure on the us sugar and cottontextile sectors fearing what increased competition from additional imports might mean for their business outlook sugar and cottontextile interests lobbied congress to defeat or to modify this agreement of more interest to the us agribusiness sector likely will be the agreements investment provisions structured to give us investors in the region

products to the us market the six countries agricultural sectors would in the aggregate gain little from this agreement according to the itcs analysis since almost all exports to the us market would continue to benefit from dutyfree access that they already receive under us trade preference programs what would change is that the agreement makes this dutyfree access permanent and sets into motion process that in 1520 years gives these countries unrestricted access to the us market for all sensitive commodities except sugar now subject to us agricultural tariffrate quotas the expanding us quotas reserved for these countries would benefit sugar processors in the region and to lesser extent exporters of beef and dairy products that seek to sell to the us market us debate the congressional debate created divisions within the us agricultural sector between commodity groups that expect to gain from drcafta and those which foresee losses whether this tension is shortlived or continues beyond the debate on this trade agreement will depend on whether and to what extent the bush administration includes comparable openings affecting these same sensitive agricultural products in other ftas recently negotiated eg colombia and peru or yet to be concluded eg panama and thailand recognizing this us trade negotiators are likely to craft these other bilateral free trade agreements acknowledging the political realities involved in securing congressional approval this means translating potential agricultural export gains in trade agreement into bloc of supportive congressional votes it also suggests that ustrs negotiating strategy must incorporate limiting us trade concessions on us sensitive agricultural commodities in order to minimize the number of congressional votes on concluded free trade agreement following senate approval of drcafta most observers acknowledged that securing majority in the house for drcafta would be problematic in large part due to opposition by the sugar sector and some segments of the textile sector consequently administration officials faced dilemma should they press ahead and work to cut deals to line up the necessary votes to make majority or should they consider making further changes to the sugar and textile provisions or related deals sufficient to yield enough yes votes to win approval as precedent for the latter course of action the clinton administration negotiated lastminute changes in november 1993 to naftas sugar and orange juice provisions in order to secure enough votes for house passage us trade officials signaled their reluctance to consider this option for fear of unraveling the overall drcafta package and facing opposition from central american negotiators to such scenario though the administration made commitments to some members to address certain textile issues the president decided to forward the final implementing bill to congress without seeking any changes in the agreement itself the drcafta implementing bill hr 3045 did not contain any provisions for example detailing the sugar compensation provision or the textile commitments though these issues remained under discussion between the administration and some house members until the very close house vote occurred crs25 debate in central america similar debate also occurred in each of the legislative chambers of five countries as their commodity and related groups sought to influence whether dr cafta should be approved or not to date the legislatures of the dominican republic salvador guatemala honduras and nicaragua have approved the trade agreement the debate in guatemala was marked by street clashes before and after the vote in which small farmers with others joined in calls for public referendum on the agreement because of the upcoming presidential election the costa rican legislature may not complete debating drcafta until early 2007 commercial farmers that produce and agribusiness firms that process sugar beef dairy products and nontraditional products with export potential eg fruits and vegetables generally supported drcafta subsistence farmers of staple crops and citizen groups concerned with the trade agreements impact on rural primarily agricultural areas though feared that the gradual removal of quotas even with the safeguard provisions available during the long transition to free trade will not sufficiently protect their livelihood and encourage families to move to urban areas in search of employment representatives reflecting the views of these constituents in their national legislatures worked unsuccessfully to defeat the drcafta when it was submitted for consideration36 some central american leaders though viewed the textile provisions of drcafta as necessary to keep their textile and apparel sectors viable against chinese competition in the us retail market and to absorb the movement of labor out of the agricultural sector37 also not yet clear is the extent to which the governments of the six countries have or might be willing to dedicate financial and technical resources to assist subsistence and small farmers and rural areas
