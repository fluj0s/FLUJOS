security was manifested as early as 1993 with the first world trade center attack and subsequent terrorist attacks against us targets abroad the congressional response to these events began with attempts to understand th nature of the terrorist threat through the creation of several commissions the response to the 911 attacks was followed by specific targeted measures to protect the nation such as the creation of the transportation security administration and the passage of laws that were aimed at strengthening security at the border including immigration policies with respect to the admission of foreign nationals and strengthening security in the maritime domain congressional interest continues in more comprehensive approaches including recent efforts to respond to the report of the 911 commission there are several broad strategies that could be pursued to enhance border security current programs and policies can be grouped under the following generic categories which include pushing the bor der outwards to intercept unwanted people or goods before they reach the united states as in the passenger prescreening program hardening the border through the use of technology as shown by biometric identifiers making the border more accessi ble for legitimate trade and travel as in trusted traveler programs strengthen ing the border inspection process through more effective use of intelligence with the integration of terrorist watch lists and multiplying the effectiveness of interdiction programs through the engagement of other actors in the enforcement effort as displayed by binational accords with canada and mexico it is also possible to use the strategies as checklist for what new efforts might be explored many current programs and policies to enhance border and transportation security were put into place as result of the 911 terrorist attacks with sense of urgency to prevent another attack programs and policies in existence prior to the attacks however were often created with different focus and not necessarily with the terrorist threat in mind the challeng for congress is to review these programs and policies comprehensively to help them form more coherent and effective overall strategy this re port will be updated periodica lly as events warranthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32840contents introduction 1 c n g r s s i n l c n c r n s1 s l c

security selected programs and policies introduction border and transportation security bts is pivotal function in protecting the american people from terrorists and their instruments of destruction while bts may be difficult to attain the federa l government has put into place multiple programs and policies to achieve this goal the three reports in this series attempt to provide an understanding of the comp lex problems faced in seeking enhanced border and transportation security suggest framework to better understand existing programs and policies and explore some possible new di rections and policy options as noted in the first report1 in this series homeland security efforts can be seen as series of concentric circles or screens with the outer screen being that of preventive efforts launched outside the country before terrorists or their weapons can reach the country the continuum of activities to provide homeland security then moves through progressively smaller circles starting from more distant efforts to closer and more localized measures ending with emergency preparedness and response thus the process starts with prevention abroad and progresses through the other stages as needed as the first report in this series observes border management is complex task and current programs and polic ies in place to strengthen the border and facilitate the flow of legitimate people and things can seem overwhelmingly complex and difficult to approach in systematic way this report addresses the myriad programs and policies that make up the nations current approach to attaining higher levels of bts before doing so however it is useful to review the developm ent of congressional concern and policy approaches congressional concerns congressional concern with terrorism and border secur ity was manifested early following series of terrorist attacks begi nning in the 1990s the shock of the first world trade center attack in 1993 was fo llowed by two attacks in saudi arabia riyadh in 1995 and khobar towers near dhahran in 1996 the simultaneous embassy bombings in 1998 kenya and tanz ania the attack on the uss cole in 2000 and culminating in the catastrophic att ack on the world trade center and the pentagon on september 11 2001 the congre ssional response began with inquiries related to the nature of the terrorist th reat and was followed by specific targetedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32840crs2 2 the official names and dates of creation of the commissions are as follows 1 gilmore commission known officially as the advisory panel to assess

passed on nov 25 2002 pl 107296 4 see for example the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 pl 104208measures to protect the nation following the events of 911 there are indications that congressional interest continues in broader more comprehensive approaches including recent efforts to respond to th report of the 911 commission contained in the national intelligence reform ac t of 2004 pl 108458 congressional policy evolution is ch arted briefly below broad efforts to understand the terrorist threat starting in 1998 congress created three commissions to better understand the nature of the terrorist threat facing th nation these included the gilmore commission to investigate domestic preparedness to cope with weapons of mass destru ction the bremer commission to explore the terrorist threat and what could be done to prepare for it and the hartrudman commission to i nvestigate national security challenges in the 21st century2 structural changes to provide proper framework for action following the 911 attacks congress enacted legislation to create the department of homeland secu rity to provide structural framework for subsequent acti on and the usa patriot act to provide the tools needed for the ne w challenge to national security3 starting even earlier but continuing through this period congress attempted to remedy perceived flaws in the immigration system with series of legislative measures4 highly specific actions to prot ect against immediate threats understandably following the 911 attacks that were committed by foreign national extremists early legislative action called for the immediate implementation of the entry and exit control system the use of biometric identifiers in travel documents and intelligence sharing among federal law enforcement and immigration agencies through the passage of the patriot act airline security measures were taken with the creation of the transportation security administration among other things in the aviation and transportation security act that was soon followed by the enhanced border security and visa entry reform act to tighten immigration practices and tools and legislation

attacks upon the united states washington gpo 2004 7 congress also passed several other pieces of legislation relevant to homeland security the usa patriot act the enhanced border s ecurity and visa entry reform act of 2002 the aviation and transportation security act the air transportation safety and system stabilization act and the maritime transportation security act of 2002serious threats posed in the maritime domain with enactment of the maritime transportation security act5 interest in broader more comprehensive approaches as evidenced in recent oversight hearings congress has been frustrated by the failure to more aggre ssively address other border and transportation security threats including the need to create integrated terrorist watchlists nd measures to address other modes of transportation rail and mass tr ansit air cargo trucking and buses these concerns were given strong impetus by the final report of the 911 commission which highlighted the need for more strategic approaches to the terrorist threat and are expressed in legislative form in the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 1084586 the next section of the report traces the development of selected programs and policies designed to achieve higher levels of border and trans portation security and presents them in framework that f acilitates better unders tanding of current approaches and some possible new directions selected programs and policies since the september 11 2001 rrorist attacks the nation has made securing the homeland its primary objective border security has emerged as critical stage in achieving this goal prior to the terrorist attacks federal agencies involved in securing the homeland were fragmented nd often plagued by internal performance problems as discussed below many fede ral agencies tasked with securing the nations borders did not communicate with one another moreover technology was inadequate for communications within many of these agencies as well as between agencies for example immigration systems and databases which are critical when trying to determine the admissibility of foreign national and keep bad people out of the country were not and to some extent still are not integrated in an effort to address some of these issues congress passed the homeland s ecurity act of 2002 pl 1072967 the homeland security act of

determined that some of the terrorists used fraudulent documents and many of them subsequently violated immigration law 12 see for example the usa patriot act the enhanced border security and visa entry reform act of 2002 and the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 13 see crs report rl31733 port and maritime security background and issues for congress by john frittellipeoplerelated border security since the terrorist attacks considerable focus has been placed on the fact that the 19 terrorists were aliens who apparently entered the united states legally despite provisions in immigration law that could have barred their admission11 fears that lax enforcement of immigration laws regulating the admission of foreign nationals into the united states may continue to make the united states vulnerable to terrorist attacks have led many to call for tighter measures at the border as well as during the screening process for visas these cerns which are cons tantly weighed with efforts to facilitate the legitimate travel of people across the border have been expressed frequently in legislative form12 goodsrelated border security the us maritime system consists of more than 300 sea and river ports with more than 3700 cargo and passenger terminal s with most ships calling at us ports being foreignowned containe r ships have been the focus of much of the attention on seaport security due to the potential of terrorists infiltrating them more than 6 million marine containers ente r us ports each year and while all cargo information is analyzed by cbp officers for possibl targeting for closer inspection only fraction is actually physically inspected13 cbp works in tandem with the us coast guard at sea ports of entry efforts such as the coast guards requirement that ships provide 96hour notice of arrival and cb ps container security initiative csi program aid in preventing more harmful things from getting to the united states in addition to maritime security much attention has been focused on the nations air truck and rail system similar to the massive volume of containers entering the nations seaports airports also experience large volumes of cargo current policies at the border the us government has employed number of strategies and programs to make the nations borders more secure the following actions are set in framework that suggests types of possible policy actions pushing the border outwards to in tercept unwanted people or goods before they reach the united stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32840crs6 14 for additional

with cbp inspector cursory check of the travele rs documents and query of the interagency border inspection system ibis which is an immigration data system that interfaces with other federal immigration and law enforcement data systems 17 traveler is referred to secondary inspections if the cbp inspector is suspicious that the traveler may be inadmissible under the immigr ation and nationality act or in violation of other us laws during secondary inspections travelers may be questioned extensively and travel documents are further examined several immigration databases are queried as well including lookout databases for terroristshardening the border through the us of technology and the presence of more agents at the border making the border more accessible for legitimate trade and travel strengthening the border through more effective use of intelligence and multiplying effectiveness through the engagement of other actors inthe enforcement effort including engaging canada mexico state and local law enforcement resources and the private sector efforts to push out the border many contend that the best way to secu re the border is by addressing issues before they reach the border while this concept is not new greater emphasis has been placed on pushing the border out since the terrorist attacks the following discussion is organized to highlight ac tivities that target people and goods for inspection people14 in 2004 there were more than 427 million travelers who were inspected at us port of entry15 of the 427 million travelers who sought entry into the united states in 2003 approximately 62 were foreign nationals while the majority of travelers seeking entry into the united states are admitted during primary inspections16 small percentage of travelers less than one percent are referred to secondary inspections17 in theory by pushing out the border the number of travelers needing closer scrutiny at the border ie referrals to secondary inspection would diminish which would create higher level of security following are few examples of either congressional mandates andor administrative initiatives that are aimed at pushing out the border preinspections preinspections are immigra tion inspections conducted at foreign ports of embarkation by united states authorities for passengers seeking entryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32840crs7

inspectors enforce various criminal and administrative statutes apprehend violators and adjudicate variet of applications for various immigration benefitsinto the us congress first author ized immigration preinspections in 199618 however efforts to preinsp ect travelers had previously been underway for several years as of spring 2005 15 foreign air ports participated in the preinspection program19 and congress has ma ndated that preinspections be extended to at least 25 foreign airports20 under the preinspection program the secretary of homeland security details immigration officers to foreign airports while immigration officers that are located at preinspection sites can perform ge neral inspection f unctions other law enforcement functions performed by immigration officers within the united states may be limited in the countries wher preinspection sites are located21 although the original intention of pre inspections was to decrease the number of inadmissible aliens entering the united states some officials now view it as useful means to better secure our borders wh ile facilitating the flow of travel setting up preinspection sites at fore ign airports however is not without controversy in order to have preinspection site at fo reign airport the united states must enter into diplomatic negotiations with the host country these negotiations include addressing issues such as sovereignty and the extent to which immigration officers can enforce united states immigration laws in the foreign country another issue in setting up preinspection sites at foreign ai rports is the amount of resources it takes to staff them immigration officials are assigned to preinspection sites based on the volume of travelers seeking entry to the ited states thus countries that may not have the volume of travelers to justify preinspection site may still justify having such site based on the number of high risk travelers advanced passenger manifest air carriers route to the united states from foreign country are required to sub mit passenger manifests in advance of their arrival at us port of entry while in spections are done on us soil such advance notification alerts

exit data system now referred to as the usvisit program that would track the arrival and parture of every alien35 the objective for an automated entry and exit data system was in part to develop mechanism that would be able to track nonimmigrants36 who overstayed their visas as part of broader emphasis on immigration control following the sept ember 11 2001 terrorist attacks however there was marked shift in priority fo r implementing an automated entry and exit data system while the tracking of nonimmigrants who overstayed their visas remained an important goal of the system border security has become the paramount concern tracking the entry and exit of most foreign nationals at us ports of entry is not small undertaking the massive volume of travelers seeking entry into the united states at one of the 300 nd air and sea ports of entr coupled with the demands such system would place on port infrastructure makes implementing the system challenging nonetheless

defined as inform ation relating to the capabilities intentions and activities of foreign powers organi zations or persons but not including counterintelligence except for in formation on international terrorist activities see part 34d executive order 12333 united states intelligence activities dec 4 1981 48 both the joint inquiry into intelligence comm unity activities before and after the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 dec 2002 and the final report of the national commission on terrorist atta cks upon the united states july 2004 found that there were various missed opportunities with respect to the lack of watchlisting of three of the 19 hijackers khalid almidhar as well as brothers salem and nawaf alhazmi 49 although it is now commonplace to hear public policy arguments about the integration continuedabout the vwp being potential loophole for rrorists of concern to some is the delay in issuing nationals from the participating countri passports that contain biometric identifiers although this concern may have abated since the administration is now requiring foreign nationals entering the united states through the vwp to be enrolled in the usvisit program45 strengthening the border through more effective use of intelligence46 intelligence plays an essential role in the protection of us national security one element of which is to contribute to the protection of us borders as with traditional foreign intelligence47 the primary role intelligence plays in the context of border security is to provide indications and warnings to government personnel responsible for border protec tion primarily dhs personne l regardless of where the intelligence is collected domestically or internationally intelligence contributes to the protection of us borders by seeking to prevent certain goods and individuals from crossing us borders howe ver as the tragic events of september 11 2001 demonstrated even when intelligen ce systems and mechanisms are in place to prevent individuals with inimical intent from crossing us borders it only takes one failure of the intelligence process andor individuals i nvolved in it to contribute to potential catastrophe48 traditional foreign intelligence as well as criminal intelligence contribute to enhancing border security at the most basic level intelligence is designed to find where the danger lies with respect to protection of the us borde rs the primary goal is to collect analyze and rapidly disseminate intelligence that can deny entry into the united states of terrorists or dangerous materi that could be used as weapon by terrorists with respect to terrorists one of the mo st useful tools in the governments counterterrorism arsenal for border protec tion is the terrorist screening database tsdb first compiled by the terrorist threat integration center49 as testamenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32840crs17 49 continued of various terrorist watchlists historically th ere was one watchlist which had as its singular purpose preventing known or suspected terrorist s from entering the country this watchlist initiated by the us department of states bureau of intelligence and research inr in 1987 to assist the bureau of consular affairs in making decisions about granting visas was known as tipoff pursuant to homeland security presidential directive6 elements of the tipoff database have been transferred to the terrorist threat integration center ttic in turn ttic and its databases will be incorporated in the new national counter terrorism center which was stat utorily created by pl 108458 50 see testimony of russell travers puty director for information sharing and knowledge development the terrorist threat integration center before the national commission on terrorist attacks upon th united states washington jan 26 2004 these figures as of jan 8 2004 51 the terrorist screening center and the foreign terrorist tracking task force have the dual mission of denying known or suspected rrorists entry into the united states and should they gain entry to the united states to locate prosecute or deport any such aliensto the robust role that traditional fore ign intelligence entities are playing in the protection of border security of the more than 20000 records in the terrorist screening database in 2004 the central intelligence agency provided just over 42 of the entries the state department provided almost 42 the national security agency provided 10 the federal bureau of investigation lmost 4 and the defense intelligence agency just under 350 at the sensitive but unclassified sbu security level the tsdb is then shared broadly across the us government to include agencies such as the dhs the fede ral bureau of investigation and the fbi led

certain protective actions by the law enforcement intelligence or secur ity personnel having in teraction with the individual with respect to protection against illicit cargo coming into the united states and the potential for shipping to be used as conveyance of weapons of mass destruction one of the unique tools being used by dhss cbp is its automated targeting system with shipments into the united st ates in the thousands of containers per day it is not practically or financially feasible to inspect each container building on years of experience in interdicting drugs being shipped into the united states through cargo containers dhss cbp establis hed the interagenc ysupported national targeting center ntc as tool to triage and effectively target cargo containers for inspection working with the intelligence community and law enforcement community personnel the ntcs automate d targeting system develops dynamic rules and algorithms which allow it to ex amine broad scope of passenger and cargo factors to assign appropriate risk scores certain risk scores flag shipment or container for human inspection in short intelligence serves as force multiplier in contributing to the protection of us borders it serves the direct pur pose of providing advance warnings to alert officials on the front lines of us borders however its indir ect use may be equally valuable that is why domestic intelligence officials including those at the state andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32840crs18 52 programs and policies discussed under other headings or listed in appendix are also examples
