unch satellite thought sputnik might be an indication that the united states was trailing behind the ussr in science and technology the cold war also led some us policymakers to perceive the sputnik launch as possible precursor to nuclear attack in response to this sputnik moment the us government undertook several policy actions including the establishment of the national aeronautics and space

influential the sputnik launch captured the publics attention at time of heightened us tension regarding the threat posed by the ussr and communism societal focus on civil defense including duck and

concerned that if the ussr could launch sate llite into space it could also launch nuclear missile capable of reaching the united states11 the sputnik launch was immediately viewed as challenge to us scientific and technological prowess the soviet union launched both sputnik and sputnik 2 before the united states was able to attempt satellite launch12 additionally the soviet launch was of far heavier satellite than the us had planned13 the net result of the sputnik launch was called pearl harbor for american science sign that the united states was falling be hind the ussr in science and

percent of the entire federal budget of the united states as one of the most internationally recognized agencies in the government many people assume that nasas budget is much higher in reality we have to make tough choices in the allocation of scarce resources we just cannot do everything that our many constituencies would like us to do we need to set carefully considered priorities of time energy and resources and for this were guided by the nasa authorization act of 2005 our annual appropriations presidential policy and the decadal surveys of the national academy of sciences 37 the house committee on appropriations also expressed concerns about these issues stating nasa has too many re sponsibilities and not enough resources to accomplish them all38 similarly the senate committee on appropriations stated nasas vision for space exploration maps out an aggressive role for the united states in manned space expl oration however the potential costs are substantial and will likely be very difficult to main tain at the current estimated funding levels the committee is concerned that nasa will neglect areas that only tangentially benefit or do not fit within the

some insights while the aldridge committee has much broader view of the industries related to space explorati on focusing on the potential role of space exploration in job generation and new market development the space act and space policy focus on only one sector the aer onautical and space vehicle industry the two presidential commissions have tw key differences one is the first theme outlined in the sputnikera killian committee report the compelling urge of man to explore and discover this is quite different from the recent aldridge commission report which although indicatin g exploration and discovery should be among nasa goals states that exploration and discovery will perhaps not be sufficient drivers to sustain what will be long and at times risky journey the implication is that today solely responding to the challenge of going to the moon or mars is not sufficient to energize public support for space exploration the second key difference is the fo cus of the aldridge commission on economic growth as proposed space explor ation theme the aldridge commission identifies the ability of investments in ci vilian space programs to generate new jobs within current industries and spawn new ma rkets the contribution that federal space investments make to the na tions economy was not key factor identified by the killian

nations priorities for civilian space exploration and its implications for future space policy current us civilian space policy is ba sed on set of fundamental objectives in the space act based on policy discussions that occurred following the launch of sputnik over 50 years ago those objectives are still part of current policy discussions and influence the nations civ ilian space policy prior ities both in terms of what actions nasa is authorized to undertake and the degree of appropriations each activity within nasa receives nasa has active programs that address all its objectives but many believe that it is being asked to accomplish too much for the available resources nasa was last reauthorized in 2005 for fy2007 and fy200860 thus the reauthorization of nasa for fy2009 and beyond along with nasas upcoming 50th anniversary in fall 2008 may provide an opportunity for congress to rethink the nations space policy some analysts have called for new 21st century space policy

the focus of nasa s activities and the degree of funding appropriated for its programs congress and outside expe rts have concerns as to whether the united states can afford to implement president bushs vision for space exploration without adversely in fluencing nasas other programs62 congress may need to make challenging decisions to determine how to reap the most benefit from the nations civilian space program inves tment these decisions might answer questions such as what are the priorities among the many reasons for us space exploration for example what might be the priority ranking among the previously identified reasons as to why the united states might explore space knowledge and understanding discovery economic growth national prestige defense international relations and education and workforce development what implications would this prioritization have for nasas current and future budgets and the balance among its programs for example what is the proper ba lance between human and robotic space activities what influence might the timin g of other countries space exploration activities have on us policy for example what would be the impact of the united st ates china or another country or commercial organization blishing the first moon base or landing on mars new objectives and priorities might help determine nasas goals this in turn might potentially help congress determine the most appropriate balance of funding available among nasas prog rams during its authorization and appropriation process for example if congress believes that national prestige should be the highest priority they may choose to emphasize nasas human exploration activities such as establishing moon base and landing hum an on mars if they consider scientific knowledge the highest priority congre ss may emphasize unmanned missions and other sciencerelated activities as nasas major goal if international relations arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34263crs19 63 the origins of

intellectual appeal of journey to space exploration and discovery will perhaps not be sufficient drivers to sustain what will be long and at times risky journey we must also undertake this mission for
