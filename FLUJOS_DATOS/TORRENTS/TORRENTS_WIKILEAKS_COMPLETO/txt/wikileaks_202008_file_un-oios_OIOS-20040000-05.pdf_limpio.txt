united nations united nations interim administration mission in kosovo unmik nations unies mission dadministration intérimaire des nations unies au kosovo investigations task force irregularities in the provision of heating ventil ation and air conditioning system at pristina airport case 021904 i introduction 1 this case arises out of an audit report dated 28 february 2003 into the financial statements of pristina international airport conduc ted by the chartered accountants which led to an investigation concerni ng alleged corruption and irregularities identified in the course of procurem ent activities at pristina airport 2 there are four specific allegations in this repo rt of investigation the contract for the heating ventilation and air conditioning system was not included in the contract for the expansion of the p assenger terminal the original design specification was deficient the contract was tendered as single source contr act when competitive tender would have sufficed the company who provided the design specification was also unofficially invited to provide an offer to install and construc t the system ii applicable laws and united nations rules section 1 of unmik regulation 199924 dated 12 december 1999 as amended states that the law applicable in kosovo shall be the regulations promulgated by the special repr esentative of the secretary general srsg

source procurement is the appr opriate method to be used 2421 as the goods works or services can be provi ded by only one supplier iii methodology 3 this investigation was conducted pursuant to exe cutive decision 200316 on the establishment of the investigation task force the itf investigators conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by interviews with persons indicated to be witnesses and persons potentially i mplicated in the allegations by obtaining documents from the pristina airport admin istration and from pillar iv which were then analysed for relevance to the inqui ry at hand iv background information 4 pristina international airport constitutes sta owned enterprise under yugoslavian law the assets of the airport include the runways terminal buildings hanger fuel storage facilities and equi pment during the period covered by this investigation from 2001 until 2003 they were maintained by the public enterprise airport pristina peap in coope ration with military units of the kosovo force kfor pursuant to united nations sec urity council resolution 1244 dated 10 june 1999 and unmik regulation 1 1999 dated 25 july 1999 unmik is mandated to administer the territory of ko sovo including state owned and publicly owned assets this includes pristina i nternational airport 5 until the end of june 2002 responsibility for t he administration of the pristina airport was entrusted to the civil administration p illar pillar ii of unmik under the direction of official 1 heshe was the supervi sor of official 2 who in turn supervised doti official 1 department of transport and infrastructure doti was later known as the transport sector of the unmi k directorate of infrastructure affairs doti official 1 left unmik at the end of june 2002 doti official 2 was recruited by doti as an internationa l staff member on 31 july 2000 in charge of airport operations reporting to doti official 1 and continued in this role until 30 september 2001 engineering expertise was provided by series of engineers seconded from the french army specifical ly airport engineer 1 airport engineer 2 and airport engineer 3 and lat er by consultant from the consulting company 6 on 1 july 2002 the responsibility for the admin istration of the airport passed from pillar ii to the kosovo trust agency kta and pillar iv official 3 was appointed under himher were the peap official and official 4 7 on 1 april 2004 pristina international airport which had until that time been under the jurisdiction of kfor was handed over to c ivilian jurisdiction pursuant to icao regulations 3 8 it is against this background of change that pro curement procedures relating to the following contract have been examined v investigation details 9 this report relates to the contract for the cons truction of new heating ventilation and air conditioning system at pristina airport the value of the contract was 68112548 analysis of evidence allegation 1 it is alleged that the contract for the heating v entilation and air conditioning system was not included in the contract for the expansion of the passenger terminal due to poor forward planning by airport management 10 meeting was held at the headquarters of vendo r 1 to redefine the requirements and implementation of the contract for the upgradin g and extension of the pristina airport terminal building 11 an analysis of the minutes of that meeting dat ed 11 december 2000 at the headquarters of vendor 1 indicate that it was atten ded by the peap official on behalf of peap and doti official 3 on behalf of unm ik paragraph 74 the minutes records that peap stated the existing hvac equipment is already over dimensioned and requires heating ventilation an air conditioning system be included in the design for the new passenger termi nal expansion 12 prior to the itf locating the minutes of the eting at vendor 1 the peap official was asked why the heating and air conditio ning system was not included in the contract for the enlargement of the passenge r terminal or at least tendered at the same time as the contract for the enlargemen t of the passenger terminal heshe replied first of all there was an urgent need to extend t he terminal at that time one wanted to provide us with funding for the expan sion i heard from doti official 1 or unmik transport official that we went for the least expensive option and that the existing heating and airconditioning system would be sufficient because there was money once work started then it was suggested that the existing heating and air conditioning system was inadequate and could not pport the capacity of the expanded terminal 13 however the suitability of the heating ventil ation and air conditioning equipment is unlikely to have been something within the knowl edge of doti official 1 or unmik transport official 14 the peap official confirmed in interview that h participated in the meeting dated 11 december 2000 at the headquarters of vendor 1 h owever when asked whether heshe said 4 peap stated the existing hvac equipment is already overdimensioned and requires heating ventilation an air conditionin g system be included in the design for the new passenger terminal expansion the peap official replied first of all vendor 1 asked to accompany them and to check the airport terminal i showed them the terminal building and i showed them the heating and air conditioning system that was repaired by th member states kfor in 1999 one of the opinions given by vendor 1 enginee r was that the existing system would cover the needs of the airport the re ason was because of the limited funds about 2 two millions german marks for the extension of the passengers terminal the idea was to provide the n ecessary minimum 15 this response is both evasive and inconsistent with the peap officials earlier statement in interview and the minutes of the meeti ng dated 11 december 2000 which were signed by the peap official as well as f our other parties from vendor 1 unmik and peap there is indication in it or in any other documents that the vendor 1 engineer provided advice of this natur during his first visit to the airport 16 when asked who made the statement at the meetin g the peap official again provided an evasive and conflicting answer stating i was not the only person representing peap there were many other persons there persons that are mentioned in the do cuments that you are showing the minutes were held by the recorder nd in the end we signed i dont recall making that statement i didnt see what was written in the document before signing it we doti official 2 do official 3 vendor 1 engineer and three others agreed with others and when they signed i signed as well this document was not signed in th meeting doti official 2 brought the document and i signed it i didnt r ead the document my english was not good at that time as it is now we didnt say to vendor 1 to not put hvac system i n the new design because the existing system was to be connected wit h the new hvac system for the new extension of the passengers terminal 17 minutes of the meeting indicate that the peap fficial was the sole peap representative at the meeting and the party respons ible for the statement at the meeting that the existing hvac equipment is already overdimens ioned and requires heating ventilation and air conditioni ng system be included in the design the peap official s explanation that heshe did n ot recall making the statement and did not read the minutes of the meeti ng before signing them give rise to doubts about the truthfulness of hisher an swer as well as indicating an unwillingness to take managerial responsibility 18 doti official 2 when asked about the statement that heating ventilation and air conditioning system was required and who had s aid so stated peap would be the peap official and the decision w ould have been taken by the peap official the peap official would have said i dont need it and heshe was the driving force in saying i dont need it i dont know what doti official 3 said as i was not party to the discus sion at this point there was not lot of cash 5 19 when asked who at peap was responsible for taki ng the decision that heating and air conditioning system should be included in t he design doti official 2 replied the peap official would be and then myself and civil aviation officer you need an engineer for any project and we did not hav one at that time 20 if there was insufficient money for the expansi on and modernising of the passenger terminal to go ahead without something as fundamental as new heating ventilation and air conditioning system i t raises questions as to why the project was allowed to proceed without the necessar funding being available 21 in the course of his interview doti official 2 commented we wanted to get the airport terminal expansion pr oject going and to launch the tender process the present system was nough and the peap official said we do not need it 22 according to evidence provided by the peap offi cial in an earlier interview the original design of the heating and air conditioning system dated from 1975 although the member states kfor had repaired it in 1999 this suggests that the system was in excess of 20 years old in additi on draft tender notice dated 24 january 2001 indicates that the expansion of the terminal building increased the floor space from 1800m² to 4000 m² 23 the interoffice memorandum from doti official 2 and airport engineer 1 dated 30 august 2001 requested single source procureme nt to design new heatingairconditioning system for the airport th reasons given to justify the single source were that the heating and air conditi oning system was too old and the replacement had not been taken into account for financial reasons the note also indicates that new money had become available 24 when asked about the inconsistency between the minutes of the meeting dated 11 december 2000 and the interoffice memorandum dat ed 30 august 2001 doti official 2stated i didnt review the previous document dated 11 dec ember 2000 before signing the document created by airport engineer 1 in looking at the second document my only reaction is that we currently had more money at that time and the system was needed i therefore gave the go ahead due to the changed financial circumstances 25 the peap official when asked the same question stated i dont know the reason why there is an inconsiste ncy in between the document dated 11122000 and that of 30082001 ven today i disagree with the statement on the paragraph 74 in the minu tes of the meeting dated 11122000 i personally understood later the rea why it was not included in the design i was told that this was an earlier agreement between unmik and vendor 1 i dont recall who was the person fro m unmik that was the party in this agreement 6 26 this response suggests third explanation from the peap official for the heating ventilation and air conditioning not being included in the design for the passenger terminal expansion project 27 in summary the decision not to include the hea ting ventilation and air conditioning system in the passenger terminal expan sion project appears to have been taken initially due to the lack of funding an d the desire to get the passenger terminal expansion project going however the proj ect should not have started until sufficient funding was available note from official 3 to official 5 dated 20 july 2002 indicates that the main contract for the passenger terminal expansion started on 16 january 2002 whilst the interoffice memorandum from doti official 2 and airport engineer 1 suggests that fun ding for the heating ventilation air conditioning became available by 30 august 20 01 28 having regard the fact that temperatures in kos ovo range from 20c in winter to 30c plus in summer and the existing system was ov er twenty years old the decision to proceed with the passenger terminal exp ansion project without something as fundamental as new heating ventilat ion and air conditioning system represents substantial error of judgement and demonstrates poor management and inadequate forward planning 29 the person principally responsible for this dec ision was the peap official however hisher decision was endorsed by doti offi cial 2 and civil aviation officer as well as doti official 1 in hisher capa city as official of the department of transport infrastructure 30 evidence provided by the peap official to the i tf on this issue during hisher interview on 22 november 2004 was evasive and contr adictory as well as raising doubts as to his willingness to take managerial res ponsibility allegation 2 it is alleged that the original design specificati on drawn up by vendor 2 for the heating ventilation and air conditioning system wa s deficient necessitating an increase in the contract price 31 in october 2001 bills of quantities technical descriptions and drawings for the heating and air conditioning system for the new air port were drawn up by vendor 2 32 however letter from vendor 3 to the procurem ent officer kta dated 4 september 2002 one year later indicates vendor 3 requested an increase in the value of the contract from 58269548 to 681125 48 due to extra work recommended by the company to be added to the bills of quantities and technical specifications for the heating ventilatio n and air conditioning system drawn up by the company vendor 2 33 the letter suggests that the design produced b vendor 2 did not include inter alia electrical work or civil work necessary to co mplete the design specification the further work appears to have resulted in the co st of the project rising by 98430 7 34 the consultant engineer contracted from the consulting company to supervise the project when asked about this stated the design produced by vendor 2 was not deficient as far the mechanical installations were concerned but was deficient as far as the electrical and civil works were concerned the inclusion of an automatic regulation system was simply to improve the design action was taken gainst vendor 2 as result of the electrical and civil works 35 in looking at the documents prepared by vendor 2 for the design of the heating ventilation and air conditioning system it is appa rent that they only cover the mechanical installation of the heating ventilation and air conditioning system this gave rise to the possibility that the company had only been asked to design the mechanical installation 36 when asked about this issue in hisher itf inte rview the peap official stated that heshe did not know what vendor 2 was to provi regarding the design but understood that they should provide full documentat ion about the project 37 vendor 2 engineer in charge of the design was also contacted by the itf and asked whether hisher company was asked to design the new heating ventilation and air conditioning system or just the mechanical installation heshe confirmed that hisher company had received instruc tions only to produce draft design for the mechanical installation from the pe ap official heshe added that the design had then been taken and altered by vendo r 3 the company who carried out the installation of the heating ventil ation and air conditioning system without any consultation and therefore heshe did not consider hisher company to be liable for any problems resulting from the re design of the system this is confirmed by fax from the peap official copy f which was forwarded to the itf 38 in summary the initial design produced for the heating ventilation and air conditioning system appears to have contained defic iencies although they were later remedied however evidence suggests that thi s was due to vendor 2 only being asked to produce design for the mechanical installation for the system rather than the whole system allegation 3 it is alleged that the contract for the heating v entilation and air conditioning system was tendered as single source contract when it co uld have been the subject of competitive tender 39 article 24 of unmik finance administrative inst ruction 19992 on public procurement using kosovo consolidated budget funds provides that direct single source procurement may be used for g oods works or ancillary physical services 241 if such direct single source procurement is not used to 2411 avoid competition 2412 discriminate against other suppliers and 242 direct single source procurement is the appr opriate method to be used 8 40 2421 as the goods works or services can be provi ded by only one supplier 41 list of six prospective companies able to car ry out the single source contract dated 29 july 2002 suggests that there were at leas t six companies who would have been able to tender for the heating ventilati on and air conditioning system however an annotation at the bottom of the list in dicates that official 3 took decision to request single source procurement for t he heating ventilation and air conditioning system this is confirmed in memoran dum from official 3 to pillar ii official 2 dated 8 august 2002 official 2 gave approval for single source procurements on 8 august 2002 42 bidding documents indicate that on 4 september 2002 vendor 3 submitted bid in the sum of 68112548 for the construction of t he heating ventilation air conditioning system for the passenger terminal at p ristina airport which was accepted in letter signed by official 3 dated 4 s eptember 2002 43 official 5 and official 3 signed contract wit h vendor 3 dated 5 september 2002 for the construction of the heating ventilation an d air conditioning for the passenger terminal at pristina airport on 14 septe mber 2002 44 when asked why heshe decided to go for singl source procurement official 3 indicated that this had been due to the time avail able and referred to memorandum written by himher to official 2 dated 8 august 2002 this memorandum indicates that official 3 made request for single source procurement due to concerns that the airport passen ger terminal could be closed if the heating ventilation and air conditioning sy stem was not completed before the onset of winter 45 however the memorandum also indicates that the tender for the project was ready to be launched by pillar ii on 27 may 2002 b ut for unknown reasons was delayed and handed over to pillar iv on 1 july 2002 when that pillar assumed responsibilities for the poes this suggests that the project was delayed due to lack of management supervision prior to official 3s arrival by doti official 1 who was the person responsible for the airport expa nsion project at pillar ii 46 this point is reinforced by the comments of the procurement officer in the itf interview that there would have been enough time fo r competitive tender if it had been started in may or july although heshe co nceded that the airport may not have had the procurement officers to do so 47 the itf also notes that official 5 signed an am endment to the contract for the expansion and modernisation of the passenger air rminal with vendor 3 on 27 august 2002 48 in summary having regard to the fact that the design for the heating ventilation and air conditioning system was produced in october 2001 and the tender for the project was ready in may 2002 the requirements of article 24 of unmik finance administrative instruction 19992 on public procure ment using kosovo consolidated budget funds do not appear to have be fulfilled since there was more than one company able to carry out the project and had the tender been 9 organised in may 2002 there would have been time t have competitive tender single source procurement could therefore have been avoided 49 responsibility for this breach lies with the of ficials of the airport and department of transport and infrastructure prior to the arriva l of official 3 the peap official and doti official 1 allegation 4 it is alleged that the company who provided the sign specification for the heating ventilation and air conditioning system was also officially invited to provide an offer to install and construct the system 50 in the course of discussing the tender for the heating ventilation and air conditioning system in interview the procurement fficer stated official 3 asked for my assistance regarding the pr ocedure they had to follow to apply the direct single source method later on heshe received the consent to continue with the single source method i told official 3 that procurement unit w ould send the documents to some companies and they had to take the best offer heshe insisted that he would send the documents only to vendor 3 and that heshe would do it himself and heshe did so after some days we received an offer about 11 million euro from vendor 3 to do the job official 3 left this ffer at the procurement and waited for us to decide the peap official did not agree w ith that price since in hisher opinion it was high and heshe contacted some other companies and requested to attend the meetings with them we had some m eetings with three companies vendor 2 i think vendor 3 and vendor 4 we put those three companies in competition and held meeting with th ree of them in the same time one after another and the companies saw that there would be competition and so they reduced the prices the best of them was vendo r 3 which submitted bid of 68112548 vendor 4 bid about 900000 and ven dor 2 about 1000000 this was what we could do the reduction from 11 million to 68112548 51 this suggests both that an attempt was made to obtain several quotes for the heating ventilation and air conditioning system an d that quote was received from the company who provided the design the itf h as only seen the offer submitted by vendor 3 52 the peap official when asked by the itf whethe r quote from vendor 2 was requested confirmed that it was 53 in summary evidence indicates that an offer wa s received from vendor 2 which designed the heating ventilation and aircondition ing system to also construct and install the system this would have been in bre ach of tender procedures had competitive tender been organised other issues 54 analysis of note from official 3 to official 5 dated 20 july 2002 indicates that the original contract for the expansion of the pass enger terminal was seriously flawed specifically it states that the contract r equired substantial changes before the work could start on 16 january 2002 involving major items such as steel 10 works foundations walls granite flooring winter snow loadings of the roof and other matters 55 official 3 was asked by the itf what action was taken concerning vendor 1 when the alleged deficiencies were discovered and whethe r an independent review of the contract was undertaken heshe replied i understand that design deficiencies were discove red in january 2002 and were rectified before i started work on 1 july 2002 i was not responsible for the terminal expansion contract at that time and i have knowledge as to whether an independent revi ew was carried out before my arrival 56 document entitled amendment no1 to the contr act for the expansion and modernisation of the passenger terminal confirms th at official 5 signed an amended contract with vendor 3 on 27 august 2002 57 in summary the deficiencies appear to have bee n remedied however evidence does not indicate that any action was taken against vendor 1 concerning the apparent deficiencies found in its original contrac t for the expansion of the passenger terminal and it is too late to do so now the parties responsible appear to be the peap official and the civil aviation off icer vi findings of fact 58 decision was taken to go ahead with the expan sion and modernising of the passenger terminal expansion at pristina airport wi thout including in the contract new heating ventilation and air conditioning sys tem 59 the initial design for the heating ventilation and air conditioning system did not make provision for electrical or civil works necess ary to complete the design specification however this was due to the fact th at these works were not requested in the original design vii conclusions 60 the decision not to include the heating vent ilation and air conditioning system in the passenger terminal expansion project appears to have been taken initially due to the lack of funding and the desire to get t he passenger terminal expansion project going however the project shoul d not have started until sufficient funding was available 61 having regard the fact that temperatures in kos ovo range from 20c in winter to 30c plus in summer and the existing system was ov er twenty years old the decision to proceed with the passenger terminal exp ansion project without something as fundamental as new heating ventilat ion and air conditioning system represents substantial error of judgement and demonstrates poor management and inadequate forward planning 62 the person principally responsible for this dec ision was the peap official however his decision was endorsed by doti official 2 and civil aviation officer 11 as well as doti official 1 in hisher capacity as fficial of the department of transport infrastructure 63 evidence provided by the peap official to the i tf on this issue was evasive and contradictory as well as raising doubts as to his her willingness to take managerial responsibility 64 the initial design produced for the heating ve ntilation and air conditioning system appears to have contained deficiencies although th ey were later remedied however evidence suggests that this was due to the company vendor 2 only being asked to produce design for the mechanical installation for the system 65 having regard to the fact that the design for t he heating ventilation and air conditioning system was produced in october 2001 an d the tender for the project was ready in may 2002 the requirements of article 24 of unmik finance administrative instruction 19992 on public procure ment using kosovo consolidated budget funds do not appear to have bee n fulfilled since there was more than one company able to carry out the project and had the tender been organised in may 2002 there would have been ample time to have competitive tender singlesource procurement could therefore h ave been avoided 66 responsibility for this breach lies with the of ficials of the airport and department of transport and infrastructure prior to the arriva l of official 3 namely the peap official and doti official 1 67 evidence indicates that an offer was received f rom the company vendor 2 which designed the heating ventilation and aircondition ing system to also construct and install the system this would have been in bre ach of tender procedures had competitive tender been organised 68 there appear to have been deficiencies in the riginal contract for expansion of the passenger terminal although evidence suggests that they were remedied however evidence does not indicate that any action was taken against vendor 1 concerning them and it is too late to do so now viii recommendations 69 the itf make the following recommendations recommendation 1 it is recommended that unmik consider the role of the peap official and doti official 2 responsible for t he decision to proceed with the passenger terminal expansion project without new heating ventilation and air conditioning system for any appropriate action dot i official 1 and the civil aviation officer although responsible longer work for t he however their respective roles should be recorded and copy of this report be placed on their personnel files iv0421901 recommendation 2 it is also recommended that unmik pillar iv take appropriate action with regard to the itfs adverse findings concerning the peap officials evasive and contradictory responses in i nterview together with hisher apparent unwillingness to accept managerial respons ibility iv0421902 12 recommendation 3 it is recommended that unmik take note of the rem aining breaches detailed in this report specifically the failure to organise competitive tender for the heating ventilation and air conditi oning system and the failure to take action concerning the deficiencies in the passenger terminal design and take any appropriate action against the peap official for hi s role the roles of doti official 1 and the civil aviation officer both of whom lon ger work for the should be noted with copy of this report placed on their pe rsonnel files for future reference iv0421904
