summary 1 c charge discussed swedens role in afghanistan and kosovo in separate meetings january 16 and 17 with goran lennmarker and urban ahlin the government and the opposition leaders in the parliaments foreign affairs committee lennmarker and ahlin both saw room for increases in the number of swedish troops in afghanistan the swedish deployment to afghanistan comes up for extension in late 2008 and ahlin asked us to help in telling the story of the humanitarian role swedens troops play ahlin lamented the governments goslow policy on kosovo recognition and asked for legal points on the kosovo independence issue and unscr 1244 see action requests at 8 end summary afghanistan 2 c charge daffaires met january 16 with goran lennmarker chairman of parliaments foreign affairs committee and january 17 with urban ahlin vicechairman of the committee and foreign policy spokesman for the opposition social democrats on afghanistan both noted that sweden had authority to increase deployments to the swedenled prt in mazare sharif from current levels of 365 to as many as 600 ahlin emphasized that parliament granted the government this flexibility in order to enable it to respond to unforeseen difficulties as the price extracted by the social democrats for their consensus support of this governmentproposed increase in may 2007 the term of authorization had been shortened and will expire in december 2008 this will mean that the deployment and authorized levels will come up for review and reauthorization in the fall of 2008 as before the proposed authorization would be limited to the mazare sharif prt area and to peacekeeping rather than peacemaking activities 3 c in anticipation of the debate on this extension ahlin emphasized it would be necessary for the social democrats to be able to explain why they are supporting the uns and natos efforts in afghanistan this story could best be told by afghanis ahlin asked for our help in getting senior afghanistan government official to come to sweden to relate humanitarian stories such as how the swedish and nato efforts are allowing girls to go to school keeping the country from being taken over by drug lords and keeping the taliban from oppressing the people ahlin suggested it would be useful for nato to distribute at its bucharest summit sheet telling the story of natos humanitarian role in afghanistan 4 c regarding the possibility of sweden sending jas gripen fighters to afghanistan ahlin said the social democrats had told the moderateled alliance government they would not agree to this mission afghanis would not be able to distinguish swedish planes from those of countries engaged in combat operations in iraq per ahlin note the swedish military continues to argue for gripen mission to afghanistan kosovo and the balkans 5 c ahlin said he disagreed with the goslow approach that foreign minister bildt and the mfa are taking on the recognition of kosovo reftel at the same time it was important for the government to be able to justify legally the position it takes on kosovos independence sweden is legalistic society and gives great deference to the he continued swedish concerns about provisions in unscr 1244 regarding the independence of kosovo and the sovereignty of serbia need to be addressed ahlin asked us to provide information on the us legal interpretation of these provisions of unscr 1244 concerns about russia 6 c both lennmarker and ahlin said sweden has serious concerns about the direction russia is taking lennmarker referring to his role as the head of the osce parliamentary assembly underscored the importance of keeping the wests doors opened for russias neighbors nato needed to provide an opening and hope for georgia and ukraine and he recommended that nato unveil creative thinking in its april summit in bucharest he recalled the important signal the baltic charter played in the 1990s as model lennmarker added that he was meeting with solana and would push for the eu to intensify it engagement in georgia and ukraine stockholm 00000051 002 of 002 comment 7 c ahlin noted that he is perceived as being on the right wing of his party on security issues and relations with the us he is wellwired across the spectrum in stockholm and is willing to play useful role regarding afghanistan and kosovo lennmarker defers to fm bildt as does the rest of the governments foreign policy apparatus action request 8 c we request assistance to respond to ahlins two requests for our help on afghanistan and kosovo on afghanistan to help arrange for the testimony of senior afghan government official before the swedish parliament in order to explain the humanitarian contribution of the swedishled prt per ahlin this would help the swedish parliament in extending the mandate of the swedishled prt on kosovo to provide information on the us legal interpretation of the provisions of unscr 1244 dealing with the sovereignty of serbia and independence of kosovo wood
