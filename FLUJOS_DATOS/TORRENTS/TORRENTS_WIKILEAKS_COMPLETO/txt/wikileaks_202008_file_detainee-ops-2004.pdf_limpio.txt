use of force follow established use of fo rce policy in responding to all detainee uprisings employ the minimum amount of force necessary to compel compliance never use excessive force in almost every si tuation nondeadly force will be sufficient to control the situation 1 use of force continuum model for determining when and w hat types of force to use against noncompliant individuals in enforcement situations includes the use of force continuum the demeanor and activity of the persons ag ainst whom the security force are taking action determines the force recommended by the continuum the tinuum recognizes four basic types of subjects passive compliant person who follows the staff members requests or verbal directions passive resistor does not follow orders or requests but offers phy sical resistance to the officers attempts to gain control active resistor does not follow the staff members request or direction offers physical resistance to the staff member s attempts to gain control but does not attempt to harm the staff member examples bracing or pulling away attempting to flee active aggressor attempts to harm or attack the staff member b the use of force continuum consists of six levels ideally the s taff member starts at level i and moves up the scale one step at time until the subject complies with lawful orders however aggr essive actions by the subject may require skipping steps and moving directly to higher but appropriate force level note nothing in these rules limits the service members inheren t right of self defense level 1 staff member presence this is the baseline for the model nd is satisfied as security members carry out their duties level 2 verbal commands security member actions include ver bal commands and task direction aimed at the subject passive compliant persons will respond to these commands level 3 soft control techniques th techniques authorized at this level are designed to bring subject under control with low prob ability of causing connective tissue damage lacerations of the skin or broken bones these techniques include the normal application of handcuffs pain compliance and strength techniques level 4 hard control techniques or chemical irritants hard control techniques are used against active resistors and aggressors the techniques authorized at this level are designed to bring subje ct under control with probability of causing connective tissue damage lacerations of the skin or broken bones techniques include kicks and punches stuns and takedown m aneuvers using oc spray is also an effective method for gaining compliance of acti ve resistors and aggressors however oc for official use only signature draft signature draft for official use only iv8 spray is not infallible and other level 4 chniques may be necessary after using the spray dod personnel must receive preauthorization from the app ropriate commander to use oc spray level 5 intermediate weapon this is defensive technique that relies upon authorized expandable baton strikes to bring an active aggressor under control the techniques authorized at this level are designed to bring subject under control with high probability of causing connective tissue damage lacerations of the skin or broken bones level 6 deadly force deadly force is used only as last resort to counter force by subject that poses substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury figure iv1 use of force continuum b security element personnel must remember at all times to use force appropriate for the circumstances list can give all sc enarios where force is needed the security element personnel must use their own expe rience and training when deciding what level of force is appropriate employ the use of force continuum as method of determining the most applicable use of fo rce security element personnel will not tolerate disruptive or violent behavior but th ey will not be abusive in their use of force the safety of the crew and the detainees requires fair but firm use of force c procedures train all security personnel in approved use of force policies prior to 1 coming in contact with any detainees 2 1 roeuse of deadly force

measures when required may impair detainees abi lity to breathe sand bags as hoods restrict airflow use them only as last resort in some areas of the world using the detainees own headgear as hood device is ideal ie turbans andor burqas blackened goggles are the preferred security measure 2 with different bindings ensure blood flow is not restricted from the restraints 13 being to tight monitor detain ees after restraints are applied check for discoloration of 14 skin which is one indication that the restraints are to t ight 15 3 flexcuffs 550 cord and ducttape are light weight and easy to use see 16 figures d1 through d6 for pictures of flexcuffs and their use 17 flexcuffs national stock number 846500072673 plastic b and with 18 selflocking mechanism at one end when threaded the

550 cord around the wrist several times and then wrap the cord 22 around between the wrists to help prevent ex tra loosening around the wrist tie cord 23 using knot like the square knot be extra careful to ensure blood flow is not 24 restrained 25 c use duct tape in the same manner as the flexcuff or 550 cord take 26 caution not to restrict blood flow use your best judgement as to the number of times to 27 wrap with tape based on the detainees strength and size 28 4 the preferred method of restraint is behind the back with palms facing away 29 from each other if injury prevents this

3 aboard naval vessels the procedures also ar of use as planning considerations for 4 shortdurationshortdistance movements by any maritime vessels including by army 5 watercraft in those cases the command ing officer co should use these ttp as 6 onboard resources and time allowances when ships brig is available confine 7 detainees per secnavinst 16409b as applicable to detention operations aboard ship 8 2 background as result of their specified mission or through actions of other combatant forces cos of naval vessels may engage in detainee operations security custody and control of detainees are key factors that cos must address to sure the safety and security of both the vessel and detainees b the following are situations where naval vessels may engage in d etainee operations 1 capturing detainees in the conduct of hostile operations 2 transferring detainees to the custody of the co for transport to nother holding facility 3 temporarily holding persennel detain eed at sea pending reasonable opportunity to transfer them to shore fac ility or to another vessel for evacuation to shore facility 3 general guidelines when conducting detainee operations the following guidelines appl 9 cos must keep the holding of detainees onboard vessels truly tem porary limited 10 to the minimum period necessary to evacuate the detainees from combat zone or to 11 avoid significant harm detainees would face if detained on land article 11203 of 12 secnavinst 16409b 13 b detention and release authority of detain ees aboard naval vessels rests with the 14 secdef or his

provide firm but humane treatment at all times report to the co all acts or 3 allegations of inhumane treatment 4 4 personnel support considerations naval crews involved in detainee operations often require outside ssistance to 5 conduct safe and efficient operations id eally augmentation by appropriate personnel 6 will occur before the unit commences oper ations determine rough estimate of 7 support needs by reviewing the expected area of operations the anticipated level of 8 activity and organic unit capabilities once needs are determined the unit should work 9 with its administrative and operational co mmanders to arrange proper support in 10 many instances unit will become involved in detainee op eration case that is 11 exceedingly complex or requires personnel pport beyond expectations when faced 12 with shortnotice need for personnel support contact the operational commander 13 immediately and describe precisely what help is needed early notification is essential 14 in preventing naval crews from being ov erwhelmed during dire circumstances 15 consider the following personnel support augmentation 16 interpreters detainee operations ofte n bring us personnel into contact with 17 vessel crews or detainees that do not speak english depending on the operating area 18 the vessel may require specialty language transla tion ie arabic korean etc if the 19 co does not have crewmember aboard with necessary language skills the co should 20 request an interpreter through the jtf co mmander assign interpreters when 21 assigned to the units operations department they should rec eive berthing 22 appropriate for their rank berth civilian in terpreters in chief petty officer or e6 23 quarters as available cos may want to consider language cards that offer basic 24 instructions ie stand up sit down do not speak come with etc 25 b us marine corps security detachment when deemed necessary for the safety 26 of the crew and detainees the co should consider requesting tempor ary assignment of 27 us marine security personnel in digenous to the task force 28 1 make the embarked marine detachment taskorganized for the specific 29 security mission the size and composition of the detachment is situation dependent 30 with the principal considerations being the number of detainees involved and the size of 31 the cutter or ship the detachment can range from small 2person team to large 32 force of more than 100 marines 4 to 6person detachment is typically embarked 33 aboard patrol boats 8 to 16person detach ments are normally detailed to frigates and 34 cruisers naval amphibious ships engaged in detainee operat ions often require 35 detachment of more than 50 marines 36 2 chain of command there are two ways to integrate detachment of marines 37 into the host units chain of command 38 aboard smaller units where the marines will perform all or t he majority 39 of security duties the marine co or oic may report directly to the ships executive 40 officer as do other department heads in th is instance the senior marine coordinates 41 with the department heads to carry out the assigned security duties the co or oic 42 may assign few naval unit crewmembers to assist the marines in their security 43 for official use only signature draft signature draft for official use only g3 mission this arrangement is ideal for smalle r vessels such as coast guard patrol boats 1 or buoy tenders and navy patrol craft 2 b the second option is more appropriate aboard units where onboard 3 personnel perform much or most of the curity duties with augmentation from the 4 marines in this case the marine deta chment co or oic should report to the 5 department head responsible for shipboard secu rity normally the operations officer or 6 first lieutenant as would division officer this arrangement is used aboard coast 7 guard high and mediumendurance cutters and most navy comb atants in large navy 8 ships the units master at arms maa is often assigned sec urity duties in this 9 instance if the senior marine is nonco mmissioned officer the marine detachment 10 may report directly to the ships maa 11 3 berthing arrangements marine corps security detachments should deploy 12 aboard ship with sleeping bags and isopor mats in lieu of assignment to berthing 13 areas provide the marines with space to t up their gear lounges hangars or other 14 open spaces are appropriate berth the securi ty detachment together as space permits 15 for detachments that embark without sleeping gear assign mem bers to berthing 16 commensurate with rank in the same space if possible 17 4 armory space the unit cooic shall provide the marine secu rity 18 detachment with adequate armory spac to store all embarked weapons and 19 ammunition 20 c sar

go overboard maintain twoonone 23 concept to overcome detainee and to maintain dive pair safety divers and swimmers 24 better serve if on small boat loitering near th ship understand that sea state and ship 25 speed may dictate where swimmers and divers are posted when t ransfers are 26 accomplished underway 27 d chaplains chaplains can play an im portant role in detainee operations 28 missions by advising the co as to all matte rs regarding religious practices for embarked 29 detainees unfortunately the small number of chaplains in t he military limits their 30 availability during routine detainee oper ations unit co engaged in detainee 31 operations may request chaplain be assign ed at any time when deemed necessary for 32 the interests of the crew and embarked detain ees chaplains report directly to the unit 33 co and act as the religious and spiritual ad visor for the command they work with the 34 executive officer for administrative function s and work closely with department heads to 35 coordinate activity all chaplains are comm issioned officers berth them accordingly 36 see appendix j for religious support 37 medical personnel embarking large numbers of detainees can q

have in advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation emergency 2 medical technician or other medical train ing to provide valued resource when 3 conducting triage and follow on care in some cases units can expect to conduct 4 detainee operations on short notice in this case the unit co should request rapid 5 medical augmentation through the operatio nal commander so as to not overwhelm 6 medical staff medical augmentees are assi gned to the units medical department or 7 division with the senior medical official reporting directly to the executive officer 8 5 holding area considerations detainee operations on naval vessels with or without brigs should anticipate 9 detainee operations even if the vessel maintains brig the co must plan for 10 exceeding such capacity 11 detainee holding area the co shall designate secure and sa fe space to house 12 detainees the layout of the detainee holding area will depend on the physical structure 13 of the ship the number of detainees and various other factors most commonly 14 detainees are housed in an open area on the weather decks such as fantail or flight 15 deck where few pieces of deck machinery or other interferences exist but they are 16 provided reasonable shelter from the elements do not house detainees within the skin 17 of the ship unless required by adverse weathe r or other constraints physically isolate 18 the detainee holding area away from main passageways and cen ters of activity and 19 when necessary where secutrity personnel ca n secure necessary detainees to stanchions 20 or other structures using leg irons or handcuff s the security watch must restrict and 21 keep positive control of access to the ships interior from the detainee holding area arm 22 the security watch on most vessels this will require that several doors hatches or 23 scuttles leading to the holding area be secured from the inside for the benefit of the 24 ships crew clearly post on the interior of each fitting warning such as this fitting 25 leads into the detainee holding area only open in emergencies on some vessel classes 26 ladders leading to the detainee holding area can be removed or lifted to prevent their 27 use thereby limiting the number of entrances to the holding ar ea use portable cells if 28 detainees are isolated to the fantail or open area outside skin of ship conex boxes for 29 longer than 20 days if possible do not use flight decks so that they are available for 30 evacuation resupply or as means of detainee embarkation 31 b showers providing showers for embarked detainees will help maintain sanitary 32 and health standards in the detainee holding area at m inimum the shower should 33 consist of garden hose rig showers on the periphery of the hold ing area in location 34 that provides privacy place curtain ar ound each shower pay close attention to 35 adequate drainage cleaning and the preven tion of safety hazards eg slippery 36 surfaces for installed showers 37 c fresh water supply to prevent dehydration detainee groups hou sed aboard 38 vessels require access to fresh water consistent with avail able onboard supplies make 39 every effort to provide ample water to meet the needs of embarked detainees locate 40 the fresh water source where shipboard security detail can exercise positive control over 41 it personnel can use two general fresh wa ter sources continuous flow garden or 42 potable water hoses and set amount coolers pitchers or jugs of water 43 for official use only signature draft signature draft for official use only g5 d toilets hosting detainees or large num bers of detainees requires setting up 1 additional toilets on the ships weather deck s the type of toilet employed will depend 2 on the storage and fabrication capabilities of the host unit toilets can range from 3 simple buckets to fully operational commerci algrade commodes regardless of the type 4 toilet used it should be located in an area t hat allows privacy and rig it with privacy 5 curtain 6 hand washing facility set up hand wa shing station near weather deck toilets 7 for use by detainees garden hose or makeshift sink is adequa to meet this need 8 f decontamination stations

sea the co must weigh necessary security needs against th possibility of injury or harm coming to the detainee and crew such security consideration includes restraints and detainee behavior 2 detainee transfer via small boat cos should consider how th security aspect of transfer alter standard sma ll boat operations for example handcuffs if the detainee appears compliant and was searched prior to detainment the security detail may remove th handcuffs during the transfer operation removing handcuffs will significantly enhance detainees ab ility to protect his or her own life if falling in the water or facing ot her perils transport uncooperative or violent detainees in handcuffs but the security detail must exercise exacting control over the detaines to ensure they are not injured du ring

detainee if he or she was not cuffed prior to boarding and escort to the detainee holding facility 4 transporting violent detainees use th minimum force necessary to compel uncooperative or violent detainees to comply with orders during transfer if needed physically restrain the detainee in one of th following devices for the duration of the transport assign at least four guards pe r detainee for the transport if use of one of these devices is necessary stokes litter this is transport li tter equipped with flotation used to move accident victims retain detainee in stokes litter and

and supply issue depending on the ships layout units can reverse the first two steps in the order take detainees requiring ur gent medical attentio n directly to medical triage bypassing other normal checkin statio ns the checkin process should resemble an assembly line with detainees following specified route and passing through each station in order station an adequate numbe r of shipboard personnel along the route and at each station to guide the detainees as they pass through ensure proper tactical spacing of the security personnel sp read these members out evenly along the embarkation route so that they can quick ly respond to unrest at any location chapter v offers detailed processing requirements 6 head count and identification for small boat transfers maintain two separate running cou nts of arriving detainees from the bridge of the unit and at each embarkation point the bridge counter should receive word from each small boat as it approaches regarding the number of detainees aboard the counters stationed at the embarka tion points will count each detainee as they step aboard single person can normally handle the bridge count but use two or more crew as available to coun t at each embarkation point the persons conducting the count on the bridge and at embarkation points should remain in direct contact with each other using radios telephones or sound powered phones and should periodically compare their counts to ensure accuracy b for alongside transfers conduct the head count at the point of embarkation as each detainee steps aboard from the transferring unit conduct dual counting with counters stationed at the point of embarkation 7 detainee identification and search as detainees step aboard t he vessel the embarkation point count team should re move the detainees pfd if appropriate for official use only signature draft signature draft for official use only g12 alternately allow detainees to hold onto their pfd for use as p illow if the transferring unit has completed identificati on of detainees being transferred the transferring unit should inform the receivin g unit and provide copy of their detainee log and custody records the receiving uni t will verify the identification of each detainee as they arrive onboard and ensure thorough search if the transferring unit does not perform detainee identification the receiving unit should prepare and affix capture tag to each person the count team should obtain copy of the detainee custody log from the transferring unit or initiate and maintain d etainee custody log listing each number issued if detainee custody log is not provided by the transferring unit the log should identify each detainee by the number and their s tatus eg adult male adult female it is not necessary to obtain names of the detain ees 8 detainee and luggage search the second step is to conduct search of each detainee to inspect for weapons illegal substances or other dan gerous items though not preferred if the transferring unit has previously conducted detailed detainee and luggage search expidite this step by simply verifying the proper tagging of all detainee possessions transferred if search is ne cessary and sufficient security personnel are available conduct two or more detainee searches simultaneousl to speed up the embarkation process the following guidelines apply conduct standard crush and feel frisk of the detainees out er clothing if necessary when there is heightened concern of unrest or violen ce conduct full searches of the detainees to include strip search if deemed necess ary if required medical personnel should perform body cavi ty searches male crewmembers should search male detainees and female crewmembers should search female detainees in the event that female crewmembers are ava ilable male crewmembers should conduct the search showing due regard for the privacy of the detainee b remove for closer inspection any items that detainees could

the detainee using the persons id tag as receipt after the detainees are delivered to their ultimate destination inform detainees that their luggage can claim their luggage at later date 10 medical triage another key process is providing medical triage to the detainees shipboard medical personnel should screen each detai nee for obvious signs of injury or illness commence immediate treatment for detainees w hose lives are in danger separate all detainees displaying in dicators of contagious disease and isolate them make immediately available all supplies needed durin g the embarkation and early care phases toiletries blankets dical supplies paper cups shower shoes identification tags latex gloves and other materials establish records as necessary 11 supply issue the final step of the checkin process is to prov ide each detainee with the supplies he or she will need during the cours of the embarkation normal supply issue to each detainee consists of blanket b one pair shower shoes

embarked detainees make all members of the ships company intimately familiar with their responsibilities both toward their vessels safety and security and the wellbein g of the detainees embarked complacency will become risk as the crew becomes familiar with their du ties routine and the detainees 1 the ships crew has the legal and moral responsibility to c are for the detainees onboard and will tend to their needs using consistent and reasonable means 2 fairly but firmly enforce all rules and regulations the sh ips crew will remain fully in charge and will not tolerate belligerent hos tile or violent behavior 3 do not compromise the safety and security of the host vessel as it is of prime importance 4 the crew will treat detainees with humanity respect and com passion and will accommodate the ethnic religious and cultural customs and practices of the detainees with due regard to security 5 in all situations the demeanor and actions of the ships com pany must remain professional and fair 6 when in the custody of us forces detainees are bound by the rules regulations and directions given them by th ships crew detainee cooperation is the key to successful embarkation the ships force must strive to create the impression that they are clearly in control of the sit uation but are interested in the detainees concerns and wellbeing determining fa ctor over which the ships crew has little control is the state of mind and level of cooperation from the detainees themselves an uncooperative group will create more difficu lt and tense relationship while docile detainee groups will reap the benefits of mo re subdued control by the ships security force b initial briefing as time permits an initial briefing to detainees can help set the proper tone for their time aboard clear sconceptions and deter potential problems the in briefing is an optional tool that shou ld not take precedence over the myriad of other security and logistical arrangements necessary durin g the first few hours of an embarkation if used conduct the initial brie fing in small groups or with the detainee population as whole cover these topics 1 established rules and

and beware of tripping hazards 6 refrain from all sexual relations while aboard the vessel 7 remain within designated areas at all times define limits of movement d first impressions essential to settin g the proper tone for an embarkation is how the detainees are treated as they come aboard the vessel horseplay taunting and any meanspirited actions toward the detain ees are expressly forbidden conversely the crew must not appear too eager to curry favor with the detainees as it may lend an improper impression regarding control and enforcement of rules crewmembers must pay close attention to their actions and only exhibit behaviors that support the professional fair firm and compassionate image that is essential to successfully dealing with detainees if faced with any sign of detainee unrest violence or unruly behavior the ships force should make very visible and immediate show or separating or restraining uncooperative or hostile detainees security considerations hosting aboard coast guard or navy vessel dozens or hundreds of potentially unhappy ill or inconsolable det ainees generates unique security concerns because the ships crew is familiar with their surroundings

during late night hours place these assign ees on standby status if not immediately needed to care for the detainees 5 rotation excuse security watch stander s from other shipboard duties for the duration of the detainee embarkation as personnel levels allow the ideal rotation is oneinthree watch with each watch lasting four hours alternatively personnel can maintain port and starboard with each watch lastin g 6 hours avoid employing security watch standers for periods of nger than six hours whenever possible 6 arming security personnel equip secu rity forces with weapons or nonlethal personal protective devices as needed to provide selfdefense and to mai ntain control of the detainee population in the vast majority of situations the use of side arms and rifles are unnecessary and inappropriate detainees are search ed during the for official use only signature draft signature draft for official use only g17 embarkation process and are unlikely to possess weapons that m ay necessitate the use of deadly force against them carrying adly weapons among the detainee population may exacerbate tensions or may even become tempting target for detainees bent on serious unrest it is feasible that rush of detainees could overwhelm security personnel and take the weapons the stand ard protective devices issued to security personnel are the expandable baton and chemical irritant quip each qualified security watch stander with one or both devi ces security personnel should wear them on the standard weapons belt in addition carry handcu ffs or flex cuffs for use in restraining violent or aggressive detainees do not arm secur ity personnel who come in frequent contact with detainees but ensure re straints are used before transferring from one part of the ship to another and

supply the security watch with an adequate number of flex cuffs extra handcuffs g irons and keys or other devices as called for by the circumstances 3 communications the security watch ction should remain in direct contact with the vessels bridge the best communications are via h andheld radios which are portable and afford instant notification of emergencies backup systems include personal communicators sound powered phon or the ships telephone service conduct communications checks at regular in tervals not to exceed every 30 minutes 4 remote surveillance employ closed circuit television or other installed surveillance gear on the bridge or combat information center ciccommand security center csc to keep remote watch on the area where detainees are h oused this provides backup in case communicati ons are lost during an emergency 5 access restrict crew access to the deta inee holding area to official business only allow only those personnel with direct role in providing security or care to the detainees to enter the holding area 6 alarms establish and use distinct alarm in case of detainee uprising or other security threat on deck the alarm can consist of ve rbal pipe over the loudspeaker mc system dedicated alarm or combination of both use of the detainee uprising alarm should immediatel trigger activation of the ships ert verbal announcements should precede alarms 7 consistency detainees will quickly lear n to take advantage of watch sections or individuals that laxly enforce regulations consistency in the application of force enforcement of rules and degree of care provided to the detainees is ess ential to maintaining calm and control the senior security officer should ensure all watch sections conform to given standards of treatment care and secu rity 8 daily routine establishing set routine for detainees impa rts an aura of stability and normalcy to an otherwise uncomfortable situati on and allows the ships crew planning tool

additional supplies in loca tion close to the detainee holding facility where they are accessible by security and ca re personnel shipboard supply personnel should check and replenish the stockpile at regular intervals at least every 4 hours during the day conserve onboard detainee supplies consistent with potential future needs as they are limited keep supply stockpiles under the control of security personnel do not allow deta inees direct access to supplies the normal procedure for issuing additional supplies is for the detainee to signal to security watch stander that they need

limited personnel and supplies differences in diet and the physical condition of the for official use only signature draft signature draft for official use only g21 detainees providing healthy and edible food is one of the most im portant aspects of the detainee care process 1 type of food the vast majority of detainees hail from nations with markedly different culture than that of the united states american cuisine is much richer than that found in most detainee so urce countries feeding normal american fare to detainees can lead to digestive difficulties and illness in as far as possible the basic philosophy for feeding detainees is to provide meals consis tent with their cultural and religious norm 2 quantity the rule of thumb for daily caloric needs is min imum of 2100 calories per person per day provide at least 10 percent of the calories as fats and 12 percent as proteins serving meals twic day in generous quantities should meet the nutritional needs of most persons individuals who are ill suffer chronic nutritional deficiencies or pregnant have nutritional needs t hat require more frequent and specialized meals 3 periodicity of feeding feed detain ees more than three and less than two times each day the standard feeding schedule is three tim per day providing meals to detainees after the vessels crew has eaten this is easily accomplished for most small to mediumsized groups of detainees twicedaily feedi ngs are employed when large groups of detainees tax the logistical capabilities of the unit start feedings in midmorning between 0830 and 0900 and late afternoon around 1530 or 1600 it may take several hours to undertake each feeding of large detai nee group when using twicedaily feeding schedule provide additional meals for persons who are ill or suffer chronic nutritional deficiencies 4 drink if supplies permit make fresh dr inking water available to detainees at all times the source of fresh water should remain under the positive control of security personnel when water rationing is necessa ry provide water at meal times and during the heat of the day 1000 to 1600 k feeding procedures two notional procedures are generally used 1 buffet style this procedure is best used for small to mediumsi zed groups of compliant detainees it is the quicker of th two methods but provides less control over the detainees do not use this practice fo r detainee groups that have displayed hostile or uncooperative attitudes set up feeding station in commonly accessible location at the periphery of the detainee holding area assi gn extra security personnel to the feeding station and assign enough personnel to effici ently serve the detainees as they traverse the food line b security personnel should direct sm all groups of detainees 8 to 12 people to stand and queue up in the food line direct the deta inees to bring their paper cups with them c serving personnel provide the detainees paper plate plastic utensils if security conditions

signature draft for official use only g22 as the first group is returning to its seats queue up sec ond group and repeat the process maintain close control over detainee groups as they queue up and return to their seats to prevent detainees from entering the line more than once be cautious as detainees moving around may capitalize the opportunity to organize or exchange information there are three stand ard procedures for ensuring each detainee is fed use line or chain to temporarily rope off sections of the detainee population that have already been fed provide personnel at the food serving station with list of all detainees embarked as detainee receives food check the number on their identification bracelet and cross them off the list mark an x with magic marker on each detainees plate or b owl as they are served modify the size of the groups uing up at the food serving station to allow families to be served as unit 2 direct serving slower but more trolled feeding method is for the ships crew to serve the detainees directly this method is best used for large crowds and when potential unrest is possible set up food station near the detainee holding area assign s erving and delivery personnel assign extra security pe rsonnel to assist in maintaining control and order b ensure all detainees remain seat ed during the serving process c prepare dishes for the detainees at the food station d security personnel rope off small sections of the detainee population 15 to 20 people prior to each section receiving its food it is easiest to start at one end of the detainee holding area and work toward the other side servers take dishes directly to each detainee in the ropedoff section refill water cups using pitcher filled with potable water f after the entire

vessels in compliant fashion exhausted from their jour ney scared and craving food and water for official use only signature draft signature draft for official use only g23 the detainees may appear harmless to sh ipboard personnel after regaining their strength and becoming more aware of their fate it is not unusu for detainee groups to become temperamental belligerent or even ho stile toward the crew this change is best defused through the application of firm and fair treatment of the detainees and by separating ringleaders and instigators from the crowd experience has also shown that if firmly dissuaded from recalcitrant and disruptive behavior the detainee group will pass through its belligerent stage and come to accept the reality of the situation at this point the detainees will grudgingly ccept their ultimate disposition and become more cooperative with shipboard personnel it is essential that throughout the embarkation and care of detainees that shipboard personnel conti nually analyze the their behavior for signs of unrest or hostilit the procedures below list means to mitigate tensions provide thorough control and best ensure the safety and security of detainee group 1 sitting vice standing the default posi tion for detainees when embarked in naval vessel is sitting or prone this po sition affords security personnel maximum control places the least strain on the detainees and reduces the possibility of persons falling overboard by providing blanket to detainees during the initial supply issue each person will have cushion to sit or lay upon on the vess els deck in addition to blankets the crew can provide available cardboard sheets an d flattened boxes for detainees to rest upon 2 controlling movement allow detain ees to stand and move about to accomplish certain tasks eg using the toilet or showers medical care and for general relief of boredom the amount of movement allowed will depend upon the circumstances including the number of detainees the availa ble space in the holding facility the attitude of the detainees and th availability of security forces to shepherd the persons moving about there are two ge neral policies for detainee movement in the first detainees are authorized to move about on their own volition to use toilet shower or other facilities wh not moving about for specified purpose each detainee should remain seated this policy works well for c ompliant detainee groups b more controllable option is for each detainee to require permissi on to stand and move about this policy is best used for large deta inee groups or when uncooperative attitudes are an issue the detainee must raise his or her hand and request permission from the security watch to use the facilities or otherwise leave their seat if necessary escort detainees to the fac ility vice allowing them to transit on their own 3 entertainment providing music during daylight hours can help soothe detainees and relax tensions use music native to the cultur from which the detainees originate and play it at comfortable levels optionally broadcast native language radio stations if received aboard the vessel providing packs of car ds to adults provides them with amusing activities detainees may create among themselves other forms of entertainment singing playing games or other impromptu activities in general these activities are helpful as they occupy the detainees time and keep their minds focused on events unrelated to the situation at hand consider securit implications eg language barriers news covert signals to embedded agents for official use only signature draft signature draft for official use only g24 4 divine services detainees may request permission to hold divine services during the course of the embarkation allow divine services so long as they do not jeopardize security and are not used as fo rum to generate detainee unrest discreetly monitor divine services as they are condu cted to ensure compliance with safety and security regulations m role of chaplains military chaplains offer unique and va luable resource that can be of great benefit during detainee operations detainee operati ons can involve intense mental stresses and emotional turmoi l on the part of both detainees and crew chaplains possess counseling and spiritual skills that can help mitigate these stresses chaplains advise and report directly to th units co for administrative purposes they work through the executive officer and coordinate their activities with the appropriate department heads and security wa tch section leaders the following are functions and services provided by chaplains 1 provide spiritual counseling and support to the ships crew 2 conduct divine services for ships crew 3 work with the detainee ombudsman if provided to determine the spi ritual needs of the detainee population 4 assist in defusing tensions among detainees with the backin g of security personnel 5 conduct divine services for detainees consistent with religious background and the desire of the detainees however as noted in appendix j there is obligation for us military commanders to provide us military chaplain s to detainees for the performance of direct religious ministry to the detainee population any consideration to utilize the professional service of us m ilitary chaplains for detainees is decided by the commander in consultation with higher echelon command au thorities the command chaplain and sja such consider ation however is to have exhausted all other possibilities to support the detainees relig ious practices or care only when the circumstances are judged to be extremis and in direct support of humane treatment or humanitarian care should the direct involvement of temporary s ervices from us military chaplain be utilized when spea king with detainees chaplains will have security personnel nearby for safety and control of the detainees 6 religious support to detainees while the chaplain assists t he commander in ensuring that detainees receive religious supp ort there is obligation for us military commanders to provide us military chaplains to detainees for t he performance of direct religious ministry to the detainee population accordingly chaplains will normally not interact directly with the detainee populati on and will normally not provide direct one onone ministry services to the detain ee population however if the commander determines need or requirement for chap lain direct interaction with detainees the privileged communication status with the chaplain will b honored 7 divine services for both crew and deta inees shall not be held in the same location hold divine services for the sh ips company out of sight and sound of the detainees n separating instigators small cadre of loyal detainees ma protect the ringleader or instigator making it difficu lt for security personnel to separate the for official use only signature draft signature draft for official use only g25 ringleader from the general population with out incident to prevent disturbance the easiest time to remove an instigator is while he or she is returning from using the toilet or shower facilities alternately remove ringleader during meals or entertainment when other detainees are distracted or while the detainees are sleeping security personnel should immediately remove any pers on who commits violent acts or otherwise endangers the detainees or ships crew the easiest method for rem oving violent or belligerent detainees is to 1 augment the security watch secti on with addition personnel 2 gain the detainees attention while securing detail approac hes him from behind 3 immobilize the instigator using flexible cuffs or handcuffs 4 quickly escort the detainee out of the holding area and out of sig ht and sound of the general detainee population after separating ringleaders place them under close guard and physically isolate them from other detainees to prevent communication use of force follow established use of fo rce policy in responding to all detainee uprisings employ the minimum amount of force necessary to compel compliance never use excessive force in almost every si tuation nondeadly force will be sufficient to control the situation see use of force continuum in chapter iv for more information use of force options the standard tools used to employ nondeadly force against unruly detainees are fire hoses oc spray and expa ndable batons fire hoses use fire fighting water to effectively fend off attack or force unruly detainees into submission highpre ssure fire fighting water is an excellent standoff weapon and can be used to great effect from distances of 20 to 30 feet or more use fire fighting water against several unruly detainees simultaneously the use of fire hoses equipped with variable nozzles allows range of responses from employment of low velocity fog as warning to use of full s tream spray to beat back rush of detainees do not use full stream water except as nece ssary to protect security personnel from injury or bodily harm to prevent serious injury when using full stream water aim at the detainees torso or legs and not at the persons head note the simple act of spraying deta inees with low velocity fog and getting them wet will often be sufficient to quench their thirst for unr est oc spray chemical irritants such as oc spray are second choice for dealing with detainee unrest oc spray is be st used against single detainee although personnel can use it to incapacitate small groups oc spray provides little standoff distance and can potentially be hazard to its user if spr ayed into the wind or if it falls into the hands of detainees expandable baton use the expandable baton as last dit ch point defense against attackers or to force violent person to submit to legitimate commands it is best used against single person and provides standoff distance aim blows from the baton at authorized target areas arms or legs not at the persons head 2 procedures for responding to detainee uprising the security watch section leader the officer of the deck ood or the co can make the decisi on to sound the for official use only
