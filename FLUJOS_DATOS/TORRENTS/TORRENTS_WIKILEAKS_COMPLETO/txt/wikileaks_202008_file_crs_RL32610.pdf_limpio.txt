herz jean hearne julie stone karen tritz evelyne baumrucker christine scott chris peterson and richard rimkunas medicaids longterm care insurance partnership program introduction in 1988 alice rivlin and joshua wiener authored study titled caring for the disabled elderly who will pay1 among other things the study outlined theory about the potential for the public sector to aid private markets in assuming larger role in the financing of longterm care ltc at the same time california connecticut indiana and mass achusetts had begun addressing this issue at the state level shortly thereafter the robert wood johnson foundation gave seed money to some states to develop programs that w ould integrate publicpri vate partnerships in longterm care financing the planning gr ants resulted in the development of long term care insurance partnership programs that would allow persons who purchase longterm care insurance2 to qualify for medicaid3 coverage of longterm care services without meeting th same asset require ments that other medicaid applicants must meet implementation of the program howev er required significant change in federal medicaid rules conn ecticut was the first state to seek and gain approval under 1902 authority of the social security act from the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms at the time the health care financing administration to amend their medicaid state plans to disregar d some or all of th assets of personshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32610crs2 4 to qualify for medicaid applicants income nd resources must be within certain limits the specific income and resource limitations that apply to each eligibility group are set through combination of federal parameters and state definitions consequently those standards vary considerably among states and different standards apply to different population groups within state for many of those groups states may seek permission under special provision section 1902r2 to use more liberal standards for computing income and resources than are specified within each of the groups definitions under the partnership program section 1902r2 is used to ignore or disregard certain amounts of assets thereby extending medicaid to indivi duals with earnings or assets too high to otherwise qualify under the specified rules for that eligibility pathway 5 the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 obra 1993 amended medicaid law to require that all 50 states and dc seek adju stment or recovery from the individuals estate for medical assistance provided to persons age 55 or older mandatory recovery or adjustment is limited to medicaid payments for nursing facility services home and communitybased services and related hospital and prescription drug services in addition states are given the option of recovering funds spent on additional items or services covered under the states medicaid plan the obra1993 provision was part of larger effort by congress to assure that persons assets are applied to the cost of care when medicaid becomes payer of that care 6 1917b1c of the social security actwho purchase longterm care insurance policies4 political debate about the advantages and disadvantages of this partnership program however resulted in significant opposition to the use of public f unds to support investment in the private market for insurance as result congress included in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 p l 10366 provision limitin g approval of medicaid exemptions for estate recovery5 to only those states with approved state plan amendments as of may 14 19936 by that date five stat california connecticut indiana iowa and new york had received cms approval all of these states except iowa have implemented partnership programs these four states received assistance from the robert wood johnson r wj foundation to help design market and operate what became known as the ltc insurance partnership programs under medicaids ltc insurance partners hip program states with approved 1902r2 plan amendments may extend dicaid coverage including longterm care benefits ie nursing home and home and communitybased services to certain persons who have purchased private ltc insurance policies without requiring them to meet the same meanstes ting requirements applicable to other groups of medicaid eligibles during the eligibility determination for medicaid these states may disregard either portion or all assets of the medicaid pplicants to the extent that payments have been made under ltc insu rance policy or because an individual has received or is entitled to r eceive benefits under ltc in surance policy upon the death of the beneficiary the statute also allows these states to exempt either some or all of the individuals assets from medicaid estate recovery the grant agreement negotiations with rwj included number of additional requi rements that have significantly contributed to the current design of the partne rship program model these include minimum criteria which ltc insurance policies must meet to qualify as partnership policies states also review and approve each of these policies before they become available on the market under the program participants must still meet certain income and functional eligibility requirements to qualify for medicaid httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32610crs3 7 kevin p corcoran cae testimony for the united states senate special committee on aging national association of health underwriters june 22 2 004 at httpagingsenategov_fileshr126kcpdfthrough the promise of medicaid asset protection the partnership program is designed to encourage people to purchase private ltc insurance when they might not otherwise do so it is also inte nded to incur savings both to medicaid by delaying or preventing spenddown to medicaid eligibility and to individuals by having them rely on insurance policies to cover ltc expenditures that would otherwise be paid by persona l income and savings the pe rsons protected assets are generally used by the individual to maintain certain living standard to pay for care not covered by medicaid or to pass on as inheritance to their heirs states have used differe nt models for protecting the assets of eligible participants connecticut and california adopted dollarfordollar model in which the amount of the assets protect ed for participant is equi valent to the value of the benefit package paid by the policy purchased eg 100000 of nursing home or assisted living coverage enables that indi vidual to retain up to 100000 in assets and still qualify for medicaid coverage in that state new york uses total asset protection model in which persons who purchas certain stateapproved policies may qualify for medicaid without having to meet any of medicaids asset criteria indiana uses hybrid model offering both dollarfo rdollar and total asse t protection indiana switched from the dollarfordollar mode l to the hybrid model in 1998 in recent years several nonpartnershi p states have expr essed interest in establishing partnership programs and ve encouraged congress to repeal the provision in 1917 of the social security act that prohibits additional states from exempting ltc insurance buyers from dicaid estate rec overy requirements further the national association of health underwriters reports that 17 states have passed enabling legislation allowing each of these states to establish partnership program when and if federa l legislation is changed7 in response to state interest congressi onal proposals were introduced in the 108th congress that would have allowed st ates the option of expanding the ltc insurance partnership program from foursta model to nationwide program the presidents fiscal years fy 2004 and 2005 budgets so included proposals that would have granted states this flexibility as result of this broad interest debate about the partnership program is likely to be continued in the 109th congress in large part disagreement has centere d around the following themes the appropriateness of using th medicaid program program designed to serve persons who are poor or near poor with high medical expenses to promote th expansion of the private sector market for longterm care insurance whether the asset protection promis ed under the partnership program is necessary and sufficient incentive to encourage the purchase of ltc insurance by persons who would not otherwise purchase it andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32610crs4 allow persons to retain large sums of assets in excess of medicaid rules that apply to everyone else and whether the program results in medicaid savings among others to help congress evaluate these propos als this report provides summary of the experiences of four states californi connecticut indiana and new york in implementing the partnership program it also discusses key issues raised by policymakers state directors of the ltc insurance partnership programs and policy analysts concerning the expansion of the partnership program to the national level summary of findings the following section presents data av ailable on the partnership programs and discusses selected policy issues regarding the partnership programs and the insurance market in general this information is based in part on the data provided to the congressional research service crs by the ltc insurance partnership programs and crs conversations with the director s of these programs in spring of 2004 partnership purchasers and policies sold state program models connecticut and california dopted dollarfordollar model new york uses total asset protec tion model but is in the planning stages of adding dollarfordollar option indiana uses hybrid model offe ring dollarfordolla r and total asset protection the dollarfordollar model allows st ates to approve more affordable options for lowerincome consumers while total asset protection encourages states to approve policies that are higher in value and thus more attractive to persons with higher incomes partnership participation about 181600 partnership policies have been sold 149300 are still inforce about 2200 persons or 12 of partnership purchasers have received private ltc insurance benefits of all purchasers of partnership policies 88 persons or 05 have received medicaid coverage of their ltc needs total of 28 million in assets have been protected for persons in california connecticut and i ndiana who have qualified for medicaid the population of persons age 65 and older living in the partnership states totaled 78 million in 2000 data collected by states show that 181623 partnership policies ve been sold in these states since the programs establishment although not all of the persons in this agehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32610crs5 category are ideal candidates for ltc insurance the program has had limited reach target populations the ltc insurance partnership pr ogram was intended to encourage persons to consider the purchase of ltc insurance as an alternative for financing their care it was especially intended to reach persons with middle and lower level wealth status surveys conducted of california nd connecticut show that almost half of partnership purchasers ve assets of greater than 350000 and survey conducted in indian shows that 60 of purchasers have assets of greater than that level excluding the home in contrast an average of 20 of purchasers in california and connecticut have asse ts of less than 100000 excluding the home in new york 8 of purchasers ve assets of less than 50000 and 13 have between 50000 and 200000 regarding income significant proportion of buyers have monthly income that exceeds 5000 in california 58 and indiana 43 in contrast more than half of purchasers in connecticut 57 have income less than 2500 some persons also hoped that partnership policies would be attractive to younger buyers as well although data are significantly limite d comparison of data that are available on the partnership stat and data on ltc insurance purchasers in general show that longterm care insurance partnership purchasers may be slightly younger than purchasers of ltc insurance in general features of policies sold the majority of partnership polic ies purchased offer comprehensive benefits that include coverage of nursing home stays and home care many of partnership policies sold in the four states cover three or more years of coverage ie 64 in california and 94 in indiana whereas 36 of policies sold in california and 20 of policies sold in connecticut cover two or fewer years of coverage all of the partnership states require that policies be protected against inflation for at least some of its purchasers this requirement varies in two states by age of policyholder insurer participation under the grant agreement with rwj states established procedures requiring insurers to seek stat approval of part nership policies before they can be sold in the market the number of insurers selling policies in each of the partnership states ranges from five companie s in california to13 companies in indianahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32610crs6 policy issues the market for ltc insura nce market stability the restructuring of the ltc insurance market may impact the stability of ltc products the following explains some of these market changes in the near future 90 of the ltc market will be owned by nine companies consolidating the nations privatelyinsured risk across small number of private sector carriers in recent years many insurers have applied stricter underwr iting practices and raised premiums to limit their exposure to financial risk most products are sold through th individual market for insurance insurer insolvencies and carrier acquisitions may pose risks to policyholders ltc insurance premiums can be costly and unexpected rateincreases may affect policyholders desire and ability to continue coverage the market for ltc insuran ce regulation and quality federal regulation of ltc insurance is limited to the hipaa provisions concerning the tax trea tment of qualifie d ltc insurance policies california connecticut and new york require that all partnership policies meet thes hipaa requirements indiana provides consumers the option to purchase either taxqualified or nonqualified part nership policy significant variation exists in the regulation of ltc insurance across states many states have limited abilities to monitor problems and trends inthe marketplace although many insurers str ongly oppose stricter federal requirements on all ltc insurance products some support the adoption of standardized requirements for partne rship policies at the national level the market for ltc insurance other issues limited claims experience combined with complex risk factors make it difficult for insurers to predict future claims as result of underwriting factors not all persons who can afford ltc insurance can obtain it even if they apply the partnership programs interaction with medicaid providing asset protection to select group of medicaid beneficiaries raises equity considerations by treating one group of medicaid applicants differently from other groups of applicantshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32610crs7 limited empirical data are available to demonstrate whether the asset protection promised under the partnership program is sufficient and necessary incentive to encourage the purchase of policies by persons who would not otherwise purchase them as result asset protection under dicaid may be extended to some persons who would otherwise never seek medicaid eligibility to begin with based on the available data it is reasonable to conclude that for some the promise of medicaid sset protection plays significant role in the decision to purchase partnership policy while for others it plays smaller role ltc insurance likely prevents spenddown to medicaid eligibilityfor some persons delays it for others and has little impact on still others number of states are likely to support standard reciprocity agreement across states while so may have reason to oppose it summary of four states experience the following section describes the asset protection models used by each of the four partnership programs it also provi des summary of par ticipation data for partnership policies sold thus far and describes the genera l features of those policies finally list of those insurers who sell partnership policies in each of the four states is provided state program models under the rwj grant agreement the part nership states developed three models for protecting the assets of ltc insurance purchasers the following is brief description of these models dollarfordollar asset protection under this model the maximum amount of assets such as savings stocks investment property that may be disregarded during medicaids eligibility assessment and that are not subject to estate recove ry is equivalent to the total value of benefits paid by the policy purchased in connecticut for example the minimum daily benefit that can be sold is 144 per day of coverage thus oneyear policy could pay out 52560 144 x 365 days for an equivalent of 52560 in asset protection the minimum twoyear policy would provide asset protection of at least 105120 nd minimum threeyear policy would provide asset protection of 157680 for inflationprotected policies the value of the benef its and thus the amount of assets protected grow annually for example policy that pays 150 per day of coverage would pay 54750 for one year if the payout began next week but 297 per day at 5 annual compounded inflation adjustment or 108401 for one year of coverage if the payout began 14 years from now under this scenario oneyear policyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32610crs8 8 under indianas hybrid model 75 of its 31042 policies purchased have earned total asset protection while 25 earned dollarfordo llar protection see indianas partnership program june 2004would result in disregard of up to 108401 of the participants assets during the medicaid eligibility determination as well as an exemption from estate recovery of this amount after the participants death totalasset protection under this model participation is limited to persons who purchase stateapproved ltc policies with minimum benefit package defined by the state for example to have all ones assets disregarded in new york participants must exhaust the benefits from policy that covers at least three years of nursing home coverage andor six years of home care coverage where the amount of coverage for two days of home care is equivalent to the amount of cove rage for one day of nursing home care persons who purchase such policies may qualify for asset protection under medicaid after pr ivate insurance benefits are exhausted and when they meet medicaids income and functional eligibility criteria they are not subject to any of medicaids asset requirements hybrid model under this model the amount of asset protection obtained depends on the va lue of the benefits exhausted in indiana for example to qualify for total asset protection participants must exhaust polic that covers about 42 years of nursing home care in indiana this is equivalent to coverage of at least 187613 of care for any setting this minimum criteria is updated annually according to indian as average daily nursing home rate 121 in 2004 and adjusted for inflation any policy of benefit value below this amount would provi participant with dollarfor dollar asset protection8 according to some state directors of the partnership programs the dollarfor dollar asset protection model allows the state to approve smaller policies that can be more affordable for persons with less w ealth providing range of options to consumers with fewer savings eg sma ller policies for less asset protection and larger policies for more asset protection they assert makes it easier for persons to purchase ltc insurance and makes asse t protection accessible to broader population it also according to state dir ectors helps delay or prevent additional persons from spending down to medicaid eligibility according to new yorks state director the fact that total asset protection is tied to larger policies ie three years of nursing home care or six years of home car tends to make them more expensive he argues therefore that this model restricts access to those persons with higher income levels and assets w ho can afford more comprehe nsive policies in hopes of expanding access to the partnership progra m to persons with less wealth new york is currently considering expanding its total asset protection model to hybrid modelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32610crs9 so that persons who purchase fewer than th ree years of coverage could obtain dollar fordollar asset protection most partnership participants who obtain asset protection under medicaid exhaust their private ltc insurance benef its before qualifying for medicaid these persons generally obtain the full asset protec tion allowed by the policy or obtain total asset protection if applicab however persons ma qualify for medicaid before exhausting their private benefits in california connecticut and indiana and still obtain some asset protecti on although less than they would have if they had exhausted their entire ltc insurance policy persons who apply for medicaid before exhausting their ltc insurance policies must spenddown to medicaid income eligibility thresholds and meet the functional eligibility requirements in that state the amount of asset protection they can obtai n is equivalent to the value of private benefits paid out at the point in time in which medicaid eligibility is established for this group medicaid would cover services not covered by the longterm care insurance policy possibly adult day care certain adaptive technologies certain mental health services etc and the policy would continue to pay benefits until they are exhausted partnership participation under mutual agreement the four partnership states maintain quarterly records of program participa tion including counts of policie s sold counts of policies in force number of persons triggering pr ivate benefits and the amount of assets protected under the program these data ar provided to the states by the insurers that sell partnership policies the stat also track the number of partnership participants that qualify for medicaid see table 1 since the programs establishmen t in the early 1990s181623 partnership policies have been sold about 2200 persons or 12 of purchas ers have qualified for private benefits thus far furthermor of all partnership purchasers to date 88 have qualified for medicaid coverage constituting 05 of total purchasers about 82 of policies sold or 149300 polic ies are currently inforce table 1 it is unknown how many of these persons with policies still inforce will eventually qualify for medicaid total of 28 million in assets have been protected for persons who have qualified for medicaid in california connecticut and indiana table 1 such persons might have qualified after exhausting their private benefits and spending down to medicaid eligibility thresholds or they may have become eligible for medicaid while receiving private benefits for persons who qualify for medicaid while receiving benefits from ltc insurance policy medicaid covers only those services not covered by either the policy or medicare possibly adult day care certain adaptive technologies certain mental health services etc the insurance policy continues to pay benefits until it is exhausted according to the most recent data av ailable 7 million has been protected in three states by persons who did not qualif for medicaid before death data on the amount of assets protected in new york are not available since the

data available only 181 623 partnership policies have ever been sold in these states although more than 10 years have passed since the partne rship programs inception the program is still small and

some persons also hoped that partnership policies would be attractive to younger population as well although some data are available demonstrating the asset levels and age levels of partnership policy

report lexington ma nov 2003 at http wwwwestlandinccom forbesltcpdfthe market for ltc insurance market stability in assessing possible ex pansion of the partnership program some policymakers have expre ssed significant concern about the stability of the market and the reliab ility of products current info rmation pertaining to these issues may be relevant to legislati on concerning the partnership program the ltc insurance market in general not limited to the partnership sellers and products has undergone significant changes in the past three decades and these changes have had an impact on policies design and prices in the very earliest years of the new ltc insurance market in the 1980s many new carriers entered the market in search of new revenues at that time products were ava ilable primarily on an individual basis and insurers saw large av erage annual increases in enrollment from previous years in the1990s insurers began to offer werpriced policies designed to squeeze competition out of the market and attract buyers15 group policies were offered for the first time fraud also became apparent during this decade with some companies lowballing premiums selling policies at inappropriately low rates then closing enrollment in that policy and raising rates for these policyholders or using loose underwriting practices eg ch arging rates that do not cover the known risk factors of the group then raising rates after less h ealthy persons have purchased the policy16 during this decade profits for many companies decreased significantly and number of carriers began to exit the market in recent years the markets restructuring has taken different shape now carrier consolidation is more prevalent17 and insurers are using stricter underwriting practices and raising premiums to try to limit their financial risk in the near future nine companies will hold more than 90 of the ltc insurance market consolidating the nations privatelyinsured risk across small number of private sector carriers18 for example the bulk of new yorks ltc insurance sales are with just threecompanies john hancock ge capital life assura nce co and medamerica insurance co of americahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32610crs21 19 ibidunder this more consolidated market structure each firm maintains influential market power and the insolvency of one or more of these firms could lead to market disruptions and higher premiums on th other hand market consolidation could concentrate ltc policies with the stronger companies and allow these carriers to spread risk across larger policyholder pool s consolidation could also lead to administrative efficiencies possibly controlling costs and improving claims processing and other operati onal expenses john hancock metlife prudential and unumprovident for example have rged their operations supporting group and individual ltc products19 one major issue growing out of market consolidation involves carrier insolvencies and the impact these insolvencies have on policyholders in recent years for example two of the largest ltc insurance carriers conseco and penn treaty became insolvent one possible outcome of carrier insolvencies is that policies of insolvent carriers are transferred to other insurers in the state practice known as assumption reinsurance unde r this scenario policyholders continue paying premiums for their ltc insurance policies yet they pay them to the new carriers for these polici contracts remain intact under the new insurer but policyholders could be aff ected by premium increases second possible outcome of carrier insolvencies poses greater risks to policyholders under this scenario instead of transferring contracts to another carrier in the state policies from the insolvent carrier might be terminated this could occur after an insolvent insurers assets are liquidated by state insurance regulator policyholders generally recei ve compensation for some amount of the policys value but must reenter the market to obtain new policy if they choose to do so to obtain new policy consumers would again be subjected to underwriting and current market rates given that consumers would have aged si nce their first policy purchase and may even have experienced change in health status it is possible that they would find premiums to be higher than they were under their old policies for some the new prices may be unaffordable insolv encies in the ltc insurance market raise concerns about companies that may be growing without sufficient capital predictability of future claims limited claims experience combined with complex and changing risk factors makes actuarial predictions of future claims experience difficult for insurers for exampl over the past decades lapse rates have decreased from 1516 to around 2 anothe r factor that makes predicting future claims difficult is the changing designs of the ltc insurance products themselves this relatively new product has largely changed from nursing home only product from the 1970s and 1980s to product offering benefits that include nursing home care as well as home care and assisted living fewer claims data are available from the newer comprehensive policies as many purchasers have not yet submitted claims these factors expose insurers to greater risk and encourages them to price products more rationally nd

new rules regarding the tax treatment of ltc insurance and expenses and define d the requirements for taxqualified ltc insurance policy20 ltc insurance products are largely regula ted by states every state and the district of columbia has some laws governing ltc insurance many of these laws reflect guidance provided by the nationa l association of insurance commissioners naic an organization of state insurance re gulators this guidance provided in the form of model act and m odel regulations for ltc insu rance addresses number of areas including 1 suitability standards to help applicants decide whether policy is appropriate and affordable 2 replacement standards designed to help applicants decide whether they should replace an old policy with new one 3 prohibition against postclaims underwritin g standards to prevent insurers from performing underwriting after policy has been purchased and claim has been filed 4 benefit triggers standards specifying minimum benefit triggers among others while many state laws and regulations are based largely on the naic standards others have adopted only some of these standards21 2002 study by the lewin group based on survey of insurance depa rtments of 49 states and the district of columbia suggests that there is significant variation in regulatory practices across states and that many states have limited ability to monitor problems or trends in the marketplace22 it also suggests that many states make approvals for rate increases based on inadequate informa tion and that number of states may lack the necessary authority or resources to stop rate increases23 california connecticut new york nd indiana have strong regulatory oversight of partnership polic ies compared to other states regulatory oversight of ltc insurance products according to partne rship directors this is largely result of problems identified with products over the years and the requirement agreed upon in the original program design with rw j not written into statute that state commissioners approve all plans before they can be deemed eligible to participate inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32610crs23 24 phone conversation with the director of c onnecticuts ltc partnership program mayjune 2004 25 ny requires that all policies issued post1997 meet these hipaa requirements the partnership program according to stat officials from the partnership states the need to approve plans has provided cat alyst for increased consumer protection requirements and more comp rehensive oversight of the ltc insurance market in general and the partnership market in particular st ate official from connecticut for example explains that about 20 of ltc plans offered in connecticut prior to the implementation of the partnership pl an included compound inflation adjustment as result of increased attention to partne rship policies in the state he explains connecticut now requires that all partnership policies include protection against inflation now not only do 100 of the partnership policies include inflation protection but bout 60 of nonpartnership policies sold by partnership participating carriers include inflation protection as well24 california connecticut and new york25 also require that all partne rship policies meet the hipaa requirements for favorable federal tax treatment indi ana provides consumers the option to purchase either taxqualif ied or nonqualified partnership policy despite increased attention to oversight by partnership states little information is available about the extent to which th states track problems with insurance products after they are approved oversee in surers carriers and agents marketing practices and evaluate the suitability of the products purchased eg do products purchased provide adequate coverage or must policyholders make large outof pocket expenditures to cover the differen ce between the benefit payments and the actual cost of services national standards for ltc insurance products the current political environment may make imposin g stricter federal standa rds on ltc policies difficult to enact part of this difficulty is result of opposition from insurers concerning stricter oversight of ltc insurance pr oducts in genera l although many insurers strongly oppose stricter federal requirements on all ltc insurance products some support the adoption of standardized requi rements for partnership policies at the national level these insurers assert that such standards would facilitate their ability to develop single partners hip product that can be marketed in each state without having to modify each policy to comply with states separate laws and regulations this they assert would free insurers from the burdensome responsibility of designing distinct product for each stat and would provide them the opportunity to compete with each other fo r the sale of similar products the partnership states themselves ve also come together to develop recommendations for regulations that could be part of nationa l model summary of these regulations can be provided upon request affordability of premiums one of the key issues in considering the role private insurance can play in longterm care financing is affordability longterm care insurance can be costly with pre miums depending greatly on the benefit packages purchased and the age of individuals at the time of purchase generally the older the individual the higher the premiums according to an ahip survey inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32610crs24 26 americas health insurance plans longterm care insurance in 2002 research

analysts and consumers have raised concerns about rate stability 2004 report by hiaa explains that the average change in premiums of policies sold in 2002 by top sellers compared to policies sold in 2001 was about 526 for the period between 1999 and 2002 the average change in premiums of policies was less than 1 for different age and policy categories27 however it is still possible that some firms may be more likely to raise premiums than others unexpected rate increases may affect policyholders desire and ability to continue the policy once policy is purchased premiums must remain fixed throughout the policyholders lifetime unle ss carrier receives approval from state insurance commissioner to raise rates for all policyholders in particular class premium increases of policies already sold may also vary by state some states may be more likely to approve insurers requests to incr ease rates than others states approval decisions are based in large part on the standards adopted by each state although the oversight of ltc insu rance premiums can help prevent unnecessary premium increases it may also courage plans to be more conservative then they might otherwise need to be for example rather than take the risk of applying to the state regulatory agency for approval of future rate increase if it becomes necessary an insurer may seek approval one time but at higher premium level than necessary to hedge its future riskhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32610crs25 28 for example such person could be determ ined ineligible for medicaid in state that uses the medicaid nursing facility rate when calculating an applicants spend down states that cover nursing facility care under their dically needy programs have the option of using either the medicaid or private pay eg private insurance or outofpocket nursing facility rates as standard for determining an applicants eligibility this means that states compare persons monthly income to the cost of nursing home care in that state either in terms of the total amount that would be paid by medicaid for month medicaid rate or the total amount that would be paid by the privat pay rate often the medicaid monthly rates are lower than the rates paid by private insu rance or outofpocket when the medicaid rate is lower it is harder for app licants to spenddown to the required level in general if an applicants income minus the cost of the dicaid reimbursement or private pay rate whichever is used by the state exceeds th state income limit then the applicant cannot qualify for medicaid coverage of institutional care under medically needy optionthe suitability of products purchased another concern of policymakers is the risk that private sector insurers and agents eager to earn profits and commissions respectively w ill inappropriately sell products to persons with low incomes and assets who cannot afford to pay premiums longterm persons who become unable to pay the premiums will have their policies cancelled under these circumstances the insurer would gain pr emium revenue without having to pay benefits related concern is that persons with lower incomes may purchase policies that are inadequately valued so that the cost of the ltc benefits needed will exceed the amount paid by private benefits for ex ample if the policy purchased covers 150 of nursing home care per day but nursing home care for that individual costs 250 per day then the policyholder would be re quired to make up the difference this is particularly troublesome for lower income pe rsons who may not be able to afford to pay the difference in cost for these pe rsons the purchase of inadequate policies could lead to the rapid spend down of po licyholders income and assets other than those protected leading policyholders to meet the financial eligibility criteria for medicaid sooner than they otherw ise would with better coverage on the one hand the pay out of the ltc in surance policy toward the cost of care for these individuals would delay their sp end down to medicaid even if the payout is insufficient to cover all of the individua ls care costs on the other hand the fact that private ltc benefits are counted as income when determining medicaid eligibility could disqualify an indivi dual from meeting the necessary income standards to qualify for dicaid depending on the income counting rules used by the state to determine medicaid eligibility such persons would not be able to obtain sufficient care through their ltc insurance policies and might not be able to afford to cover the costs of their care with their personal income28 the directors of the partnership programs argued that as ove rsight of ltc insurance policies improves this problem is decreasing in prevalence partnership states have ttempted to address these concerns through regulatory standards concerning suitability and minimum benefit packages statutory or regulatory language concerning how part nership policies are marketed sold and regulated could also addre ss some of these concernshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32610crs26 29 annual report for the connecticut partners hip for longterm care evaluation studies july 1 2001june 30 2002

group po licies may or may not be so ld with full or partial underwriting underwriting is used by insu rers to protect agai nst the adverse risk selection that can occur if individuals buy policies when they know or suspect that they may soon need to make use of the insurance age is another major factor considered by insurance companies in cove rage because the probability of claims is highly correlated with age as result not all persons who can afford ltc insurance can obtain it even if they apply for example of the 31151 applications that were received in the decade between april 1 1992 and june 30 2002 in connecticut 3640 11 were denied29 of the persons denied 29 had hypertension either prior to or at the time of the survey 14 had cancer in the past 3 at the time of the survey 20 had arthritis in the past 24 at the time of the survey 14 had stomach condition in the past 4 at the time of the survey and 17 had heart condition in the past 11 at the time of the survey in california for example of the 73809 applications received for partne rship policies as of september 2003 12857 applications 17 had been denied since the programs establishment30 of the 36474 applications received in indian as of 304 5142 applications 14 were denied31 persons who are denied coverage are forced to apply their savings to cover the cost of their care and cannot be nefit from the asset protection offered to healthier persons under th partnership program the partnership programs interaction with medicaid equity within the medicaid program providing asset protection to medicaid beneficiaries who purchase ltc insurance reflects policies that differ significantly from medicaids general policies on eligibility medicaid is program for the poor or for persons who have be come poor eligibility for the program is designed to allow only persons with small amount of asse ts generally 2000 to qualify for coverage medicaid law also contains rules that are designed to prohibit persons from transferring ssets in order to qualify fo r coverage sooner then they otherwise would some say that the purpos of these provisions is to assure that limited federal resources are available only for those in need by disregarding additional assets of pa rtnership participants some say that the program violates these principles providing special treatment to purchaser s of partnership policies also raises equity concerns because it treats one group of medicaid applicants differently from other groups of applicants under the pa rtnership program persons who can afford ltc insurance benefit from pa rtial or full asset protecti on rather than depleting their assets on their care to qualify for medicaid these persons can retain some or allhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32610crs27 32 it is also intended to discourage persons from transferring their assets to qualify for medicaid sooner than they otherwise would 33 purchaser survey 2002 ca department of health services ca partnership for long term care annual report oct 2003of their assets and use them to either maintain certain living standard andor pay for care not covered by medicaid while not all of these assets may be protected by the partnership program some amounts will not be applied to the cost of care in the event that medicaid begins to cover expens furthermore some or all of this groups protected assets are exempt from dicaid estate recovery so they may pass on their assets to their heirs persons who cannot afford ltc insurance who purchase nonpartnership ltc insurance po licy or who are denied coverage by ltc insurers on the other hand would be re quired to meet medi caids strict asset requirements and be subject to medicaid estate recovery the role of asset protection the partnership program is intended to result in medicaid savings by delaying or preventing spenddown to medicaid eligibility for those persons who can afford private coverage this could serve to free some of medicaids resources for use by pe rsons with greater financial need the following discussion explores claims ma by partnership proponents that the programs asset protec tion 1 provides an incentive to persons to purchase private insurance andor 2 help s save medicaid expenditures32 asset protection as an incentive to the purchase of insurance limited empirical data are available to demonstrate whether the asset protection promised under the partnership program is sufficient and necessary incentive to encourage the purchase of policies by pe rsons who would not otherwise purchase them the partnership states have attempted to test the reliability of these claims through smallsample surveys of partnership purchasers the following is brief description of what they found california purchaser survey 2002 survey in california found that three principal reasons motiv ated the 629 survey respondents in 2002 to purchase partnership policies they were 1 to pay for future services 90 2 to protect the spouse and family 81 and 3 to protect the assets of th purchaser 74 slightly under 25 of respondents stated that they purchased policy as an alternative to transfe rring assets further respondents were asked to rate the relative importance of specific partnership policy features when selecting their policy findi ngs show that 79 of respondents felt it was important or very impor tant to have the state seal of approval on the policies and 82 felt that medi caid asset protection feature was important or very important33 indiana purchaser survey 2002

reasons mo tivated the 2794 survey respondents to purchase partnership policies they were 1 to protect their assets 2 to remain financially i ndependent and 3 to cover the cost of ltc respondents also

89 of respondents felt it was important or very im portant to have the st ate seal of approval on the policies and 91 felt that the medicaid asset protection feature was important or very important36 when probed further about the role of medicaid asset protecti on in making their decision to purchase 83 of respondents said that they considered purchasing ltc insurance before hearing about the partnership 66 said thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32610crs29 37 in reality these individuals would have been subject the private nursing home rate that for many would have been higher and resu lted in fewer months of private coveragethe partnership program influenced their decision to purchase and 72 said that they would have purchased ltc insurance without the partnership these findings suggest that for most re spondents the asset protection promised by ltc insurance in general played significant role in encouraging persons to purchase insurance however the data do not show that it was sufficient and necessary to encourage the purchase of ltc insurance without the existence of other motivating reasons on the contrary the data suggest that medicaid asset protection is just one of several motivating reasons th at can lead person to purchase insurance without more data it is reasonable to conclude that for some the promise of medicaid asset protection plays signif icant role in conjunction with other motivating reasons while for others it plays smaller role policymakers have also expressed c oncern about the partnership program providing asset protection to persons who would otherwise have purchased insurance without it andor to persons with high wea lth status the broa d criteria for obtaining asset protection under the part nership program could allow this to occur on the other hand if savings from the partnership program occur as result of delaying or preventing medicaid enrollment these savings could also be used to cover additional persons under medicaid who cannot afford ltc insurance asset protection versus medicaid savings supporters of the partnership program assert that the purch ase of ltc insurance delays or prevents spenddown to medicaid eligib ility and that this in tur n saves medicaid funds that otherwise would have been spent on care for these persons proponents assert that proof of this can be seen by state data showing that few qua lified ltc policyholders end up accessing medicaid coverage for their ltc needs see table 1 opponents on the other hand note that the program is only in its early phase of operation and as policyholders age the population of persons who spend down to medicaid will grow small study conducted by california s partnership prog ram attempted to calculate the impact of sset protection on california s medicaid budget the study was conducted of 18 partnershi p participants who eventu ally qualified for medicaid combined these persons had to tal of 347600 in assets or 19000 each on average at the time they met the requirements for their private ltc insurance benefits without the existence of thei r partnership ltc policies california assumes that the assets of these individuals would have been used to cover the cost of their nursing home care at the aver age medicaid nursing home rate of 4415 per month in california these funds could have paid for total of about 78 months of nursing facility care or fewer than five months on average per person37 in total the 18 individuals used 466 months of nursing home care or slightly fewer than 26 months per person all of these months we re paid by their ltc insurance policieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32610crs30 38 summary of study provided to crs by the ca ltc partnership programto determine how much californias dicaid program would have paid for nursing home care if these 18 individuals had sought medicaid coverage instead of ltc insurance california multiplied its m onthly medicaid rate 4415 by the total number of nursing home months used by the 18 individuals 466 months minus the spend down months 78 months it then subtracted the income of the eligible individuals that would have been applied to ward the cost of their care through this analysis california estimated that the exis tence of the private policies resulted in 13 million that medicaid might have paid had these individuals sought medicaid coverage for their nursing home coverage in stead of private ltc insurance coverage it is important to note however that this study provides information about whether these individuals transferred assets before applying for medicaid38 reciprocity between and among st ates for partnership policies since the establishment of partnership prog rams some partnershi p participants who have interest in moving outofstate have expressed concern that other states medicaid programs cannot offer them the sa asset protection that is offered by their home states these i ndividuals assert that wit hout interstate reciprocity agreements that allow them to protect their assets after they change states in manner consistent with their former states partnership policies th ey would be forced to live out their retirements in the same state in which they purchased their partnership policies connecticut and indiana have received cms approval to enter into reciprocal agreement so that each st ate honors the commitment of dollarfordollar asset protection offered by the other state if partnership polic ies were made widely available across the nation r eciprocity between and among states would need to be addressed either at the federal or state levels number of states are likely to support standard reciprocity provision for many states reciprocity provision woul d offer their partnership participants freedom to live out their retirement in different state thus relieving some states of the potential financial strain to their medicaid programs other states especially those that attract large numbers of retirees such as florida arizona california and nevada may oppose such provision as it c ould increase the risk that those states would be obligated to pay the medicaid l ongterm care expenses of more individuals than they might otherwise pay without more data showing whether the program incurs savings or costs to the medicaid prog ram it is possible that those states with high numbers of retirees may be hesitant to enter into reciprocity agreement with other states furthermore if wider implementation of th partnership program occurs giving states the choice to use either dollarfordollar model ndor total asset protection model reciprocity between states with different models would be difficult legislative proposals two identical congressional proposals were introduced in the 108th congress that would have repealed the provision in 1917 of the social security act that prohibits additional states from exempting ltc insurance buyers from medicaid estate recovery requirements s 2077 introduced by senator craig and hr 1406 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32610crs31 introduced by representative peterson woul d have repealed the provision requiring states to have state plan amendments approved as of may 14 1993 and would have allowed states the option of seeking or not seeking estate recovery from persons who purchase ltc insurance policies in addition the presidents fy2004 and fy2005 budgets proposed to eliminate the legislative prohibition against devel oping more partnership programs and considered these provisions to ve cost to the federal budget it is likely that the additional proposals will be introduced in the 109th congress
