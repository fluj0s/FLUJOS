electionarchiveorg page 3 41205 abstract what is the main cause of the discrepancies between the official ele ction results and the exit polls the exit pollster of record for the 2004 election was the disonmitofsky1 consortium their national poll results projected kerry victory by 30 whereas t he official count had bush winning by 252 several methods have been used to estimate the probabili ty that the national exit poll results would be as different as they were from the national popular vote by random chance these estimates range from 1 in 165 million to 1 in 12403 matter how one calculates it the discrepancy cannot be attributed to chance edisonmitofsky disavowed the results of their own poll saying that the data cannot be construed as evidence that the official vote count was corrupted and hy pothesized that kerry voters were more amenable to completing the poll questionnaire than bush v oters however edisonmitofskys own exit poll data does not support their theory that higher exit poll response rate by kerry voters accounted for the discrepanci between the exit polls and the presidential election results using edisonmitofskys data tables w demonstrate that the reluctant bush responder hypothesis is implausible because it is inconsistent wit h the combination of high response rates and high discrepancy rates among the precincts with the highest per centage for bush there are three primary explanations for the discrepancies 1 statistical sampling error or chance we agree with edisonmitofsky that the first possib cause random statistical sampling error can be ruled out 2 inaccurate exit polls this is the theory that edisonmitofsky put forth they hypothesize that t he reason the exit polls were so biased towards kerry was because bush voters were more reluctant to respond to xit polls than kerry voters edisonmitofsky did not come close to justifying this position howeve r even though they have access to the raw unadjusted precinctspecific data set the data that edison mitofsky did offer in their report show how implausible this theory is 3 inaccurate election results edisonmitofsky did not even consider this hypothesis and thus made effort t contradict it some of edisonmitofskys exit poll data may be construed as affirmative evidenc for inaccurate election results we conclude that the hypothesis that the vot ers intent was not accurately recorded or counted cannot be ruled out and needs further investigation 1 edison media research and mitofsky international 2 p 20 evaluation of edisonmitofsky election syst em 2004 report by edisonmitofsky jan 19

irregularities reported problems4 included voting machine shortages ballots counted and recounted in secret lost discarded and improperly rejected registration forms and absentee ba llots touchscreen machines that registered bush when voters pressed kerr precincts in which there were more votes recorded than registered voters precincts in which the reported participation rate was less than 10 high rates of spoiled ballots and undervotes in which choice for president was recorded sworn affidavit by florida computer programmer who claims he was hired to develop voting program with back door mechanism to undetectably alter vote tallies these problems arose in the context of vote recordin g and counting systems developed provided and maintained primarily by handful of private vendors with partisan ties and where nonauditable voting equipment which cannot provide assurance that votes ar counted as cast tallied about 30 of the national vote5 the crucial question is whether these problems were part of larger pattern were these issues collectively of sufficient magnitude to reverse the outcome of the election or were they isolated incidents procedurally disturbing but of little overall consequence importance of exit polls under such circumstances we must rely on indirect evidence such as exit polls or analysis of election result data as check of the overall integrity of the official election results without auditability or transparency in our election systems the role of exit polls as trigger for further scrutiny is of paramount importance background the 2004 exit polls were conducted by edison media research and mitofs ky international edisonmitofsky or em on contract with major national press and tv news services operating collectively as the national election pool edisonmitofsk conduct exit polls in every state plus nationwide exit poll confidential exit poll data sho wing john kerry ahead of george bush in several key battleground states was disclosed to the

kerry by 25 in the popular vote this discrepancy between exit polls and the official ection results has triggered controversy which has yet to be resolved shortly after the exit poll disparity was noted the edisonmitofs ky group took the position that their own projections could not be taken as an indication of error in the of ficial vote count the theory they put forward to explain the disparity was that more of the bush voter s had declined to be interviewed for the exit polls while more of the kerry voters had completed the poll qu estionnaire7 immediately after the election those skeptical of edi sonmitofskys explanation tried to obtain the precinctlevel unadjusted exit poll data to independen tly test edisonmitofskys explanation but the raw data has not to this day been released in the absenc of raw data analyses were done using screen captures of data published to the internet on election n ight8 one such analysis of unadjusted exit poll data was done by ron baiman9 baiman found that statistically significant discrepancies of exit poll results from reported election outcomes were concentrated in five states four of which were key battleground states is this merely coincidence how much of coincidence was it baiman concluded that the probability that these discrepancies would simultaneously occur in just the most critical states of ohio florida and pennsylvania rather tha n in any other randomly selected group of three states is less than 1330000 this analysis agrees with an earlier calculation by steven freeman showing that the probability that random chance accounte d for simultaneous exit poll discrepancies in florida pennsylvania and ohio was well outside of the realm of statistical plausibility10 on january 19 2005 edison media research and mitofsky international r eleased 77page report evaluation of edisonmitofsky election system 2004 the edisonmitofsky report acknowledged widespread discrepancies between their exit polls and official counts admi tted that the differences were far greater than can be explained by sampling error and sserted that this disparity was most likely due to kerry voters participating in the exit

did edisonmitofskys january 19th report support their assertion that bush voters were more reluctant to participate in exit poll surveys than kerry voters did their analysis conf irm the reluctant bush responder hypothesis analysis i explanation one random error definition of wpe within precinct error is the average of the difference between the perc entage margin between the leading candidates in the exit poll and the actual vote for all s ample precincts in state the sign of the wpe gives the direction of the error negative number means t hat the exit polls were more favorable to kerry than the actual election results while posi tive number means the exit polls were more favorable to bush than the actual election results wpe can be rou ghly thought of as the percentage discrepancy between election results and exit poll results w ithin sampled precincts edisonmitofsky wpe within precinct error scores for dif ference between the election results and exit polls by state are clearly skewed seven of fifty states have standardized values less than 27 meaning that each of the m had less than 1 probability of having the reported difference between exit polls and election results occurring by chance the probability of seven values being less than 27 approximated via sta ndard normal distribution probabilities is 000357 for the tdistribution with 40 degrees of freedom mor conservative value is 00057 full comparison of the exit polls with the null d istribution blue curve via shapirowilk test yields probability that is micros copically small that such exit poll discrepancies could occur by chance aside from three outlier states on the left the data appear to be normally distributed with the mean electionarchiveorg page 7 41205 shifted 10 standard deviations toward kerry the data without these three passes the shapirowilk test for normality p4 with shifted mean we agree with edisonmitofsky as stated in their report that random chance as possible explanation for discrepancies between exit polls and official election results c an be dismissed having eliminated random chance as cause of the discrepanc ies between election and exit poll results two hypotheses remain to explore exit polls were subject to cons istent bias or the official vote count was corrupted ii explanation two exit poll error exit poll science exit polling is welldeveloped science informed by half cent ury of experience and continually improving methodology11 edisonmitofsky samples voters for nationwide exit poll as well as for each states exit poll best practices exit poll methodology involves three steps 1 choose set of representative precincts that mirrors the state as whole in demography and historic voting patterns out of precinct sampling 2 randomly select and interview voters from those precincts for polling as they leave the polling place within precinct sampling 3 algebraically weight to correct for the observed demographic composition of the sample for example rebalance by race and gender in this process to assure representative sampling of the state were the right precincts sampled to confirm that steps number 1 and 3 were done correctl official vote tallies from the sampled precincts were substituted by edisonmitofsky for exit poll r esults in their weighting formulas to see if the results would correctly predict statewide voting pa tterns this procedure em pp 2830 confirms that steps number 1 and 3 worked well the selected precincts ccurately predicted the results in their respective states with only small observed bias 03 which was actually in the opposite direction to the bias that resulted when exit poll numbers were used were voters randomly selected and interviewed problems with step number 2 improper selection of voters can cause withinprecinct error wpe12 edisonmitofsky seek to explain the overall disparity betwee n exit polls and official election results in 11 polling and presidential election coverage lavrakas paul j and holley jack k eds newb ury park ca sage pp 8399 12 see prior definition of wpe on p 7 in this docume nt electionarchiveorg page 8 41205 terms of wpe they calculate that the required shift toward ke rry in the exit polls must have been 65 they note that this number is greater than any wpe from past presidential elections going back more than 20 years to time when polling science was less sophist icated and less reliable than at present they also note that this 65 wpe stands out in comparison to n average 19 wpe from 2004 state primaries exit polls adjusting the exit polls using reported election results the em report claims that all of the error is within precinct error wpe because using reported precinct level election results with sample precinct model spm g ives close to reported results p 2830 but this does not necessarily follow because the spm may use reported elec tion results p 9 and may be adjusting the weights over time based on these reported results this i mplies that computations with these new weights may not be fully unadjusted predictive exi t poll estimates to the extent that spm adjustments are based on reported election results exit pol l discrepancies derived from weights that have not been adjusted may be out of precinct this lea ves open the possibility that central office mistabulation andor discriminator voter suppression that are not taken into account when using precinct weights that are derived from past voter pa rticipation rates to calculate state level exit poll results could explain part of the discrepancy access to the raw precinct level data and weights used to calculate final unadjusted state level exit pol ls is necessary to investigate this hypothesis the reluctant bush responder rbr hypothesis the em report however explains the wpe with the following statement p 31 while we cannot measure the response rate by kerry and bush voters hypothetical response rates of 56 among kerry voters and 50 among bush voters overal l would account for the entire within precinct error that we observed in 2004 this apparently is the basis for their statement in the execut ive summary p 4 it is difficult to pinpoint precisely the reasons that in general kerry voters were more likely to participate in the exit polls than bush voters data in the em report supports the hypothesis that kerry voters were mo re likely than bush voters to cooperate with pollsters and in fact the data provided by em suggests that the oppos ite may have been true electionarchiveorg page 9 41205 table 1 partisanship precinct data given

that the r eluctant bush responder hypothesis explains the exit poll discrepancy in the november 2004 presidential lection b exit poll discrepancies rise with concentration of bush voters the reluctant bush responder hypothesis would lead one to expect higher nonresponse rat where there are many more bush voters yet edisonmitofskys data shows that in fa ct the response rate is slightly higher in precincts where bush drew 80 of the vote high rep than in those where kerry drew 80 of the vote high dem the chart above was constructed from data within the em report p 37 this data bears directly on the plausibility of the reports central hypothesis and it goes i n the wrong direction in precincts with higher numbers of bush voters response rates were slightly higher than in precincts with higher number of kerry voters electionarchiveorg page 10 41205 precincts in which bush supporters were dominant actually completed the poll ques tionnaire at rate higher than precincts in which kerry dominated this fact undermines the reports c entral premise that kerry supporters were more likely than bush supporters to participate in the exit poll reluctant bush responder in mixed political company rbrmpc hypoth esis yet it is not conclusive proof that the em hypothesis is wrong because some have hypot hesized that bush supporters were more diffident about expressing their views in mixed politica l company than kerry supporters it has been suggested that the bush supporters participated at high rates in prec incts where they were surrounded by other bush supporters while bush supporters in predominantlykerry preci ncts were more reticent than their counterpart kerry supporters voting in predominantly bush pr ecincts this reluctant bush exit poll participant in predominantly kerry precincts hyp othesis is also inconsistent with the em data if the polls were faulty because bush voters were shy in the presence of kerr voters and less likely to cooperate with pollsters then the polls should be most accurate in those precincts where bush voters were in the overwhelming majority and where exit poll participation was als at its maximum 020 2040 4060 6080

full 10 mean difference between official vote tallies and the exit poll results electionarchiveorg page 11 41205 alternate hypothesis bush strongholds have more votecount corru ption bsvcc an alternative hypothesis that is more consistent with the data is that corrupti on of the official vote count occurred most freely in districts that were overwhelmingly bush stro ngholds if edisonmitofsky would release the detailed results of their poll to the public t hen much more could be said about this hypothesis and the suspicious precincts could be identified if em doe s not release its list of sampled precincts us count votes believes it will still be possibl to rigorously test the hypothesis that the vote counts were corrupted by assembling and analyzing p recinctlevel nationwide database containing detailed election results voting equipment informat ion and demographic data higher exit poll response rates and higher exit poll discrepancies occurred in bush strongholds ems own data contradict both the rbr and the rbrmpc hypotheses and support the bsvcc hypothesis c implausible exit poll participation patterns are needed to satisfy em s data the edisonmitofsky report states our investigation of the differences between the exit poll estimates and the actual vote count point to one primary reason in number of precincts higher than average within precinc t error wpe most likely due to kerry voters participating in the exit poll s at higher rate than bush voters page 3 it is mathematically possible to construct set of response patterns

data table 2 three oddities must occur 1 there must have been very large spread of response rates of 31 for kerry supporters from low of 529 to high of 84 that is five times greater than the spread among bush supporters of only 6 from low of 476 to high of 538 2 kerry voters must have responded their highest of 84 in bush strongholds while responding least 53 in kerry strongholds 3 the difference in response rates between bush and kerry voters must be over 30 in bush strongholds much higher than the 6 overall response rate difference suggested by edisonmitofsky and much higher than the wpe this data contradicts previous experience and observations of this election that voter s finding themselves in the minority in local venue and particularly dwarfed minor ity tend to be less willing to respond to exit poll interviewers not more as this data requires certa inly we would not expect the kerry voter response rate to soar to over 84 in precincts where bush voters outnumber them by at least fourtoone conversely we would not expect the kerry voter response rate to be at its lowest 53 in precincts where kerry voters were most numerous one might reasonably ask if such oddities persist when employing other assumpti ons of the percentage of bush and kerry voters in each partisan precinct grouping the answer is yes as we show in appendix the required pattern of exit poll participation by kerry and bush voters to satisfy the m exit poll data defies empirical experience and common sense under any assumed scenario electionarchiveorg page 13 41205 implausible patterns of exit poll participation as proportion of those as ked to take the polls are needed to satisfy ems data in the prior section we computed the response rates as proportion of those in the sample who completed the exit poll not the proportion of those who were actually invited to respond now we calculate the kerry and bush voter response rates as proportion of those actua lly asked to complete the exit poll voter was missed if he or she could not be approached perhaps when cluster emerges from the voting area together and only limited few can be approached edisonmitofsky d efine

miss rate is constant across precinct types while the refusal and response rates are not according t the edisonmitofsky explanation suggests that the miss rate cannot be highly correlated with the

page 14 41205 ems exit poll data not only requires reluctant bush responder syndrome it also requires high range of kerry voters response rates that varies far more than bush voters pl us kerry voters respond most in bush strongholds theory once again there is an implausible set of required response rates for kerry and bush supporters given the edisonmitofsky precinct partisanship data in table 1 very implausible patterns of exit poll participation are required to s atisfy ems data in 80 100 bush precincts one clue in the em data offers insight into possible cause of the discrepancies they report the mean vs the median in bush strongholds in 80100 bush strongholds the median wpe of 59 is very different from the mean wpe of 100 this suggests that the mean in these bush strongholds was pulled up by small number of precincts with extremely high wpes for this to occur there must have been some pr ecincts in which the wpe was very negative and the exit poll estimated much bigger vote for kerry than the election results recorded because the median wpe is 58 we know that in half these precinc ts the error was less than 58 therefore the wpe discrepancy in half of the data must conse rvatively be estimated to be at least average 142 wpe15 the following table shows the required response rates calculated for these highbush precincts mean wpe eresponse rate rbush bkerry kbush bkerry

huge gap of 29 that is totally at odds with empirical experience the difference in respons rates for bush and kerry voters conservatively must exceed 25 and is in all cases much higher t han the wpes

hypothesis in t he absence of ems raw data us count votes is planning an indepth statistical analysis of pre cincts with high bush and high kerry vote totals once our new nationwide precinctlevel vote

surprising patterns of partisan response rates to exit polls are required by both kerry and bush voters when we select values to minimize the differences between bush and kerr voters exit poll response rates in sum there are values of proportions of bush and kerry voters which can be chosen that would result in plausible response rate patterns and that satisfy the exit poll data given by em d the same exit polls more accurately projected the senate races the senate and presidential races were both questions on single exit poll survey if bush supporters were refusing to fill out this survey as hypothesized the accuracy of the xit poll should have been just as poor in the senate races as it was in the presidential race the presidential and senate poll results derive from exactly the same responders in 32 states senate elections took place on the same ballot with the presidential rac the exit polls were more accurate for senate races than for the presidential race includi ng states where republican senator eventually won pages 1924 the senate polls were significantly more accurate paired ttest t30 248 p 02 if outlier north dakota is excluded therefore the mitofskyedison hypothesis of reluctant bus h poll responders is irrelevant to explain the discrepancies between the exit poll and election res ults in the presidential race this difference between the accuracy of the senate and presidential exit poll is puzzling historic data as well as the exit polls themselves indicate that the ticketsplitting ra is low it is reasonable to expect that the same voters who voted for kerry were also the mainstay of support f or the democratic candidates in the senate why should polls based on these same participants be more accurate in predicting sena results than in predicting the presidential vote in the absence of raw unadjusted precinct l evel exit poll data this question may best be answered by comparative analysis of official precinct level presidential vote tallies with tallies from senate and other races patterns of anomalies i n vote counting in us senate races should also be searched for and investigated if found there is logic to account for nonresponders or missed voters when discussing the differen ce in the accuracy of results for the senate versus the presidential races in the same exit poll electionarchiveorg page 17 41205 other possible reasons for exit poll bias traugott highton and brady in their study of the exit polls16 juxtaposed their discussion of the discrepancies between election and exit poll results in the presidential race with their discussion of other causes for wpe within precinct errors which were discussed in ems r eport pp 3746 thus implying that these explained the exit poll discrepancies in the presidential r ace while this data is useful for em in planning future polls but it is almost certainl irrelevant to the 2004 exit poll discrepancy here is table of the highest and lowest wpes for each factor given by em table 6 other factors with influence amount of wpe within precinct error other factors related to wpe lowest overall mean wpe highest mean wpe 1 distance from polling location

we can easily eliminate these factors let us take distance from polling place the number of precincts where the pollsters were placed far from the polling s tation was small the discrepancies that em seek to explain are already fully present even in th precincts where pollsters were optimally placed most of this bias is apparent even in the 75 of precincts wher the pollster was allowed to conduct his survey just outside or within the building hand counted paper ballots were used primarily in rural districts in only 3 of sa mpled precincts altogether so had very little effect on the overall discrepancies all voting methods produced higher mean wpes in urban areas with over 50000 population rural areas constituted 24 of precincts sampled all other population size preci nct groups had mean wpe of at least 50 with the highest mean wpe of 79 in suburbs which constituted 39 f precincts other factors relating to wpe within precinct error were given in the edi sonmitofsky report that would explain the systematic discrepancies between the election results and the exit poll results in the presidential race iii explanation three inaccurate election results if the discrepancies between exit poll and election results cannot be explained by random sampling error the reluctant bush responder hypothesis is inconsistent with the data and other exit polling errors are insufficient to explain the large exit polling discrepancies then the only remaining explanation that the official vote count was corrupted must be seriously considered edison mitofsky say in their executive summary p 3 exit po lls do not support allegations of fraud but they do not seriously consider the hypothesis of elec tion fraud instead em use the word error consistently to analyze potential problems wit h the exit polls always assuming the correctness of the election results without providing supporting evidence for that assumption the em exit poll report shows differences in wpe for differ ent types of voting equipment p 40 precincts with paper ballots used primarily in rural precincts showed median wpe of 09 consistent with chance while all other technologies were associa ted with unexplained high wpe discrepancies between election and exit poll results table 7 median wpe by voting equipment type of equipment used at polling place median wpe overall paper ballot 09 mechanical voting machine 103 touch screen 70 punch cards 73 optical scan 55 there is the possibility that errors for all four automated vot ing systems could derive from errors in electionarchiveorg page 19 41205 the election results regrettably edisonmitofsky fail to speci fy pvalues significance levels or the statistical method by which they arrived at their conclusion that voting machine type is not related to wpe and their breakdown for voting equipment ignores whether results re tallied in the precinct or at central location further they do not provide the raw data b which one might evaluate that conclusion the edisonmitofsky report does not report having done an ano va of voting machine type that might confirm their claim that there is differe nce between precincts using different voting machines limited study of new mexicos detailed precinct level vote type elect ion results showed that pushbutton digital recording electronic dre voting machines in new mexico produced significantly higher rates of undervotes in the presidential race in ele ction day voting than did new mexicos optical scan voting machines17 similar audits of other states election results are needed the many anecdotal reports of voting irregularities18 create context in which the possibility that the overall vote count was substantially corrupted must be taken seriously the h ypothesis that the discrepancy between the exit polls and election results is due to errors in the off icial election tally remains coherent theory iv misleading use of adjusted exit poll data the important distinctions between weighting and adjusting exit poll dat must be made in our analysis weighting involves comparison of raw exit poll data with known or consistently estimated parameters such as race and gender breakdown of the electorate the raw dat is weighted to better conform to the demographic composition of the electorate and there is general agre ement that such weighting or stratification produces greater accuracy in the exit poll results by diminishing the effects of both sampling error and skewing eg differential response vels by race or gender or age group adjusting reweighting renormalization or forcing of exit poll data is als weighting process but one which involves the use of tabulated vote counts to which the already demographically weighted exit poll results are brought into congruence once the polls have closed and t abulated results become available first at the precinct and then at the county level edi sonmitofskys exit poll results are adjusted to mirror these tabulated results thus it has been stated what you would get after the election are preference ie exit poll numbers forced to the elec tion result19 such adjustment of exit polls results to congruence with incoming tabulated electi on results did indeed take place late on election night 2004 and was posted to media websites during the hour or so after 17 httpelectionarchiveorgucvanalysisnmnmanalys is_el_jmpdf 18 election

available prior to this adjustment wil l be referred to as unadjusted many have questioned whether this process was in itself sinister designed to conceal troubling questions about vote counting in election 2004 as revealed by the unadjusted exit poll results t he answer is almost certainly and yet the effect of the process was at the very least confusing and served to blunt public awareness of the dramatic exit pollvote count discrepancies during the critical period immediately following the election while we acknowledge that slight adjustment may legitimately be made to exit polls using the reported election results so that the results can be used to assess the demogra phics and opinions underlying the reported voter shares in consistent fashion the justification for doing so rests entirely on the assumption that the reported election results are in fact accurate as reflected by small and undramatic discrepancy between exit poll results and vote counts in order for the exit poll results in 2004 to be used in this manner they had to be substantially in fact dramatically adjusted such substantial discrepancies and the need for such dramatic adjustment raised bri ght red flag edisonmitofsky ignored this red flag and simply substituted the adjusted data t which has been generally employed without acknowledgement this practice continues in edisonmitofskys report the national exit poll nep data given on pp 6061 and again on p 65 was adjusted to correspond to the official vote count this adjusted data continues to be highly misleading for example adam nagourney writing in the n ew york times21 apparently unknowingly used this adjusted report data to make the major and erroneous point that for the first time the republican share of the electorate equaled the democrati c 3737 the actual unadjusted exit poll data showed democratic share of 38 to republican 35 promulga ting multiple and not clearly delineated data sets raises the level of general confusion and detracts from the credibility of the salient data sets and results fortunately demographically weighted unadjusted data set has been availa ble for analysis since november 3 2004 see appendix b cnn screen shots of exit poll data were downloaded by jonathan simon and others from 1217 to 1224 am et on nov 3 200422 it is an open question whether in the absence of this somewhat fortuitous data capture either the vote count s themselves or the exit poll results adjusted to mirror them would have been called into question and whethe r any of the unadjusted data sets would have come to light to the best of our knowledge the simon screen shots that are marked as having been updated from 1217 to 1224 am et and referred to as the simon data23reflect the final demographically weighted exit poll data available bef ore these data 20 see eg httpwwwcnncomelection2004pagesresultsstat esctp00epolls0html this is the page for connecticut for other states substitute the appro priate state abbreviation for

and ohio simon was captured both unadjusted and adjusted results all of which show major exit poll adjustments in favor of bush in the state on connecticut for example the results changed fr om 577

screen shots or the data set derived from them thi s simon data corresponds closely with the data sets referred to as call 3 data and present ed by em in their report on pp 212224 em employs this call3 data set for the presidential election once in the ir report table pp 2122 and then abandons it entirely substituting without acknowledgement the adjusted data set nd thus perpetuating the confusion and misleading impressions created by their original conversion to the adjusted data on the morning of november 3 2004 we see constructive reason for ems prac tice in this regard it is reasonable to ask edisonmitofsky to make publicly available the raw precinct lev data and weights used to calculate both their call3and simon data sets and explain to the public its selective avoidance of these data sets in their report kerry444 bush in the 1253 am update while th number of respondents remained constant at 872 t he tabulated results were 547 kerry444 bush exactly matchi ng the adjusted poll results 24 although the simon data and call 3 data do not mat ch exactly in nearly all cases the discrepancies re very minor within few tenths of percentage point within the bounds of rounding error and there is stati stically significant pattern of overstatement or understatement either the simon data or the call3 data may be used witho ut changing the thrust of our analysis that there exists pattern of statistically significant discrepancy between th exit poll results and vote counts electionarchiveorg page 22 41205 summary there is already strong case that there were significant irregul arities in the presidential vote count from the 2004 election nevertheless critics are asking for firmer proof befor going forward with thorough investigation25 we feel strongly that this is the wrong standard one cannot have proof before an investigation in fact the burden of proof should be to show that the election process is accurate and fa ir the integrity of the american electoral system can and should be beyond reproach ci tizens in the worlds oldest and greatest democracy should be provided every assurance that the mechanis ms they have put in place to count our votes are fair and accurate the legitimacy of our electe d leaders depends upon it welldocumented security vulnerabilities and accuracy issues have affect ed voting equipment as far back as the late 1960s26 and history shows that partisan election officials have long possessed the power to suppress and otherwise distort the vote counts27 the recent and ongoing proliferation of sophisticated computerized vote recording and tallying equipment28 much of it unverifiable and hence faithbased dramatically augments the opportunities for wholesale and utcomedeterminative distortions of the vote counting process that the lions share of this equipment is develope d provided and serviced by partisan private corporations only amplifies these serious concerns the fact that in the 2004 election all voting equipment technologies except paper ballots were ssociated with large unexplained exit poll discrepancies all favoring the same party certainly warrants further inquiry the absence of any statisticallyplausible explanation for the discrepancy between edison mitofskys exit poll data and the official presidential vote tally is an unanswered question of vital national

electionarchiveorg page 26 41205 appendix b wpe and differential partisan response wpe is poor measure of differential response by party as its magnitude i s affected by the partisan composition of the precinct k or b and by the overall response rate r in addition to the relative response to exit pollsters by members of each party29 this can be seen by inspecting tables 24 above the difference between bush and kerry voter response rates and mean wpe incre ases as precincts become more partisan this is because in addition to differential res ponse by party overall response rates and partisan composition affect wpe this can be seen by setting k r 5w and b r 5w where bkw is differential response by party and r is mean response by party and substituting these into the solutions for k and b in equation 1 appendix to get the following two equation system for r and w w rkre k5 05 0 and w rbre b5 05 0 the solution of this system for w is ke krbe brw2 2 so that when 1kb as we assume in this report neglecting the response of independent voters who made up 1 or so of the national electorate we get equation 3 1 1 2 1 1 2 k kre b brew or conversely equation 4 k krwb brwe 1212 from this equation we see that or wpe is not only determined by the partisan response differential w but also by k or b and r more competitive precincts when 5 0 b 5 0 k and precincts with lower overall response rates r will have higher absolute wpe simply because of the mathematical effects of k or b and r on the relationship between wand differential response by party w will not be equal to unless 1 1212 b brk kr for perfectly competitive precinct wre kb 5 05 0 its maximum value if in addition r 05 then we this suggests that the wpes listed in tables 24 of our report substantially unders tate differential response by party especially for partisan districts as we have shown w has to be very and implausibly large in all cases if is to be explained 29 we thank elizabeth liddle of the university of not tingham uk for calling our attention to the eff ect of precinct partisanship on the relationship between differenti partisan response and wpe we take full responsi bility for the derivations and conclusions that we have arrived at from analyzing this pattern in this appendix electionarchiveorg page 27 41205 moreover this analysis suggests that if there is pervasive and more or less constant bias in exit polling because of differential response by party wpe should be greatest f or more balanced precincts and fall as precincts become more partisan the data presented on p 36 37 of the m report and displayed in table 1 of our report above show that this is the case for all except the most highly partisan bush precincts for which wpe dramatically increases to 100 our calculations above show the differential partisan response necessary t generate this level of wpe in these precincts ranges from 40 table 2 to an absolute minimum of 205 table 4 these results would appear to lend further support to the bush strongholds have more votecorruption bsvcc hypot hesis discussed in section b of our report and to the discussion of the very implausible pat terns of exit poll participation are required to satisfy ems data in 80100 bush precinct s signed wpe versus absolute wpe in partisan precincts the next to last column of the precinct partisanship table p 36 of em report shows tha t the mean absolute value wpe unsigned wpe for highly partisan bush precincts declines to 124 for highly partisan republican precincts relative to less partisan 132 and 134 and more bala nced precincts 152 only highly partisan kerry precincts have lower mean absolute value wpe of 88 comparing this data to the mean wpe data in table 2 of our report shows that highly kerry precincts had large absolute value wpes totaling 88 but these included both pro kerry and probush discrepancies that offset each other so that the average signed wpe was only 03 probush bias was just about offset by prokerry bias in these precincts as one would expect for random sampling bias and random measurement error b somewhat similar but less balanced pattern occurred in less partisan pr ecincts as in these precincts signed wpe though consistently negative was roughly half the magnitude of mean absolute value wpe 55 and 134 83 and 152 61 and 132 respectively this suggests that in these precincts about half of prokerry exit poll bias wa s offset by probush exit poll bias this is not what one would expect from random exit poll bias and measurement er ror but at least moves in the expected direction c the dramatic and unexpected increase in signed mean wpe in highly bush prec incts of 100 noted above is also unexpectedly close to mean absolute value wpe 124 in these precincts this suggests that the jump in signed wpe in high ly partisan bush precincts occurred primarily because signed wpe discrepancies in the precincts were unlike in above and much more so than in b above overwhelmingly onesided negative overstatements of kerrys vote share these results lend further support to the bush strongholds have more votecorruption bsvcc hypothesis discussed in section b of our report and to the discussion of the very impl ausible patterns of exit poll participation are required to satisfy ems data in 80 100 bush precincts it is reasonable to ask edisonmitofsky to explain why signed wpe in highly partisan precincts is not lower than in less partisan precincts as would be m athematically expected and where this dramatic increase in onesided wpe in highly bush precincts and significant increases in onesided wpe in more partisan precincts both of which are at odds with the more or less random pattern of signed wpe error in highly kerry precincts comes from electionarchiveorg page 28 41205 appendix c jonathan simon exit poll data downloaded from cnn and similar t the call 3 data in edisonmitofskys report on pp 2122 state venue
