for reasons 14bd 1 c during an october 26 call on the ambassador israeli ambassador gabby levy registered concern over the recent deterioration in his countrys bilateral relations with turkey and the conviction that the relationships decline is attributable exclusively to prime minister erdogan levy said foreign minister davutoglu had relayed message to him through the visiting czech foreign minister that things will get better he had also fielded messages from senior civil servants xxxxx urging him to weather quietly erdogans harsh public criticisms of israel the latter claimed erdogans repeated angry references to the humanitarian situation in gaza are for domestic political consumption only 2 c levy dismissed political calculation as motivator for erdogans hostility arguing the prime ministers party had not gained single point in the polls from his bashing of israel instead levy attributed erdogans harshness to deepseated emotion hes fundamentalist he hates us religiously and his hatred is spreading levy cited perceived antiisraeli shift in turkish foreign policy including the gots recent elevation of its relations with syria and its quest for observer status in the arab league 3 c comment our discussions with contacts both inside and outside of the turkish government on turkeys deteriorating relations with israel tend to confirm levys thesis that erdogan simply hates israel xxxxx discusses contributing reasons for erdogans tilt on iranmiddle east isues but antipathy towards israel is factor jeffrey visit ankaras classified web site at httpwwwintelinks
