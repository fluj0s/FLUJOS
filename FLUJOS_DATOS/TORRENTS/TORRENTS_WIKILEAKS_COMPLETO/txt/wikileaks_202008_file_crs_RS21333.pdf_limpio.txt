nevertheless full implementation of the peace agreement has been difficult the devolved government was susp ended for the fourth time in october 2002 amid loss of trust and confidence on both side s of the conflict unionist s were concerned about the iras commitment to nonviolence and the lack of full nationalist support for policing meanwhile nationalists worried about th pace of uk demilitarization police reforms and ongoing loyalist paramilitary activity efforts to restore the devolved government culminated on march 26 2007 when the tr aditionally antiagreement democratic unionist party dup agreed to enter into powersharing government with sinn fein the iras associated political party th new government began work on may 8 2007 with dup leader ian paisley as first minister and sinn feins chief negotiator martin mcguinness as deputy first minister l ondon and dublin hope that this deal will entrench the political settlement embodied in the good friday agreement and produce politically stable devolved government in northern ireland devolved government and recurrent crises 19992002 for years instability in northern irelands devolved government was the rule rather than the exception decommissioning and police reforms were key sticking points authority over local affairs was first transferred to the northern ireland assembly and executive on december 1 1999 after 27 year s of direct rule from london but on february 11 2000 london suspended the devolve d government because the assemblys first minister thenulster unionist party uup leader david trimble was poised to resign to protest the absence of ira decommissioning after intense negotiations involving trimble and sinn fein the ira pl edged to put its arms beyond use the powersharing institutions we re reinstated in june 2000 for the next twelve months unionists rema ined frustrated by the ongoing lack of ira decommissioning as result trimble resigned as first minister on july 1 2001 since the assembly can operate longer than six weeks without first minister or new elections must be called l ondon suspended the devolved g overnment on august 10 for 24 hours london feared elections would resu lt in gains for hardliners the brief suspension reset the clock giving negotiators another six weeks to try to avert the collapse of belfasts political institutions meanwhile pressure on the ira to decommission began to grow following the august 2001 arre sts in colombia of three suspected ira members on charges of training farc guerrillas to use explosives and the september 11 terrorist attacks on september 21 2001 london suspended the assembly again for 24 hours to buy more time for negotiations fi nally on october 23 after sinn fein leader gerry adams publicly called for ira deco mmissioning the ira announced that it had put quantity of weapons beyond use to save the p eace process in response the uup decided to rejoin the executive and the assembly reconve ned in november 2001 relative calm prevailed in early 2002 on april 8 2002 the ira carried out second act of decommissioning still wo rries about the iras longterm commitment to the peace process persisted following allegations that the ira was buying new weapons updating its hit list and was behind the theft of intelligence documents from belfast police barracks on october 4 2002 police raided sinn feins assembly offices and arrested four officials as part of an i nvestigation into suspected ira spy ring the uup and the dup threatened to withdraw from the government unless sinn fein was expelled with the political process in rmoil london once again suspended belfasts devolved government and reinstat ed direct rule on october 14 2002httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21333crs3 2003present following the 2002 suspension of the devolved government london and dublin led talks with northern irel ands political parties to try to find way forward negotiations largely focused on findi ng formula to assure unionists that the ira was winding down as paramilitary force and meeting nationalist demands for government stability and more progress in the police justice and human rights fields in october 2003 the ira announced third act of decommissioning but uup leader trimble criticized the lack of details about the quantity of ar ms disposed and put further progress toward restor ing devolution on hold despite the suspension of the powersharing institutions assembly elections took place in november 2003 the elections resulte d in shift toward perceived hardliners the dup led by the reverend ian pais ley overtook the uup as the dominant unionist party sinn fein surpassed the mo re moderate social democratic and labor party sdlp to become the largest nationalist party immediately after the elections the dup asserted that it would not enter into government with sinn fein until the ira disarmed and disbanded the dup also refused to talk directly to sinn fein most analysts predicted that the election results would ma ke restoring devolution more difficult negotiations continued but remained stalem ated for much of 2004 efforts to restore devolution were further comp licated by december 2004 bank robbery in belfast which police believed was carried out by the ira and the january 2005 murder of belfast man robert mccartney during bar brawl i nvolving ira members these incidents increased pressure on the ira and sinn fein to also address the issue of ira criminality on april 6 2005 gerry adams effectively called on the ira to abandon violence and pursue politics as an alternative to armed struggle on july 28 2005 the ira ordered an end to its armed campaign it instructed all members to pursue objectives through exclusively peaceful means and to not engage in any other activities whatsoever all ira units were ordered to dump arms although many analysts asserted that the iras statement was the least ambiguous one ever unionists were wary noting that it did not explicitly address the issue of ira criminality or whether the ira would disba nd the dup and other unionists also wanted sinn fein to support northern irelands new police service see belo w on september 26 2005 northern irelands independent international commission on decommissioning iicd announced that the ira had put all of its arms beyond use asserting that the ira weaponry dismantled or made inoperable ma tched estimates provide d by the security forces on february 1 2006 the internati onal monitoring commission imc which monitors paramilitary ceasefires and political party compliance with the peace agreement asserted that the ira seemed to be moving in the right direction however unionists remained skeptical and the dup continued to resist sharing power with sinn fein in an attempt to break the stalemate london recalled the northern ireland assembly on may 15 2006 the assembly wa s permitted to deba policy matters but was not given the power to make laws uk and irish offici als had hoped that by recalling the assembly even in such shadow form confidence would build between the opposing parties and in the political process when this attemp t ultimately failed london and dublin gave the parties until november 24 2006 to form an executive or new britishirish partnership arrangements would be implemented to eff ectively govern northern ireland the exact form of such partnership arrangements was ft unclear but analysts viewed this prospecthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21333crs4 2 brian lavery

bertie ahern announced an allparty meeting in scotland in an ttempt to hammer out deal on october 13 blair and ahern put forth road map known as the st ndrews agreement intended to break the political stalemate it called for nego tiations between nove mber 2006 and march 2007 on forming new permanent government during this time the dup would agree to share power with sinn fein and sinn fein would agree to support the police service and join the policing board the st andrews agreement also included some changes to the operation of the powersharing institutions and provisions on government stability and human rights in addition to meet nationa list demands it called for the devolution of policing and justice powers from london to be lfast by 2008 it set march 7 2007 as the date for new assembly electi ons and march 26 as the date for london to rescind direct rule and restore northern ir elands devolved government blair and ahern warned that failure to establish an executive by march 26 would result in the dissolution of the assembly and new britishirish partnership arrangements to govern northern ireland analysts contended that the biggest probl em was the lack of trust between the dup and sinn fein the dup wanted sinn fein to accept northern irelands new police service the courts and the rule of law before agreeing to shared government meanwhile sinn fein wanted the shared government to sit before accepting policing because it feared that otherwise the dup would raise additiona l issues regarding the ira before agreeing to share power in january 2007 sinn fein mbers voted to support northern irelands police and the criminal justice system in the context of the reestablishment of the political institutions many experts viewed sinn feins resolution as historic given the iras traditional view of the police as legitimate target3 on march 7 2007 northern ireland voters went to the polls once again the dup and sinn fein emerged as the largest unionist and nationalist parties both the dup and sinn fein interpreted these election results in which each saw off challenges from internal dissenters opposed to the st andr ews agreement as providing mandate to work toward forming powersharing governme nt analysts speculated that in light of sinn feins commitment to policing and perhaps to secure his own legacy paisley was finally ready to enter into government with sinn fein on march 26 2007 paisley nd adams met for the first time and announced deal to enter into powersharing government on may 8 2007 london and dublin agreed to accept the sixweek delay in restoring northe rn irelands devolved government given that the two parties were able to reach agreement themselves the dup had pressed for the delay in order to raise the level of confidence in the unionist community especially in regard to sinn feins pledge to support po licing analysts contend that the image of paisley and adams sitting at the same table and the statements of both

and deputy first minister respec tively and the powersharing assembly and executive began work many experts believe that unlike past efforts this deal will stick given that it was reached by the dup and sinn fein viewed as the two most polarized forces in northern ireland politics4 by many accounts the devolved government has been running relatively smoothly and paisley and mcgui nness have established good wo rking relationship focus has largely been on local political issues such as water charges health care housing and education in october 2007 the executive i ssued new legislative program 10year investment strategy and its first budget ce devolution was restore d many hailed these documents as demonstrating the executives ability to work together on key priorities and spending plans at the same time tensions within the assembly and executive exist and some reflect nationalistunionist divisions for example the dup and sinn fein remain at odds over certain aspects of the plan to transfer police and justice affairs from london to the devolved government in may 2008 pa isley who is 81 announced that he would step down as dup leader and first minister observers speculate that his decision likely reflects his increasing fragility and recent ss of support among some protestant voters who still oppose the powersharing deal pete r robinson the former deputy dup leader succeeded paisley as party leader and first minister5 implementing police reforms the royal ulster constabular ruc northern irela nds former 92 protestant police force was long viewed by catholics as

culture ethos and symbol s are such that northern ireland has police service that can enjoy widespread support from the community as whole in june 1998 prime minister blair appointed chris patten to

other key measures included reducing the size of the force from 11400 to 7500 and increasing the proportion of ca tholic officers unionists responded negatively but nationalists were mostly positive in may 2000 the blair government introduced the police bill in the house of commons nationalists were critical arguing that pattens proposals had been gutted london responded that amendments would deal with human rights training promoting 5050 recruitment of ca tholics and protestant s and oversight responsibilities the police bill became law on november 23 2000 but sinn fe in and the sdlp

support london proposed further concessions in july 2001 including lving the antiterrorist special branch in august 2001 the sdlp broke with sinn fein and accepted the british governments additional cessions on policing the sdlp along with the uup and dup agreed to nominate representatives to the policing board democratic oversight body on november 4 2001 the policing board came into being that same day the ruc was renamed the psni and the first class of r ecruits drawn 5050 from both catholic and protestant communities began their training some say that sinn feins absence from the policing board discouraged more catholics from joining the psni sinn fein maintained that its acceptance of the psni and the policing board hinged on deal to revive the devolved government and the transfer of policing and justice powers from london to restored assembly nd executive as noted above in january 2007 sinn fein members voted to support the police and join the policing board in the context of reconstituted assembly and executive sinn fein members assumed their places on the policing board in late may 2007 in july 2007 the british army ended its 38year long military operation in northern
