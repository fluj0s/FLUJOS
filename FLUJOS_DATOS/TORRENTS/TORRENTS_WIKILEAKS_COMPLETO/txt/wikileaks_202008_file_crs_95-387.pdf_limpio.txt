1993 president clinton modified the military policy on providing abortions at military medical facilities under the change directed by the president military medical facilities were allowed to perform abortions if paid for entirely with nondepartment of defense dod funds ie privately funded although arguably consistent with statutory language barring the use of defense department funds the presidents policy overturned former interpretation of existing law barring the availability of these services on december 1 1995 hr 2126 the fy1996 dod appropriations act became law pl 10461 included in this law was language barring the use of funds to administer any policy that permits the performance of abortions at any dod facility except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term or where the pregnancy resulted from an act of rape or incest language was also included in the fy1996 dod authorization act pl 104106 febr uary 10 1996 prohibiting the use of dod facilities in the performance of abortions these served to reverse the presidents 1993 policy change recent attempts to change or modify these laws have failed over the last three decades the availability of abortion services at military medical facilities has been subjected to numerous changes and interpreta tions within the last 15 years congress has considered numerous amendments to effectuate such changes although congress in 1992 passed one such amendment to make abortions available at overseas installation it was vetoed the changes ordered by the president did not necessarily have the effect of greatly increasing access to abortion services abortions are generally not performed at military medical facilities in the continental united states in addition few have been performed at these facilities abroad for number of reasons first the us military follows the prevailing laws and rules of foreign countries regarding abortion second the military has had difficult time finding health care professionals in uniform willing to perform the procedure with the enactment of pl 10461 and pl 104106 these questions became moot because now neither dod funds nor facilities may be used to administer any policy that provides for abortions at any dod facility except where the life of the mother may be endangered if the fetus were carried to term privatelyfunded abortions at military facilities are permitted when the pregnancy was the result of an act of rape or incest there has been little legislative activity affecting the military on this issue the last major effort occurred with an amendment to the house vers ion of the fy2007 national defense authorization act would allow dod facilities outside the us to perform privatelyfunded abortions this language was rejected by the conference committee this report will be updated as warranted

proposals to modify the law as well as other related legislative and administrative actions g11g156g156g158g142g561 shortly after his inauguration on january 20 1993 president clinton issued memorandum on abortions at military hospitals this memorandum directed change in policy so that abortions could be performed at military medical faciliti provided that the procedure was privately funded this memo stated that section 1093 of title 10 of the united states code prohibits the use of department of defense dod funds to perform abortions except where the life of women would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term by memorandum of december 21 1987 and june 21 1988 dod has gone beyond what i am informed are the requirements of the statute and has banned all abortions at us military facilities even where the procedure is privately funded the ban is unwarranted accordingly i hereby direct that you reverse the ban immediately and permit abortion services to be provided if paid for entirely with nondod funds and in accordance with other relevant dod policies and procedures 1 the issue at hand was how the language in title 10 of the united states code and the presidents memo were to be interpreted as the presidents memorandum made obvious this language has been subject to varying interpretations that llowed or denied abortion services specifically section 1093 states funds available to the department of defense may not be used to perform abortions except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term2 although the presidents interpretation of the language was arguably consistent with the letter of the law critics contend that it countermanded the spirit of the statute and is overly broad in other words it is argued that the intent of this language was to prevent the dod from providing abortion services proponents of the clinton change argued that congress allowed for exactly this type of interpretation proponents note that this interpretation was particularly important for 1 president william j clinton memorandum for the secretary of defense memorandum on abortions in military hospitals january 22 1993 filed with the office of the federal register 1150 am january 27 1993 cited in public papers of the presidents of the united states william j c linton 1993 washington dc government printing

program for military dependents certain retirees and their dependents who are unable to receive care at military medical facility will provide coverage for abortions only when the mothers life is in danger the attending physician must certify in writing that the abortion was performed because lifeendangering condition existed and must provide medical documentation to the champus claims processor

affordable and sanitary abortion services may not be available in the local economy following the election of the 104th congress democrats were replaced by republicans as committee leaders representative robert k dorn an the thennew republican chairman of the military personnel and compensation subcommittee house national security committee noted that one of his priorities was barring abor tions at overseas military hospitals even if the patients pay for them3 on december 1 1995 pl 10461 was enacted according to this law sec 8119 none of the funds made available in this act may be used to administer any policy that permits the performance of abortions at medical treatment or other facilities of the department of defense sec 8119a the provision of section 8119 shall not apply where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term or the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest on february 10 1996 pl 104106 was enacted this law further limited that availability of abortion services sec 738b restriction on the use of facilitiesno medical treatment facility or other facility of the department of defense may be used to perform an abortion except where the life of the mother would be enda ngered if the fetus were carried to term or in case in which the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest4 since then efforts to modify the law pertaining to abortions have become routine part of the legislative process g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 there appears to be evidence of formal service policy on abortions prior to 1970 sources familiar with the issue at that time note that the availability of abortion services at military medical facilities varied by service location physician and command milieu each of the services approached the issue differently the air force tended to be somewhat more liberal while the army and the navy tended to be somewhat more conservative each facility also tended to follow the laws and regulations of the state within which it was located individual physicians ultimately had say regarding whether or not they personally would provide such services finally the commanders of various medical facilities may have had some effect on how and under what circumstances abortion services may have been provided commanders often lead by example without explicitly stating their own opinions policies or giving direct orders subordinates are acutely aware of their commanders approach to issues and often will integrate this approach into their own practice in other words policy may exist without one ever being officially stated although formal policy may not exist physicians also follow professional guidelines as they interpret them by practicing good medicine thus the decision to provide an abortion may have been based on host of dical indications particular to any given case 3 maze rick representative dornan pay gap one of top concerns army times

few abortions at military medical facilities in this era in certain situations such as in vietnam 19611975 military medical facilities generally did not provide abortion services instead medical evacuations to other countries that had available procedures japan for example provided access to abortion services in 1970 the office responsible for health affairs at dod reportedly issued orders that military hospitals perform abortions when it is medically necessary or when the mental health of the mother is threatened5 the rules however did not require military personnel to perform abortions these rules were less restrictive than the abortion laws in number of states one year later thenpresident richard m nixon directed that military policy concerning abortions at military bases in the united states be made to correspond with the laws of the states where the bases are located 6 following the 1973 supreme court case of roe v wade 7 the department of defense funded abortions for any women eligible for dod health care subject to certain limitations first two physicians were required to find that the abortion was medically indicated or required for reasons of mental health second the funding for these services could not be in conflict with the law of the state in which the abortion is carried out8 since states had differing rules regarding abortion it was possible for women to be treated differently depending on the location of the facility nevertheless there remains anecdotal evid ence of variations in accessibility similar to those that existed before roe v wade in 1975 concerns were raised over inconsistencies between state statutes and the roe decision military medical personnel were instructed to fo llow the constitutional guidance provided in roe in certain instances even though the state statutes had not been successfully challenged in court 9 from august 31 1976 to august 31 1977 approximately 26000 abortions were performed in military hospitals or in the champus program10 in 1978 an amendment to the department of defense appropriations bill offered by representative robert dornan prohibited the use of defense department funds for abortions with certain exceptions this amendment as enacted stated that 5 wolffe jim abortion ban may be lifted soon stateside air force times april 12 1993 23 6 statement about policy on abortions at

exercise of that fundamental right by regulations that prohibit or substantially limit access to the means of effectuating that decision 8 ayres b drummond jr new york times august 10 1978 79

perform abortions except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term or except for such medical procedures necessary for the victims of rape or incest when such rape or incest has been reported promptly to law enforcement agency or public health service or except in those instances where severe and longlasting physical health damage to the mother would result if the pregnancy were carried to term when so determined by two physicians nor are payments prohibited for drugs or devices to prevent implantation of the fertilized ovum or for medical procedures necessary for the termination of an ectopic pregnancy 11 in 1979 similar language was enacted in the fy1980 dod appropriations act the 1979 language did not contain any restrictions with regard to the severe and longlasting physical health damage to the mother that would result if the pregnancy were carried to term when so determined by two physicians in other words determination that carrying the pregnancy to term would affect the physical health of woman was not basis for providing abortions under this language 12 this language did not prevent all abortions at military hospitals military hospitals overseas reportedly performed approximately 1300 abortions in fy1979 these abortions were privately paid for defense officials allowed these procedures under the rationale that at certain overseas or isolated us stations safe and reliable civilian facilities were not always available13 in 1980 the language included in the fy1981 dod appropriations act was again modified as follows none of the funds appropriated by this act shall be used to perform abortions except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term or except for such medical procedures necessary for the victim of rape or incest when such rape has within seventytwo hours been reported to law enforcement agency or public health service nor are payments prohibited for drugs or devices to prevent implantation of the fertilized ovum or for medical procedures n ecessary for the termination of an ectopic pregnancy provided however that the several states are and shall remain free not to fund abortions to the extent that they in their sole discretion deem appropriate 14 under this language the reporting requirement for incest was removed also victims of rape were required to report the incident within 72 hours15 in addition language was added encouraging the states to exercise their authority with regard to funding abortions the language was shortened considerably in 1981 many of the exceptions to the prohibition of funding were removed this language stated that 11 pl 95457 section 863 october 13 1978 92 stat 1254 in anticipation of this change the office of the assistant

language required that such report should be made promptly dod interpreted this to mean within 48 hours it was also expected that victims of incest would report the incidents to appropriate

abortions except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term16 identical language was included in the following two years appropriations acts17 finally in 1984 congress codified this language in title 10 united states code see quoted text at the top of page 1 18 in 1988 dod modified its rules to require physicians statement for abortion claims made via champus this change was instituted to assure that all claims for abortions performed in the private sector and covered by champus were for lifethreatening situations champus officials said lifethreatening conditions include leukemia breast cancer and other malignancies kidney failure congestive heart failure severe heart disease uncontrolled diabetes and several other conditions19 on june 21 1988 dr william mayer thenassist ant secretary of defense health affairs issued memorandum barring abortions in military medical facilities overseas although dr mayer recognized that privately paid abortions did not violate the letter of the law he issued the memorandum to avoid the appearance of insensitivity to the spirit of the law20 in 1990 an attempt to overturn this restriction failed an amendment to the dod authorization act to allow abortions at military medical facilities overseas was withdrawn when the senate fell two votes short of the number needed to invoke cloture 584121 the house of representatives rejected similar amendment on may 22 1991 the house of representatives reversed itself and passed 220208 an amendment to the dod authorization act that would have reinstated the prepaid overseas policy proponents argued that the language would be merely return to the policy as it existed prior to dr mayers memo of 1988 opponents countered that as drafted the amendment offered by representative aucoin would go beyond the thenprevailing policy by allowing abortions for any reason and at any time during the pregnancy 22 the measure was rejected once again when the senate fell two votes short of the 60 votes needed to invoke cloture 584023 the battle over this language intensified proponents stated that military women or dependents overseas were forced into dangerous or lifethreatening situations in countries where safe legal or affordable abortions could not be provided opponents argued that woman was denied military transportation to receive access to an abortion in another country 16 pl 97114 section 757 december 29 1981 95 stat 1588 17 pl 97377 section 755 december 21 1982 96 stat 1860 pl 98212 section 751 december 8 1983 97 stat 1447

overturn the restrictions on abortions at overseas military facilities this amendment was passed 21619324 on september 18 1992 the senate rejected 3655 an effort to strike language overturning the restrictions on overseas abortions despite these votes it was expected that president george h w bush would veto any defense legislation reinstating the former policy this expected veto was cited as the reason for the language being dropped by the conferees25 by unanimous consent the senate agreed to substitute the language pertaining to overseas abortions into s 3144 after striking all after the enacting clause26 s 3144 was simultaneously passed by unanimous consent the house subsequently passed the measure 220186 on october 3 199227 arguably the senate and house agreed to remove this language from the dod authorization act in anticipation of presidential veto by removing the language and passing it as freestanding bill the authorization act was not jeopardized since this was not presented in the authorization act it remains unknown whether president bush would have exercised his veto authority over the entire bill nevertheless president bush did pocketveto s 3144 on october 31 1992 after the congressional adjournment attempt was made to override this veto 28 as result of president clintons 1993 memorandum see page 1 thensecretary of defense aspin directed the secretaries of the military departments to reinstate the pre1988 policy concerning the availability of abortions overseas on may 9 1994 the assistant secretary of defense health affairs dr stephen c joseph released memorandum 29 seeking to unify and make consistent dod policy this policy had five parts that 1 provided access to abortion services for service women and eligible dependents overseas 2 required the valid consent of parent or other designated person in the case of minor who was not mature enough and well enough informed to give valid consent 3 relieved those medical practitioners directly involved from performing abortions if they objected 4 respected host nation laws regarding abortion and 5 directed the military health services system to provide other means of access if providing pre paid abortion services at facility was not feasible such alternate means could include supplementing staff with contract personnel referrals travel etc the cost of an abortion had been reported to be about 500 30 in practice the policy instituted by president clintons 1993 action may not have had the effects the president had expected although abortion access had been liberalized in terms of overall policy liberalization had not necessarily occurred in terms of actual access 24 congressional record june 4 1992 h4150h4156 25 dewar helen bushs veto power stalled the abortionrights

overseas had performed an average of 30 abortions annually last spring though when the military medical officials surveyed 44 army navy and air force obstetricians and gynecologists stationed in europe they found that all but one doctor adamantly refused to perform the procedure that one holdout too quickly switched positions military medical personnel willing to perform abortions have stepped forward in the pentagons sprawling pacific theater of operations either 31 number of reasons have been advanced to explain this general unwillingness by health care personnel in uniform to perform these procedures first fewer medical schools require or provide training in these techniques than was the case in the years immediately following the roe v wade decision32 second it is widely thought that the military in general and military physicians in particular tend to be more conservative on social issues than many population cohorts even if training were made available it is unlikely that many would volunteer third the social order on military posts tends to be very closeknit and hierarchical subordinate may choose not to ruffle the feathers of superior over such contentious issue thus the social norms established by superiors in the military environment are likely to translate into action or inaction by subordinates this conventional wisdom gains credibility given the enormous amount of leverage superiors in the military have over the careers of subordinates although this is true in the civilian context it apparently exists to lesser degree especially in professional fields such as medicine in which civilians are generally unwilling to formally judge or secondguess professional colleagues fourth the medical team must consist of volunteers any member of medical team needed to perform an abortion can essentially veto it fifth since military physicians are paid salary and not on the basis of procedures performed there is economic incentive to provide abortions finally rules exist requiring the services to respect the prevailing laws in each country thus the restrictions of particular country may limit the access to prepaid abortions at military facilities see appendix 33 given these factors and considerations it was reported that 27 abortions were performed at military hospitals worldwide in 199334 and 10 in 1994 all of the 1994 abortions were reported to be life of the mother cases ie none were prepaid according to data provided by dod two abortions were performed at military trea tment facilities worldwide in fy1999 for fiscal years 2000 2001 2002 2003 and 2004 the respective number of therapeutic abortions reported was 1 5 3 4 and 3 for fiscal years 2005 2006 and 2007 the numbers of therapeutic abortion reported were 4 5 and 5 respectively over these 8 years dod has performed an average of 375 therapeutic abortions per year 31 morrison david c an order that didnt take national journal april 16 1994 900 32 according to the alan guttmacher institute from 1976 to 19 91 the proportion of residency programs that did not offer abortion training rose from 75 to 31 in 1976 26 of the residency programs required abortion training by 1991 only 12 required such training the accreditation council for graduate medical education has directed obstetrical residents should be taught how to perform abortions unless they have moral or religious objection this change in policy is scheduled to become effective on january 1 1996 abortion mandated for ob training washington times february 15 1995 a12 on march 19 1996

abortions the armys 7th medical command europe sought in 1993 to hire civilian physician whose duties would include providing abortion services35 this move would have been consistent with the presidents memo stating that in circumstances in which it is not feasible to provide prepaid abortion services in particular military facility the military health services system shall develop other means to assure access such an affirmative step would have provided access where none was available before however such step could have been viewed as encouraging abortion and threatened to provoke protests both within the uniformed services and in the international community 36 to date reports of protests have not been found another consideration along similar lines is to expand the use of foreign physicians as suggested by the defense advisory committee for women in the services dacowits this may be effective in certain situations but not all since dod is still required to observe local laws countries such as spain south korea and pa nama outlaw or sharply restrict abortions 37 following german unification in 1993 german court issued an injunction against law that would have unified abortion policies in the east and west the bundestag lower house of the german parliament struggled to write new laws during this void the performance of abortions or restrictions on abortion services at military facilities in germany although not illegal may have been inflammatory to certain german sensitivities38 on august 21 1995 german president roman herzog signed into law measure passed by the bundestag on june 29 and approved by the bundesrat upper house on july 14 under this law abortions are illegal except in cases of rape or medical necessity but woman who seeks an abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy will not be subject to criminal prosecution provided she attends compulsory counseling session reviewing her options39 contracting with foreign physicians poses its ow n problems countries that lack professional medical personnel trained to us standards the very reason argued for providing these services in the first place are less likely to have physicians with skill level that would be commendable for contracting in certain cases contracting may be an option but it raises other considerations if the patient was to pay the cost of the abortion does such cost include prorated amount based on contracting training travel and other costs required to provide these services inclusion of these in such cost calculation could well make the price of these services prohibitive conversely using defense department funds to make available p repaid abortions ie through contracting travel etc could be viewed as in conflict with 10 usc 1093 35

hiring nonmilitary physicians to perform abortions was issued with specific reference to treatment facilities in germany dod respects host nation laws regarding abortion40 furthermore it was unlikely that abortion services would become more available if the military reduced the number of physicians as part of dod downsizing of the force structure one drawdown proposal suggests that dod could reduce the number of physicians in uniform by as much as 50 41 under the administrations longterm defense spending plans 5600 civilian medical personnel will be cut from the army ov er the next six years the navy and air force together are expected to be reduced by less than 2000 these reductions amount to the equivalent of shutting three of the armys eight medical centers experts say42 the reduction of civilian professionals in the us military may require dod to rotate uni formed physicians back to the us from overseas further reducing the number of physicians overseas such reduction would likely serve to reduce the availability of abortion services overseas on may 29 2002 federal judge ruled that the military must pay for 1994 abortion of an anencephalic fetus43 later in august 2002 second federal court ruled likewise in separate case involving another anencephalic fetus44 both cases were reversed on appeal45

prevent pregnancy by interfering with ovulation sperm transport through cervical mucus and fallopian tubes release of pituitary gonadotropins corpus luteum functions fertilization embryo transport and implantation 48 emphasis added the possibility of preventing fertilized egg from implanting leads to the argument for those who maintain that life begins at conception that plan b represents potential form of abortion in certain cases in may 2002 the pt executive council meeting released the following at the february 2002 dod pharmacy therapeutics pt executive council meeting the council recommended the addition of levonorgestrel 075 mg plan b to the basic core formulary bcf subject to the review of the director tricare management activity tma andor the assistance secretary of defense for health affairs asdha on 28 march 2002 the executive director of tma signed an action memo approving the recommendation on april 3 2002 the cocha ir of the dod pt committee informed the council members and pharmacy consultants of the decision and reinformed the council on 7 may 2002 on 8 may 2002 the executive council was reconvened briefly to announce that the council cochairs had been informed that the asdha also wanted to review the councils recommendation and that the executive director of tma had rescinded his earlier approval therefore plan b has not been approved for addition to the bcf at this time and the asdha is reviewing the councils recommendation military treatment facilities mtfs are required to include all bcf drugs on their local formularies as result of plan bs removal from the bcf each mtfs pt committee must now reevaluate whether this product is within the scope of practice at the mtf and whether the mtf wants to continue to have plan b on its formulary 49 in may 2005 proposed amendment to make plan b available on all military bases died in the house rules committee as part of its consideration of the fy2005 national defense authorization act50 this is not to say that plan b is not available at certain military bases or to military health care beneficiaries on september 7 2005 it was reported that certain military bases do have plan b on hand and have offered it usually in cases of sexual assault but also in cases where other contraceptives failed or unprotected sex was involved further military physicians may prescribe the medication allowing the beneficiary to have the prescription filled at civilian pharmacies51 although tangentially relevant to dod policy plan b has been the subject of controversy within the food and drug administration fda fda commissioner lester crawford on august 26 2005 said the agency is indefinitely deferring barr laboratories application for nonprescription sales of its emergency contraceptive plan b and opening 60day pu blic comment period on the application sparking charges that the decision was motivat ed by politics rather than science fda in may 2004 issued not approvable letter in response to

facility by or on behalf of military dependent who is minor andor incapable of making such decision according to dod assuming that an abortion is authorized under statute consent must be obtained before any surgical procedure is performed the requirement to obtain consent is required in military treatment facilities mtfs because the standard of care for medical practice in mtfs within the united states is governed by the federal tort claims act ftca the standard of care for obtaining consent under ftca is that the provider will follow state law governing the circumstances under which minor may consent for medical treatment in overseas facilities consent by minors for abortions is governed by dod health affairs policy dated may 9 1994 as amended by dod health affairs policy 96030 dated february 13 1996 those policies state that the host nation laws or legal requirements will apply in the absence of such host nation laws or legal requirements valid consent for minors may be obtained in either of two methods first the consent of at least one parent or guardian is provided second the commanding officer of the medical treatment facility or if the commanding officer is not physician senior physician designated by the commanding officer makes judgment upon the recommendation of the attending physician that the minor is mature enough and well enough informed to give valid consent or if she is not sufficiently mature and informed that the desired abortion would be in her best interest 56 52 fda indefinitely defers decision on emergency contraceptive plan b national

section that would terminate the policy of allowing the performance of abortions on prepaid basis at military facilities under this language this section would amend section 1093 of title 10 united states code to include restricting the department of defense from using medical treatment facilities or other dod facilities as well as dod funds to perform abortions unless necessary to save the life of the mother 57 the senate report contained similar provisions as result of numerous political differences between the house and the senate language as well as administration opposition on number of issues raising the specter of veto the authorization act stalled in conference legislators sought to have language included in the fy1996 dod appropriations act that would prohibit abortions at overseas military facilities the appropriations conference committee originally included the following language sec 8119 none of the funds made available in this act may be used to administer any policy that permits the performance of abortions at medical treatment or other facilities of the department of defense except when it is made known to the federal official having authority to obligate or expend such funds that the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term provided that the provisions of this section shall enter into force if specifically authorized in the nationa l defense authorization act for fiscal year 1996 thus the nature of this language only allowed it to take effect when and if the authorization language was enacted into law as noted at the time the authorization bill was stalled in conference and faced possible veto the failure of the authorization bill to be passed would negate any language concerning abortions in the appropriations bill on september 29 1995 prolife legislators in the house and large number of democrats opposed to the bill on policy and other spending considerations joined ranks and rejected the conference version of the fy1996 dod appropriations act 151267 thereby returning the bill to the housesenate conference 58 on november 16 1995 the conferees agreed to compromise that included the following language sec 8119 none of the funds made available in this act may be used to administer any policy that permits the performance of abortions at medical treatment or other facilities of the department of defense sec 8119a the provision of section 8119 shall not apply where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term or the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape

victimization of the child while in utero and afford appropriate criminal sanctions to perpetrators of violent acts critics view the inclusion of such language as means of defining fetus as victim and thereby acknowledging or creating separate human existence these critics are concerned that such language would arguably recognize the fetus as separate person in the eyes of the law thereby complicating the abortion debate70 in consideration of the fy2001 national defe nse authorization act hr 4205 the house armed services committee voted to retain its ban on abortions at military hospitals unless the mothers life is at risk the 3120 vote came may 10 2000 on an amendment that would have allowed abortions at overseas hospitals if patients rather than the government paid for them the 2926 vote came on failed try to allow military hospitals to perform abortions in cases of rape or incest 71 eight days later floor amendment was offered that would strike subsections and b of 10 usc 1093 effectively removing any restriction to providing abortions under this title the amendment was defeated 22119572 on june 20 2000 the senate tabled 5049 an amendment to the fy2001 national defense authorization act s 2549 that would strike section b of 10 usc 1093 the amendment would have lifted the ban on the use of military facilities in performing abortions although proponents noted that the amendment would lift restrictions on privately funded abortions at military facilities overseas as written the amendment would affect such facilities in the united states as well 73 on september 25 2001 representative loretta sanchez offered an amendment to the national defense authorization act for fy2002 this amendment would have limited the restriction on the use of dod facilities for performing abortions at those facilities in the united states in other words this language would remove the restriction of providing privately funded abortion services at dod facilities overseas the amendment was rejected 199217 74 during debate on the bob stump fy2003 national defense authorization act the senate 5240 passed an amendment that would remove the restriction on the use

twelve weeks of pregnancy are not considered prosecutable offense provided the woman has certification attesting to receiving state approved counseling to review her options the military does not allow abortions at its facilities since the us ban was lifted estimates of how many american service women or family members received abortions from german providers in 1993 are as high as 1500 although german officials say there is way to confirm this number italy national policy abortions are permitted they must be performed by licensed gynecologist local us military policy abortion services comparable to those in the united states are available from italian providers in the naples and sigonella areas service women and family members who desire abortions are referred to pre identified licensed local providers abortions are not performed at military hospitals since the us ban was lifted one elective abortion was reportedly provided in sigonella at an italian facility japan national policy abortion is legal and fairly unrestricted but more expensive than in the united states local us military policy given that abortions are readily available in the japanese community women seeking abortion from navy hospitals here are referred to familyservice counselors for referrals to japanese doctors since the us ban was lifted few if any abortions were performed at

abortion policies of foreign militaries vary these variations depend on the countrys general policy regarding abortion for instance abortion policies are affected by religion vatican israel and islamic nations for example population control policies china and other cultural factors nationalized health care policies such as are found in great britain and issues pertaining to the structure of the militarythe presence of women in uniform many islamic countries do not have women in uniform making the issue moot some countries do not have military costa rica for instance does not have military per but rather paramilitary style security force in addition internal legal restrictions or rulings such as court rulings on abortion see germany affect the countrys policy finally very few countries maintain level of overseas deployments that make direct comparisons relevant for these reasons comparisons to foreign nations in terms of their abortion policy in general and their policy regarding military abortions at overseas military medical facilities are difficult to justify and of questionable utility
