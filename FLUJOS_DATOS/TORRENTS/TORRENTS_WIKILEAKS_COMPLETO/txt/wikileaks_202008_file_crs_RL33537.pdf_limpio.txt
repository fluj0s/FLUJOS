departments hospitals clinics and medical personnel is to maintain the health of military personnel so they can carry out th eir military missions and to be prepared to deliver health care during wartime the military health system also provides health care services through either depa rtment of defense dod medical facilities known as military treatment f acilities or mtfs as space is available or through private health care providers known as tricare this system of military and private health care offers benefits to active duty pers onnel and other beneficiarie s including dependents of active duty personnel military retirees and dependents of retirees tricare beneficiaries can obtain prescription drugs through pharmacy system that includes mtf pharmacies network retail pharmacies nonnetwork retail pharmacies and the tricare mail order program tmop dependents of active duty personnel and retirees and depende nts under age 65 can choose to enroll in tricare prime managed care option or if they choose not to enroll they can obtain care through tricare standard feeforservice option or tricare extra preferredprovider option retirees who are eligible for medicare can enroll in tricare for life tfl the military health system currently in cludes some 63 hospita ls and 413 clinics serving an eligible population of 92 milli on it operates worldwide and employs some 44100 civilians and 89400 military pers onnel calculating the total cost of military medical spending is complicated by the different categories of funds involved dod statistics on total medical spending indicate growth from 175 billion in fy2000 to an estimated 416 billi on in fy2009 the latter figure includes 104 billion paid to an accrual fund for medi care eligible retirees dod projects total medical spending to grow perhaps reaching 64 billion in fy2015 as of 2007 active duty military and their pendents made up 44 of tricare beneficiaries thirtysix percent of beneficiaries were retirees under age 65 and their dependents and 20 were retirees age 65 and over and their dependents dod estimates that care provided to retirees and their dependents will make up over 65 of dod health care

war with the soviet union and its allies in europe high casualties were anticipated along with need for intheater medical treatment facilities however the collapse of the soviet union and the end of the warsaw pact led to major reassessment of us defense policy this led defense pla nners to believe the most likely conflicts will be of limited durati on and involve smaller numbers of troops in the

more recently considerations driven by the events of september 11 2001 and the resulting global ware on terrorismg wot have driven changes in dods planning the 2006 edition of the quadre nnial defense revi ew qdr focused dod on better defining its responsibilities fo r homeland defense within broader national framework including gwot count erterrorism counterinserg uency and military support for stabilization and reconstruction efforts with respect to the military health system the qdr process identified 18 initiatives across 4 focus areas 1 transform the force 2 transform the infrastructure 3 transform the business and 4 sustain the benefit7 as part of this process dod launched medical readiness review mrr in august 2004 the mrr was intended to determine the optimal size of the active duty medical force the results of the mrr led to plans for converting military health billets to civilian jobs from fy2005 to fy2007 the navy converted 2676 military positions to ci vilian positions created hiring plan for 2116 c onverted positions and hired 1349 civilian employees the army planned to convert 1588 positions in fis cal years 2006 and 2007 and the air force planned to convert 1216 military positions to civilian jobs8 these conversions have been controversial within the military services and congress has imposed limitations on these so called milci v conversions in each of the last three ndaas in addition to revisions in military planning nationwide changes in the practice of medicine have also affected dod in particular managed care initiatives and capitated budgeting that are widely adopted in the civilian community are being implemented in dods tricare program tr icare is also designed to coordinate medical care efforts of the three military departments in three geographical regions each under single military commander known as lead agent th lead agents are responsible for managing care provided by all military medical facilities in their respective regions and for contracting for additional care from civilian providers these competitivelybid regionwide contracts represent significant change in delivery of defense health care and will it is anticipated

costs are contained through administrative controls and treatment protocols in civilian practice hmos have been credited with some success in reducing costs although oppone nts of these systems complain about restrictions on provider choice and incentives that may be created to constrain the delivery of services tricare standard has been the military equivalent of health insurance plan run by dod for active duty dependents military retirees and the depe ndents of retirees survivors of deceased members and certain former spouses9 unlike private insurance plans tricare standard does not require premiums if care at military facility cannot be provide d due to space limitations limitations on the types of services that facility is capable of providing or due to the fact that beneficiary may not live close enough to military fac ility to make such travel reasonable tricare standard will share responsibility with the beneficiary for the payment of care received from nonmilitary health care provide rs subject to regulations certain types of care such as most dentistry and chiropractic services are excluded in addition to tricare standard and tri care prime there is preferredprovider option tricare extra in tricare extra beneficiaries do not enroll or pay annual premiums but use physicians and specialists in the tricare network and are charged 5 less for medical services many of the changes made in the past decade have been intended to improve medical care available to the active duty population but they have also resulted in less medical care available in military fac ilities for retired pers onnel and their dependents the introduction of tricare for life in fy2002 provided coverage for retired beneficiaries but most of their care will undoubtedly be obtained from civilian providers reimbursed by medicare and tricare the establishment of tricare for life and the current pharmaceutical benefit have contributed to significant growth in health care spending by dod the expanding costs of military healthcare r eached an estimated 416 billion in fy2009 with the majority of the spending going to provide care to individuals longer on active duty or to their family members the congressional budget office has also projected that dods medical spending w ill grow by more than 80 in real terms by 202410 7 who is eligible to receive this care current law provides that active duty pe rsonnel are entitled to receive health care at military medical facilities in addition active dut dependents military retirees and their dependents

are entitled to health care in military medical facility 10 usc 1074 according to 10 usc 1076 dependent s of active duty personnel are entitled upon request to medical and dental care on spaceavailable basis at military medical facility title 10 usc 1074 states that member or former member of the uniformed services who is entitled to retired or retain er pay may upon request be given medical and dental care in any facility of the uniformed service on spaceavailable basis this language entitles active duty dependents to medical and dental care subject to spaceavailable limitations such entitle ment or right is provided to retirees or their dependents instea d retirees and their dependent s may be given medical and dental care subject to th same spaceavailable limitations this language gives active duty personnel and their dependents priority in r eceiving medical and dental care at any facility of the uniformed services over military members entitled to receive retired pay and their dependents the policy of providing active duty dependents priority over retirees in the receipt of medical and dental care in any facility of the uniformed services has exis ted in law since at least september 2 1958 pl 85861 since the establishment of tricare and pursuant to the defense authorization act of fy1996 pl 104106 dod has estab lished the following basic priorities with certain special provisions priority 1 activeduty service members priority 2 activeduty family members who are enrolled in tricare prime priority 3 retirees their family members and survivors who are enrolled in tricare prime priority 4 activeduty family members who are not enrolled in tricare prime priority 5 all other eligible persons the priority is given to active duty pendents to help them obtain care easily and thus make it possible for active duty members to perform their military servicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33537crs12 11 see crs report rl32975 veterans medical care fy2006 appropriations by sidath viranga panangalawithout worrying about health care for th eir dependents th is is particularly important for active duty pers onnel who may be assigned ove rseas or aboard ship and separated from their depende nts as retirees are not subject to such imposed separations they are considered to be in better position to see that their dependents receive care if care cannot be provided in military facility thus the role of health care delivery recognizes the unique needs of the military mission the role of health care in the military is qualitatively different nd therefore not necessarily comparable to the civilian sector the benefits available to service members or retirees which require comparatively little or contributions from the beneficiaries themselves are considered by some to be more generous benefit package than is available to civil servants or to most people in the private sector retirees may also be eligible to receive medical care at department of veterans affairs va medical facilities11 9 what is the relationship of dod health care to medicare active duty military personnel have been fu lly covered by social security and have paid social security taxes since january 1 1957 social security coverage includes eligibility for health care covera ge under medicare at age 65 it was the legislative intent of the congress that retired members of the uniformed services and their eligible dependents be provided with medical care after they retire from the military usually between their late30s and mid40s champus was intended to supplement not to replace military hea lth care likewise congress did not intend that champus should replace medicar as supplemental benefit to military health care for this reason retirees became ineligible to receive champus benefits when at age 65 they b ecome eligible for medicare many argued that the structure was inherently unfair because retirees lost tricarechampus benefits at the stage in life when they were increasingly likely to need them it was argued that milita ry personnel had been promised free medical care for life not just until age 65 after cons iderable debate over various options for ensuring medical care to retired benefi ciaries congress in the fy2001 defense authorization act pl 106 259 provided that beginni ng october 1 2001 tricare pays outofpocket costs for services pr ovided under medicare fo r beneficiaries over age 64 if they are enrolled in medicare part b this benefit is known as tricare for life tfl disabled persons under 65 who are entitled to medicare may continue to receive champus benefits as sec ond payer to medicare parts and b with some restrictions the requirement for enrollment in medi care part b which will cost 9640 per month in 2008 for most military retirees is source of concern to some beneficiaries especially those who did not enroll in part b when they became 65 and thus must pay significant penalties some argue that this requirement is unfair since part b enrollment was not originally prerequisite for access to any dod medical care onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33537crs13 12 see crs report rs21731 medicare part b premium penalty by

turning 65 the medicare prescription drug improve ment and modernization act pl 108173 passed in december 2003 waived penalties for milita ry retirees in certain circumstances during an open season in 200412 10 have military personnel been promised free medical care for life some military personnel and former military personnel maintain that they and their dependents were promised free medical care for life at the time of their enlistment such promises may have been made by military recruiters and in recruiting brochures however if they were made they were not based upon laws or official regulations which provide only for access to military medical facilities for nonactive duty personnel if space is availa ble as described above space was not always available and tricare options could involve significant costs to beneficiaries rear admiral harold m koenig the deputy assistant secretary of defense for health affairs testified in may 1993 we have medical care program for life for our beneficiaries and it is pretty well defined in the law that easily gets interpreted to or reinterpreted into free medical care for the rest of your life that is pretty easy transition for people to make in their thinking and it is pervasive we dod spend an incredible amount of effort trying to reeducate people that that is not their benefit13 dr stephen c joseph assistant secret ary of defense for health affairs in april 1998 however argued that because re tirees believe they have had promise of free care the government did have an obligation joseph did not specify the precise extent of the
