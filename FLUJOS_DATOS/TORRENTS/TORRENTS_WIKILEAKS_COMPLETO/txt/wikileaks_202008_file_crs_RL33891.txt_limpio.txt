transportation policy resources science and industry division airport improvement program issues for congress summary the airport improvement program aip has been providing federal grants for airport development and planning since the passage of the airport and airway improvement act of 1982 pl 97248 aip funding is usually spent on projects that support aircraft operations such as runways taxiways aprons noise abatement land purchase and safety or emergency equipment the funds obligated for the aip are drawn from the airport and airway trust fund hereafter referred to as the trust fund which is supported by variety of user fees and fuel taxes the aip is one of five major sources of airport capital development funding the other sources are tax exempt bonds passenger facility charges pfcs local tax levied on each boarding passenger state and local grants and airport operating revenue different airports use different combinations of these sources depending on the individual airports financial situation and the type of project being considered small airports are more dependent on aip grants than large or mediumsized airports the larger airports whose projects tend to be much more costly are more likely to participate in the tax exempt bond market or finance capital development projects with pfc the multiyear authorization of the aip under vision 100 century of aviation reauthorization act pl 108176 ended on september 30 2007 series of shortterm extensions authorized and provided funding for aip most recently through june 30 2008 pl 110190 the program was in abeyance from january 1 2008 until the enactment of pl 110190 on february 28 2008 during this period new grants could not be awarded but faa could honor payment requests for existing grants the aip and pfc issues that have been considered during the ongoing debate regarding the reauthorization of the federal aviation administration faa include the national level of need for airport development and the appropriate aip funding level the appropriate federal role in airport development the criteria for the distribution of funding across airports of different types and sizes the sufficiency of aip discretionary funding especially for major capacity enhancing projects accommodating new system users such as the airbus a380 superjumbo jet and very light jets vljs airport privatization defederalization of large airports raising or eliminating the 450 ceiling now imposed on pfcs the use and tax treatment of airport bonds and noise mitigation funding and eligibility during the faa reauthorization debate virtually all of the policy issues and options concerning aip will be influenced by the broader budget issues of the adequacy of trust fund revenues and the availability of money for the faa from the treasury general fund should ample revenues be available the reauthorization of aip could maintain the programs structure and perhaps even increase aip spending constrainedbudget scenario would probably increase interest in such issues as defederalization or tightening of program formula funding and eligibility criteria which could provide cost savings it could also increase interest in raising or eliminating the pfc ceiling which could help airports fund more projects this report is not the crs tracking report for faa reauthorization to track proposed

provides federal grants to airports for airport development and planning the airports participating in the aip range from very large publiclyowned commercial primary airports to small public use general aviation airports that may be privatelyowned1 aip funding is usually limited to construction or improvements related to aircraft operations typically for planning and construction of projects such as runways taxiways aprons noise abatement land purchase and safety emergency or snow removal equipment commercial revenue producing portions of terminals such as shop concessions or commercial maintenance hangars automobile parking garages and road construction outside the airport boundry are examples of improvements that generally are not eligible for aip funding airports smaller than medium hub however have broader eligibility on terminal projects under certain conditions2 aip money cannot be used for an airports operational expenses3 the passenger facility charge pfc is local tax imposed with federal approval by an airport on each boarding passenger the spending of pfc program revenues is meant to complement aip grants pfc funds can be used for broader range of projects than aip grants and are more likely to be used for landside projects such as passenger terminal and ground access improvements that are 1 general aviation airports do not serve military with few air national guard exceptions or scheduled commercial service aircraft but typically do support one or more of the following businesscorporate personal instructional flying agricultural spraying air ambulances ondemand airtaxies charter aircraft see appendix b at the end of this report for airport definitions 2 primary commercial airports are categorized by the percentage of the total national passenger boardings enplanements that occur at the individual airport during year large hub airports enplane at least 1 of the national total medium hub airports enplane at least 025 but less than 1 small hub airports enplane 005 but less than 025 and nonhub airports enplane more than 10000 passengers but less than 005 of total national enplanements large and medium hub airports accounted for almost 89 of all enplanements in 2005 see appendix b at the end of this report for more detail 3 for aip eligibility criteria and prohibitions see faa aip handbook chapter 3 at httpwwwfaagovairports_airtrafficairportsresourcespublicationsordersmediaaip_ 5100_38cpdf generally all work items must be located within the airport boundary exceptions however include such items as removal of obstructions relocation of roads and utilities to allow for eligible airport development projects some environmental mitigation work and noise program projects crs2 generally not eligible for aip funding 4 pfcs can also be used for bond repayments and in some cases to provide the local match for aip projects this report discusses the airport improvement program and its complement the pfc within the broader context of airport capital development finance5 after brief history of federal support for airport construction and improvement the report describes aip funding its source of revenues funding distribution and the types of projects the program funds this is followed by review of aip legislative and policy issues that are being considered in the course of the federal aviation administration faa reauthorization debate of the 110th congress6 the multiyear authorization of the aip under vision 100 century of aviation reauthorization act pl 108176 ended on september 30 2007 series of shortterm extensions authorized and provided funding for aip most recently through june 30 2008 pl 110190 the program was in abeyance from january 1 2008 until the enactment of pl 110190 on february 28 2008 during this period new grants could not be awarded but faa could honor payment requests for existing grants this report is not the crs tracking report for faa reauthorization for an overview of proposed faa reauthorization legislation see crs report rl33920 federal aviation administration reauthorization an overview of selected provisions in proposed legislation coordinated by bart elias aip spending is supported by funding from the airport and airway trust fund hereafter referred to as the trust fund the aviation user fees and taxes that support the trust fund had been authorized through september 30 2007 in this case under provisions of the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 10534 pl 110190 discussed above also extended the taxes that support the trust fund and the trust funds expenditure authority through june 30 2008 4 the terms airside and landside are terms of art often used in discussions of airport development and planning although their meanings may vary depending on the user and context airside generally refers to parts of an airport that directly involve the arrival and departure of aircraft ie runway taxiway and ramp areas etc landside generally refers to other areas of the airport ie buildings such as terminals hangars firehouses and other facilities and infrastructure such as fuel farms roads perimeter facilities etc although most would describe aip as primarily an airside program its eligibility criteria allow for some projects that are landside as well as for noise and environmental mitigation projects which do not fit neatly into the airsidelandside distinction 5 for an overview of how airports fund their operating expenses and the sources of funding commonly used to pay for airport capital development see crs report 98579 airport finance brief overview by robert s kirk 6 for broad discussion of faa reauthorization that goes beyond aip reauthorization issues see crs report rl33698 reauthorization of the federal aviation administration background and issues for congress coordinated by bart elias crs3 background and selected legislative history7 prior to world war ii the federal government limited its role in aviation to maintaining the airway system viewing airports as local responsibility some federal monies were spent on airports during the 1930s about 150 million but only as part of federal work relief activities such as works progress administration wpa projects the national defense need for strong system of airports during world war ii led to the first major federal support for airport construction after the war the federal airport act of 1946 pl 79377 the 1946 act continued federal aid under the federal aid to airports program although at lower levels than during the war years under the 1946 act funds were appropriated annually from the general fund of the us treasury initially much of this spending supported policy of conversion of military airports to civilian use in the 1960s substantial funding also was used to upgrade and extend runways for use by commercial jets8 increasing congestion during the 1960s both in the air and on the ground at us airports was seen as evidence by some that past federal support for airports had not been sufficient to maintain adequate airport capacity9 airport and airway development and revenue acts of 1970 pl 91258 in 1970 congress responded to the congestion problems and capacity concerns at airports by passing two acts the first the airport and airway development act dealt with the spending side of federal aid to airports it established the forerunner programs of aip the airport development aid program adap and the planning grant program pgp and set forth the programs grant criteria distribution guidelines and authorization of grantinaid funding for the first five years of the program10 the second act the airport and airway revenue act of 1970 dealt with the revenue side of airport development this act established the airport and airway trust fund aatf also referred to as the aviation trust fund and in this report simply the trust fund revenues from levies on aviation users and fuel were dedicated to the fund11 since enactment of the 1970 act the trust fund has been the principal source of federal aid to airports first under adap and then under the aip starting in fy1982 7 this is summary of more detailed legislative history of federal grantsinaid to airports provided in appendix at the end of this report 8 for general discussion of the us airport system see alexander r wells airport planning management new york tab books 1992 176 9 us president 19691974 nixon problems of air transportation in america message from the president of the united states 91st cong 1st sess june 1969 washington us govt print off 1969 hdoc 91130 10 grantsinaid to airports refer to the giving of federal money that does not have to be repaid to an airport sponsor such as an airport authority to subsidize an faa approved airport project 11 see crs report rs21321 aviation taxes and fees major issues by john w fischer crs4 in 1976 the airport and airway development amendments act of 1976 pl 94353 responding to concerns over the amounts made available in appropriations bills for adap included cap and penalty provisions which placed an annual cap on spending for costs of air navigation systems and penalty that reduced these caps if airport grants were not funded each year at the airport programs authorized levels12 some form of cap and penalty mechanisms were in effect until fy1998 adap grants totaled about 41 billion from 1971 through 1980 in part because of debate over proposed defederalization provisions congress did not pass authorizing legislation for the taxes that supported the trust fund or for the funds operation during fy1981 and fy1982 which meant that the aviation trust fund lapsed during those two years although spending for airport grants continued13 airport and airway improvement act of 1982 pl 97248 the 1982 act the 1982 act created the current aip and reactivated the trust fund although the aip maintained the adaps approach of using grantsinaid as opposed to providing loans to support an integrated national system of airports it did make some significant changes in the operation of the program the program differences included altering the funding distribution among the newly defined categories of airports and extending aid eligibility to privately owned general aviation airports14 the act also required the secretary of transportation to publish national plan for the development of publicuse airports in the united states this biannual publication is called the national plan of integrated airport systems npias the npias identifies airports that are considered important to national transportation for an airport to receive aip funds it must be listed in the npias15 in reauthorizing the aviation trust fund the act also adjusted the schedule of aviation user fees 12 for detailed discussion of the history of the various cap and penalty provisions and other spending guarantees see crs report rl33654 aviation spending guarantee mechanisms by robert s kirk 13 airport aid for those years was appropriated at 450 million per year certain aviation fee revenues went into the treasurys general fund and the highway trust fund the defederalization debate centered around proposals to withdraw federal aid from major air carrier airports on the grounds that the federal government was overly involved in airport development finance and that large airports could finance any needed development themselves 14 see the discussion in appendix at the end of this report for more detail 15 federal aviation administration national plan of integrated airport systems npias 20072011 washington faa 2006 1 according to the faa 3431 including 67 proposed npias airports of the 19847 airports existing in the united states are listed in the npias unless otherwise stated the discussion in this paper refers to the npias or national system airports crs5 although the act was amended often in the 1980s and early 1990s the general structure of the program remained the same16 the wendell h ford aviation investment and reform act for the 21st century of 2000 air21 pl 106181 air21s enactment was the culmination of two years of legislative effort to pass multiyear faa reauthorization bill17 the length of the effort was reflection of the difficult issues faced major issues that had to be resolved included the budgetary treatment of the aviation trust fund raising or eliminating the ceiling on the passenger facility charge pfc and the spending amounts and their distribution rather than enacting further modifications of the cap and penalty provisions air21instead included socalled guarantee that all of each years receipts and interest credited to the trust fund will be made available annually for aviation purposes the guarantee is enforced by changes made in house and senate pointof order rules one rule makes it outoforder to consider legislation that does not spend all trust fund revenues for aviation purposes the second rule makes it outoforder to consider legislation for funding faas operations and maintenance om or research engineering and development red budgets if aip and the facilities and equipment fe budgets are funded below authorized levels as is discussed later in this report the funding guarantees have not been enforced in recent years because pointsoforder have either been waived by the house rules committee or have not been raised by members on the floor of the house or senate air21 did not however make any major changes in the overall structure or functioning of aip it did make major change in the amount of money made available for airport development projects from funding level of approximately 19 billion for fy2000 aips authorization increased funding by nearly 70 to 32 billion for fy2001 then to 33 billion for fy2002 and to 34 billion for fy2003 the bill also made changes in funding distribution to facilitate the larger amounts authorized the formula funding and minimums for primary airports were doubled starting in fy2001 the state apportionment for general aviation airports was increased from 185 to 20 the noise setaside was increased from 31 to 34 of discretionary funding and reliever airport discretionary setaside of 066 was established18 16 authority to collect taxes for the trust fund expired on january 1 1996 and the trust fund received revenues for nearly eight months until it was extended to the end of the calendar year tax authority then expired for another two months spending from the trust fund continued during these lapses however 17 during the debate aip underwent four separate authorization extensions pl 105227 extended aip through march 31 1999 pl 1066 through may 31 1999 pl 10631 through august 6 1999 and finally pl 10659 through september 30 1999 the aip was held in abeyance from october 1 1999 until air21 was enacted on april 5 2000 see crs report rs21621 surface transportation and aviation extension legislation historical perspective by john w fischer and robert s kirk 18 an increase in aip funding of the size of the air21 increase faces number of obstacles continued crs6 air21 also increased the pfc maximum to 450 per boarding passenger in return for imposing pfc above the 3 level large and medium hub airports would give back or forgo 75 of their aip formula funds this made more aip funding available to the smaller airports vision 100 century of aviation reauthorization act of 2003 pl 108176 hrept 108334 vision 100 the faa reauthorization act signed by president george w bush on december 12 2003 included some changes to aip but not on the scale of the changes made under air21 both the funding increase and the programmatic changes were modest by comparison vision 100 funded aip for four years at the following annual levels 34 billion for fy2004 35 billion for fy2005 36 billion for fy2006 and 37 billion for fy2007 the law extended the air21 spending guarantees through fy2007 sources of project funding for airports the aip is one of five major sources of funding for airport development and improvement19 airports also fund capital projects using taxexempt bonds passenger facility charges pfcs local tax levied on each boarding passenger state and local grants and airport revenue20 different airports use different combinations of these sources depending on the individual airports financial situation and the type of project being considered small airports are more likely to be dependent on aip grants than large or mediumsized airports the larger airports are also much more likely to participate in the taxexempt bond market or finance capital development projects with the proceeds generated from pfcs each of these funding sources places differing legislative regulatory or contractual constraints on airports that use them bonds aip and pfcs are the primary sources of funding for airport capital projects based on 19992001 data the us general accounting office now the government accountability office gao found in 2003 that the airport system received an average of 12 billion per year from all sources for capital development of this amount bonds accounted for 59 aip for 21 pfcs for 13 state and local contributions for 4 and airport revenue for 421 the average amounts made 18 continued in the 110th congress that are discussed later in this report including deficit reduction efforts enforcement of payasyougo rules and the spending of limited available funds on other initiatives such as air traffic control modernization 19 for more see crs report 98579 airport finance brief overview by robert s kirk 20 airport revenue sources include airfield area feeslanding fees terminal area concessions and rent airline leases parking etc pfcs are sometimes referred to as head tax 21 general accounting office gao now the government accountability office airport finance past funding levels may not be sufficient to cover airports planned capital continued crs7 available for aip and the average annual pfc collections have been significantly higher since fy2001 because of the air21 increase in aip funding and the raised pfc ceiling so the aip and pfc percentages of total capital spending are probably now higher than was the case in date range covered in the gao study22 bonds however doubtless remain the largest source of funding for airport capital projects23 of the 3364 airports in the national airport system all but 113 are public sector enterprises that usually operate under city county or state department or specially contrived organization such as an airport or port authority generally airports can do little to influence their financial relationship to their governmental sponsors on the other hand airports that handle commercial service aircraft are able to negotiate the terms and conditions of their agreements with their major users and creditors the source of airport development funds sets the different limitations and obligations that influence how project money can be raised and spent the availability and conditions of one source of funding may also influence the availability and terms of other sources of funding the two financing sources for airports with the most significant federal involvement are the aip and pfc programs as mentioned above the dependence on aip to pay for capital needs varies greatly according to airport size categories with the smaller airports being more dependent on aip funding24 large and mediumhub airports finance much of their capital expenditures by using bonding and pfcs and rely on aip for only 16 and 29 respectively of their total capital spending for smallhub airports the dependence on aip grants rises to 51 for nonhub commercial service airports aip dependence rises to 89 and for other nonhub airports to 9425 airport improvement program aip the aip provides federal grants to airports for airport development and planning the airports participating in the aip range from very large publiclyowned primary commercial service airports to small public use general aviation airports that may be privatelyowned but are required under aip to be available for public use as mentioned earlier aip funding is usually limited to construction or improvements 21 continued development washington gao gao03497t 2003 7 22 the 20072011 npias estimates that aip and pfcs together account for about 40 of capital spending needs 23 because pfcs are often used to make debt payments this use reduces the total of pfc revenues used to directly pay for airport projects this means that the amounts actually available for airport projects will be somewhat less that the grand total of aip pfcs bonds local grants and airport revenues dedicated to capital improvements 24 see appendix b for airport definitions 25 based on fy2003 data see faa airports data package for stakeholders available at httpwwwfaagovaboutoffice_orgheadquarters_officesaepaatfmediaairports20 data20packagepdf crs8 related to aircraft operations such as runways and taxiways commercial revenue producing facilities are generally not eligible for aip funding nor are operational costs26 the structure of aip funds distribution reflects legislatively set national priorities and objectives of assuring airport safety and security stimulating capacity building reducing congestion helping fund noise and environmental mitigation costs and financing small state and community airports there is less federal involvement in the four other sources of airport development funds the main financial advantage of aip to airports is that as grant program it can provide funds for known range of capital projects without the financial burden placed on airports by bond or other debt financing limitations on the use of aip grants include the range of projects that aip can fund and the requirement that airports adhere to all program regulations and grant assurances this section begins with brief discussion of the source of the money that is used to pay for aip grants the airport and airway trust fund aatf aviation trust fund hereafter simply referred to as the trust fund followed by description of the aips system of project grant distribution the section then describes aip funding in terms of what types of projects the grants are spent on and examines grant distribution by airport size finally it discusses aips complement the pfc program the airport and airway trust fund modeled on the highway trust fund this trust fund was designed to assure an adequate and consistent source of funds for federal airport and airway programs27 the trust fund is also the primary funding source for most faa activities in addition to federal grants for airports these include facilities and equipment fe research engineering and development red and faa operations and maintenance om om also however receives some funding from the treasury general fund air traffic system capital maintenance and improvement falls primarily under the fe category under the 1970 act the trust fund was to have been both capital account and when excess funds existed userpay system to help support faas administrative and operations costs28 26 for detailed guidance on allowable costs see chapter 3 of the aip handbook at httpwwwfaagovairports_airtrafficairportsresourcespublicationsordersmediaaip_ 5100_38cpdf 27 although the airway and airport trust fund was modeled after the highway trust fund there are differences in the way funds are distributed one major difference is that highway spending is funneled through the states whereas most airport development funds go directly to airports 28 see government accounting office congressional intent whether or not the airport and airway trust fund was created solely to finance aviation infrastructure b 281779 washington gao 1999 16 p for another discussion of congressional intent regarding the debate over the use of aviation trust fund revenues for both airport and airway infrastructure as well as spending on faa operations see also congressional budget office the status of the airport and airway trust fund washington cbo 1988 118 crs9 the money that goes into the aviation trust fund comes from variety of aviation user fees and fuel taxes29 as mentioned earlier these tax revenues were authorized until september 30 2007 by the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 105 34 the authority for these taxes has been extended through june 30 2008 revenue sources current rate as of january 1 2008 include 75 ticket tax 350 flight segment tax30 625 tax on cargo waybills 43 cents on commercial aviation fuel 193 cents on general aviation gasoline 218 cents on general aviation jet fuel 1540 international arrival tax31 1540 international departure tax 75 frequent flyer award tax32 75 ticket tax at rural airports33 over much of the life of the trust fund these revenues plus interest on the trust funds unexpended balances often brought more revenue into the fund than was being paid out this led to the growth in the endofyear unexpended balance in the trust fund there are outstanding commitments against these unexpended balances so not all of the unexpended balance would actually be available in any given year nonetheless these unexpended balances somewhat inaccurately referred to by some as surplus have been large enough at times during the history of the aviation trust fund to make their existence controversial the scenario of an unexpended trust fund balance that grows substantially larger each year ended in fy2001 most observers believe the drop in demand for air travel that began during 2001 due at first to recessionary economy and later to potential fear of flying following the september 11 attacks significantly reduced the revenues flowing to the trust fund in addition air21established mechanism to ensure that all trust fund receipts would be committed to spending on aviation each 29 us internal revenue code sec 40414081 4091 426142634271

airport ticket tax they do not pay the segment tax on the segment to or from the rural airport and do not pay the general ticket tax in addition to the rural airport ticket tax crs10 year the forecast levels of receipts were drawn from the presidents budget baseline projection for each year for fy2002 through fy2005 actual trust fund revenues fell below the forecast revenues consequently this meant that more money was being committed than was being collected in revenues and the difference was drawn from the trust funds uncommitted balance the uncommitted balance in the aviation trust fund fell from 73 billion at the end of fy2001 to 19 billion at the end of fy2005 the us government accountability office gao projects that under vision 100 spending levels the uncommitted balance will fall to 17 billion in fy200734 although it appears that the uncommitted balance will remain positive through fy2007 it is important to keep in mind that the taxes that provide revenue to the trust fund will lapse unless reauthorized by the end of fy2007 historically achieving agreement on the authorization of aviation taxes has been difficult the authority to collect aviation taxes lapsed for significant periods in 1980 and 1996 at the times of these lapses there existed in the trust fund large accumulated unobligated balances which permitted the funding of aip and other faa programs to continue in spite of the absence of new tax revenue it appears that this will not be the case after september 30 2007 based on gaos projections the trust funds uncommitted balance would not be sufficient to fund faa programs including aip for long in the event that the aviation taxes are allowed to lapse the adequacy of trust fund revenue under the current tax regime for the years ahead has recently also been an issue of significant debate35 the basic question is whether the current revenue streams from the existing tax sources at their existing rates will be adequate to fund faa programs and activities without the trust fund going into deficit before or during the next authorization cycle the expected availability of trust fund revenues could influence whether the transportation authorizing committees in congress recommend modest significant or growth in aip funding in their legislative proposals both the faa and the department of the treasury projections indicate that any increases in revenues flowing into the trust fund will be modest36 the congressional budget office cbo has produced an estimate that is somewhat more positive about future revenues37 the aircraft owners and pilots association aopa has also produced revenue forecasts that 34 government accountability office federal aviation administration an analysis of the financial viability of the airport and airway trust fund gao06562t washington gao 2006 15 p gao also estimated that if revenues were 5 less than projected the uncommitted balance would fall to 595 million in fy2007 and to 0 if revenues were 10 less

testimony before the house committee on transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on aviation september 27 2006 crs11 suggest that the trust fund will have adequate revenues well into the

spending were active during fy2001fy2006 aip was funded near its fully authorized levels the difference between the authorized levels and the yearly amounts made available narrowed significantly in comparison to the previous eight years the remaining shortfalls mostly reflected the impact on aip of governmentwide acrosstheboard rescissions and of some administrative and minor programmatic funding transfers that were included in the annual appropriations bills 39 in some years the annual aip obligation limitation has supported some other uses this reduced the amounts made available for aip below the obligation limitation in some years crs13 vision 100 as mentioned earlier continued the spending guarantees included in air21 through fy2007 during the years the guarantees were in effect fy2001 fy2007 appropriators initially provided funding at the authorized level but then reduced the amounts provided by the imposition of acrosstheboard rescissions technically the failure of the amount made available to achieve the authorized level should have made these spending levels subject to the spending guarantees point of order provisions in recent years however all points of order on appropriations bills have been waived by the rules committee in the house or have not been raised on the floor of the house and senate this as well as the recent failure to fully fund the fe

however only authorized through june 30 2008 aip funding distribution the distribution system for aip grants is complex it is based on combination of formula grants also referred to as apportionments or entitlements and discretionary funds41 each year the entitlements are first apportioned by formula to specific airports or types of airports including primary airports cargo service airports states and insular areas and alaska airports the remaining funds are defined as discretionary funds discretionary funds are applied for by airports to pay for planned airport capital development needs in recent years however significant amounts of aip discretionary funding have been earmarked by congress42 formula grants and discretionary funds are not mutually exclusive in the sense that airports receiving formula funds may also apply for and receive discretionary funds airport legislation sets forth definitions of airports by type that are relevant both in discussions of the airport system in general and aip funding distribution in particular because the statutory provisions for the allocation of both formula and discretionary funds depend on some of these definitions these definitions are set forth in appendix b at the end of this report formula and discretionary funds formula funds sometimes referred to as apportionments or entitlements these funds are apportioned by formula or percentage formula funds may generally be used for any eligible airport or planning project formula funds are divided into four categories primary airports cargo service airports general aviation airports and alaska supplemental funds see appendix b for airport definitions each category 40 see crs report rl33654 aviation spending guarantee mechanisms by robert s kirk 41 see usc 49 chapter 471

funds by different formula most airports have up to three years to use their apportionments nonhub commercial service airports the smallest of the primary airports have up to four years the formula changes implemented in air21 and in some cases modified in vision 100 are contingent on an aip funding level of 32 billion or more if this threshold is not met most formulas revert to prior authorized funding levels for instance in the case of the primary airport entitlement the vision 100 authorized doubling of the formula amounts would not take place primary airports the apportionment for primary airports is based on the number of passenger boardings made at the airport during the prior calendar year the amount apportioned for each fiscal year is equal to double the amount that would be received according to the following formulas 780 for each of the first 50000 passenger boardings 520 for each of the next 50000 passenger boardings 260 for each of the next 400000 passenger boardings 065 for each of the next 500000 passenger boardings and 050 for each passenger boarding in excess of 1 million the minimum formula allocation is 1 million the maximum is 26 million new airports receive the minimum for their first fiscal year of operation virtual primary airports vision 100 included special rule for certain airports that longer meet the requirement of 10000 enplanements to be categorized as primary airports but had met the requirement in calendar years 2000 or 200143 the act allowed these airports to continue to receive their full entitlement ie of formula funds usually the 1 million primary airport minimum for fy2004 and fy2005 the entitlement would otherwise have dropped to 150000 in most cases the fy2006 transportationtreasury appropriations act pl109115 extended the virtual primary airport eligibility through fy2006 but at reduced entitlement of 500000 the explanatory language in the conference report expresses the conferees intent that fy2006 be the last year for virtual primary airport entitlements accordingly the fy2007 continuing resolution hjres 20 did not extend the virtual primary funding distribution in effect eliminating the virtual primary distribution category paying the higher entitlements to the virtual primary airports reduces the amount of funding available for discretionary spending cargo service airports 35 of aip funds subject to apportionment are apportioned to cargo service airports the allocation formula is the proportion of the individual airports landed weight to the total landed weight at all cargo service airports stateinsular areas 20 of aip funds are to be apportioned to general aviation reliever and nonprimary commercial service airports from this share all airports excluding all nonreliever primary airports

integrated airport systems npias to maximum of 200000 per year any remaining funds are distributed according to statebased population and area formula44 the faa makes the project decisions on the use of these funds in consultation with the states although faa has ultimate control of the use of these remainder funds some states view these funds as an opportunity to address some general aviation needs from statewide rather than local or national perspective45 alaska supplemental funds funds are apportioned to alaska to assure that alaskan airports receive at least twice as much funding as they did under the adap in 1980 foregone apportionments large and medium hub airports that collect passenger facility charge of 3 or less have their aip formula entitlements reduced by an amount equal to 50 of their projected pfc revenue for the fiscal year until they have foregone sometimes referred to as give back 50 of their aip formula grants in the case of fee above the 3 level the percentage foregone is 75 the implementation of the reduction is not imposed until the first fiscal year following the calendar year in which the pfc is first imposed special small airport fund which provides grants on discretionary basis to airports smaller than medium hub gets 875 of these foregone funds the discretionary fund gets the remaining 125 discretionary funding the discretionary fund 49 usc sec

exemptions under 49 us sec 47134 the pilot program for private ownership of airports vision 100 included sunset clause that returns the federal share of the projects eligible for 95 share to 90 after fy2007 the increase in share to 95 was established to provide relief to operators of small airports after the 911 terrorist attacks the airports themselves must raise the remaining share from other sources unlike federal aid to highways aip grants generally go directly to airports rather than through the states this federal share regime means that smaller airports do not pay as high percentage of aip eligible funded project costs as large and medium airports do some argue that the high federal share for small airports may be factor in the low level of participation by small airports in the bond market ie why borrow when federal aip grants may eventually be available at 95 federal share distribution of aip grants by airport size the appropriateness of the distribution of grants among airports of different sizes has at times been source of debate although smaller airports individual grants are of much smaller dollar amounts than the grants going to large and medium hub airports the smaller airports are much more dependent on aip to meet their capital needs in fy2006 of the 2059 grants issued by the faa 196 95 of the grants representing by value 326 of aip grant amounts financed projects at large and mediumhub airports for the same fiscal year small airports were awarded 1805 grants or 877 of the total individual airport grants awarded by dollar value these small airport grants accounted for 651 of the total dollar value of aip grants for fy200650 the fy2006 percent value of aip grants awarded broken out by airport size is displayed in figure 3 the chart displays the percentage aggregates of all aip funds derived from all categories of both formula and discretionary funds depending on how the chart is viewed it could either support or refute the contention that aip funding distribution favors large airports although the large hub primary airports got the highest percentage 207 of the total funds awarded the smaller of the primary airports the primary non hub airports and the small hub airports also received substantial percentages of the total aip funds awarded 188 and 139 respectively if one counts only the large and medium hub airports as major airports and all the others as small airports one could argue that only 326 of grant awards went to major airports on the other hand general aviation advocates could point out that primary airports as group were awarded 653 of aip grants amounts51 50 source faa airports branch data by value an additional 28 of aip grants were provided for airport system planning composed of 58 grants or 23 of all grants

for the funds to become available the faa is authorized to issue letter of intent loi53 under the loi program primary or reliever airport sponsor may notify the faa of their intent to carry out an aip eligible airport development project in advance of federal funding and request that the faa issue an loi for the project if the faa agrees it issues letter the loi stating that the eligible project costs up to the allowable federal share will be reimbursed according to schedule set forth in the letter although the loi is technically not an obligation of the federal government to pay it is an indication of the faas approval of the scope and timing of the project as well as the federal intent to fund the project in future years because most primary airports fund their major development projects with taxexempt revenue bonds the evidence of federal support that the loi provides is likely to lead to favorable bond rates in financing the project54 with an loi the airport may proceed with the project both without waiting for the aip grants to become available and with the assurance that all aip allowable costs in the loi will remain eligible for reimbursement over the life of the loi both entitlement and discretionary funds are used to fulfill lois the faa limits the total of discretionary funds in all lois subject to future obligation to roughly 50 of forecast available discretionary funds lois have certain eligibility restrictions they can only be issued to cover projects at primary and reliever airports the proposed airport development project or action must

voluntary airport low emissions vale grants vision 100 directed the faa to establish national program to reduce airport ground emissions at commercial service airports located in air quality nonattainment and maintenance areas currently roughly 160 airports can participate the voluntary airport low emissions vale program allows airport sponsors to use airport improvement program aip grants and passenger facility charge pfc funds to help finance the purchase of low emissions vehicles refueling and recharging stations gate electrification and other airport air quality improvements56 vale is restricted to financing capital improvements and cannot pay for operations or maintenance costs such as fuel purchases the range of vale uses for pfc funding is broader than those allowable under aip for example aip funds are limited to vehicles and infrastructure for alternative fuel use as defined by the department of energy whereas the pfc program allows for use of clean conventional fuels significantly vale program funding is restricted to the incremental cost differential between the higher priced lowemission vehicle and the lower price of conventional fuel vehicle retaining changing or eliminating these restrictions or eligibility criteria could be considered during reauthorization aip grant assurances airports grant applications are conditioned on assurances regarding future airport operations examples of such assurances include making the airport available for public use on reasonable conditions and without unjust discrimination charging air carriers making similar use of the airport substantially comparable charges maintaining current airport layout plan making financial reports to the faa and expending airport revenue only on capital or operating costs at the airport57 within the aip context assurances are an important means of guaranteeing the implementation of federal policy when airport managers or interest groups express concerns about federal regulation and the strings attached to aip funding they are usually referring to aip grant assurances 55 aip handbook chapter 10 section 8 56 according to the faa gate electrification is the aircraft equivalent of vehicle idle reduction it provides for air conditioning and electricity for an aircraft parked at the gate 57 49 usc sec 47107 the layout plan must be approved by the secretary of dot as must any revision or modification of the plan this in effect generally means that any aip project must be written into the airports plan the nondiscrimination provision protects wide variety of users including for example nighttime users and cargo carriers crs22 passenger facility charges pfcs during the late 1960s number of airports began collecting local head tax the precursor of the pfc on each paying passenger boarding an aircraft58 although the legality of the head tax was affirmed by the supreme court in evansville vanderburgh airport authority v delta airlines there was severe criticism of the passenger charges by both airlines and passengers the complaints included administrative problems for the airlines collecting the charge passenger inconvenience especially when the passengers had to make payments separately at the airport and the use of head tax revenue for offairport projects and projects not aviation related59 in 1973 the airport development acceleration act pl 9344 banned the imposition of state and local passenger charges in 1990 expected tight budgets resulting from federal deficit concerns led to reconsideration of head taxes concerns that the aviation trust fund and other existing sources of funds for airport development would be insufficient to meet national airport needs led to the legislation that developed the passenger facility charge pfc the pfc was seen as being complementary to aip funding the aviation safety and capacity expansion act of 1990 pl 101508 allowed the secretary of transportation to authorize public agencies that control commercial airports to impose passenger facility fee of 1 2 or 3 on each paying passenger boarding an aircraft at their airports the money was to be used to finance eligible airportrelated projects and unlike aip funds could be used to make payments for debt service or indebtedness incurred to carry out the projects60 there was 3 cap on each airports pfc and there was 12 limit on the total pfcs that passenger could be charged per roundtrip large and medium hub airports had their aip apportionments reduced by 50 of their projected pfc revenues until they had forgone 50 of their apportionments as mentioned earlier 875 of these forgone entitlement funds are credited to the small airport fund and the discretionary fund is credited the remaining 12561 although the faa oversees the pfc program the agency does not impose the fee the pfc is state local or port authority fee not federally imposed tax because of the complementary relationship between aip and pfcs pfc legislation is generally folded into the aip provisions of faa reauthorization legislation the legislative origin of the pfc itself is title ix of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 pl 101508 58 the head tax was similar but not exactly the same as pfc there were limits on how the head tax could be spent head taxes and similar devices are common outside the united states 59 house committee on public works and transportation subcommittee on aviation passenger facility charges hearing 101st cong 2nd sess june 19 1990 vvi 60 49 usc sec 40117 61 the airport capacity funding advisory committee which had recommended many of the pfc characteristics including that of forgone entitlements recommended that small hub and nonhub airports should not be required to forgo any aip entitlement funds the committee also recommended that the forgone funds should all be shifted to the discretionary fund and allocated proportionally across all categories of the discretionary category crs23 air21 increased the pfc ceiling to 450 to impose pfc above the 3 level an airport has to show that the funded projects will make significant improvements in air safety increase competition reduce congestion or noise impacts on communities and that these projects could not be funded by using the airports aip formula funds or through aip discretionary grants large and medium hub airports imposing pfcs above the 3 level forego 75 of their aip formula funds beginning in fy2001 pfcs at large and medium hub airports could not be approved unless they had submitted written competition plan to the faa the competition plans include information such as the availability of gates leasing arrangements gateuse requirements patterns of air service controls over air and groundside capacity intentions to build gates that could be used as common facilities and airfare levels compared to other large airports the airports council internationalnorth america acina favors the elimination of the competition plan requirement the competition plan provision however was supported by members of congress who wanted to assure that the major airports be available on reasonable basis to all air carriers wishing to serve those airports62 vision 100 included number of relatively minor changes to the pfc program the act included provisions to streamline pfc public notice requirements as well as to end the significant contribution project requirement on large and medium hub airports that wish to impose pfcs at the 4 and 450 level as of december 1 2006 48 large and mediumhub airports and 215 smaller airports had been approved to collect pfcs at the 450 level the requirement of notice and consultation of air carriers at applicant airports was limited to carriers having less than 1 of the boardings at the airport having 25000 or more boardings or airports providing scheduled service vision 100 also established pilot program to test alternative procedures for authorizing small airports to impose pfcs it made conversion of ground support equipment to low emission technology eligible for pfc funds the secretary of transportation was also empowered to allow the use of pfcs for debt service on what would normally be noneligible nonairport related projects if the secretary finds that such project funding is necessary due to an airports financial need the act requires that airlines filing for bankruptcy must place pfc collections in segregated account to prevent their loss as airport revenue vision 100 required dot to publish in the federal register its policy under current law on the eligibility of airport ground access projects for pfc funding airports have used pfc revenues for broad range of purposes unlike aip grants of which 644 since 1992 have gone to airside projects runways taxiways aprons and safety related projects pfc revenues have been increasingly used for landside and interest payments purposes 154 of approved pfcs have been

broader interpretation of capacity enhancing and the implementing regulations are less constraining than those for aip funds also the airlines who historically have preferred funding be dedicated to airside projects only have to be notified and provided with an opportunity for consultation about pfc funding requests and are therefore somewhat less involved in the pfc project planning and decisionmaking process than with aip projects the difference in the pattern of project types may also be influenced by the difference in project spending patterns between the larger airports that collect most of the pfc revenue and have more substantial landside infrastructure versus the smaller airports that are much more dependent on aip funding and have comparatively limited land side facilities in recent years pfc approvals have most often been for interest on bonds and for landside projects as of march 31 2008 pfcs approved were 32 for interest on bonds 37 for landside primarily terminal projects 7 for access mostly roads 19 for airside projects and 5 for noise projects according to the faa as of the end of march 31 2008 the agency had approved 619 billion in pfc collections at total of 372 locations over the life of the program64 large and mediumhub airports are the most likely to impose pfc with 97 collecting pfcs small hub and nonhub primary airports participate at rates of 92 and 79 respectively only 25 of nonprimary commercial airports participate small airports often do not have high enough ticketed passenger volume to provide sufficient revenue surplus over

the main source of federal grants for airport security capital projects in the years preceding the 911 terrorist attacks however security projects only amounted to about 2 of aips total project spending in fy2002 following the 911 terrorist attacks the spending of aip funds for security projects expanded to 17 of the amounts made available for aip grants for that year 561 million of the 32 billion of amounts made available as the aip funding of security projects grew there was proportional decline of aip resources dedicated to nonsecurity projects there were concerns among aip supporters that the programs traditional priorities of enhancing capacity safety and noise mitigation were in danger of being underfunded66 vision 100 made two major changes regarding the funding of airport security projects first the act included provision that repealed the language of the federal aviation reauthorization act of 1996 pl 104264 that permitted the use of aip and pfc funds for securityrelated improvement of facilities and the purchase or deployment of equipment for security purposes second vision 100 established the aviation security capital fund to fund airport security related projects together these provisions were expected to relieve the aip of the demands on its funds for most security projects the aviation security fee revenues credited to the fund however have been insufficient to fully fund security costs67 consequently despite the vision 100 prohibition some still view aip as potential source of funding for certain securityrelated airport improvements in the future the use of aip grants for security purposes could reemerge as an issue during faa reauthorization68 65 for pfc collections by year see httpwwwfaagovairports_airtrafficairportspfc

level among the airport interests the airlines general aviation interests the military or within congress that strong national network of airports is in the national interest however views of how to best support the national airport system can vary greatly from group to group depending on the issues involved related issue is the appropriate degree of federal participation in airport development and finance by statute the safe operation of airports is the highest aviation priority other priorities include increasing capacity to the maximum feasible extent minimizing noise impacts and encouraging efficient service to state and local communities ie support for general aviation airports these priorities along with the assessment of airport capital needs and the availability of budgetary resources for aip all influence the scope and structure of the program during the faa reauthorization debate in the 110th congress virtually all of the policy issues and options concerning aip will be influenced by the broader budget issues of the adequacy of aviation trust fund revenues and the availability of money from the treasury general fund if aip funding is increased significantly the program may well remain basically as it is if aips funding is reduced the funding formulas and project eligibility requirements might be altered to assure that the aips statutory priorities can still be met at the lower funding levels because this report is about an existing program the analysis of the program necessarily discusses the existing programmatic structure and the historical funding levels of the periods being discussed advocates of aip view the fully authorized funding of the program as good thing over time however there has also been an alternative view that too much was being spent on aip particularly at smaller airports that do not play significant role in commercial aviation these critics often view the breadth of aip spending decreasing local share requirements and ever widening project eligibilities as allowing for spending that is increasingly inefficient unfocused and of questionable federal purpose airport capital needs assessments the debate over the scope of airport capital needs is of concern to congress because reliable assessment of needs can help facilitate determining the appropriate federal support needed to foster safe and efficient national airport system70 the federal governments interest in the needs debate is broader than just dealing with capacity constrained airports it also deals with implementing federal safety and noise policies 69 see crs report rl33698 reauthorization of the federal aviation administration background and issues for congress coordinated by bart elias which includes summary of aip issues for congress 70 see faa npias 20072011 crs27 views on the scope of airport capital needs vary among airport stakeholders historically air carriers preferred that federally supported capital projects be restricted mostly to airside capacity enhancing projects71 airports generally view their capital needs within the context of the business needs of the airports operations as whole ie airside landside as well as some offairport access projects the faa view is from within the more limited context of the npias the national plan that is used by faa management to administer the aip and therefore is focused more narrowly on aip eligibility as the primary criterion for making its capital needs assessments both the faa and the airports council internationalnorth america acina have projected different longterm airport financial needs in the most recent npias report the faa has estimated that the national systems capital needs for 20072011 will total 412 billion an annual average of 824 billion72 the acina capital needs survey resulted in an estimate of 874 billion for 20072011 an annual average of 174 billion73 the studies differing conclusions are the result of number of factors including difference in collections periods and an inflation adjustment in the aci na study although these differences may somewhat limit the comparability of the two estimates the main reason for the widely differing estimates is the differing views on what kinds of airport projects were appropriate to include in the estimates the npias report was based on planned project information taken from airport master plans and state system plans faa planners screened out projects that were not justified by aviation activity forecasts or that were not eligible for aip grants only designated npias airports were included in the study implicit in this methodology is that the planning has been carried through to the point where financing is identified not all projects used to develop the npias estimates are actually completed however economic conditions the financial conditions in the aviation industry constraints on federal funding and on projectbyproject basis legal challenges can prevent the completion of some projects or delay them beyond the range of years covered in the npias estimates some observers argue that the 71 as of this writing the air transport association which represents the major air carriers has not done an estimate of airport capital needs for the upcoming 2007 faa reauthorization debate however during the 1996 reauthorization debate the airlines estimated the annual airport capital needs at 4 billion this was significantly less than the faa estimate of 65 billion and much less than the airport estimate of 10 billion per year gao study concluded that the widely differing estimates were primarily result of different views on what kinds of projects and airports to include in the estimates see gao airport development needs estimating future costs april 1997 gaorecd9799 38 p 72 the five year total is 17 billion higher than the estimate in the previous npias 2001 2005 73 airports council international airport capital development costs 20072011 httpwwwacinaorgstaticentransitairport20capital20development20costspdf crs28 npias under estimates aip eligible needs because not all such needs will be in the current airport plans74 the acina study reflects the broader business view of major airport operators and casts substantially broader net including nonaip funded projects funded by pfcs bonds or statelocal funding airportfunded air traffic control facilities airport or tsa funded security projects necessary aipineligible projects such as parking facilities hangars revenue portions of terminals offairport roadstransit facilities and aipeligible projects not reported to faa in the belief that there would be low probability of receiving additional aip funding75 because the 174 billion is based on proposals for airport development projects some would argue that this figure is high because it reflects wants rather than needs and includes projects that may never be completed views of the adequacy of funding availability the acina and the faa also disagree on the adequacy of funding the 20072011 npias report finds that recently together aip grants and pfc collections account for about 40 percent of annual us airport capital spending needs historically the combined resources have been adequate to achieve needed development76 the amount made available for fy2007 for aip was 3515 billion this would be 42 of the 824 billion average annual needs estimated in the 20072011 npias calculating this funding level against the average annual acina derived level of 175 billion produces percentage of 20 of all funding sources should all needs be met it is important to keep in mind that aip is only one source of funding for airport capital projects airport bonds are the largest source of funds for airport capital needs often totaling more than aip and pfc awards combined77 the estimates are important because the primary aip reauthorization issue is the programs appropriate level of funding because the acina airport needs projection includes much that is not eligible for aip grants its accuracy may not be as critical to policy makers considering aip funding as the npias projections on the other hand the broader acina estimate may be more significant to bonding and pfc policies since these sources fund broader range of projects than aip 74 in the dept of

needs at the 35 busiest airports78 in march 2004 faa administrator marion c blakey stated that the agencys goal was to improve the overall capacity at the top 35 us airports by 30 over ten year period these airports account for about 73 of commercial passenger boardings the faas operational evolution plan oep recently also referred to as the operational evolution partnership is intended to increase the capacity and efficiency of the national airspace system nas over tenyear period to keep up with the expected growth in demand for air travel and air cargo the plan focuses on infrastructure primarily new runways and technological and procedural initiatives at the top 35 airports79 the focus on runways is based on estimates from 2004 airport capacity benchmark report data that the 12 oep airports planning new runways would achieve an average capacity increase of 31 this would be much larger improvement than the expectation that technology enhancements could net of 3 to 880 the june 2004 faa study of airport capacity capacity needs in the national airspace system an analysis of airport and metropolitan area demand and operational capacity in the future first examined which of the 35 oep airports would and would not be able to meet future demand and then examined whether other areas of the united states might be unable to accommodate the demand for air transportation in the future the study examined airports that would need capacity increases mostly new or reconfigured runways from base year of 2003 and also projected which airports would need capacity increases in 2013 and 2020 it identified five airports plus the atlanta metropolitan area that needed additional capacity in 2003 the study projected that assuming that planned oep improvements for 20032013 were completed capacity improvements would be needed at 15 airports for 2013 for the year 2020 assuming implementation of runway construction project not included in the oep as well as improvements in technologies and procedures an ambitious assumption the study notes the study still identifies 18 airports as likely needing additional capacity some not currently part of the oep81 interestingly the airports identified for 2013 and especially for 2020 show increased needs at some medium hub airports that are considered secondary to large hub airports in major metropolitan airports part of this trend may be that some major metropolitan airports are approaching the point that they may have limited room to add new runway capacity but could also result from the expansion of secondary metropolitan area airports that have found favor with low cost air carriers 78 for broad discussion of aviation congestion issues see crs report rl32707 avoiding gridlock in the skies issues and

system ix crs30 in recent years this also could reflect shift to more pointtopoint service and somewhat diminished reliance on the hubandspoke model by the legacy carriers82 if valid the study has implications for aip within the context of reauthorization to begin with although the life cycles of faa authorization bills are usually only for two to four years large runway projects that are the focus of the oep can require long lead times 10 or more years from concept to initial construction is not unusual because of this some costs from projects needed by 2013 and even 2020 may need to be funded in the next few years at large and medium hub airports runway projects are usually paid for in part by aip funds there is 75 maximum participation at large airports the participation however is generally significantly below this maximum these funds are generally used in combination with other sources of funding such as pfcs taxfree airport bonds often paid for using pfc revenues airport revenues and sometimes state funds as mentioned earlier most large and medium airports impose pfcs on each boarding passenger in return for permission to levy the pfc these airports forgo either 50 or 75 of their aip formula entitlement funds this means that federal funding for major runway projects at large and medium hub airports will probably need to be for the most part funded with aip discretionary funds the pool of discretionary funds is primarily the remainder of provided annual funding after the entitlement formula requirements are satisfied of the forgone pfc funds 875 are reserved for small airport fund and are also not available for oep airports if there is confluence of policy of overall federal budget deficit reduction with an inability to either increase trust fund revenues or to increase the general fund share for the faa budget there could be meaningful reduction in the amount of funding available for discretionary grants once the entitlement ie formula funding requirements are satisfied in other words if the aip budget is constrained either under reauthorization bill or during the annual appropriation process and the entitlement formulas remain as they are the squeezedown effect will be likely on the discretionary portion of the aip budget within this context it is important to also keep in mind that significant portion of aip discretionary funds have in recent years been earmarked to hundreds of airports based primarily on local needs and wants rather than in accordance with national capacity plan this situation could also limit or reduce aip participation in some of the capacity increasing projects at oep airports caveats predicting the future is difficult and although the faa has reasonably good record for accuracy in its activity forecasts the faa itself has pointed out that since the events of 911 the instability of the industry has led to 82 some have argued that because some of the large airports included in the oep 35 have been losing market share to lowcost secondary airports in their urban areas it might make more sense in these cases to consider increasing aip funding to these secondary airports rather than supporting major capacity enhancement projects or airside reconfigurations at legacy airports discussed during session effects of airline restructuring on airport systems at the 2007 transportation research board 86th annual meeting washington january 23 2007 crs31 larger errors in the agencys shortterm forecasts83 the recent unpredictability of fuel prices major component of aviation business costs also brings degree of uncertainty to aviation forecasts in addition trends in business jet use and the potential impact of very light jets vljs discussed later may also influence the accuracy of forecasts aips financial future under an uncertain budgetary outlook the aip is good example of how broader budget issues can have implications for not only programs funding level but also the programs scope and benefit distribution should ample revenues be available the reauthorization of aip could likely maintain the programmatic status quo with relatively few changes to the programs structure although project eligibility criteria could be broadened given however the recent decline in the uncommitted balance of the aviation trust fund for the aip to grow substantially some observers expect that something will have to change in the budgetary environment increased tax revenues either through new taxes higher fares or faster economic growth or an increase in the general fund share would be needed to provide for an aip increase on the order of the increases initiated by air21and maintained in vision 10084 otherwise any aip increase would have to come at the expense of other faa programs for variety reasons some within the transportation community expect budgetary constraints will restrict the size of the aip budget as mentioned earlier the uncommitted balance in the trust fund is much smaller than it was during the last authorization cycle more money may be needed to fund the fe component of the faa budget to support the modernization of the air traffic control system under the next generation air transportation system ngats and in constrained budgetary environment this could exert downward pressure on the aip component of the faa budget the enforcement of payasyougo rules and renewed commitment to reduce the federal budget deficit could also make it difficult to increase aip funding85 in recent years the george w bush administration and the faa itself have consistently proposed aip budgets significantly below the programs authorized levels most recently the presidents fy2009 budget proposed 275 billion for aip this is 765 million below the estimated amount made available for fy2007 and nearly 1 billion below the fy2007 funding authorized in vision 100 within constrainedbudget scenario interest would probably increase in such issues as defederalization of the larger airports which by allowing them to opt out of the aip program could reduce aip spending on large hub airports another possibility would be to make the aip formulas more restrictive project eligibility criteria could also be tightened perhaps the greatest concern at the federal level 83 faa aerospace forecast fiscal years 20062017 p 51 84 as mentioned earlier in this report the fy2001 increase in the aip budget under air21 was 70 increase over the fy2000 amount made available 85 see crs report rl32835 paygo rules for budget enforcement in the house and senate by robert keith and bill heniff jr crs32 may be the availability of aip discretionary funds for major capacity enhancing projects as those set forth in the oep aip spending guarantees86 as discussed earlier congressional concerns especially among transportation authorizing committee members that aviation trust fund revenues first be used to fund faas two capital programs aip and fe before being drawn down to pay for the agencys operations activities have led to the enactment of series of cap and penalty and other socalled spending guarantee mechanisms although the various cap and penalty mechanisms that were in place prior to passage of air21 in 2000 succeeded in restricting spending from the aviation trust fund on operations they did not consistently succeed in forcing full appropriation of authorized aip and fe funding levels87 this situation led to the growth of the trust funds uncommitted balance as congressional budget office cbo report explained in 1988 but still applicable today88 primarily because of program constraints these provisions have merely altered the accounting for aviation spending forcing the general fund to finance more of these expenditures in addition there still remains an incentive to limit capital spending for aviation programs given the annual level of excise tax revenue from aviation each dollar of aviation spending greater than these tax revenues must be funded by general revenues therefore regardless of the actual accounting for aviation spending each dollar reduction in spending on aviation either reduces the need for the general fund to finance aviation spending or produces trust fund surplus from which the treasury can borrow to cover non aviation expenditures in effect within the context of the unitary federal budget appropriators and budgeteers were more concerned about the overall budget level or the size of the federal budget deficit than whether belowauthorized spending on aip and fe caused reduction of trust fund spending for om broader budget concerns trumped the cap and penalty provisions current law pointoforder enforced spending guarantees there are two existing spending guarantees which are different than the previously discussed cap and penalty provisions one makes it outoforder in the house or senate to consider legislation that failed to use all aviation trust fund receipts and interest annually the second makes it outoforder to consider any bill that provided any funding for red or om if it failed to fully fund the faas two capital 86 for detailed discussion of the history of funding guarantees see crs report rl33654 aviation spending guarantee mechanisms by robert s kirk the spending guarantee issues are also summarized in crs report rl33698 reauthorization of the federal aviation administration background and issues for congress coordinated by bart elias 87 the cap set ceiling on the amount of aviation trust fund money that could be used to fund faa operations the penalty would reduce this cap by formula linked to faa capital program appropriations shortfall below their authorizations for the fiscal year 88 cbo status of the airport and airway trust fund 1988 p 1011 crs33 programs aip and fe at their authorized levels as penalty of sorts any failure to fully fund fe would lead to an increased appropriation referred to as popup budget authority for aip equal to the appropriations shortfall for fe during the first years of the air21 guarantees fy2001fy2003 these measures appear to have successfully assured that both aip and fe were funded at or very near their authorized levels in the annual appropriations acts however congressional support in the annual appropriation bills for adherence to the guarantees during the last three years has been mixed on the one hand the obligation limitations for aip for fy2004fy2007 have been reasonably close to their authorized levels for these years on the other hand fe spending has been cut significantly in each of these years fes annual appropriation fell below its authorization as follows 320 million for fy2004 468 million for fy2005 498 million for fy2006 and 595 million for fy2007 these fe funding levels were out of conformance with the guarantees and should have made the funding of the om and red components of faas budget out of order during these years it also should have led to additional popup budget authority for the aip equal to the annual underfunding of fe there are number of reasons that the guarantee provisions have not been adhered to specific to fe spending has been the lack of confidence in congress in the ability of the faa to oversee the national air system modernization the hesitance to fully fund fe may have more to do with this than with resistance to adherence to the funding guarantees however some other weaknesses in the current guarantee mechanism have manifested themselves in recent years spending guarantees that are enforced by pointoforder actions only work if the pointoforder is raised by member and if they have not been waived by rule in the house recent annual appropriations bills have had all pointsoforder waived by the rules committee senators have also chosen not to raise pointsoforder against violations of the aip and fe funding guarantees89 pointsoforder have not been allowed on appropriations bill conference reports also the popup aip budget authority which some viewed as part of the mechanism for preventing appropriators from spending any fe shortfall for noncapital aviation spending can and has been rescinded in recent appropriations legislation these rescissions allow appropriators to bring down the nominal total cost of the transportationtreasury appropriations bills generally in the following budget year as was true during the cap and penalty era fy1977fy1998 the current spending guarantees can still be trumped by broader budget policy goals such as deficit reduction or at times by the spending priorities of appropriators spending guarantee options aviation funding guarantees are expected to be considered in the faa reauthorization debate during the 110th congress and could include keeping the current system modifying the current guarantees 89 in part this may have been because if point of order were upheld the entire aip or fe financing provision would be stricken from the bill that senate conferees would take to conference this absence of funding provision could put the senate conferees at disadvantage in negotiating with house conferees over the contents of the bill to be voted out of conference crs34 resurrecting mechanism analogous to the cap and penalty provisions reconsidering taking the trust fund offbudget or erecting budgetary fire walls as was done for the highway and transit programs in 1998 some would argue that there should be guarantees and that the normal congressional budget process should be allowed to progress unfettered the absence of large uncommitted trust fund balance could also have an impact on the support for new or continued aviation spending guarantee mechanisms during faa reauthorization in the 110th congress partial defederalization one way to reduce the amount of trust fund revenue needed for aip would be to allow large and medium hub airports to opt out of the aip program in favor of unrestricted or higher pfc financing this would in the view of some airport executives also give them the flexibility they would prefer to have in managing their airports these airports would longer be bound by all of the grant assurances that are currently required of participants if the large and medium hub airports are able to defederalize there would be implications for the degree of policy influence the federal government could wield in airport development some argue that because the threat of withdrawal of federal aip funds provides the federal government with substantial leverage to enforce grant assurances that implement federal policy for example the fair and reasonable rates requirement or airport revenue diversion assurances other means of maintaining federal influence might be considered during reauthorization should defederalization gain significant legislative attention privatization for congress the privatization debate is both about saving money on airports that can be less dependent on federal assistance and also in the broader sense whether federal involvement in airport infrastructure is excessive airport privatization differs from defederalization in that privatization denotes change in ownership from public entity to private one airport privatization in the united states has for the most part been limited to what some would refer to as commercialization of airport management or services the use of private companies to provide airport services is widespread at the largest airports in the united states employees of private companies the airlines concessionaires and other contractors account for 90 of all employees90 the airport privatization pilot program 49 usc sec 47134 section 149 of the federal aviation reauthorization act of 1996 pl 104264 authorizes the faa to exempt up to five airports from certain federal restrictions on the use of airport revenue offairport participating airports may be exempted from such requirements as repayment of federal grants privatized airports may still participate in the aip but at lower federal share 70 during the nine years since the application procedures were published only one airport stewart international airport in new 90 ncarc development needs and financing options p 13 crs35 york has obtained an approved exemption91 in january 2007 however the british lease holder national express group plc agreed to sell the operating lease which has 93 years remaining at stewart international to the port authority of new york and new jersey for 785 million national express had bought the lease for 35 million in 2000 this means that the only successfully privatized airport under the airport privatization pilot program is returning to public sector control92 the case can be made that neither the repurchase of privatized airport by public airport authority nor the quick resale at significant profit of longterm airport lease of an airport built with public funds was what some supporters had in mind when they supported the privatization program recently the discussion of airport privatization has taken place within the context of the recent leasing agreements of the chicago skyway toll road and the indiana toll road to private investors the skyway sale was especially controversial because the money payed to the city of chicago was used by the city to defray normal city budgetary expenses and not to support or improve transportation infrastructure on september 14 2006 the city of chicago submitted preliminary application under the airport privatization pilot program for the longterm lease of chicago midway airport and on october 3 2006 the faa authorized the city of chicago to select private operator negotiate an agreement and submit final application under the pilot program93 chicago midway has received 371 million in federal aip grants since 1982 some observers of chicagos midway airport lease proposal have described it as value extraction proposal because they expect that the lease payments would be simply used as general city revenue and would not add value ie make improvements to the airport or to any transportation infrastructure94 supporters of privatization generally take the view that if lease revenues or profits from airport sales can only be used for airport purposes there is incentive for an airport authority to sell or forprofit company to purchase an airport or airport lease as mentioned earlier the pilot program provides for exemptions on the aip grant assurance restrictions on use of revenues the airport privatization pilot program however requires that the airport sponsor may only recover from the sale or lease the amount that may be approved by at least 65 of the air carriers serving the airport and air carriers that account for 65 of the total landed weight at the airport for the year proponents of privatization argue that this requirement of air carrier approval air carriers have historically not favored privatization of the use of airport revenue offairport or into city or county budget as major reason there has been limited interest in the privatization pilot program given the limited success of 91 the owner of the 99 year lease at stewart airport the united kingdombased national express group neg has announced that the remainder of its lease will be put up for sale neg held the lease for seven years 92 joe mysak airport privatization pittsburgh tribune review february 4 2007 93 see faa fact sheet chicago midway airport pilot privatization program faa news april 2008 94 government accountability office financing airport capital development roundtable discussion meeting held january 27 2007 crs36 the airport privatization pilot program congress may wish to modify replace or eliminate the program95 there is certainty that any aip cost savings from either privatization or defederalization would be retained as aip funds for use by the remaining airports aip spending is determined by the authorization and appropriations process and there is guarantee that the savings would be made available to the remaining eligible airports any savings could also be used to lower the program size to marginally assist in deficit reduction to lower the needed general fund payment or to make money available for spending elsewhere apportionment and eligibility changes apportioned funds sometimes referred to as entitlements were substantially increased in air21 and the range of landside projects eligible for aip grants was increased somewhat in both air21 and vision 100 most of the eligibility changes benefitted airports smaller than mediumhub size although the increase in apportioned funding and the broadening of eligibility criteria could continue in the next reauthorization bill if the budget environment is constrained the opposite could happen in particular the apportioned funds may have to be reduced to assure that sufficient funds remain to fund discretionary grants in particular for operational evolution plan projects the acina supports the maintenance of aip funding for smaller airports and argues further for giving these airports increased flexibility in the use of their entitlements the case can be made that over the years the broadening of aip eligibility at small airports has made it increasingly difficult to identify the federal interest that has been met by such spending as mentioned earlier air carriers are skeptical of the benefit to the national airport system of some proposals seeking to broaden project eligibility in part because they feel it shifts spending away from airside projects at large airports and to projects at small airports that do not play key role in commercial aviation general aviation and small airport supporters defend the distribution of aip funds to small airports noting that smaller airports are more dependant on aip and do not often have the access to the bond market that larger airports have in addition they stress the importance of small airports to broad regions of the united states and their role in fulfilling the national goal of having an extensive national airport system96 federal share vision 100 raised the federal share from 90 to 95 for smaller than large and mediumhub airports and for airports in states participating in the state block grant program but included sunset clause that returns the federal share back to 90 after 95 see robert w poole jr us airport privatization the second time around airport policy news 23 february 2007 45 the issues were also discussed at the gao roundtable financing airport capital development 96 npias 4 the npias includes the attribute that the airport system be extensive providing as many people as possible with convenient access to air transportation typically by having most commuters with more than 20 miles of travel to the nearest npias airport crs37 fy2007 should the federal or faa budget be constrained or held at current levels congress may wish to consider adjusting the federal share as either cost cutting measure or to encourage more local financial participation the federal share for most projects at large and mediumhub airports is 75 those who favor significant local matching share in federal transportation projects generally argue that it helps prevent the construction of projects of questionable value that may be built only because federal funds may be obtained at little cost to local governments or airport authorities some also argue that high federal share discourages local government financial participation and makes smaller airports less interested in seeking funds through the bond market discretionary fund setasides the discretionary funds which are the remainder funds after the apportionments are satisfied are subject to setasides for noise mitigation the military airports program map reliever airports and the capacitysafetysecuritynoise setaside any of these could be modified during reauthorization however the greater the total of all the setasides the smaller the remaining amounts that are truly unrestricted discretionary funds some observers argue that this could limit the ability of the faa to respond to national aviation priorities such as the oep minimum discretionary fund 49 usc 47115 requires that minimum amount 148 million plus any outstanding prejanuary 1 1997 letters of intent remains available for the discretionary fund after all apportionments and setasides are satisfied if less money remains the apportionments are reduced pro rata to bring the discretionary funding up to the required level because aip has been funded since fy2001 at historically high levels the minimum discretionary fund provision has not been factor in aip funding if however aips budget is reduced substantially or if the entitlements are increased substantially the appropriate minimum discretionary fund level may need to be reconsidered grant assurances as mentioned earlier along with the acceptance of aip funds come certain obligations generally referred to as assurances that airports must agree to these assurances include the obligation to maintain and operate their facilities safely and efficiently as well as more specific obligations such as not to discriminate against any class of air system users97 to adhere to davisbacon prevailing wage requirements and to use airport revenue solely for spending on airport operations and capital costs98 proposals to alter the aip grant assurances can be expected to arise during the reauthorization debate for example the acina is seeking bill that simplifies airport grant assurances including reforms that permit airports to use non aeronautical revenue sources to attract new and competitive air service to their 97 for example against cargo or commuter aircraft or night time flight operators 98 49 usc sec 47107 crs38 communities99 supporters of maintaining the grant assurances generally argue that the assurances not only help establish and enforce federal policy priorities but also insulate airports from local efforts to limit or shut down airport operations for example because of noise concerns or for land development noise mitigation historically the basic funding issue is whether to change the existing discretionary fund noise setaside the noise setaside however has been raised in each of the last two reauthorization acts and is now 35 of discretionary funding although some support for another increase could develop it would likely face resistance from proponents of spending on capacity and safety enhancing projects that also rely on aip discretionary spending this scenario would change should the aviation trust fund revenue outlook improve enough to allow for significant increase in aip funding other noise issues that may arise are funding eligibility issues one issue is whether faa should be granted the flexibility to fund some noise mitigation projects that are outside the 65 decibel noise impact area supporters argue that at some airports expanding noise mitigation to areas subject to slightly lower than 65 decibel impact could significantly lower local resistance to airport projects some air carriers and airports however are concerned that any lowering would eventually in effect be applied nationwide and the resulting demand for aip funds would divert resources from capacity and safety projects another issue is whether or not to make the planning for noise mitigating arrival and departure operational air traffic control procedures eligible for aip funding in what was major expansion of aip noise funding eligibility vision 100 authorized the faa to make grants for land use compatibility planning and projects around large and medium hub airports that have not submitted part 150 noise compatibility plan under 14 cfr part 150 as was previously required the provision is limited to grants that are awarded through fy2007 congress may wish to review this provision and extend or modify it or allow it to lapse very light jets vljs and the airbus a380 impact on aip some predictions of the rapid growth of new type of aircraft the vljs jets with takeoff weight less than 12500 pounds that can land on 3000 foot runway have in turn led to concerns that increased airport funding will be needed to accommodate them100 even if the optimistic estimates of the speed of introduction of vljs panout given that vljs have been specifically designed to operate at most existing general aviation airports existing airport facilities should be able to handle 99 board of directors airports council internationalnorth america the acina board of directors endorses an aviation reauthorization program that includes balanced financing program

reauthorization of the federal aviation administration background and issues for congress coordinated by bart elias crs39 the traffic if however the advent of vljs leads to increasing demands for installing all weather capabilities at small airports or if insurers place requirements on vlj use for example that vljs only be used at airports with runways longer than 3000 feet the demand for aipfunded improvements at small airports could increase over time in either case unless the reauthorization bill covers an unusually long time frame it is unlikely that vljs will be major aip concern at this time as mentioned previously small airports are more dependent on aip funding for their capital projects than larger airports more likely to have an impact on aip funding in the near term is the airbus super jumbo a380 the gao identified 18 us airports making changes to accommodate the a380 at an estimated cost of roughly 927 million these airports identified aip as the planned source for 50 of these costs and pfcs for another 21101 place naming in annual appropriations legislation historically congress has not earmarked aip funds in the manner typical to mass transit appropriations where specific projects have specific dollar amounts designated in the language of the appropriations bills instead of earmarking aip funds are subject to place naming under place naming the appropriations committees direct faa to give priority consideration to discretionary grant applications at airports named in the appropriations bill report language the enacted fy2001 conference agreement hrept 106940 place named 158 airports and also specified dollar amounts to be awarded totaling just under 300 million the language was also more directive than had been the case previously the report directed faa to provide not less than the following specified funding levels out of available discretionary resources since then each annual conference report has named over 100 airports with set dollar amounts most recently the fy2006 transportationtreasury appropriations conference report hrept 109307 place named 124 airport for projects totaling just under 196 million one of the issues related to this form of earmarking is the impact it has on the grant application process another is the impact of place naming on the availability of limited discretionary funds for national priorities such as the operation evolution plan oep for fy2007 the continuing appropriations resolution hjres 20 passed the house free of earmarks or place naming place naming of airports for aip grants however reemerged during the fy2008 appropriations process the consolidated appropriations act 2008 pl 110161 hrept 110434 named 110 airports for projects totaling just over 99 million passenger facility charge issues the central pfc issue is whether to raise the 450 per enplaned ie boarding passenger ceiling or to eliminate the ceiling all together airports have long argued 101 us government accountability office commercial aviation costs and major factors influencing infrastructure changes at us airports to accommodate the new a380 aircraft gao06571 washington dc gao 2006 available at httpwwwgaogov newitemsd06571pdf crs40 for elimination of the cap but would also be pleased with an increase of some sort the overall historical arguments for and against raising or eliminating the 450 cap on passenger facility charges are similar to the current arguments and are similar to the arguments for and against the pfc in general most air carriers and some passenger advocates will probably oppose an increase in the pfc the pros and cons of increasing or eliminating the pfc cap are discussed below pro pfc supporters feel that the pfc is more reliable than aip funding they also argue that pfcs are procompetitive helping airports build gates and facilities that both encourage new entrant carriers and allow incumbent carriers to expand airports also argue that the pfc has proven an appropriate user fee that has travelers pay for airport improvements and capacity expansion at the airport where the fee is collected in addition supporters argue that over time the value of the pfc has been eroded by inflation and an adjustment is therefore necessary airport interests also want even fewer restrictions on the use of pfc revenue the airlines object to increasing the pfc cap they argue that the pfc is just another head tax102 they also argue that it is anti consumer because it increases passenger costs and that by raising these travel costs it could at some point lead to reduction in passenger traffic airline interests object to what pfcs have been spent on arguing that airports have learned to game the system to provide money for marginal proposals of debatable value instead of high priority projects that offer meaningful safety or capacity enhancements the major air carriers are also unhappy with the less influential decision making role they have in project decisions under pfcs airports only have to consult with resident air carriers under the pfc rules they do not have to get air carrier agreement on pfc funded projects although pfc revenues can be used for broader range of projects than aip some airport advocates argue there is still room for more flexibility in pfc eligibility requirements for example some would like more freedom to use pfc funds on off airport projects such as transportation access projects airports would also like the application process to be streamlined additionally they would also to eliminate the competition plan requirement that is placed on large and medium hub airports that charge pfcs at the 450 level as mentioned earlier supporters of the competition plan provision hoped the requirement would help assure that the major airports would be available on reasonable basis to all air carriers wishing to serve those airports air carrier advocates have expressed concerns about the expansion of project eligibility under the pfc program they are especially concerned about the use of 102 merlis edward passenger facility charge increase statement on behalf of the air transport association of america before the house of representatives aviation subcommittee march 12 1998 6 p crs41 pfcs to fund certain airport access projects such as rail mass transit projects that would spend pfc revenues beyond the airport boundary they view the broadening of pfc project eligibility as shifting resources away from airport infrastructure projects that support the operation of aircraft at the airport in their view this creates situation where the airside projects generally favored by air carriers are more likely to be funded by aip grants bonds and airport revenues and less likely to be funded with pfcs part of this concern is driven by air carrier belief that the broadening of pfc project eligibility in effect makes some large airports more likely to raise the rates and fees such as landing fees charged to air carriers that use the airport if the aip budget faces period of constraint which could limit the availability of aip discretionary funding for national priorities such as the oep congress may wish to revisit the distribution of the aip apportionments that are foregone by the large and mediumhub airports that impose pfc currently 875 of the foregone funds are directed to small airport fund and 125 to the discretionary fund adjusting these percentages could be one way of increasing the money available to support oep projects in 1990 the airport capacity funding advisory committee recommended that all foregone funds should be shifted to the discretionary fund and allocated proportionally across all categories of the discretionary category103 this original recommendation could be reconsidered airport bonding issues recently there has been interest in increased use of private activity bonds pabs for transportation development private activity airport bonds could allow private entity to enter the taxexempt bond market to raise funding for capital project at public use airport as possible precedent the recently passed surface transportation act the safe accountable flexible efficient transportation equity act legacy for users pl 10959 safetealu allowed for up to 15 billion in private facility bond funding for highways or freight transfer facilities104 airport bonds however have long been major source of funding for capital projects at primary airports because most airports are owned by public authorities they can seek funds in the taxexempt bond market the majority of these bonds are already treated by the internal revenue service as private activity bonds because they fund projects that benefit the activities of private entities usually airlines at the airport and because they directly or indirectly through fees depend on revenue from such private entities to make the bond payments income from pabs are subject to the alternative minimum tax the current use by airport sponsors of airport bonding differs somewhat from the use of pabs envisioned in safetealu many of the supporters of the safetealu provisions envisioned pabs as means of facilitating publicprivate partnerships between the public authority and an outside investor see the 103 faa report of the airport capacity funding advisory committee washington faa p 3 104 for description of the federal highway administration program see httpwwwfhwa dotgovpppprivate_activity_bondshtm crs42 privatization issue discussion earlier in this report within the airports context this would be analogous to an airport authority agreeing to long term lease with an outside private investor who would have the ability to enter the market for tax exempt bonds to finance improvements at the airport and perhaps also to finance the purchasing costs of the lease itself105 alternative minimum tax amt issues as mentioned above income from pabs is subject to the amt106 income from taxexempt governmental purpose bonds is not subject to the amt the majority of airport bonds are pabs one change sought by acina would be to broaden the definition of governmental purpose airport bonds to in effect include either all airport bonds or at least those bonds issued for public use projects that meet aip or pfc eligibility requirements107 opponents of such changes express concerns that these changes could reduce us treasury revenues some also argue it would make more sense to change the amt as part of tax bill rather than as specific exemption provided for income on airport bonds in an faa reauthorization bill in either case such change would not be under the jurisdiction of the congressional committees that will have jurisdiction over most reauthorization provisions changes to the amt would be under the jurisdiction of the congressional taxwriting committees the house committee on ways and means and the senate committee on finance the congressional budget office cbo the office of management and budget omb and the treasury department however have generally opposed bonding as adding additional governmentborne costs to the airport improvement process108 105 see also the discussion of privatization of airports earlier in this report 106 the amt was originally enacted to make sure that all taxpayers pay at least minimum amount of federal taxes on their income so that individual taxpayers could not take unfair advantage of the various federal tax preferences and incentives because the tax was not indexed for inflation the impact of the tax has grown beyond the small group of tax payers for whom it was originally intended see crs report rl34382 the alternative minimum tax for individuals legislative activity in the 110th congress by steven maguire and jennifer teefy 107 acina reforming the federal tax treatment of airport bonds washington aci na 2006 the acina also proposes that the advance refunding of pabs which is usually done to take advantage of lower interest rates be allowed 108 cbo reiterated this position at recent september 27 2006 house aviation subcommittee hearings on financing options for faa and redesign of the air transportation system gao also expressed the reasons for its concerns about the costs of bonding see gao national airspace system modernization observations on potential funding options for faa and the next generation airspace system gao061114t washington gao 2006 p 1617 crs43 appendix legislative history of federal grantsinaid to airports prior to world war ii the federal government limited its role in aviation to maintaining the airway system viewing airports as local responsibility some federal monies were spent on airports during the 1930s about 150 million but only as part of federal work relief activities such as works progress administration wpa projects the national defense need for strong system of airports during world war ii led to the first major federal support for airport construction after the war the federal airport act of 1946 pl 79377 hereafter referred to as the 1946 act continued federal aid under the federal aid to airports program although at lower levels than during the war years under the 1946 act funds were appropriated annually from the general fund of the us treasury initially much of this spending supported policy of conversion of military airports to civilian use in the 1960s substantial funding also went to upgrade and extend runways for use by commercial jets109 by the end of the 1960s congestion both in the air and on the ground at us airports was seen as evidence by some that past federal support for airports had not been sufficient to maintain adequate airport capacity110 airport and airway development and revenue acts of 1970 pl 91258 the 1970 acts in 1970 congress responded to the congestion problems and capacity concerns at airports by passing two acts the first the airport and airway development act dealt with the spending side of federal aid to airports it established the airport development aid program adap the planning grant program pgp and set forth the programs grant criteria distribution guidelines and authorization of grant inaid funding for the first five years of the program the second act the airport and airway revenue act of 1970 dealt with the revenue side of airport development this act established the airport and airway trust fund also known as the aviation trust fund revenues from levies on aviation users and fuel were dedicated to the fund111 modeled on the highway trust fund this fund was designed to assure an adequate and consistent source of funds for federal airport and airway programs112 the aviation trust fund also funds most faa activities in addition to grantsinaid for airports these include facilities and equipment fe research engineering development red and faa operations air traffic 109 for general discussion of the us airport

airport trust fund was modeled after the highway trust fund there are differences in the way funds are distributed one major difference is that highway spending is funneled through the states whereas most airport development funds go directly to airports crs44 system maintenance and improvement fall under the first two of those categories under the 1970 acts the trust fund was to have been both capital account and when excess funds existed userpay system to help support faas administrative and operations costs113 airport and airway development and revenue acts amendments of 1971 pl 92174 the 1971 amendments act the nixon administrations faa budget requests for fy1971 and fy1972 under the new trust fund system brought it into immediate conflict with congress over the budgetary treatment of trust fund revenues114 the administration treated the new financing system as userpay system whereas many members of congress viewed the trust fund as primarily capital fund for the adap and fe although spending on faa operations was allowable115 the 1971 amendments act was strong congressional reaction consistent with many members perceptions that the nixon administration was ignoring the intent of congress under the 1970 acts the amendment made the trust fund capitalonly account although only through fy1976 disallowing the use of trust fund revenues for faa operations116 airport and airway development amendments act of 1976 pl 94353 the 1976 act the 1976 act made number of adjustments to the adap and reauthorized the aviation trust fund through fy1980 the act again allowed the use of trust fund resources for the costs of air navigation services part of operations and maintenance however in an attempt to assure adequate funding of airport grants the act included cap and penalty provisions which placed an annual cap on spending for costs of air navigation systems and penalty that reduced these caps if airport grants were not funded each year at the airport programs authorized levels117 adap grants totaled about 41 billion dollars from 1971 through 1980 in part because of debate over defederalization congress did not pass authorizing legislation for adap during fy1981 and fy1982 which meant that the aviation 113 see gao congressional intent for another discussion of congressional intent regarding the debate over the use of aviation trust fund revenues for

trust fund lapsed during those two years although spending for airport grants continued118 airport and airway improvement act of 1982 pl 97248 the 1982 act the 1982 act created the current aip and reactivated the aviation trust fund although the aip maintained the adaps approach of using grantsinaid to support an integrated national system of airports it did make some significant changes in the operation of the program the program differences included altering the funding distribution among the newly defined categories of airports119 extending aid eligibility to privately owned general aviation airports increasing the federal share of eligible project costs and earmarking 8 of total funding for noise abatement and compatibility planning the act also required the secretary of transportation to publish national plan for the development of publicuse airports in the united states this biannual publication is called the national plan of integrated airport systems npias the npias identifies airports that are considered important to national transportation for an airport to receive aip funds it must be listed in the npias120 in reauthorizing the aviation trust fund the act also adjusted the schedule of aviation user fees although the act was amended often in the 1980s and early 1990s the general structure of the program remained the same the airport and airway safety and capacity and expansion act of 1987 pl 100223 1987 act authorized significant increases for aip and added cargo service apportionment the 1987 act also included modified cap and penalty provisions as well as tax reduction trigger in part to encourage full funding of aip at the fully authorized level121 title ix of pl 101508 the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 obra included the aviation and airway safety and capacity act of 1990 which allowed airports under certain conditions to levy passenger facility charge pfc to raise revenue and 118 airport aid for those years was appropriated at 450 million per year certain aviation fee revenues went into the treasurys general fund and the highway trust fund during the lapse the defederalization debate centered around proposals to withdraw federal aid from major air carrier airports on the grounds that the federal government was overinvolved in airport development finance and that large airports could finance any needed development themselves 119 the 1982 act defined four categories for the distribution of formula funds commercial service primary reliever and general aviation of the distribution not more than 50was to primary airports based on the number of enplanements 12 of the authorization was for use within the states and insular areas and the remainder was defined as discretionary sizable portion of the discretionary funding was dedicated to specified funding minimums 120 faa npias 20072011 according to faa 3431 including 67 proposed npias airports of the 19847 airports existing in the united states are listed in the npias unless otherwise stated the discussion in this paper refers to the npias or national system airports 121 the 1987 act added provision for fy1988fy1989 that would trigger reduction in aviation tax rates if the total of the amounts made available for aip fe and red were less than 85 of the amounts authorized for these programs crs46 also established the military airport program map which provided aip funding for capacity andor conversionrelated projects at joint use or former military airports the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 also set national aviation noise policy obra included the revenue reconciliation act of 1990 which reauthorized the aviation trust fund and adjusted some of the aviation taxes finally obra again modified the cap and penalty provisions and eliminated the tax reduction trigger the federal aviation reauthorization act of 1994 pl 103305 reauthorized aip for two more years and again made modifications in the cap and penalty provisions122 federal aviation reauthorization act of 1996 pl 104264 the 1996 authorization of the aip provided 228 billion for fy1997 and 237 billion for fy1998 the act made number of adjustments to entitlement funding and discretionary setaside provisions it also included number of directives concerning intermodal planning cost reimbursement rules letters of intent lois and the small airport fund demonstration airport privatization program and demonstration program for innovative financing techniques were established the pilot status of the state block grant program was removed the 1996 act again altered the cap and penalty provisions the act did not reauthorize the taxes that supported the aviation trust fund this was done by the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 10534 which extended subject to number of modifications the existing aviation trust fund taxes for ten years through september 30 2007 the wendell h ford aviation investment and reform act for the 21st century of 2000 air21 pl 106181 air21s enactment was the culmination of two years of legislative effort to pass multiyear faa reauthorization bill123 the length of the effort was reflection of the difficult issues faced major issues that had to be resolved included the budgetary treatment of the aviation trust fund raising the ceiling on the passenger facility charge pfc as well as the amounts to be spent and their distribution rather than debating further modifications of the cap and penalty provisions the initial debate focused on provisions to take the aviation trust fund offbudget or erect budgetary firewalls to assure that all trust fund revenues and interest would be spent each year for aviation purposes these proposals however never emerged from the conference committee instead the enacted legislation included socalled 122 the 1994 act was preceded by two acts that extended the aip program the airport and airway safety capacity noise improvement and intermodal transportation act of 1992 pl 102581 extended aip through fy1993 and the aip temporary extension act of 1994 pl 103260 extended aip through june 30 1994 123 during the debate aip underwent four separate authorization extensions pl 105227 extended aip through march 31 1999 pl 1066 through may 31 1999 pl 10631 through august 6 1999 and finally pl 10659 through september 30 1999 the aip was held in abeyance from october 1 1999

airtight the budgetary resources made available for aip during the years fy2001fy2003 that the air21guaranties were in effect were at or near the programs authorized levels air21 did not however make any major changes in the structure or functioning of aip the big difference was the amount of money made available for airport development projects from funding level of approximately 19 billion for fy2000 aips authorization increased funding by nearly 70 to 32 billion for fy2001 then to 33 billion for fy2002 and to 34 billion for fy2003 within the context of these increases the formula funding and minimums for primary airports were doubled starting in fy2001 the state apportionment for general aviation airports was increased from 185 to 20 the noise setaside was increased from 31 to 34 of discretionary funding and reliever airport discretionary setaside of 066 was established air21 also increased the pfc maximum to 450 per boarding passenger in return for imposing pfc above the 3 level large and mediumhub airports would give back or forgo 75 of their aip formula funds this made more aip funding available to the smaller airports vision 100 century of aviation reauthorization act of 2003 pl 108176 hrept 108334 vision 100 the faa reauthorization act signed by president george wbush on december 12 2003 included some significant changes to aip but nothing of the scale or consequence of the changes made under air21 both the funding increase and the programmatic changes were modest by comparison vision 100 funded aip for four years at the following annual levels 34 billion for fy2004 35 billion for fy2005 36 billion for fy2006 and 37 billion for fy2007 the law codified the air21 spending guarantees through fy2007 the agreement does not authorize the use of aip funds for the administration of the program vision 100 increased the discretionary set aside for noise compatibility projects from 34 to 35 it increased the amount that an airport participating in the military airport program map could receive to 10 million for fy2004 and fy2005 but in fy2006 and fy2007 it returned the maximum funding level to 7 million the act allowed nonprimary airports to use their entitlements for revenue generating areas if the secretary of dot determines that the sponsor has made adequate provisions for the airside needs of the airport the agreement permitted aip grants at small airports to be used to pay interest on bonds used to finance an airport project the act included pilot program to test procedures for authorizing small airports to impose pfcs vision 100
