essential elements of the task of stabilizing and rebu ilding the country train the afghan army police and judiciary support the governme nt in counternarcotic s efforts develop market infrastructure and suppress the taliban although the allies agree on isafs mission they differ on how to accomplish it some allies do not want their forces to engage in combat operations none wants to engage directly in destruction of poppy fields in countering the drug trade how to support the afghan government in this task largely through training the police is proving to be difficult undertaking in the wake of the abu ghraib scandal and criticism of us practices at guantanamo the allies are insisting on close observation of international law in dealing with prisoners taken in afghanistan isaf has proceeded in stages to stabiliz the country in stage one isaf took control of kabul and norther n afghanistan in stage two isaf moved into western afghanistan stage three in the still restive south began in july 2006 stage four began in october 2006 and isaf now covers the entire country isafs principal mechanism for rebuilding afghanistan is the provincial reconstruction team prt prts composed of military and civilian officials are charged with extending the reach of the afghan government by improving governance and rebuilding the economy there are significant differen ces in how individual nato governments run their prts most observers predict that isafs efforts to stabilize afghanistan will require five years or more an exit strategy has multiple components suppressing the taliban rebuilding the economy and cajoling afghan leaders to put aside tribal and regional disputes and improve governance us leadership of the alliance as well as nato credibility are at issue the allies are sharply critical of aspects of the bush administrations foreign policy and sometimes specifically its nato policy us leadership in afghanistan may well affect natos cohesiveness and its future

capabilities and their political will to undert ake complex mission since september 11 2001 the allies have sought to create new nato able to go beyond the european theater and combat new threats such as terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction wmd nat is seeking to be global in its geographic reach and in the development of nonmember partner states that assist in achieving an agreed mission this ch ange in overall mission reflects nato consensus that the principal dangers to allied security lie distant from the treaty area and require new political tools and military capabilities to combat them two military operations in afghanista n seek to stabilize the country operation enduring freedom oef is combat operation led by the united states against qaeda remnants

of isaf the following ear by july 2007 isaf had an estimated 35000 troops from 37 countries with nato members providing the core of the force the united states has 15000 to 17000 troops in isaf natos

stabilization and reconstruction missions before for example in kosovo the scope of the undertaking in afghanistan is considerably more difficult taliban and qaeda remnants are resisting the operation afghanistan has neve r had wellfunctioning cen tral government and the distance from europe and the countrys terrain present daunting obstacles reconstruction must therefore take place while combat operations albeit often low level continue and lthough the allies agree upon general political objective some have differing interp retations how to achieve it the mission in afghanistan is likely to

achieved in the past several years nato governments have also repeatedly pledged to develop capabilities making their forces more expeditionary and deployable the mission in afghanistan provides hard test of these capabilities several key nato members above all the united states ve insisted that the allies must generate the political will to counter the greatest threats to th eir security again afghanistan provides test of will against the concrete danger of international terrorism natos mission in afghanistan also tests us leadership of the alliance some allies question whether the united states will distance itself fro m inhumane practices reportedly used in us militaryrun prisons such as at guantanamo and whether the us commitment to the interests of the allies preserves the mutual sense of obligation that once more clearly characterized the alliance the allies also believe that the united states as global power must provide leadership and resources to counter the destabilizing influences upon af ghanistan of two neighboring states iran and pakistan afghanistan presents growing challenge to nato over the past two years taliban attacks have increased in scope and number and taliban fighters are adopting some of the tactics such as roadsi bombs used by insurgents in iraq the karzai government in afghanistan is coming under internati onal criticism and its public support has diminished due to corruption and an inability to improve living conditions some warlords c ontinue to exert influence and the narcotics industry remains an entrenched threat to the countrys political health2 the allies are not in full agreement how to counter these problems but allied officials say that they need strong and reliable afghan government to provide reasonable services and competence to the population if nato is to succeed this report follows the path of natos evolution in afghanistan the first section covers the initial two stages of isaf s mission and analyzes key issues in the mission use of provincial reconstruction teams to stabilize and rebuild the country overcoming caveats placed by indivi dual allies on the use of their forces and managing the counternar cotics effort the next s ection of the report examines the debate to develop re fined mission statement and new organizational structure for stage three by analyzing issues that are both political and military such as securing more troops the treatment of prisoners and organization of command it covers roughly the period december 2005fa ll 2006 by spring 2006 the allies began to realize that stage

rather the allies am ong themselves in consultation with the afghan government have refined the re solutions provisions into active policy nato involvement began in afghanis tan under mandate in august 2003 some nonnato states such as australia and new zealand contribute resources to the allied effort over time the alliance has laid out four stages to bring most of afghanistan under nato

against its forces use in combat the italian and spanish governments said that their force commanders in the field could make the decisi on to send forces to assist in an urgent situation it remains unclear whether nd when these commanders would have to request permission from their capitals to do so complicating factor that could delay decision some allies have singled out germany for special criticism given that germany has large contingent of 2800 troops in relatively quiet area of northern afghanistan at riga the germans left the situation murky it is unclear whether germany will send combat forces to assist in an emergency5 the issue moved into the public arena in november 2006 in meetings of the nato parliamentary assembly in quebec city one british member of parliament asked his german colleagues if the situ ation were reversed and german soldiers were in imminent danger how would you feel if the british commander responded to german request for urgent assistance with the answer sorry we cant come across the line to help you6 provincial reconstruction teams nato officials describe provincial r econstruction teams prts as the leading edge of the allies effort to

confronting isaf counternarcotics the allies are struggling to combat afghanistans poppy crop afghanistan supplies 92 of the worlds opium as of 2006 the crop is major factor in the economic life and stability of the country and by one estimate accounts for 40 of afghanistans gross domestic product gdp10 opium poppy farmers are heavily concentrated in the southe rn part of the country the repercussions of afghanistans poppy crop for the future of the country and for isaf operations are extensive and complex the afghan government lacks the law enforcement apparatus including wellfunctioning judicial system to combat the narcotics trade successfu lly narcotics traffickers can exploit the countrys primitive transportation network as an extensive road system is not needed to

the drug trade contributes to endemic corruption at all vels of government and unde rcuts public confidence dangerous nexus exists between drugs and insurgents and warlords who derive funds from

that the government does not take decisive action to end warlord i nvolvement in the narcotics trade12 in these circumstances isaf and the karzai government are working on long term solution to the problem nato is assisting in the building of an afghan law enforcement infrastructure intended to di smantle the opium industry and prosecute drug traffickers to this end isaf is tr aining special

country has very few welledu cated individuals able to serve in the judiciary and in other professions in the view of most observe rs the entire judicial system is greatly deficient the poli ce remain corrupt and distrusted by the population they lack extensive training nd experience as well as transport the court system remains in its infancy with few capable jurists and attorneys13 another component of the counternarcotic s effort is to persuade farmers to switch to alternative crops such crops cannot compete with poppies income from hectare of poppies can reach 4600 ear while wheat one

part of the country where the writ of the karzai g overnment is limited initially in late 2005 the allies believed that stage three would emulate stages one and two by seeing replacement of oef forces

army and police an effort in state building meant to provide kabul govern ment with reliable security forces formidable task because such forces were barely in existence they further committed themselves to supporting afgh an government counternarcotics efforts15 they also agreed upon guidelines for dealing with prisoners the mission statement reflected european and canadian views that stage three operations should concentrate on reconstruc tion and stabilization with initial concern over military threat at minimum the taliban were relatively quiet when the allies wrote their communiqué perhaps due to the winter weather in afghanistan perhaps because the taliban were organizing and seeking to gather their strength in april 2006 then british defense secretary said th at he

combat forces were in the region to protect the isaf personnel other nat forces that were nearby had caveats prohibiting their use in combat operations eventually british plane and forces were found to end the attack on the prt before and after the attack on the prt then nato saceur general james j ones called upon the nato governments to pledge forces to isaf that would be cap able of combat operations he waged constant campaign to cajole allied govern ments not to place caveats on their forces that ruled out combat operations19 nato governments ultimately agreed to adjust how isaf would fulfil stage three they wrote more robust rules of engagement which have not been made fully public by may 2006 british general david richards then the isaf commander was describing stage three as combat operation he added that caveats affecting stage three forces had been reduced he di smissed the tendency of some nato governments to draw lin between oefs counterterror operations and the

stage three and stage four operations the views of the british canadian and dutch governments will be discussed more extensively later in this report disagreements over tr eatment of prisoners there was contentious debate among the allies over the december 2005 final communiqué guiding nato operations in afghanistan most of the allies were critical of us abuse of prisoners at the abu ghraib prison in iraq they extended this criticism to the us detention policy at guantanamo bay where some prisoners captured in afghanistan have been sent since 2001 these allies contended that the bush administration was ignoring the ge neva convention governing treatment of prisoners taken in combat and that the issue was significant one among their publics and in their domestic political debates22 these allies insisted that the communiqué explicitly address the issue of treatment of prisoners th final document contains the statement in addition to natos agreed detention policy for isaf which is and remains consistent with international law we welcome initiatives by allies to assist the afghan authorities in the implementation of international st andards for the detention of prisoners23 the allies also agreed that prisoners take n by isaf should be turned over to the afghan government some allied g overnments reportedly told the afghan government that they did not wish such pris oners to

have tortured detainees turned over to them by isaf forces24 command structure coordinating isaf and oef operations natos discussion over the command struct ure for stages three and four in afghanistan reflected the us desire to see the allies more fully embrace combat tasks reluctance on the part of some european governments to clash with the taliban and warlords was evident in these discussions from at least 2004 the bush administrati on began to urge the allies to assume more responsibilities in the fight against insu rgents and terrorists in afghanistan by 2005 the administration was urging th at isaf and oef be merged under one command many allies at first resisted th call to merge the two commands largely because of the different nature of the tw operations and differi ng national agendas britain germany and france were the principal allies opposing the us idea to merge the commands they did so for differing reasons britain and germany wished to preserve isaf as stabilizati on and not combat mission britain leading the isaf antinarcotics effort wished to ensure that that initiative remained in the political sphere along with other allies the british believe that using force against afghan farmers to eradicate the poppy crop might result in broadened insurgency germany opposed merger of the commands because german forces in isaf were trained only for stabilization and not for counterinsurgency operations the french view was somewhat different the french government was close to the administration view that some combat operations against the taliban and other elements would be necessary at the same time french officials were concerned that the administration after ving us commander in place to guide all military activity in afghanistan might use nato as toolbox to accomplish washingtons broader objectives specifi cally paris was concerned that the administration would designate more us units from afghanistan to be sent to iraq and leave the allies to stabilize afghanista n administration officials insist publicly and privately that they have intention of sharply reducing forces in afghanistan25 in fact the bush administration has increased the number of us forces in afghanistan in resolving the issue of command structure the allies sought to address practical problems for the two operations isaf and oef operate in contiguous areas but there is clear dividing line between regions where the taliban and qaeda are active and the relatively stable regions of the country weakness of isaf had been deficient capability

successful strategic and tactical lift and search and rescue are formidable third deputy directs secu rity operations this deputy answers to both the oef and isaf commanders the purpose of the security commanders dual role is to provide coordinati on between the two operations for example if troops in one operation need air cover or an emergency response then those resources could come from either oef or isaf depending on wh ich was nearest to the action and had available resources this arrangement was in fact already in place with some allied governments before stage three began french air combat forces operating out of tajikistan for example have been providing this function to troops in the field in both isaf and oef since 2005 and other llies air components are now prepared to do the same in addition french and dutch officials say th at their air force components serve both commands by gath ering and sharing military intelligence26 stage three operations allied viewpoints once the allies agreed on isafs mission for stage three they began to differ on how to accomplish it the previous secti on analyzed allied views in establishing the mission and structure of stage three this section discusses the developing views of allies as stage three moves forward allied views began to change between the time of the december 2005 nato communi describing isafs mission and july 2006 largely due to the surge in taliban activity for purposes of analysis the range of views begins with governments most hesitant about the use of combat forces in afghanistan and proceeds through list of governments that believe that more forceful military hand will be necessary to stabilize and rebuild the country germany rebuild but avoid combat chancellor angela merkels coalition government had initially expressed more decisive commitment to securing stab ility in afghanistan than its predecessor germany now has 2800 forces in isaf trai ned for stability operations but not for combat in

and oef commands b ecause it would make the situation for our soldiers doubly dangerous and worsen the current climate in afghanistan some officials from other allied governments and the eu have criticized the existing restrictions on german forces and the capabilities of those forces these officials say that german troops and civilia ns rarely venture be yond the perimeter of their prts due to concern that they might arouse afghan public criticism or come into contact with armed elements germ an troops reportedly do not go on extended patrols and do not respond to local security incidents critics of the german approach say that it is important to engage local officials and demonstrate that nato has an active approach to rebuilding the country and persuading the afghan population that the alliance is serving constructive role28 some us and european officials are also critical of the manner in which germany managed its task of training the afghan police force anp the task was daunting one given the low pay provide d by the afghan government and the modest numbers of police used to cover broad territory in this view the afghan police remain corrupt and hollow as force at the same time former saceur general jones said that while training of the afghan army is one of the bright stories one of the notsog ood stories is the inadequ acy to bring similar progress to police reform which is the responsibility of germany part of the problem may lie in the lack of authority of the german government to order police to afghanistan unlike its military forces german police must volunteer for such an assignment29 the united states is now active in training the afghan police possibly as result of the reported deficiencies in german training and the general

complicated however us general karl eikenberry now the deputy of the nato military committee believes that many taliban are not individuals who have hidde n themselves in pakistan or elsewhere outside

mission to stabilize the country they often differ on the means to reach that objective and on the amount of resources to be made available although isaf does not explicitly have counterterror mission it is clear that contributing governments believe that fighting the taliban warlords and the narcotics trade can prevent the return of qaeda or radical islamic groups inimical to western interests

than at producing concrete results for the stabilization plan in the view of these same officials nato may be expecting too much from some of its new member governments which only recently coming out

warlords vigorous drug trade the taliban and rudimentary economy and infra structure in the view of general eikenberry the enemy we face is not partic ularly strong but the institutions of the afghan

small number of welleducated afghans available for the legal profession in part due to insufficient resources provided by rome57 the quality and practices of natos own forces have also come into question by some us and european officials it has already been noted that some of natos newer member states attemp t to manage prts with troops not yet trained for stabilization mission in dangerous environment some nato forces also do not have the appropriate equi pment for their tasks they may lack nightvision equipment or the technology necessary to detect roadside bombs some nato governments send forces ina ppropriate for the task forces that are heavy on support functions but light on combat capabilities these governments tend to be reluctant to send their forces out into the field to confront the taliban nd to control warlords and their militias the result in this view has been that british canadian dutch and us forces bear disproportionate share of the most dangerous tasks58 the united states has made an evident effort through its prts to engage local afghan leaders and the general population to convince them of the worth of isafs mission while some progress has clearly been
