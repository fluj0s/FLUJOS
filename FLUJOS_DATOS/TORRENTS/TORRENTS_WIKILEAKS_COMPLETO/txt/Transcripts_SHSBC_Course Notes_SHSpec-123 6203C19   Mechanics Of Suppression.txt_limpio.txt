6203c19 shspec123 mechanics of suppression the axioms always have been way ahead of us trying to get scientology tech to catch up with them is tough job the axioms contain the basic data on suppressors under the heading of notisness notisness is suppressed isness it is the effort to put an isness out of existence running lies out of bank runs out alterisness and notisness alterisness is change it sits between an isness and suppression time mechanically is change cycle of action runs from nonexistence to an existence to nonexistence the first material on this is science of certainty see pab 3 certainty processing p 4 the earliest reference is to journal of scientology issue 16g this is scientology the science of certainty the somethingnothing process the cycle of action never entered in it was just alternate something and nothing used to unstick maybe most people consider maybe as an unknown though it isnt really an unknown except perhaps mechanically maybe is really the nomansland between the certainty that something is and the certainty that it isnt cycle of action can be stacked alongside maybe and you could say that change is maybe it looks in the reactive mind as though the middle of cycle of action is maybe so that all change is maybe and therefore if anything is changed maybe it isnt start change stop certainty maybe certainty we get new process out of the above the somethingnothing process it is hard to word this so that it is comprehensible to mind we have had trouble processing notis somethingnothing lies etc lies get into creating which beefs up some banks this new process somethingnothing which is class i process class i auditor is relatively unskilled and is only permitted to audit process that he has had success with on pcs see p 152 and hcopl 29sep61 hgc allowed processes needs refinement on wording perhaps it is just it is it isnt repetitively if he is run awhile on this the pc will move on the track he will also before long deliver up his chronic somatic ptp current difficulty or whatever by applying the process directly to his case what you are doing is running him on the cycle of action you havent said whether the it isnt is vanishment or notisness but the pc will always run it as notis or suppressors so you are running direct suppressors and the thing he is most immediately suppressing is most likely to come into view his hidden standard or chronic ptp the thing he is trying to make up his mind about is something he has said it is about then not liking it has said it isnt this has left him in the maybe or whether it ever was is or will be you would get nowhere processing someone on maybe because basically there is such thing as maybe there is only creation and the conditions of the creation even when cycle of action has been completed it is still there as memory this gives the pc recording of the it is you never get pure nonexistence after an existence the only pure nonexistence was before the existence so this fantastically simple process can produce practically every other phenomenon in scientology it stems from existence and nonexistence which stems from perception and dontwanttoperceive which goes over into creativeness and destruction and wild bands of change in between most people avoid isnesses like the plague in the course of running the above process the uncertainty of the case blows off the openminded maybe case is the normal frame of mind for modern scientists they think lrh isnt scientific because he is so positive because he is not full of maybes scientists are always on the verge of something being revealed suddenly which scares them therefore they make bad auditors people that have lot of withholds dont want their minds to be invaded people are hung up in revelations the catholic church is against the idea of investigating the mind they are big on revelations which are all delusory modern sciences revelation is the hbomb but this is too big revelation so people wont look at it similarly with scientology it would be more successful to oppose the hbomb by cutting back the revelation to an investigation of the guy who pushes the button than to try to impress people with the whole picture of the hbomb with scientology revealing that it clears people is too much revelation you will have more success with do you have pain scientology would probably take quite awhile to do anything about that the person could confront that much you could run get the idea that there is pain there get the idea that there is pain there this would tum on the pain he could confront it because it is slightly on unlike his suppressed pains so he wont be faced with an unexpected revelation check every five or six commands to make sure he has followed the commands pains which appear in some previously nonpainful areas where the person has some malfunction will turn on he will be completing old cycles of action only two things can happen to person to have nothing appear and to have something appear so the two conditions of any game are appearance and nonappearance so we get the anatomy of games which is the context in which lrh originally studied this subject the opposing player in game either is or isnt the middle between it is and it isnt is what reads there are all kinds of ramifications of it is anything can be represented by it the opposing player the team either team etc the amount of is the person can conceive compared to the amount of isnt the person can conceive finds the disagreement between the isnt and the is that gives the read all the meter reads on is the disagreement between the it is and the it isnt two valences in one mind can produce quite disagreement eg an atheist and presbyterian it is the disagreement that gives the read so in the case of the atheist and the presbyterian you will get big registry on the meter from either one because of the other on 3dxx you will get as much charge off running terminals as oppterms the whole mass goes out of balance when you discharge one but that one wont discharge totally until you can discharge the other why are they counteropposed it is because one says certain principles are and the other says certain principles arent and viceversa they are violently opposed you will find that this is characteristic of every gpm package you get identities which are opposites which make problems so all these isnesses are opposed by all these notisnesses it is heavily charged and violent because of all these disagreements you could probably put this theory into any process for instance you could make prepcheck zero question out of it have you ever considered that another didnt exist or have you ever insisted something was with that you would get tremendous number of overts since trying to damage something is trying to make it not exist and when you are creating something you are asserting it is every overt is an assertion that something is or isnt this is all very black and white unlike nonaristotelian logic which insists that positives and negatives dont exist it is true that there are gradient scales and that ultimates are unattainable but you would be speaking nonsense to say that positives do not exist though ultimates dont general semantics see alfred korzybskis general semantics and modern science shy completely away from positiveness and certainties as time drags out positiveness reduces the less concept of time person has the less positive things seem all you have to be is aware of the nowness of the instant and you get quite bit of isness and notisness coming in this occurs during havingness the walls seem brighter what happens is that the notisness disappears and is replaced by nonexistence it ceases being suppression and becomes so to speak an awareness of nonexistence rather than suppression of existence person sits surrounded by masses these are all notisnesses the first thing the pc would say about them is that they dont exist as he runs havingness and comes up to pt the walls get brighter and these things would disappear but when you run some people on havingness it goes from notisness to nonexistence on such clearcut track that as you run havingness on them and make the walls more real their bank materializes and they have people standing in the room you run off the notisness by running on the isness of the wall the notisness that pushed the picture into invisibility released as the persons reality on the wall increased you ran out the invisibility of the isness the people have always been there but he has notised them and has had to be quite careful about them all this time the fellow whom you audit on and on who never gets any pictures is classic he is totally suppressing because there is something he is deathly afraid will appear you could make list of who or what would be afraid to find out oppterm the terminals etc as this ran awhile the dead bodies that he has notised would start to to show up sometimes someone in weakened condition will take his attention off these things for awhile and one will materialize and spook him he will say that he has been blanketed many people dont have time track they have only series of notisnesses these are the calm people hah there are some pretty hideous phenomena that can occur while running this out but continuing to run it will turn them off auditors used to get upset by this while running notknow they would get curious when the pc actually notknew something to the point of its vanishing and go off in q and and never flatten the process of course this was terribly restimulative on the subject of notfindout the notis button when the notis disappears the isness materializes and scares the pc to the point at times where the pc decides never to let that happen again the pictures that turn on can be more real than pt for awhile this is quite surprise pc gets afraid to find out when an identity in the bank has been asserting isness and somebody else has been asserting notisness various bank phenomena turn on and off and the pc gets stuck then he gets afraid to find out something is liable to materialize to appear this makes bad auditor he is just shaky on the subject of things appearing he can be gotten over it educationally andor with processing it is it isnt does it 3dxx would do it as would various prepcheck and notisness questions etc another method is change in the withhold system see pp 186 190 above also see hcob 21mar62 prepchecking data p 2 to use the withhold system on suppressors add appear before who this might even run an engram go when all appear and who appear is what might have appeared or revealed itself or should have shown up at that point or is there anything that didnt show up this mechanism helps get suppressors off the withhold beefed up in this way it might be strong enough to run an engram
