local and national disc ussions on water management and water scarcity water and species management i ssues were brought to the forefront when severe drought in 2001 ex acerbated competition for scarce water resources and generated conflict among several interests farmers indian tribes commercial and sport fishermen other recreationists federal wildlife refuge managers environmental groups and state local and tribal governme nts the conflicts over water distribution and allocation are physically and legally complex reflecting the varied and sometimes competing uses of limited water supplies in th basin for management purposes the basin is divided at iron gate dam into the upper and lower basins as is true in many regions in the west the federal government plays prominent role in the klamath basins water management this role stems from three primary activities 1 the operation and management of the bureau of reclamations klamath water project and ce ntral valley project eg trinity river dams 2 management of fe deral lands in the basin incl uding five national wildlife refuges several national fore sts and public lands and 3 implementation of federal laws such as the endangered species act clean water act cwa and national environmental policy act nepa conflict was sparked in ap ril of 2001 when the bureau of reclamation which has supplied water to farms in the upper basin for nearly 100 years announced that water would be available for farms normally receiving water from the upper klamath lake to avoid jeopardizing the existence of three fish species listed as endangered or threatened under the while some water wa s subsequently made available to some farmers from other sour ces eg wells and other bureau sources many farmers faced serious hardships during reclamations operations in september of 2002 warm water temperatures and atypically low flows in the lower klamath contributed to the death of at least 33000 adult salmonids this die off damaged fish stocks and the tribes commercial fishermen and recreational anglers that catch klamath fish there have been many studies biolog ical opinions and operating plans over recent years all of which have been c ontroversial the events of 2001 and 2002 prompted renewed efforts to resolve water conflicts in the klamath basin congress has responded to the controversy in num ber of ways including holding oversight hearings and appropriating f unds for activities in the area this report provides an overview of recent conflict in the klamat h basin with an emphasis on activities in the

goal federal agencies are to consult with either the fish and wildlife service fws for terrestrial and freshwater species or the national marine fisheries service nmfs for ma rine species and anadromous fish on agency actions eg project operations for given year that might affect listed species and are to avoid jeopard izing its continued existence4 when federal agency proposes an action

nmfs identifies reasonable and prudent alternatives rpas to the proposed agency action that would avoid jeopardy if jeopardy cannot be avoided the agency must forego the propos ed action seek an exemption or as the supreme court has noted proceed at its own peril in light of the civil and criminal penalties applicable under the esa6 thus even though civil or criminal penalties have seldom been imposed the opinions and recommendations rendered by the fws and nmfs in practice are compelling the agency and certain others may petition the secretary of the interior to convene an endangered

basin provides habitat for several endangered and threatened species three aquatic species the lost river and shortnose suckers7 listed as endangered in 1988 and coho salmon8 listed as threatened in

in 1905 and largely completed in 1907 the project is one of the oldest us reclamation projects the project is different from many other reclamation projects because the basins geography makes it difficult to find suitable sites for reservoir storage upper klamath lake is the primary source for project water however the lake is not storage reser voir such as is found at other reclamation project sites because it is relatively sha llow and has little storage carryover from year to year and thus is highly dependent on current precipitation nd snowmelt for water supply through this project reclamation facilities control klamath and lost river flows between the link river dam at th outlet of the upper klamath lake and the keno water level regulation dam see figure 2 the link

lake which is also the principle source of water for the project the suckers are particularly important to the klamath modoc and yahooskin tribes who use the fish for ceremonial purposes but historically relied on the fish for sustenance upper basin tribes and recreational anglers also used to catch salmon however iron gate dam constructed in 1962 blocks salmon passage upstream see figure 1 portions of the upper klamath river support major trout fishery and other recreational activities in particular 11 miles of the upper klamath river from the jc boyle powerhouse to the californ

destination for commercial and private whitewater rafting and kayaking water rights the allocation of water rights in the upper klamath basin is subject of continuing debate the stat of oregon controls its water allocation however certain federal or trust rights g tribal rights have very early high priority rights and there also are federal water rights associated with federal land reservations eg national fo rests and national wildlife re fuges however many of the regions water rights have not been qua ntified general adjudication of oregon water rights and priorities began in 1975 and is still unde rway this process will establish or register quantities and priorities of all rights in the upper basin it is expected to be completed in 200821 reclamation began acquiring water rights for the kl amath project in 1905 and filed formal application with the state of oregon in 1909 to ppropriate water for delivery to landowners within the project ar ea some private rights predate the 1909 rights for reclamation purposes in 1957 the bistate klamath river compact22 gave domestic including municipal users and irrigators in the upper basin preferential use of unallocated water supplies however the effect of the compact is not clear because it excepts the rights and obligations of the united states further it is unclear what if any wate r was unappropriated by 1957 although they have yet to be quantifie d the klamath tribes may have water rights that predate those of irrigators court has held that the rights of the klamath tribes have priority date of time

tribes 1864 treaty with the us government24 these tribal water rights could take precedence over any other water rights in the basin recent court decision clarified both the prio rity date of the tribes ri ghts and their possible scope the federal district court for oregon held that the klamath tribes have reserved gathering rights along with their hunting fishing and trapping rights and that all of these rights have accompanying water rights25 the decision stipulated that these rights are to be quantified at level that will sustain productive habitat so that there will be game to hunt and fish to catch as we ll as edible plants to gather the state had looked to language statin g that the tribes were entitle d rights to natural resources that would provide the indians with livelihood that is to say moderate living26 view that would have entitled tribes only to that amount of unconsumed water flowing through each descri bed river reach as of the date of the first adair case or the quantity of water claimed by the bia for physical habitat maintenance flows whichever is less however the court concluded that the tribes water could not be reduced below that n ecessary to maintain productive habitat and that to do otherwise would be tantamount to assigning 1979 or 1984 priority date to the tribes water rights result that was not permissible because the priority date of the tribes rights is time immemorial how this holding will affect klamath basin water allocations under the ongoing wa ter rights adjudication is not yet clear the six national wildlife refuges in the upper klamath basin were established between 1908 and 195827 two of these refuges lower klamath nwr and tule lake nwr rely on water from the klamath project these refuges have received lower priority for water than irrigators or tribes thus they may not receive water in times of shortage and often depend on irrigation return flows however the lower klamath nwr est 1908 may have fede ral reserved rights for an asyet undetermined amount of water suffi cient to accomplish its purposes28 the presence of migratory birds and at least one species listed under the also may affect the water supplies

project users from the lake in nondroug ht years and could have restored some wells and saved pastures and some row crops but came too late in the season to provide significant help to farmers the

payments under federal crop insurance and other disaster assistance programs it is not clear to what extent this relief was made available unlike farms the lower klamath nwr did not receive water from

believed water manageme nt decisions in the upper basin contributed to the 2002 fish kill ot hers believed flows similar to 2001 would not have prevented the fish kill regardless the direct cause of this fish kill was an epizootic disease78 several factors contributed to stressful conditions for fish which ultimately led to the epizootic disease 1 an above average number of chinook salmon entered the klamath river from the ocean between the last week in august and the first week in september 2002 2 river flow and volume of water in the fishkill area were atypically low due in part to drought and 3 water temperatures were very warm79 these three factors resulted in high fish densities which may have been further exacerbated by impeded fish passage upstream due to low water depths of certain riffles perhaps caused by higher trinity water flows several years earlier that may have changed the stream bed the warm water temperatures and high fish density created ideal conditions for pathog ens to infect salmon and spread quickly however neither the flows nor the temper atures that occurred were unprecedented80 it is not clear to what degree reclamations spring 2002 decisions contributed to these factors but the nrc postulated that the flows in the trinity river could be most effective in lowering temperatures presumably in the future81httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33098crs19

subject of new lawsuits from agricultural interests as agencies and administrations attempt to implement different policies the plaintiffs in suits may change even if the nature of challenges remains the same for example as just discussed fishermen sued with respect to the 2000 operations plan and irrigators sued to enjoin the 2001 operations plan84 or to receive compensation for reduction in

for listed species while not reducing water available for irrigation the issue of water availability is most serious during spawning periods and during dry summer mont hs when irrigation water is essential for crops and low lake levels and low instream flows can lead to water temperatures that harm fish populations93 storage one strategy for increasing the water available to farmers and fish during lowflow periods is to store water during spring floods for release when water is more scarce however the geography of the upper basin offers little in the way of potentially suitable sites even

generally favorable for usual storage reservoirs in particular attention has centered on long lake valley located s outhwest of upper klamath lake according to reclamation conver ting long lake valley into reservoir could yield up to 250000 acrefeet of water with depth of 250 to 300 feet when full103 storage at this site could provide flows to upper klamath lake or the klamath river during times of shortage these flows would likely be cooler and thus more beneficial to fish particul arly coho salmon than additional water available from upper klamath lake as with options to expand upper klamath lake however there are uncertainties associated with developing storage at long lake storage would depend on the availability of spring spills and the environmental impacts of diverting flows to this offstream storage site are unclear it is also unclear whether the geology of long lake would provide good barrier to prevent leakage while reclamations initial examination of the valleys floor is promising investigations of the valleys walls are still underway if these studies ggest that the valleys walls and floors are sufficiently impermeable then reclamation may move ahead with full feasibility study such study however would not begin until funding plan has been established according to gao reclam ation estimates that feasibility study would take three years to complete and would

water rights for that year and then releases water downstream that it would otherwise pump to farmers from upper klamath lake to da reclamation has used this water bank primarily to increase instream flows during the spring runoff while reclamations water bank is one of the few activities that actually makes water available for instream uses it may not be longterm solution in particular the waterbank may be difficu lt to maintain because of its substantial annual cost as shown in table 1 reclamation paid more than 12 million for water in the last three years continuing the program is expected to cost an additional 76 million per year excluding administrative costs112 therefore budget watchdogs and some environmental organizations argue that tax dollars would be better spent to purchase agricultural lands thereby permanently reducing this source of demand for irrigation water see land retirement belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33098crs25 113 gao report 2005 p 26 114 gao report

following the shortage of surface water in 2001 there is broad interest in exploring the use of ground water to augment or replace surface water for certain uses and to augment stream flows118 and the rate of well drilling appears to be increasing throug hout the basin between 2001 through 2003 124 irrigation wells were drilled up fro m 14 in the previous three years furthermore reclamation relied heavily on groundwater pumping to meet its 2004 water bank targets in that year recl amation obtained near ly 70 approximately 60000 af of its deliveries by pumping groundwater while drawing groundwater can help reduce water shortages during times of drought the longerterm impact of groundwat er pumping on the regions aquifers and potential stream flows is not clear to gain better

study in 1998119 the study is expected to be substantially completed in 2005120 in study focused on the wa ter bank the usgs concluded that groundwater pumping has increased in recen t years and that increased pumping has affected the water table specifically the usgs found that increased pumping has caused well interference seasonal waterlevel declines of up to 20 feet and yearto year declines of up to 8 feet121 however these effects vary throughout the upper basin and the long term consequences of pumping at 2003 and 2004 rates are unclear fish passage and water quality while increasing

of environmental stresses and conditions according to the nrc hatchery juveniles tend to be larger than their wild counterparts these larger juvenile s could harm the wild populations through

completion of biological opinions for the operation of th project on highest priority basis and the acceleration of fish screen constructi on to minimize the number of fish entering the canal the major water diversion from upper klamath lake while this entity reached some of its objectives including completion of the new canal fish screens on april 1 2003 it appears that the group s become less active in recent years efforts to coordinate continue in october 2004 four federal agencies166 and the states of oregon and california signed an agreement to form the state and federal klamath basin coordination group under th agreement they resolved to place priority on their klamath basin activities and on their coordination and communication with one anothe r and with tribal govern ments local governments private groups and individuals to resolve the basins issues167 while there is general acknowledgment that coordination and informa tion sharing has improved in recent years the effectiveness of this recent agreement is unknown selected regional entities in addition to the federal and state coordinating groups there are more than 15 subba groups major nongovernmental planning entity in the upper basin is the upper klamath basin working group or hatfield group168 this entity has drafted plan169 for the upper basin and is currently sponsoring studies and restora tion activities on the sp rague and williamson rivers it also works to involve privat landowners in restor ation activities the groups 7member science committ ee is helping set prioritie s for restoration

july 11 2005in the trinity river basin major planning entity is the trinity management council tmc the tmc reports to the secr etary of the interior and is responsible for management and oversight of the trinity river restoration program it is supported by several entities including technical advisory committee independent review panels and an adaptive environm ental assessment and management team the council makes recommendations to reclamation regarding the timing of instream flow releases from the trinity ri ver diversion it also works on channel rehabilitation sediment management and wa tershed restorati on activities in the trinity basin in the lower basin two major nongove rnmental management entities are the klamath river basin fisheries task fo rce and fisheries management council170 as established in 1986 the task force guid the klamath river basin conservation area restoration program working by consen to coordinate re storation planning fund restoration projects and express opinions on issu affecting the klamath river171 for example the task force deve loped longrange plan for fisheries restoration in the klamath river basin conservation area and has been undertaking regional restoration activities172 the task force also s ponsors directors for six sub basins these directors who also act as grant writers raise awareness of fish needs in the subbasins and help to coordinate and encourage restoration activities on private lands the klamath river basi n fisheries manageme nt council receives funding from the task force but is sma ller entity focused on the scientific aspects of restoration the councils technical team mode ls klamath fish stocks and reviews harvest and management go als ultimately the counc il makes recommendations to the pacific fishery management council regarding catch l imits and management objectives for the klamath fisheries authorization for both these entities sunsets in 2006 while these entities generally operate separately formation of basinwide task force is topic of continual discussi on for number of years the trinity management council consider ed expanding representation to the upper basin but this proposal never came to fruition recen t efforts focus on creating new basin wide entity in particular reclamati on has released two draft proposals for klamath river basin conservation implemen tation program or cip the cip is reclamations response to nmfs may 2002 biological opinion which directs reclamation to establish basinwide plan for restoring the coho salmon in consultation with stakeholders173 however the cip has been met with significant resistance in particular lower basin entities have expressed concern that an organization managed by reclamation would not sufficiently represent their interestshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33098crs38 174 people refer to the workshops by the name of mediator bob chadwick who facilitates the workshops 175 klamath watershed conference commun ities resources and restoration putting what we know to work held feb 2626 2004 in klamath falls or 176 sponsors include the klamath compact co mmission oregon state university extension klamath fallsand the upper klamath basin working group 177 personal communication on sept 20 2005 with lori fernlund oregon state universitywhile there is currently resistance to reclamations cip basin stakeholders including native american tribes farmersirrigators local businesses federal state and local agencies environmental groups and interested community members have been coming together through seri of threeday work shops these greater klamath basin stakeholders work shops or chadwick workshops174 were prompted by session facilitated by bob chadwick at the klamath watershed conference of 2004175 following the conference coalition of stakeholders initiated subsequent workshops which ve been sponsored by several basin entities176 these meetings which are ongoi ng and sometimes draw over 100 people are the main focus of activity in the basin the purpose of these meeting is to address three questions 1 is there any way to deal with competing demands for water that recovers the fish yet sustains and enhances the rural communities 2 can we create fair and equitable solutions and 3 how can we solve these problems locally from the bottom up rather than top down177 the workshops are largely focused on giving each participant the opportunity to speak and be listened to in supportive environment in addition the workshop participants develop collective statements including shor t term purpose statement and strategies and actions for the next year due to the widespread participation in these meetings some see them as grassroots entity that could eventua lly provide support for reclamations cip or that could agree on an alternative plan of action conclusion while drought exacerbates water supply i ssues conflicts have been continuous in the klamath basin because demands are greater than current supplies reducing demand has proven difficult due to the im portance of water for sustaining both irrigation and the endangered fisheries upon which tribes and commercial fishermen depend however some pr ogress has been made ce 2001 and 2002 studies have increased understanding of fisheries needs groundwater aquifers and the geology of storage sites ecosystem re storation projects are slowly improving hab itat and water quality further activities such as the chadwick meetings appear to be increasing communication and building mutual understanding throughout the basin while some progress has b een made number of uncer tainties remain in july of 2005 another fish kill occurred thus dem onstrating that the longterm health of the fishery is still in doubt it also is uncl ear whether sufficient st eps have been taken to prevent another agricultural crisis additional questions include 1 is there sufficient coordination and unde rstanding to develop basinwide management planhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33098crs39 and 2 what should be the federal role in facilitating and implementing such an agreement given the number of issues it is likely that some level of conflict will persist and given the presence of the federal irrigation project and federal responsibility under the cwa and other federal laws signif icant federal issues and involvement will continue it is also likely that congress could be faced with number of decisions related to the klamath basin perhaps most pr essing is the decision of whether to reauthorize the klamath ri ver basin conservation area restoration program pl 99552 which sunsets in 2006 and which authorizes activities of the klamath fishery management council and the klamath basin fisheries task force further there is the question of how much if any money to appropriate for klamath basin activities in the nearterm congress will lik ely be asked to tinue funding habitat restoration activities recl amations water bank and dditional studies further congress may be faced with decisions over whether to authorize and provide appropriations for new or expanded stor age dam removal projects and land purchases
