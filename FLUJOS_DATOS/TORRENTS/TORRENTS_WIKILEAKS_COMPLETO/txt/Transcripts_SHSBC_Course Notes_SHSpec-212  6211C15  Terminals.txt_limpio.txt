6211c15 shspec212 terminals there is an item on the bulletin board about nixon we really clobbered him i hit him because he hit mary sue he was using the us secret service as sort of private gestapo all over washington which didnt seem right you will notice that after country has defeated country b customs of country b will show up in almost anyone will take on the color of his oppterm this is horrible but true people tend to think of themselves as the cowboy in the white hat and the oppterm as the cowboy in the black hat however the only real to tell whether you are dealing with terminal or an oppterm is whether it turns on pain or sensation pain shows that it is terminal sensation shows that it is an oppterm some people get tangled up because they consider themselves to be the guys in the black hat if you get terminal on the oppterm side or vice versa the consequence is great confusion such an item combination terminal turns on pain and sensation this is deteriorated package mark it in the center of the line plot its legitimate it is new terminal that has attributes of both terminal and oppterm sort of end of the road combination terminal which is lock on both the terminal chain and the oppterm chain in national life you get succeeding generations of politicians performing as combination terminals the us defeats germany then somewhere up the track there is tendency towards democratic fascism in the us it is ok for democracy to exist as long as we can also operate gestapo its that sort of thing that i tend to keep an eye on you may not realize it but you are all members of secret society you have been for very long time it is the spg you can enlist anyone there are dues only performance is required it is the society for the prevention of government it is interesting that man hasnt yet realized that government is the cause of his wars pure government attacks an sp government thus producing combination terminal the pure government henceforth isnt so pure keep this up and you will get what we have in the way of government lrh recently received an invitation to be part of group that is supposed to figure out what should be done with governments and man and atom bombs all the group is doing is meeting in the hope that someone will come up with solution all they are doing is to get people in communication they havent approached governments the reason why government occupies so much of peoples attention is that governments have spokesmen and salesmen while individuals do not democracy is highly publicized but in democracy everything is the peoples fault so the head of the government has responsibility but the people have real choice this is real mess with salesmen you get more and more government individuals become less and less the end of this process is totalitarianism the only reason you collide with government is that you are selling the idea of the individual you see that bettering things by handling the individual is workable system so you push it this puts you up against the government because it is for the government this makes you revolutionary in totalitarian world whether you intend to revolt or not the perfect reply to communist is to tell him that you are an anarchist that is the one thing that he cannot handle he is claiming that communism wants to do away with the state and you force him to say that government is necessary thus you turn him into conservative anarchy has always been rampant in countries just before the communists took over anarchy is the one thing that the communist fears he has so many overts on anarchists that they have almost become sacred to him similarly the us government is becoming more and more communistic eg with its tax laws things wont get straightened out in the political arena they will just get more and more confused you can predict the politics of the future by looking at the opposing sides and combining the least desirable characteristics of both combination terminals in politics occur because the least admired characteristics tend to persist that which is least admired tends to persist we are going to get the worst of russia and the us combined into super state unless we stop it this is also the fate of any individual livingness alone will not lead to new highly desirable state because the above mechanism will occur in the course of handling cases you will get look at the eventual fate of any individual you process in the absence of further processing suppose you could locate the chief terminal and the chief oppterm in an individual without in any way relieving them you could take the least desirable characteristics of both and get the combination terminal the person would become in few generations those terminals and oppterms that are near the top will produce new pair but first they will produce new single terminal the new combination terminal as the gpm flies off you will see that this had been taking place the freedom that is there to be freed is fantastic because all cases are in very deteriorated state when we first discovered the tremendous power that the basic postulate of an individual could exert over him in the course of creating the sections of the gpm we tended to see it as something brand new despite the fact that it is mentioned in the definition of the first dynamic in dianetics the original thesisi the dynamic of self consists of the dynamic thrust to survive as an individual to obtain pleasure as an individual and to avoid pain it covers the general field of food clothing and shelter personal ambition and general individual purpose p 31 see also advanced procedures and axioms p 42 and p 270 above thetan does various basic things following the laws governing theta as formulated in the axioms however he also splinters off and postulates some portion or specialization of them he tries to go forward with this specialization as an individual purpose and trying to effect this purpose moves on with lot of accumulated mass and things like terminals oppterms combination terminals items upsets etc thus the thetan builds up section of the gpm then he postulates something else and builds up another section of the gpm that dwindles out it gets blown up thoroughly and the thetan gets sort of out of it he forgets it utterly then he makes up new individual purpose actually all these purposes are in controversion to the basic laws of this universe theta and the purposes of thetans and if there is any reason why it builds up mass it is that it is an alteris of the axioms the thetan is an individual already in games condition with his fellows and the universe then he decides to be even more individual and makes basic postulate it is this basic postulate that we are dragging up as goal this postulate is counter to the agreements on the structure of the universe as contained in the axioms so the thetan is now individuated out to the degree that he has pitted himself against the whole lot what we are finding out as we find items turn on somatics and clear the individual is that he hasnt gotten away with it there is the gpm and it is killing him he cant even execute his individual purpose or goal because it fights his own more basic agreements postulates etc he has called himself liar by violating these agreements eg the axioms and thus he has departed into superindividuality as the individual goes forth postulating new goal he is flying in the teeth of all his former agreements so now he gets to point where he explodes out of the bank then he postulates new individuation new basic purpose he lives this one out when he finally gets out of it he adds it to the old stuff that he has accumulated each new purpose gets messed up faster and faster he finds more and more things he cant do and that he can longer confront eventually he wont even explode out of the mass anymore one day he says row come its all black and he wont get out of the gpm again this is hell an oblivion of total pain and sensation whats hell in religions theyll have some metaphorical method of trying to communicate but if they were talking about hell this is hell they recognize there is something waiting for them in the future and they try to shorten it up and say its the next life and this time youll die and youll go to it well thats just enthusiasm the only alternative to this grisly picture is scientology but people have been saved before too many times on the track eg by the autodafe of the inquisition thats why they are decidedly reluctant to be saved by scientology someone who gets mad at scientology and refuses further processing is fool he isnt aware of his future of total pain and sensation which is hell but thetans have long history of being sold pieinthesky so they are likely to be skeptical about what scientology has to offer someone who has been sold on heaven and hasnt found it and who knows that hell is possible begins to regard the idea of freedom with some doubt he has been straightened out before and has been cheated this area of betrayal comes up in the course of clearing someone the offer of help restimulates this area and the pc will fight help all the way until he gets reality on what is happening the kindest way to handle him is to give him fast reality on the fact that you mean business do something for him subjectively so that he will realize that he is on some kind of real road to truth the pc whose trust level is shot alterises commands doesnt answer etc the auditor can feel uncomfortable about this the healing sciences havent helped with their general ineffectiveness in most things wonder the pcs trust level is so low this is the main thing that gets in the way of dissemination the individual has fought the physical universe and the laws of the physical universe after agreeing to them he now alterises them since those laws concern matter energy space and time he starts accumulating mest that is what puts mest in his bank then he makes an individual purpose that has nothing to do with these other purposes he tries to go up against these other purposes with this individual purpose that causes lot of mass to accumulate then he does this again and again etc all this is true but this activity must have been based on very low level of confidence and trust anyway to have gone to all this trouble with all the individuation etc the thetan must have had very low level of trust and confidence he must have thought that what was going on was detrimental or he wouldnt have taken all this trouble to individuate from it most pcs are mad at the physical universe to some degree now here is something ive never told you before but it follows from the sixtyfour lectures of the 1952 philadelphia lectures the physical universe will stay there for the individual until the individual gets back to the first individuating goal that he made after agreeing to the axioms at this point you would think that the pc would hit total ot but he wont he still has to handle the axioms you will now have to back up through the axioms the pc at this point in processing would start telling you about the axioms even if he had never heard of them they are getting ready to blow the individuals agreement to the axioms his contribution to the axioms to that degree is in all probability his first basic trust you may have to go back to the axioms and run them sooner or later the pc will collide with them going backward the purposes that you will run into at first are all purposes that are individuations from the basic purpose you have to go long way back to pick up more than the first dynamic even today the fellow is generally on an inversion of the first you will find that there are seven dynamics that will invert on you you must reverse the inversion process before the pc gets to straight first dynamic he then has to go quite ways before he gets sight of the other dynamics that is what you are tackling in every pc there is deteriorated trust in everything not only in his fellow man but also in organizations group activities and any effort to do something for him he starts to get nervous when you start to do anything for him because he knows that that has always been dangerous for him you are reversing his experiential track so he is going back into areas that he thinks are dangerous and thinking these areas are dangerous he is nervous this applies to every pc what is important is your skill as an auditor the smoothness of your model session the positiveness of what you are doing the fact that you can produce result in the pc in which he has reality these things make him realize that you are going in the direction of freedom the pc may be so downscale that when he sees that he is going towards freedom he cant have it because it looks too good and you get into another wrigglewraggle you can add to the above phenomenon the idea that if you existed and if you freed man and did things for the physical universe then this person couldnt execute the first goal you will run into in processing him this goal one is not the first goal that the pc made it is the first one you find with this addition youve got rockslammer his distrust is not built just on goal one it goes earlier and is built on the quicksand that everybody is made of to handle him you have to find the oppterm to what he is rockslamming on then it tends to blow up his whole viewpoint on the subject of scientology will shift see hcob 23nov62 urgent routine 212 opening procedure by rockslam an hparca skill this bulletin gives r212 procedure at this point r212 is also known as 3gaxx for rock slammers evidently it is form of 3gaxx that can be done by lower than class iv auditor many other bulletins and tapes on r212 follow soon as your auditing is less than perfect you rekindle or permit to remain all the morass of distrust that has been generated down the track all the betrayals of promises of heaven all his experience of hell you can flub little but if you let the case drift too far out without win and you will key in the whole background of there is heaven and you will pay the price the individuals reality on hell is much greater than his reality on heaven thus the longer you take to produce result on pc the harder it is to get the result because of the distrust factor you cant say positively that person isnt rockslammer because he may have to be processed awhile before it shows up some rockslammers are below being rockslammers at first the pc may at first simply be nattery and then you have to rely on intuition there is absolute test of absolution except persistent case progress rockslamming relates to the degree of overting in your direction and his belief that if you did not exist he could achieve his basic goal once you discover and he discovers that he is rockslammer the discovery of it tends to pull its teeth all you have to do is to list the oppose list to the thing on which he is rockslamming and it will blow up in smoke if its an auditor write an opposition list to an auditor and get the first pt package capable auditor should be able to straighten this out in two or three hours you can list goal against any terminal or oppterm that rockslams sometimes you will wind up with the persons goal if so opposition it unhandled rockslammers will frequently become combination terminals squirrels for instance combine scientology with something else because they realize that they are as crazy as loon to be attacking it
