feasible must consider their exposure to this emerging threat this report describes how workplace safety programs are being rec onsidered in this new light the world trade center site presented an immediate safety and health challenge for public agencies and onsite workers osha has jurisdiction in most disaster situations but exercises forbearance while local emergency authorities are dealing with rescue and recovery this period was unusually prolonged in the world trade case while workers and the general public were exposed to many toxic substances special enforcement and monitoring programs were adopted there incrementally for the future measures such as s 1621 and hr 4687 would provide for more thorough study and response to health impacts from such events general employer responsibilitie s that are relevant to the terrorism risk include building and site management worker s compensation and certain aspects of personnel policy such as those regarding vi olence in general proper attention to these routine matters as modified for the new range of risks will help assure that all that can reasonably done in preparation will be done in certain highrisk industries emerge ncy planning is required by number of laws most facilities that use large quantities of toxic or flammable materials must explicitly assess all potential accident modes adapt processes to minimize them and plan their responses to emergencies in cluding coordination with local emergency agencies the spread of anthrax through the mail has posed unique problems for many organizations osha and the centers for dis ease control have issued guidelines for dealing with this and other bioterror agents in workplaces legislation pl 107 188 has been passed to impr ove overall preparedness for

the world trade center or the pentagon or vi ctims of anthrax transmitted through the mails in preventing future incidents or mitigating the consequences people may find their most important roles as employer s or employees survey shows that 69 of firms had already taken tangible steps to enhance security by the end of 20011 the workplace is in effect key line of defense for homeland security this is recognized formally by participation of the department of labor in the homeland security council established by recent presidential directive aside from general concern with the welf are of their workers and protection of their property employers will have number of practical motivations for reducing their vulnerabilities to terrorism these consist of governmental mandates and legal liabilities including workers compensa tion most responsibilities are currently generic eg general fire protection rather than protec tions specifically responsive to terrorist threats this highlights the fact that most of the practical steps businesses can take will be found to be dual use ie also yieldi ng benefits in the normal civilian context as one commentator s suggested if businesses are looking for positive aspect of these unfathomable events it is that they will finally start doing all the things that ensure the safety of their employees and the continuity of their business that

regulations and guidelines will suggest many questions that need to be considered and may not be so obvious at first for example if portable fire extinguishers are installed how shall they be used training will be required but who should receive it perhaps only cer tain employees should be designated to use the extinguishers and receive the training in which cases should employees attempt to fight fire and when should th ey simply escape it may be decided that all firefighting be left to the professionals in which case extinguishers will not be installed except where required by local

terms to the incident with workers compensation payments estimated to total 35 to 4 billion or more than 1 million per fatality14 still in such cases insurers could ve tenable grounds to contest some of these claims it could be argued that injury by way of terrorism was not risk peculiarly related to the employment of the people in the buildings and this could place the injuries outside the

had often not explicitly addressed the risk of terrorism previously they are raising their premium rates especially where large numbers of employees are present at one location eg high rise office buildings under state laws insurers are not allowed to categorically exclude losses caused by terrorism although as noted in some states and situations incidents might fall outside the bounds of ge neral principles such as arising out of employment but while employers and their insurers must bear the risk of terrorism the insurers own backup part ners reinsurers are not as tightly regulated and have been excluding terrorism coverage thus some primary insurers are finding themselves exposed to potentially serious risk17 families of police and firefighters are eligible for special payment from

testing nd precautionary prophylactic treatment generally workers compensation will pay for treatment for workrelated injury or disease if it is known to have happened but in the case of bioterrorism this may not be known until testing is done so at least in the program coveri ng federal workers the situation is that workers compensation will cover the cost of testing and treatment retroactively if and only if the test is positive if the test is negative costs will be borne either by the employee by his or her health insurer or at its discretion by the employing

investigation of employees controlled access to facilities nd information security guards site surveillance and detailed planning to respond to threats and incidents in applying these to terrorism planning probably the most im portant will be access control19 depending on the type of operation and the results of threat and vulnerability assessment managers might choose to adopt one or more of the following limited number of entrances perhaps only one staffing of entrances by trained security personnel who perform bag searches deliveries be ing accepted only at designated receiving places and admittance of visitors by prearrangement on an access list and with escort by host throughout their visit however security will have to be balanced against the need for access especially where access is the very raison detre of th facility eg retail stores and many government offices discrimination and privacy while employers may tighten their screening of new employees trying as sometimes is said to not hire your problems there are limitations on what can be done legally categorically not hiring people of particular religious or national origin groups for ex ample could constitute unlawful discrimination doing various back ground checks on individuals may require explicit authorization from the applicant some factors including criminal records may not be considered in hiring decisions under some state laws on the other hand in certain critical occupations such as hazmat transportation criminal background checks are now required20 one might also question whether there is much predictive value in criminal records where terrorism is concerned as opposed to traditional problems such as pilferage indeed it appears that some firms could be overreacting barring anyone from any position who may have committed minor offenses at any time21 in climate of fear engendered by terrorism general suspicion may settle on certain ethnic groups employers should be aware that if

the latter three are designed to encourag planning and coordination with public authorities in localities that ma be affected there are pub licprivate overlaps in all of these however one of the challenges pr esented by industrial disasters is that they call for planning and response by so many parties and agencies an interagency group led by the environmental protection ag ency epa has tried to simplify the process for plant operators by issuing model plan that can be used to comply with many of the laws at once28 more broadly the presidents national strategy document indicates an

numerous facilities of substantial size at other firms that do not participate concern about remaining vulnerabilities prompted the congress in 1999 pl 10640 to call for special study by the partment of justice of possible terrorist dangers31 since the september 2001 terrorist ttacks s 1602 corzine et has been introduced to require plant operators to consider explicitly the risks of terrorist or criminal action including theft of hazardous materials and modify their operations so as to reduce the probability and potential consequences of releases the unique dangers associated with certa in other industries led to much more rigorous and specialized regulatory regimes for them many years ago most notably those for nuclear energy and hazardous ma terials hazmat transport these are explained in other crs reports32 emergency management systems starting around 1950 federal disaster planning went on two tracks for natural disasters and for possible nuclear attack civil defense over time concern about nuclear war decreased while perception grew that there was significant overlap in the requirements for these two types of preparedness in practice resources or iginally developed fo r civil defense were redirected toward natural disasters33 the priority pendul um may now have swung back toward military orientation but in any case the dual use concept appears still to be valid there is at least one issue in industria l disaster preparedne ss public disclosure of information that highlights significant difference between civilian and military issues the risk management plans under the clean air act include lists of toxic chemicals and analyses of worst case scenarios of possible releases into surrounding commun ities since at least 1993 when the regulations were under

difficult balancing here as disclosure of information could on the one hand increase the risks of terrorist acti ons while on the other lead to reduction in the risks of accidental rel eases or at least improve the publics ability to plan for emergencies in their communities another problematic aspect of information flow is that owners of critical infrastructure may be reluctant to disclose

workplaces into three levels of risk the vast majority of workplaces are in the green zone ie where contamination is unlikely the recommendations consist mainly of general hygienictype precautions actions that will minimize skin contact with the mail and are least likely to spread any contents in the air nitrile or vinyl gloves ar optional respirators are not recommended in the green zone in the yellow zone which includes facilities handling bulk mail andor mail coming from contaminated places engineering controls are the preferred strategy although these may take cons iderable time to implement these are aimed essentially at exhaust ventilation of air from ar ound mail handling machinery and thorough filtering of circulating air after engineering controls prudent work practices are called for such as using wet cleanin g methods and properly filtered vacuums finally impermeable gloves are called for properly chosen and fitted respirators should be used by those working around m achinery that could generate aerosolized particles eg automatic sorters36 finally the red zone applies to facilities where contamination is confirmed or strongly suspected only qualifie d emergency

labor and industry associations was established to monitor developments and recommend solutions while most observers consider usps response much improved since the confusing first days of the crisis

be shut down when contamination is found or ju st the immediate work area some also question the safety of cipro nd other antibiotics37 more broadly it remains to be seen how much of the financial cost of responding to this threat can be borne by the postal service the administration allocated 175 million in an emergency grant but much more will be needed for full implementation of steps such as irradiation moreover the usps financial condition has deteriorated due to decline in mail volume38 it is not clear whether private sector express delivery companies are gaining competitive advantage from the situation or whether the u sps should dopt any of their procedures in response while there are absolutes some consider the private company traffic less likely to contain dangerous
