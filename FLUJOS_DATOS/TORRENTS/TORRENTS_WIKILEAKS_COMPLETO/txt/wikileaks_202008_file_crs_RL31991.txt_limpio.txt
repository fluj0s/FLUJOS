gordon ranking democrat on the subcommittee opposed the bill according to science committee democratic membership news release representative gordon said that he is disappointed that we didnt wait for the columbia accident investigation board to report before marking up nasa workforce legislation he explained his opposition as follows on may 13th of this year all of the members of the democratic caucus of the science committee sent joint letter to chairman boehlert1 in that letter we asked him to delay the markup of any nasa workforce legislation until the columbia accident investigation board has reported and the committee has had chance to review its findings and recommendations admiral gehman has said on several occasions that the accident investigation board is examining issues related to nasas personnel contractors and culture as it attempts to ascertain the root causes of the accident indeed admiral gehman was quoted in yesterdays washington post as saying goodly portion of the report perhaps half will deal with issues of management at nasa we should wait to hear what the board concludes before we adopt legislative provisions that might prove either counterproductive or insufficient to address the underlying problems identified by the board2 among representative gordons other concerns are these that issues affecting all nasa employees be considered questions why

plan include safeguards for not compromising the safety or survival of any spacecraft or crew would provide that certain workforce authorities authorized in the bill would not apply to political appointees and would express the sense of congress that nasa conduct continuing program to recruit members of minority groups for positions in the agency among other amendments considered by the

board report in hand in any event i am convinced that we will have to revisit all of these issues to build safer nasa8 in the senate senator george voinovich introduced s 610 the nasa workforce flexibility act of 2003 on march 13 2003 and it was referred to the senate committee on governmental affairs the committees subcommittee on oversight of government management the federal workforce and the district of columbia conducted hearing on human capital at nasa on march 6 2003 the bill was markedup by the full committee and ordered to be reported with an amendment in the nature of substitute on june 17 2003 the amendment in the nature of substitute to the bill offered by senators voinovich and thomas carper and further modified by an amendment by senator richard durbin and agreed to by the committee included changes which would require nasas workforce plan to discuss the caibs workforce recommendations would remove the provision which would have lifted the cap on the number of employees who could participate in demonstration project at nasa would provide that more than 25 of the total number of recruitment redesignation relocation and retention bonuses awarded in any year could be awarded to supervisors or management officials and would add language to restrict exchange assignments to individuals in scientific and technical positions s 610 was reported srept 108113 on july 28 20039 the cbo estimates that s 610 would cost 80 million dollars over the period fy2004 through fy2008 specifically cbo estimates the cost at 6 million fy2004 13 million fy2005 18 million fy2006 21 million fy2007 and 22 million fy200810 the estimate for s 610 is higher than that for hr 1085 because the senate bill as reported but not as passed would have authorized an exchange program between nasa and the private sector that is not included in the house bill in the committee report accompanying s 610 senator durbin expressed his view that the provision in the bill which would authorize exchange assignments between nasa and private sector employees raises serious concerns about the potential for conflicts of interest11 he noted senator voinovichs commitment to address such concerns and said that he was confident of making further progress on the provision prior to consideration of the legislation by the senate senator daniel akaka also presented his views in the committee report stating that as congress prepares to grant new personnel flexibilities to nasa congress must provide strong 8 us house science committee democratic caucus committee bill fails to deal

challenges12 specifically with regard to the provision on the exchange assignments mr akaka believes that for the exchange program to be effective there must be in place an adequate internal management structure that is transparent and accountable for the proposed exchange program to work there needs to be sufficient safeguards to make certain that the program does not result in workforce shortfalls nasa should not lose more employees and talent than it gains from the private sector as such there should be controls over the proportion and number of private sector and nasa employees who participate in the program the provision would benefit from additional safeguards to ensure that contractors do not use the program to gain competitive advantage in future contracts with nasa one way to address that concern is to institute cooling off period whereby contractors participating in the program would be restricted from contracting with nasa for an appropriate period of time moreover there need to be assurances that minority owned and small businesses have the access to participate in the exchange program although s 610 does not specifically address contract management i believe that with such heavy reliance on contract personnel it is critical that there is effective and strong contract management at nasa13 when the senate proceeded to the consideration of s 610 on november 24 2003 senator voinovich for himself and senator carper offered substitute amendment 2214 that was agreed to by voice vote the same day the senate agreed to the committee amendment as amended and passed the bill as amended by voice vote and without debate the substitute amendment dropped provisions in s 610 as reported that would have authorized exchange assignments for scientific and technical personnel between privatesector entities and nasa it also reconciled differences between the hr 1085 and s 610 provisions on distinguished scholar appointment authority annual leave

the senate with current law both bills would create new chapter 98 in title 5 government organization and management of the united states code to provide enhanced flexibilities for human resources management at nasa18 the sidebyside comparison follows the organization of hr 1085 hr 1085 and s 610 would among other provisions provide more remunerative amounts of and greater flexibility in administering recruitment relocation and retention bonuses permit term appointments up to six years and authorize pay up to the vice presidents salary currently 201600 in january 2004 until enactment of the omnibus appropriations bill then expected to be 203000 for critically needed scientific technical professional or administrative personnel unlike s 610 hr 1085 would allow personnel management demonstration project at nasa to cover up to 8000 employees rather than the up to 5000 employees permitted under current law both bills hr 1085 section 9814 s 610 section 9813 also would allow the administrator of nasa to place limited term and limited emergency appointees in careerreserved positions in the senior executive service ses careerreserved positions are required by statute to be filled by career appointees and are designated as such if placing career appointee in the position is necessary to ensure impartiality as of june 30 2002 nasa had 505 ses allocations 330 of these were

the title iii subtitle securities and exchange commission provisions of hr 1836 were included in hr 658 which was enacted as pl 108044 on july 3 2003 16 us congress house committee on government reform civil service and national security personnel improvement act report to accompany hr 1836 108th cong 1st sess hrept 108116 part 1 washington gpo 2003 17 as forwarded by the house subcommittee on space and aeronautics to the committee on science hr 1085 would have authorized voluntary separation incentive payments vsips commonly referred to as buyouts of up to 50 of an employees annual rate of basic pay for limited number of employees this provision is not included in hr 1085 as reported by the committee on science to the house of representatives 18 hr 1085 as introduced would have added the chapter to chapter 26 national space program of title 42 the public health and welfare united states code the house space and aeronautics subcommittee amended hr 1085 during markup to add the chapter to title 5 government organization and management crs7 careerreserved positions and the remaining were general positions which may be filled by career noncareer or limited term appointees19 if enacted this provision would give the administrator some additional flexibility in filling career reserved positions but might also be seen as an encroachment upon the ranks of career appointments on the one hand it is likely that the head of nasa could fill careerreserved position more quickly through the appointment of limited appointee than through the hiring of career appointee however the exercise of this authority would reduce the number of careerreserved positions within nasa available to career appointees finally while this provision applies only to nasa it is possible that should this section be enacted other agencies would view it as precedent and request the same flexibility in filling career reserved positions hr 1085 also would permit the administrator to appoint individuals who are not career appointees in the ses to careerreserved positions this provision however does not use the terms limited term appointee or limited emergency appointee to refer to an individual who would receive temporary appointment apparently hr 1085 would establish another category of ses appointee one that is as yet unnamed and only for nasa hr 1085 would be more restrictive than s 610 under the house bill careerreserved position would be vacant for someone other than career appointee to be appointed to it and it would be likely that the position would be eliminated within two years temporary appointment would be allowed for only two years with possibility of oneyear extension the senate bill would provide the administrator with broader authority while hr 1085 perhaps would address very specific need ie filling career reserved positions that might be eliminated within two years other issues that may arise during consideration of the legislation include the following with regard to the enhanced ipa authority extending assignments by four years instead of two years hr 1085 and s 610 5 usc 9808 should extensions of assignments continue to be reviewed in twoyear increments if the proposed four year extension is adopted with regard to the enhanced recruitment relocation and retention bonuses hr 1085 and s 610 5 usc 9804 9805 and the annual leave provisions hr 1085 5 usc 9813 s 610 5 usc 9812 what is unique about nasa that would require these more generous policies for nasa employees according to the office of personnel management the existing recruitment relocation and retention bonus authorities are not being fully utilized by federal agencies how fully has nasa used these 19 information provided electronically to crs by the us office of personnel management office of executive resources management july 1 2003 crs8 during the march 6 2003 senate subcommittee hearing sean okeefe administrator of nasa testified as to the reasons nasa is seeking the enhanced human resources management flexibilities with regard to the various provisions of the legislation he said that the nasa industry exchange program introduces means for nasa to engage in mutually beneficial collaborate ventures with industry to infuse new ideas and perspectives into the agency develop new skills within the workforce and strengthen mission capabilities without such authority talented individuals from industry remain an untapped resource for the agency since the salaries and benefits of the federal sector are not competitive with the compensation packages offered to industrys most talented workers enhancing the intergovernmental personnel act authority which allows for exchanges between the federal government and state and local governments universities and nonprofits will allow individuals from academia or other institutions to continue working in support of longterm projects or programs when the need for continuity is critical enhanced recruitment relocation and retention bonuses authority would base bonuses on the higher locality pay salaries allow greater amounts when coupled with longer service agreements and make more flexible payment options available which could be tailored to the situation at hand and tie payment of the incentive to actual performance the enhanced annual leave provisions are targeted particularly to midcareer hires who likely would give up attractive vacation packages to become firsttime federal employees these flexibilities help nasa to compete with the compensation packages available to private sector employers the bills provision to allow limited number of term appointments to be extended up to six years rather than four will enhance its usefulness by accommodating the length of some nasa programs and projects in addition the bill provides that term employee may be converted to permanent position in the same line of work without further competition provided requirements are met ultimately it may make the concept of term appointments more attractive to potential applicants and thereby provide more robust labor pool for nasa management to consider in order to attract worldclass talent into nasas most essential positions enhanced critical pay authority up to the vice presidents salary is sought which will help us to compete in an enormously competitive job market separation incentives buyouts are valuable tool to encourage voluntary attrition nasa needs the tools to encourage targeted attrition in areas in which the need for certain skills has diminished so that it can recruit and reshape workforce that is aligned to current and future mission needs the authority to pay higher amount as buyout is requested because the current amount is not always enough to entice highly paid nasa professionals to leave crs9 the demonstration project authority we are seeking would remove the coverage limit of 5000 employees to allow widespread testing of new ideas20 the international federation of professional and technical engineers aflcio ifpte represents more than 8000 nasa employees nationwide in june 25 2003 letter to representative sherwood boehlert chairman of the house committee on science ifpte announced that the union was endorsing hr 1085 as amended by the subcommittee on space and aeronautics at its june 26 2003 markup union president gregory j junemann wrote that ifpte is especially pleased with the rigorous notification planning and monitoring portions of the bill with the inclusion of financial incentives reserved almost exclusively for the recruitment and retention of rank and file technical staff in addition ifpte applauds you for ensuring that the proposed industry exchange program not be included in your bill ifpte believes that such program in any form would seriously compromise the agencys independence from the very contractors it must oversee the letter stated that the union will be looking for acknowledgment of those recommendations that come out of the final report of the columbia accident investigation board especially those pertaining to rectifying management problems at nasa21 the american federation of government employees afge represents workers at nasa at march 12 2003 house science committee hearing bobby harnage national president of afge testified about the unions opposition to most of the human resources proposals contained in this legislation according to mr harnage many of the proposals contemplated in this legislation have been presented elsewhere as governmentwide changes or earlier in the form of legislation prepared by nasas political leadership and have been rejected largely on the grounds that they undermine merit system principles that they would exacerbate the federal governments human capital crisis and that they would create serious conflicts of interests between private sector interests and the public good in addition they fail to address the root causes of nasas and the other executive branch agencies workforce problems inadequate salaries and mindless contracting out privatization and downsizing22 20 statement of sean okeefe
