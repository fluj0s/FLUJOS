regarding the nature of the threat prior to during or after the raising of the alertlevel the information conveyed to the public often has been inconsistent regarding the threat or the timing of

to the homeland have led to an erosion of confidence in the information conveyed to the nation congress is now considering legislation hr 1817 the department of homeland security authorization act for fy2006 to reform the homeland security advisor system to assure greater confidence in the threat information being conveyed to the nation universally understandable consistent and reliable national threat notification system is deemed necessary in todays world of increasing and time sensitive threats to the nation many believe that the notification of threat to the united states should be conveyed by single entity and the message should be consistent with other communications federal government officials may offer in times of crisis or national emergency the federal governments unity of message and coordinated delivery of the threat notification are widely seen as crucial to the effectiveness of the system designed to convey the message the systems color coded warnings have become the primary means by which the federal government communicates directly to the public its bottomline judgment on the risk of terrorist attack at any given time1 however the circumstances and explanations surrounding the warnings and changes in the homeland security advisory systems hsas color code to date have called into question the utility and credibility of the system in particular at times it appears the colorcode has been raised based on speculation that terrorist attack may occur rather than receipt of new threat information at other times warnings of heightened threats have been issued without changing the hsas and on numerous occasions agencies have provided different and sometimes contradictory information about threats to the homeland 1 house homeland security

crs3 though the homeland security act of 2002 is fairly clear regarding the transition of responsibility of administering national threat notification system from the attorney general to the secretary of homeland security there reportedly have been few occasions in the past couple of years that secretary ridge was frustrated when attorney general ashcroft announced terrorist threat information despite the fact that the homeland security act of 2002 transferred the responsibility of management of the hsas from doj to dhs also at times dhs has disagreed with the alarming tone of ashcrofts announcements4 this paper will discuss examples of uncoordinated national threat announcements between dhs doj and other federal government entities it is possible that recent changes of departmental and agency leadership may assist in resolving future occurrences of uncoordinated and premature threat announcements however the issue remains that previous threat announcements and arguably lack of discernible processes in determining from whom threat information is to be conveyed has seriously eroded the hsass credibility generating congressional review and discussion of ways to approach future national threat warning efforts threat notifications chronology september 11 september 24 2002 first time the threatlevel is raised from yellowelevated significant risk of terrorist attack to orangehigh high risk of terrorist attack pursuant to the responsibility given to the attorney general and delineated in hspd3 attorney general ashcroft announced on september 11 2002 that the us intelligence community has received information based on the debriefing of senior qaeda operative of possible terrorist attacks timed to coincide with the anniversary of the september 11 attacks on the united states however oneweek prior to the official notice put forth by the attorney general office of homeland security chief tom ridge reportedly stated that us officials do not have intelligence indicating terrorists are plotting another attack on the september 11th anniversary we do not anticipate raising the threat level for that day5 though it is common in the world of intelligence to receive information that contradicts previous analysis possibly explaining moving from an elevated yellow to high threat orange environment in oneweeks time the concern is that prior to the first use of the hsas two senior members of the administration spoke publicly to the status of the threat environment in this case the director of the office of homeland security seemed to have preempted the attorney generals responsibility to publicly announce information regarding the threat environment and the status of the hsas 4 john mintz chertoff orders agency review changes possible

of significant nature was discussed by senior administration officials in an open forum these instances did not result in change of the hsas on october 17 2002 director of central intelligence dci tenet stated before joint session of the house and senate intelligence committees you must make the assumption that qaeda is in an execution phase and intends to strike us both here and overseas thats unambiguous as far as i am concerned6 on november 15 2002 the fbi stated sources suggest qaeda may favor spectacular attacks that meet several criteria high symbolic value mass casualties severe damage to the us economy and maximum psychological trauma7 despite the tone of the warning white house spokesman scott mcclellan said the national alert status would remain unchanged although the previous two examples did not represent official public announcements the effect was the same in that both of these events were widely publicized both statements may have been analytically correct however potentially troublesome precedent was being set by senior officials offering diverging interpretations of the nations threat environment in public forum february 7 february 27 2003 second time the threatlevel raised to orange prior to the raising of the alert level the homeland security act of 2002 had been enacted november 11 2002 the act provided that the under secretary of iaip subject to the direction and control of the secretary of homeland security shall administer the homeland security advisory system hsas on february 7 2003 secretary of homeland security ridge announced that intelligence reports suggested that qaeda was planning attacks on apartment buildings hotels and other soft targets8 in the week leading up to the issuance of this threat warning and during the twentyday duration of this rise in the alert level numerous administration officials provided varying descriptions as to the level of specificity and immediacy of the threat homeland security secretary ridge said terrorist attack was unlikely one week after attorney general ashcroft stated that there was an increased likelihood of an attack on the united states during this same timeperiod dci tenet testified before congress that the information that led to this threat alert was as specific as it has ever been9 secretary ridge also stated during this alert level change that the

washington post february 16 2003 crs5 general ashcroft stated that specific intelligence was corroborated by multiple intelligence sources10 on february 24 2003 in the waning days of this increased alert level attorney general ashcroft stated that the threat of terrorist attack remained high and there were plans to downgrade the nations alert level less than three days later secretary ridge announced that the hsas was being lowered to yellow elevated march 17 april 11 2003 third time threatlevel raised to orange on march 17 2003 secretary of homeland security ridge stated that intelligence reports indicated qaeda would probably attempt to launch terrorist attacks against us interests to defend muslims and the iraqi people on the eve of the war in iraq secretary ridge informed the public that the terrorist threat level was being raised not because of any new threatening intelligence but because the war seemed likely to provoke terrorist response in the us11 prior to the war in iraq numerous administration officials including some at the cia and fbi and lawmakers believed that should the united states commence military operations in iraq terrorist attacks in the united states would be an inevitable cost of toppling saddam hussein12 in lowering the threat level on april 11 2003 dhs released statement that after an assessment of the threats by the intelligence community the department of homeland security had made the decision to lower the threat advisory level defense secretary rumsfeld later noted that the nation must remain vigilant and alert to the possibility qaeda or those sympathetic to their cause as well as former iraqi regime state agents may attempt to conduct attacks against the united states13 this change of alert level status was accompanied by continuing pattern of independent official announcements regarding possible threats to the nation including statements by the secretary of defense countering the reasoning used to lower the alert level threats remain of an attack from qaeda or iraqi sympathizers14 10 ridge attack is unlikely keep duct tape in storage newsday february 15 2003 11 nation at war domestic

security announced that the united states intelligence community believed qaeda had entered an operational period worldwide including plans to attack the united states on the morning of may 20 2003 dhs secretary ridge appeared before the house committee on homeland security and stated that america had the terror networks offbalance and that we are much safer as nation later that day in press conference held to announce raising the threat alert level secretary ridge reportedly stated in response to intelligence reports concerning antius terrorist group intentions and the recent attacks in saudi arabia and morocco15 we are raising the hsas to orange while there is not credible specific information with respect to targets or method of attack the use of tactics similar to those seen in recent terrorist attacks overseas include small arms equipped assault teams large vehicle borne improvised explosive devices and suicide bombers16 simultaneous with this announcement dhs under secretary for border and transportation security asa hutchinson announced at press conference on capitol hill that the alert level had been raised because there is increased specificity in what we hear but not necessarily in terms of the target17 on the following day fbi director mueller stated that there was specific information regarding potential targets or the timing of an attack dod secretary rumsfeld reportedly stated that same day that some qaeda leaders in iran were plotting attacks18 in this instance number of senior members of the administration discussed the information considered in the raising of the alert level and one of the secretary of homeland securitys principal deputies offered conflicting information regarding the specificity of that information december 21 2003 january 9 2004 fifth time threatlevel raised to orange on december 21 2003 secretary of homeland security ridge stated that the united states intelligence community had received substantial increase in threat related intelligence reports and that credible sources suggested the possibility of attacks against the homeland around the holiday season and beyond the information we have indicates that extremists abroad are anticipating nearterm 15 us less vulnerable but terror attacks still possible ridge agence france presse may 21 2003 16 dhs website statement by homeland security secretary tom ridge on raising the threat level may 20 2003 17 cnn united states goes on orange alert may 20 2003 18 terror alert raised to high amid fears foreign attacks could spread the associated press may 21 2003 crs7 attacks that they believe will either rival or exceed the attacks that occurred in new york and the pentagon and the fields of pennsylvania nearly two years ago19 on numerous occasions since the inception of the hsas variety of senior government officials have been quoted saying that it may never be known if raising the alert level stopped terrorist act from occurring however two days after the alert level was raised for the fifth time since its creation the secretary of defense stated that theres question that there are any number of terrorist acts that were stopped prior to their actually occurring20 also six days after this hsas threat level was lowered the fbi director stated that he did not foresee time when the country could drop its guard and that we probably will at some point in time have another attack21 there were two public discussions in 2004 of threat information of significant nature that produced some anxiety among us citizens and frustration on the part of the congress neither of the following instances resulted in change of the hsas on march 24 2004 the fbi issued threat advisory indicating that the texas oil industry may have been targeted by terrorists while dhs is statutorily responsible for public advisories relating to the announcement of homeland security threats specifically as they pertain to alerting infrastructure owners and operators of threat related information the advisory came solely from the fbi as house committee for homeland security chairman christopher cox stated twoweeks after this occurrence clearly this is very troubling development was it simply onetime glitch or has there been breakdown in communications between some of our key federal agencies chairman cox added congress and the american people need to know given the dangerous uncertain times we live in today cooperation among all authorities is more important than ever we simply cant afford to be sending confusing messages to nervous public22 may 26 2004 on may 26 2004 secretary ridge appeared on five television news shows stating that although the prospect of terrorist attack is significant americans should go about living their lives and enjoying living in this country at 3 pm that same day attorney general ashcroft and federal bureau of investigation director mueller held press conference and gave warning to the american public the attorney general announced that based on credible intelligence from multiple sources qaeda intends to attack the united states in the next few months this disturbing intelligence indicates qaedas specific intention to hit the united states hard ashcroft said the intelligence along with recent public statements attributed to qaeda suggest that it is almost ready to attack the united states he further stated that after the march 11 train bombings 19 error fear alarms homeland the boston herald december 22 2003 20 defense department operational update briefing

advisories congressman jim gibbons press release april 2004 crs8 in madrid spain an qaeda spokesman said the network had completed 90 percent of preparations to attack the united states23 during this press conference reporter asked if there was credible intelligence suggesting the united states is going to be attacked between now and the election why the threat level had not been raised attorney general ashcroft responded that the homeland security council led by secretary ridge would make such decision and for to try to speak for them at this time would be inappropriate24 after mr ashcrofts announcement mr ridge seemed surprised by the attorney generals warning asked why the national colorcode alert had not been raised mr ridge replied there is nothing specific enough to raise the alert level this seemingly uncoordinated effort was followed by response from representative christopher cox chairman of the house select committee on homeland security dissemination by our government of sensitive terrorism warnings must be closely coordinated across our intelligence and law enforcement communities cox said in the homeland security act dhs was assigned the central coordinating role in this process the absence of secretary ridge from yesterdays news conference held by the attorney general and the fbi director and the conflicting public messages their separate public appearances delivered to the nation suggests that the broad and close interagency consultation we expect and which the law requires did not take place in this case 25 these last two examples are cited by many observers as suggesting general lack of coordination and unity in message of warnings to the nation of threats and also reflecting lack of overall collaboration between dhs and other federal intelligence community and law enforcement organizations homeland security employees have complained that their cia and fbi colleagues show them little respect intelligence agents reportedly counter saying that dhs has been known to go public with terror alerts based on information that other agencies found to be sketchy26 this latter contention does not seem to be supported by the pattern of administration officials other than the dhs secretary openly discussing threats to the nation 23 attorney general ashcroft and fbi director mueller press conference doj media advisory may 26 2004 24

2004 sixth time threatlevel raised to orange on august 1st 2004 secretary of homeland security ridge stated that the hsas was being raised to orange based on threat intelligence that indicated qaeda was planning attacks against financial institutions in new york washington dc and new jersey prior to september 11 2001 in announcing this threat level change the dhs secretary ridge stated that the united states had new and unusually specific information about where qaeda would like to attack the following day monday august 2 2004 white house homeland security advisor fran townsend similarly stated that the increase in threat level was based on information showing that qaeda had been surveilling financial targets in 2000 and 2001 however she also added that the most recent intelligence included mention of threats to the us capital and members of congress this prompted washington dc capitol police chief to remark that the briefings he had received on the recent intelligence did not speak to specific credible direct threats against congress as an institution or its members 27 secretary ridge did not mention the capital or congress in his statement announcing the increase in the threat level however one month later secretary ridge reportedly admitted that though the administration viewed the threat as credible the information was sketchy and incomplete28 on october 12 2004 in view of the uncertainty of the intelligence that was presented and the subsequent announcements regarding the threat environment senator mark dayton temporarily closed his washington dc office based upon that information i have decided to close my office until after the upcoming election i do so out of extreme but necessary precaution to protect the lives and safety of my senate staff and my minnesota constituents who might otherwise visit my office in the next few weeks i feel compelled to do so because i will not be here in washington to share in what i consider to be an unacceptably greater risk to their safety29 during this threat level change senior member of the white house proffered additional information as to the reason the threat level was raised in washington dc the additional information led to further confusion producing followon statements and actions by the washington dc police chief and member of congress that further called into question the credibility of

warnings homeland security advisory system given the history of these seemingly uncoordinated threat notifications local governments and the public have complained about being confused by the varying details supporting the decision to raise the alert level many have lost confidence in the system in february 2003 the governor of hawaii decided to keep hawaii at the blue guarded level when the federal government raised its level to orange high risk monetary cost of increased security and the publics psyche were figured into the decision as well as the potential loss of life ed teixeira vice director of the civil defense division of the hawaiis department of defense reportedly commented that just because secretary of homeland security tom ridge and attorney general john ashcroft go on tv and say we are on orange it doesnt mean states and counties have to be at orange30 though lack of information regarding place and timing of an attack was noted as the reason to not follow the federal governments recommendation regarding raising the alert level it is equally telling that the hawaii state homeland security advisor pointed to the secretary of homeland security and the the attorney general as the individuals hawaii state officials listen to regarding threat warnings business leaders argued for better threat information from law enforcement as well as better coordination among agencies providing threat information specifically they said that they did not receive sufficient specific threat information and frequently received threat information from multiple government agencies31 some federal agencies as well as state and local officials reported hearing about notification of national threat level changes from other entities such as the fbi and media sources before being notified by dhs32 other warning advisory problems there have been examples and findings that speak to the issue of coordinated warnings and unity of message significant finding of the uss cole commission acknowledged that contradictory threat levels played role in the level of protection of the ship on the day of the attack33 similarly the commission on the intelligence 30 pacific business

state and local law enforcement governors and mayors and private sector officials with responsibility for critical infrastructure all deserve crystal clarity when it comes to terrorism threat advisories representative christopher cox rcalif chairman of the house select committee on homeland security number of options exist that include clarifying dhss primacy in alerting the nation of impending threats eliminating the homeland security advisory system or transferring the national threat notification responsibility to the national counter terrorism center was operating under department of defense threat condition bravo the second lowest alert level that denotes the current threat condition central commands decision based in part on the current defense threat condition continued to use yemen during this period as refueling location despite us state department warning against travel to yemen on september 14 1999 stating that yemen is experiencing higher incident of hostility and violence toward americans also the annual state department patterns of global terrorism report released in april 2000 characterized yemen as haven for terrorists this same report did not mention djibouti neighboring country that would have been available for refueling as concern for terrorist the inconsistency between the department of defense and the department of state warning offered conflicting information as to the level of threat faced by the uss cole as it waited to be refueled off of the coast of yemen this differing analysis and lack of coordination between dod and dos resulted in the lack of recognition of the danger that the uss coles crew faced the uss cole commission in investigating the attack and making policy and procedure recommendations to improve the dods system of protecting its forces released report on january 9 2001 acknowledging contradictory threat alerting mechanisms one of the recommendations stated that the geographic commander in chief cinc should have the sole authority for assigning the threat level for country within his area of responsibility the commission report further recommended that the geographic cincs be solely responsible for establishing the threat level within the appropriate area of responsibility with input from dia and that the secretary of defense coordinate with secretary of state where possible to minimize conflicting threat levels being issued from the department of defense and the department of state dod uss cole commission report executive summary unclassified findings and recommendations january 9 2001 34 the communitys inability to implement one team one fight strategy in the terror war may be attributed both to ongoing bureaucratic battles between agencies charged with responsibility for counter terrorism analysis and warning as well as the failure of community leaders to effectively resolve these disputes and clearly define agency roles and authorities wmd commission report chapter 4 finding 2 page 288 crs12 option clarify dhss primacy in alerting the nation of impending threats one issue is whether the intent of section 201d735 of the homeland security act of 2002 was to give dhs explicit authority and responsibility to be the sole federal entity charged with conveying homeland security threat information to the american people in delivering to congress the proposed legislation to create the department of homeland security president bush recommended that one department coordinate communication with state and local governments private industry and the american people about threats and preparedness36 section102c3 of the homeland security act also states that the secretary of homeland security has the authority and responsibility for distributing or as appropriate coordinating the distribution of warnings and information to state and local government personnel agencies and authorities and to the public congress could reemphasize dhs primacy in alerting the nation of impending threats this might put other agency officials on notice as to whom is authorized to be the public face of national threat notifications another option would be to allow other departments to disseminate threat information regarding the security of the homeland when such information is deemed credible and extremely timesensitive exigent circumstances option eliminate the homeland security advisory system given the short history of the hsas uncoordinated warning efforts lack of uniformity in the type of information conveyed and an increasingly wary populace as to the credibility of the message congress could choose to eliminate the system the natural question that follows is what would the replacement system be and would it be an improvement on the current system one could argue that given the uniqueness of each threat situation requiring communication to the public threat notifications may not allow for system per according to this line of reasoning each warningnotice should be handled as its own entity threat information geographic location target location timing of perceived attack defensive measures and the like should be addressed individually and not formulated to fit into neat category of threatlevels this might be problematic for number of reasons first many federal and state programs are tied to the current colorcode with numerous actions and funding decisions tied to raising or lowering of the alert secondly though cumbersome and nonspecific the current hsas allows for an assessment by federal and state governments the private 35 hsa2002 sect 201d 7 the under secretary of iaip subject to the direction and control of the secretary of homeland security shall administer the homeland security advisory system hsas including 1 exercising primary responsibility for public advisories related to threat to homeland security 2 in coordination with other agencies of the federal government provide specific warning

department of homeland security june 18 2002 httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases2002 06200206185html crs13 sector and the public as to general threat level that comes with certain expectations regarding the federal response lastly if warningnotice type system were introduced the inevitable question would arise regarding how one compares todays threat warning to past colorcoded warnings and other warningnotices option transfer the threat notification responsibility to the national counter terrorism center nctc as stated in the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 mission of the national counter terrorism center is to serve as the primary organization for analyzing and integrating all intelligence possessed or acquired by the united states government pertaining to terrorism and counter terrorism except intelligence pertaining exclusively to domestic terrorists and domestic counter terrorism and to serve as the central and shared knowledge bank on known and suspected terrorists and international terror groups as well as their goals strategies capabilities and networks of contacts and support37 since the relevant departments concerned with terrorism are represented at the nctc and legislatively nctc is the focal point of all federal analytical and strategic operational planning terrorism efforts this entity may be well positioned to review all applicable information regarding the terrorist threat and also coordinate the warning message to be conveyed to the public one option would be to designate the nctc the federal governments communicator of threat information to the nation precedence exists for this option as secretary ridge and the director of the nctc formerly the terrorist threat integration center held joint press conference discussing the threat environment and suggested protective measures38 formalizing the nctc as the national threat messenger would allow congress to hold one organization nctc responsible for terrorism analysis and the warnings that are derived therein dhs could continue to provide specific advice regarding protective measures to the private sector state and local governments and the public however the advice and collaborative efforts would be based on threat information compiled and communicated by the nctc congress could include language to allow for other departments to disseminate threat information under exigent circumstances whether the threat notification process continues in the current form of the hsas is eliminated and replaced by situation specific warningnotices or is transferred to the nctc or some other entity the issue remains one of coordination and unity of message rather than in what form the threat information should be conveyed undoubtedly numerous government agencies will continue to comment on various aspects of given threat condition however critics argue that future national threat announcements should occur in coordinated manner that allows for an unambiguous message due to lack of coordination and unity in message it appears that the general public and affected localities are becoming desensitized or disinterested in the information contained in national threat warning notification messages the lack of confidence brought on by confusion in the current notification process could be severe liability in an actual emergency 37 pl 108458 section 119 3d1and 6 38 feds decide against raising terror alert fox news october 20 2004 httpwwwfoxnewscomstory0293313716000html for other versions of this
