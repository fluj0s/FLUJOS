nate committee report that accompanied s 1255 trademark owners are facing new form of piracy on the internet caused by acts of cybersquatting which refers to the deliberate badfaith and abusive registration of internet domain names in violation of the rights of trademark owners for example when mobil and exxon announced their proposed merger in december 1998 speculator registered every variation of the possible resulting domain name ie mobilexxoncom exxonmobilcom mobilexxoncom etc ad infinitum cybersquatters target distinctive marks for variety of reasons some register wellknown brand names as internet domain names in order to extract payment from the rightful owners of the marks who find their trademarks locked up and are forced to pay for the right to engage in electr onic commerce under their own brand name in addition cybersquatters often register wellknown marks to prey on consumer confusion by misusing the domain name to divert customers from the mark ownershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20367crs2 1 srept 106140 106th congress 1st session 1999 47 2 s 1255 and hr 3028 previous versions of the legislation referred to trademark or service mark rather than mark including personal name which is protected as mark under 15 usc 1125 3 18 usc 706 prohibits fraudulently wearing or displaying the sign of the red cross or any insignia colored in imitation of it 36 usc 220506 prohibits anyone but the us olympic committee from using that committees name sym bol emblem or various associated words 4 the senate report claims that these factors balance the property interests of trademark owners with internet users who would make fair use of others marks or otherwise engage in protected speech online srept 106140 supra note 1 at 9site to the cybersquatters own site many of which are pornography sites that derive advertising revenue based on the number of visits or hits the site receives for example the committee was informed of parent whose child mistakenly typed in the domain name for dosneycom expecting to access the familyoriented content of the walt disney home page only to end up staring at screen of hardcore pornography because cybersquatter had registered that domain name in anticipation that consumers would make that exact mistake others attempt to divert unsuspecting consumers to their sites in or der to engage in unfair competition for example the business operating under the domain name disneytransportationcom greets online consumers at its site with picture of mickey mouse and offers shuttle services in the orlando area and reservati ons at disney hotels although the company is in way affiliated with the walt disney company and such fact is not clearly indicated on the site finally and most importantly cybersquatters target distinctive marks to defraud consumers including to engage in c ounterfeiting activities for example the committee heard testimony regarding cybersquatter who registered the domain names attphonecardcom and attcallingcardcom and used those names to establish sites purporting to sell calling cards and so liciting personally identifying information including credit card numbers 1 s 1948 addresses these problems by amending the trademark act of 1946 popularly known as the lanham act 15 usc 1051 et seq to allow the owner of mark including personal name which is protected as mark under 15 usc 11252 to sue any person who with bad fa ith intent to profit from that mark or personal name registers traffics in or uses domain name that i in the case of mark that is distinctive at the time of registration of the domain name is identical or confusingly similar to such mark ii in the case of famous mark that is famous at the time of registration of the domain name is dilutive of such mark or iii is trademark word or name protected by reason of section 706 of title 18 united states code or section 220506 of title 36 united states code3 s 1948 lists nine factors that court may consider in determining whether there was badfaith intent but does not limit courts to these nine4 the nine factors paraphrased are 1 the domain name users trademark ri ghts in the domain name 2 the extent tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20367crs3 which the domain name is his gal name or commonly used na 3 his prior use of the domain name in connection with the bona fide offering of goods and services 4 his legitimate noncommercial or fa ir use of the mark in site accessible under the domain name 5 his intent to divert consumers fro m the mark owners online location that could harm the goodwill represented by the mark 6 his offer to sell the domain name to the mark owner or third party fo r substantial consideration w ithout having used it in the bona fide offering of any goods or services 7 his provision of misleading false contact information when applying for the registra tion of the domain name 8 his acquisition of multiple domain names that are confusingly similar to others and 9 the extent to which the mark incorporated in his domain name registration is distinctive and famous within the meaning of 15 usc 1125c1 which lists eight factors for determining whether mark is distinctive and famous for pur poses of determining whether its owner is entitled to an injunction to prevent dilution s 1948 authorizes various forms of relief in cluding in particular situations court order for the forfeiture or cancellation of the domain name or the transfer of the domain name to the owner of the mar k injunctions damages and statutory damages of not less than 1000 and not more than 100000 per dom ain name s 1948 also prescribes situations in which domai n name registrar domain name registry or other domain name registration authority w ould and would not be liable s 1948 contains two sections that were not in previous versions of the legislation section 3006 requires the secret ary of commerce in consu ltation with the patent and trademark office and the federal election commission to conduct study and report to congress with recommendations on guidelines and procedures for resolving disputes involving the registration or use by person of domain name that includes the personal name of another person in whol or in part or name conf usingly similar thereto section 3007 added to the nati onal historic preservation ac t 16 usc 470aa1a sentence providing that notwithstanding the trademark act of 1946 buildings and structures on or eligible for inclusion on the national register of historic places or designated as an individual ndmark or as contributing build ing in historic district by unit of state of local government may retain the name historically associated with the building or structure the first amendment s 1948 also includes savin gs clause which provides nothing in this act shall affect any defense available to defendant under the trademark act of 1946 or persons ri ght of free speech or expression under the first amendment of the united states constitution the reference to the first amendment is unn ecessary as even in the absence of such savings clause federal statute may be enforced in manner that violates the constitution in san francisco arts athletics inc v united states olympic committee the supreme court held that trademar k protection statute did not violate thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20367crs4 5 483 us 522 1987 6 id at 536537 7 ward v rock against ra cism 491 us 781 798799 1989 8 trade name itself is form of commercial speech and nothing more friedman v rogers 440 us 1 11 1979 as such the constitutiona lity of governmental restriction on trade names is also subject to lessstrict test th an is applied to contentbased restrictions see central hudson gas electric corp v public rvice commission of new york 447 us 557 566 1980 domain name need not be commercia l speech however as not all websites propose commercial transaction which is the test th at defines whether speech is commercial see board of trustees of the state university of new york v fox 492 us 469 482 1989 but this has great significance as the test to determine the constitutiona lity of restrictions on commercial speech and the test to determine the constitutionality of incidental restrictions on noncommercial speech are similar see san francisco arts athletics inc supra note 5 483 us at 537 n16first amendment5 the statute was 110 of the am ateur sports act of 1978 36 usc 380 which prohibits the use of the word lympic by anyone other than the united states olympic committee usoc to induce th sale of any goods or services or to promote any theatrical exhibition athletic performance or competition the supreme court found that although the statute restricts expressive sp eech it does so merely incidentally to the primary congressional purpose of enc ouraging and rewarding the usocs activities the appropria inquiry is thus whether th incidental restrictions on first amendment freedoms are greater than necessary to further substantial governmental interest6 as this suggests the supreme court uses looser standard to determine the constitutionality of incidental restrictions on speech than it does to determine the constitutionality of laws that restrict speech on th basis of its content in fact subsequent to san francisco arts athletics inc the court made clear that though it had said that an incidental restriction must not be greater than necessary to further substantial governmental interest such restriction actually need not be the least restrictive or least intrusive means of furthering governmental interest ra ther the restriction must be narrowly tailored and the re quirement of narrow tailoring is satisfied so long as the regulation promotes substantial govern mental interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation7 the senate committee report quoted above as well as the congressional findings set forth in 2 of s 1255 the house bill doe s not include findings indicate that the legislation is designed in part like the statute the supr eme court upheld in san francisco arts athletics inc to protect trademarks not to restrict speech on the basis of its content s 1255s other stated purposes such as preventing consum er fraud also indicate that the legislation if challenged on fr ee speech grounds would apparently be subject only to the looser standard that the supreme court uses to determine the constitutionality of incidental restrictions on speech as such there seems little doubt that the bills on their face would not be found to abridge the first amendment8 this is not to say that the bills if enacted could never be applied unconstitutionally for example with respect to dilution of trademark by tarnishment linking it to shoddy products of another commentator stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20367crs5 9 j thomas mccarthy 3 mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition 24105tarnishment caused merely by an editorial or artistic parody which satirizes plaintiffs product or its image is not actionable under an antidilution statute because of the free speech protections of the first amendment9 it seems possible that domain name could constitute an editorial or artistic parody of trademark to which it was similar and thereby be protected by the first amendment from suit under the legislation
