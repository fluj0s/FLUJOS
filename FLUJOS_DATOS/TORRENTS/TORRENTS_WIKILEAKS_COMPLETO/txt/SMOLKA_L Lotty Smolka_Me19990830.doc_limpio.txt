to debra c humphreys date 30 august 1999 from tia healy trust department telephon345 949 7212 fax 345 949 0993 subject lotty smolka trust dear debra attached please find copies of correspondence re the fees i also attach copy of the time log for this year from april the refund requested is chf1372650 our invoice for 1999 has not yet been paid and would be chf1235907 this is based on year end accounts produced by bk insurance cash values as supplied by bernstein i realise that these assets were subsequently transferred to haas if we were to bill on the assets left in ls the amount would be chf1451 or whatever minimum we can apply with regard to the new insurance policies i do not think that we have had sufficient information for us to exercise our discretion in this regard i think we should have the findings of the insurance analyst and full copies of policy documents for the new policies before we sign any of the documents incidentally i note from the forms that ruth smolka is now living in israel and alex and felix seem to be based in florida resident for tax purposes i also note that ruth and alex now appear to be married we were not informed of this darlee and i have looked at the accounts prepared by bk for ls trust and note that they have never included the value of the insurance policies the invoice from bk for the accounts is chf14405 from my translation of the invoice this appears to be for the 1998 accounts only other comments darlee had were that the accounts should be in english there are notes to the accounts we did not get the accounts for 1993 and the chfusd exchange rate used for 311298 was 134 when bjbz used 138 on theportfolio valuations and bloomberg showed the rate as 1375 the fees for the accounting seem high especially when you consider the fees that we are getting it might bediplomatic to suggest that we waive the fees on ls but not haas for which we should charge full fees for this year in return for the claim for refund being dropped as there has already been considerable amount of time spent already and we can anticipate more with the new policies this may well turn out to be in their favour i hope that i have given you everything you need and that we can resolve this whole thing as soon as possible kind regards tia
