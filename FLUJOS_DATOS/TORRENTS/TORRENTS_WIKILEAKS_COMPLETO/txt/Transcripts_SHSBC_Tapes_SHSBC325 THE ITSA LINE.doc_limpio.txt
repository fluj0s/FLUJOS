the itsa line lecture given on 20 august 1963 how are you today audience good fine thank you all right this is what audience twenty august twenty august ad 13 thank you well this is lecture on the itsa line about time the itsa line why is it called the itsa line the auditor says whatsit and the pc says itsa it is the pcs communication line from pc to auditor and it isnt necessarily pursuant to the auditors whatsit it is sometimes pursuant to the pcs whatsitpc very often puts in his own whatsit okay there are numerous communication lines between the auditor and the pc and the aggregate of these make up thewhat you call the auditing cycle the auditing cycle is made up of several communication lines communication line is causedistanceeffect i call your attention to dianetics 1955 for the full definition of communication line what is communication intention attention duplication at the point of effect and so forth all those are quite important and technically accurate but what youre mainly interested in is causedistanceeffect causedistanceeffect is communication line communication line is not causedistanceeffect cause distanceeffectthats two communication lines now communication line can be very faint and one of those that youll find out routinely on an auditor is the attention line line 1 minor line 1 minor the attention line and that is just consistently out but as i say there are numbers of these and were not particularly going into them thats the first line thatsget the pcs attention how do you get the pcs attention to cause the pc to put his attention on the auditor and that line is the one that is put in now that line itself can be complex and become two lines or three lines pc sitting there and hes saying gobgob wallawalla something and the auditor wants to get his attention on him see it has to have attention on the auditor now the auditor cant really give an auditing command or do anything with his command unless he gets his attention line in now that can be done very crudely you can drop the emeter you can cough loudly in the pcs face tip over your chair get angry theres in essence numbers of ways to get this line in very very wrong and the line has to be put in however and very often you find pc fogging around at the beginning of session and his attention is not on the auditor its really not on his case its not on anything youre trying to do and so forth well how do you get it there well one of the ways of getting it there is having an attention line already extant you then convert it to an itsa line now this is the whole trick because theres another attention line there is attention on what see and this looks like another attention line its actually 1 minor it just isnt putting the attention on the auditor its putting attention on something else and this is little trick i used to do that used to baffle everybody in accs they used to get baffled and everybody would drop his jaw and look at dully when 1 would try to get them to do thisand its been wholly unsuccessfulbut by dividing down the auditing cycle into these various communication lines and component parts i will bravely take another crack at it its slippy i know if i give this to you itll become repetitive command process which it isnt its slippy thats all is you just very adroitly without really putting the pcs attention on anything except what his attention should be on just flick the pcs attention over to what it should be on ill give you an idea pc is saying oh i justjustjust cant standcant stand these these wild parties just cant stand them had one last night and just cant stand them and so forth theres just too muchtoo much music and everything and ive got an awful present time problem because this guys thisthis this girls bbboyfriend came over and wanted to pop in the eye because i was getting too familiar and its terrible and present time problem present time problem present time problem and you know youre running the gpm to be sexual see this you know about the case this isthis im giving you also is the itsa line hey were getting nice storm tape here too peter well cut the storm off of it and so forth and sell it they go great in the middle west they love storm tapes it reminds them of home i had green tornado one time in kansasnever been back since twenty fivepound blocks of ice were falling out of peasoupgreen sky and the visibility had dropped down to about fifteen feetbright green never quite recovered was impossible couldnt have happenedbut it did now your pcs attention being all over the confounded place the auditor sits back and says hes going to put in the itsa line now usually by this unless he is well trained and has this data and so forththis means hes going to sit back and leave the pcs attention totally uncontrolled the itsa line when you first start giving it to people is just never doing anything but listen and thats because people think it is simply communication line and it isnt but we will go on to this in moment now therefore this pc is running on and on and on about this party and this is slippy auditing i can sit and do this by the hour pc never finds out about it and theres command process being run and everything else and tone arm moves like mad and so forth it requires certain estimation of effort you understand and i actually years and years ago despaired of getting anybody to control attention that lightly this is another effort to do so see so you sayhes going on and on and this guy came over and he almost bopped but this was nicelooking girl and so forth and i had terrible problem because of my wife you know and so on and here we go see now the auditor who is not well informed and who is not well skilled just sits back and listens to this whole thing now to do anything about it suddenly is to put line 1 minor in on the auditor clank and boy the pc will arc break see because its sudden shift of attention so the whole thing is the skill by which you can take line 1 minor and flick it over onto what you were doing or want to do in the sessionthe skill with which you can do this and believe this is skill maneuver and when you are really skilled at this you could almost sit down and run full auditing session and even casual observer would think you were simply listening to the pc which you werent at all you were actually directing the pcs attention very closely the pc was talking exactly about what you wanted that pc to talk about and nothing else and the pc never realizes that their attention has been grooved on it now that would be the tremendous difference between psychoanalysis listening and scientology auditing you see these things could look quite alike the psychoanalyst 1 did not really know what to direct anybodys attention to see he didnt know the anatomy of the bank he thought if he could direct somebodys attention to sexual incidents in early childhood he had it made well now pca pcactually follows in his case at any given moment the leastcharged line pc will always follow the least charged line get this get this good because thats one of those remarks that goes by in the night and you wonder somedayyoure sitting there auditing somebody and you dont know what to do and so forth and its one of those things that if you knew that well youd know exactly what to do he always follows the leastcharged line with his tone arm action if youre going to get tone arm action it is on the leastcharged aberrative linenot the leastcharged thing he could talk about but the leastcharged aberrative line the tone arm action exists on the leastcharged aberrative line at any given moment in case progressalways the leastcharged aberrative line now give you what i mean by that lets take dynamics youve got eight dynamics you could audit on the pc the third dynamic is what the pc is always coming up with well if you kept the pc on the third dynamic you know you would get tone arm action because this happens with the pc to be the leastcharged line you got it now the other lines do not give tone arm action and this does not mean they are not charged it means they are overcharged there is too much charge on them got that so youre always trying to snake through the minefield on the leastpopping firecrackers to get your tone arm action you got that you want little ones thatll just tingle his feet you dont want those thatll blow his legs off you understand well the mind is so regulated and safetyvalved that it will not release charges which the pc considers over his ability to tolerate now an auditor can actually punch these charges into view hes got all the materials in his hand and therefore he could actually throw the pc into areas which are overcharged areas to be runthe areas are overcharged the result of an overcharged area is stuck tone arm stuck tone arms have many peculiarities and particularities you can say that if you want to really get tone arms moving you have to get the gpms on case run thats the most likely to give you tone arm action because its the most aberrative in terms of time you can say lot of things about tone arm action you say tone arm action sticks because of timethese things are all true but with regard to charge what you really want to know with regard to charge is that in the presence of too much charge too much charge the ta ceases to operate ta action ceases when you have too much charge that doesnt say that you couldnt bleed it that you couldnt work your way around it that there arent means of getting off the charge anyhow and all that sort of thing but when you see ta ceasing to operate and ceasing to act then you have entered an area of too much chargeparticularly on an extremely high or an extremely low ta do you follow that now too much charge its not because theres nothing there to run its because theres too cockeyed much there see that and if you dont get tone arm action then the charge that holds the significances and ideas postulates cognitions and that sort of thing in placejust the corny electrical charge you understand other significance connected with itthis thing packed up and held in facsimiles masses all of this sort of thing wont then let the case advance and you get case advance in the absence of tone arm action that isthats it i mean there arent any ands ifs ares or buts about it tone arm action case advance i dont care if you erased somatic i dont care if the pc has ceased to have lumbosis i dont care about any of these thingsbecause youre not auditing body as far as this pc is concernedno tone arm action case advance now can you worsen tone arm action yes you can bring about needle action on top of tone arm action huhuhuhu and if you insist on running pc without tone arm action you soon will begin to see it expressed over here in the needle which will get tighter and tighter and tighter and after while everything locks up and then if you use real desperate measures why you can just freeze the pc into something thatll feel to him like solid rock the longer you run case without tone arm action the more you will freeze the case into tone arm action and the more the case is frozen into tone arm action the less chance you have of getting charge off by any means you see this i mean youre walking away from the point of resolution the further you go with tone arm action the less likely you are to fortuitously produce some so its not just well hes running without tone arm action and brush it off you see its oh my god hes running without tone arm action whew huh hey hey hey bobobobo tone arm action hey hey hey hey tone arm action get some tone arm action haha you know it gets that type of emotional response you know not well hes running without tone arm action so he isnt getting any better and so on see guy being run without tone arm action is somebody youre watching go down the big toboggan and the longer this goes on the harder its going to get to get tone arm action now the most likely way to get tone arm action on any condition any case or any anything is getting in the itsa line this has processes connected with it these processes are designated routine 1c c for communication routine 1c this is the softtouch process this is the process that will be given to scientology one auditors and after youve studied it and used it year or two youll find out that theres lot more to know about it it is at once the clumsiest useits the workhorse you see you say well youve got two processes to make an ot youve got 3n you got r3r youve always got three processes see if youve got two like that then youve always got one more and thatll always be the itsa line or 1c see this is the workhorse this is the workhorse and yeah somebody in coaudit yes sure somebody in adoing bookauditing job yeah somebody some student in the academy yeah these people oh yes these guys will be able to make progress with this thing but before hes gone very long in the academy and before hes done very much auditing hell all of sudden begin to believehell do one of two things either well i just get tired of just sitting there listening to him talk and talk and talk and talk you know i just get tired of this so this itsa line isnt so good see he didnt even know what it was in the first place see or he will all of sudden begin to realize that there is certain deftness required here or one will just continue to sit and listen and listen and the pc goes on and talks and talks well look they talked for five years in psychoanalysis without getting anyplace see we dont know that they had tone arm action but we sure know they didnt get anyplace they did they didpardon pardon thatim maligning the boys im maligning them they got careful they did get someplace well lookahere you learn then that an overcharged case can most easily be bled down by the itsa line and youll restore tone arm action so the best way to restore tone arm action to any ease that has become overcharged through being run in the wrong departments is getting in the itsa line now thats your base process you can restore tone arm action matter how badly the case has been jammed up if you are clever in handling the itsa line now when i say itsa line and when i say clever yes theyre very definitely joined together clever it is not process its cleverness and the biggest trouble you have anything with is as well come back to this line 1 minor why put the attention on the auditor when all youve got to do is shift it slightly in the pc this guy is saying well and so forth and we had this bigbig hassle at this party and ithismy wife bawled out and everybody bawled out and so forth and ive got this terrible present time problem i got this awful hangover and im having an awful time in this session and so on and so on and so on yeah under long series of runs you could probably take apart this present time problem but you were running on the pc the goal to be sexual the pc is having trouble with being sexual thats for sure well thats where the cleverness is is was there anything that happenedyou know is what the pcs talking about got anything to do with what you were doing see so of course the adroit question practically walks up and hits you in the head the adroit question ispc takes long breath and momentarily he isnt going on any further just momentarily see he actually hasnt run his communication line out terribly but hes just been floundering youre getting minimum tone arm action and you say did our last session have anything to do with this oh lets see what the hell were we doing in the last session well i dont know just review what we were doing well lets see so and so on so on then we had an arc break and we were doing something or other and so on we were running out some kind of items theres this backtrack and theres this stairs or something there let see now i ill im gettin it now and so forth oh yeah yeah yeah yeah we were runningyou see ii really cant get anywhere near this im so worried about my present time problembut we werewe were running some goal some goal some goal some goal something along this line and so on oh yes to be sex say what do you know yeah i sure do have lot of trouble with with this thing to be sexual i yeah i sure do yeah i1 have lot of trouble with that well you say well what items did we have there right toward the last well i think we arrived at this point on the line plot and i think it wasi think it wasabsolutably it was nixyeah well all right there we are and youre starting to see your tone arm move and your needle start to twitch and he never knew what happened magic man magic its gently taking line 1 minor without actually putting it on the auditor and putting it back to the subject of the auditing and you see theres process that you could announce that will do this because the auditing is tremendously variable and the pcs worries and concerns are fantastically agglomerate now sometimes the pc has legitimately had present time problem and something catastrophic has occurred between sessions something like this this is just using this factor for just present time problemand its something way off and the only thing you can do is to keep flicking that attention line flick its really not whatsit line your whatsits already in you see and you just keep moving it around till the pc will ventilate the ptp that hes worrying about now the crudest but still acceptable example of this is simply tell about it see thats crude see thats something like were going to build house so we pile up some bricks thats crude thats about as adroit as the cow doing the twist see but nevertheless its functional you do get some motion i couldnt forbear to milk that gag now so theres the pc see and the pc cant get his mind on what youre doing because something else has happened and this something else is real worried and maybe its worried down to the level of grief charge or something like this see well all you can do is move themove this little attention line around onto things thatll give him itsas and you can cut it down fromwell actually failing to relieve the situation thats how bad it can be see you just didnt really relieve his problem or you relieved it somewhat or younext grade is you spent the session making him feel better about that present time problem see were well into the acceptable band if weve got to be or we handled it in the first two hours of the session or we handled it in the first hour of the session or we handled it in the first fifteen minutes of the session and that difference of time has very little to do with the seriousness of the problem it has everything to do with the cleverness of the auditorwithout putting the attention line on himself without cutting the itsa line adroitly shifting that little attention line there to this and that well the person says but thisbut i dont seei dont see why we had to fight half the night after we got home i told her i just was attracted by blondes and so forth and she just wouldnt listen and so forth and the auditor says what have you found out about arguments like that with your wife well itsa itsa itsa itsa itsa itsa itsa well thatsthats fine all right now how do you feel about this problem now well the problem is all right well hes still little bit fluttery so well lets review now what we were doing on something or other got the idea well we were doing soandso and well you know what we were doing as well as i do well all right yeah probably but i may not have full records here of this there might have been something that came up during the session or something like this or between sessions you might have thought of something else oh yes i did as matter of fact youre away see got the idea actually its just about as skilled as building watch but because there is apparent skill there dont you see it gets slightly into disrepute people can watch session in which this is occurring and they really never even hear the auditor say anything see and the pc never really hears the auditor say anything because the attention line isnt all right now all right okay all right yeah yeah yeah ii got all that youre talking about now all right now were going to give you going to give you the nextthe next next auditing commandthe nextthe nextthethe next auditing command you got that now got that now all right here we are now all right do birds suffocate okay got that now do birds suffocate now youve restimulated some charge i wont say what charge youve restimulated see now that can grade on down from just too much you see that can grade on down to do suffocating birds have anything to do with this were there any birds suffocating in that see to well do you think your processing has bettered this situation now were really getting featherlight arent we pc hardly heard you say it and neither would anybody else you see well lets see lets go over what weve covered so far in auditing well now you had couple of cognitions in the last session there that had something to do with this have you had any other cognitions with regard to goals and so forththese implanted goals this is getting awful adroit see youve actually got something hes already been talking about and you put it in by the duplication factor you duplicate what he has been talking about and you just pull his itsa line little bit further and put it on something see ill give you an idea of doing this he says well auditing auditing i get these awful headaches in auditing and that sort of thing well have you particularly gotten them while weve been running goals few sessions laterhes forgotten all about these headaches and so forthwere having hard time getting his itsa line handled how about these headaches are they troubling you as much now when we run these goals and that sort of thing how are these headaches sounds merely solicitous it isnt its itsa line see see youve taken deadended communication line someplace back down the line and youve repeated its subject so therefore you have made duplication so youve created communication line its all very technical and the persons attention goes back on to this and he has to make comparison he has to say his headaches are better or worse or theres change and while hes doing this he has to put his attention on gpms or whatever youre trying to run on it and you say well with this last one that we were running in the last sessionthe last one to be nutty to be crazy in the head so forth something like that how were the somatics in the head getting along there were they turning on and off and so forth while weve been running that oh well you shouldnt really remark on this because i had them pretty well off well what item did they go off on well they went off onwell i really dont know someplace in the first part of it umumumi had an item in thereisidiotablyi think it was idiotably nutty yeah yeah that was the one hey i got that headache again you know you say well give nix idiotably nutty youre away see see he doesnt know what hit him see its moving that attention line adroitly adroitly see adroit with the little pinkythe little finger you knowraised just right on the teacup see now youll see an auditor who really hasnt got much feeling for it and tools and so forth why hes got this teacup with both paws wrapped around it you see and youll see somebody else has poured the tea into the saucer with both paws wrapped around the saucer and inhaling at very large number of decibels see so that youll see this in all of its shades of gray you see down to outright black but before you understand anything much about the itsa line you have to understand that there is such thing as an attention lineline 1 minor and unless you can handle that attention line slightly adroitly greatly smoothlyyoull curse yourself sometimes even the best of an auditor will say well lets get to running this gpm now or something like that cut your throat you see you spend the next fifteen minutes getting out of this hole see it was just too much in the wrong place see and it just smashed everything up and the pc is busy explaining to you that he is eight thousand lightyears from that gpm and his attention wasnt on it you know you find yourself making these mistakes dont knock yourself in the head and say well im terrible at this and run big makeguilty on self because you dont handle this well always just those times you have been clever pat yourself on the back thats the one to pay attention to im not kidding you because well i gave session last night and i dropped three times once i dropped handful of anvils on the floor shook up the session most interestinglyand another time i put off whole chain of firecrackers in the middle of the auditing table and another time practically ran the mains voltage through the cans see but that was three see that was three but there was two hours worth and probably something on the order of 150 that were handled you know with such aplomb man that nobody ever found out anything about it and it got the pc out of the woods gorgeously see quantitatively see course what you put your attention on are those three that had to be patched up see oh oh well your attention wasnt on it well im very sorry and so on have i cut your communication you know sorry and so forth well what would you have said if i hadnt have interrupted that see good recovery see level and so forth nevertheless if you really were selfcritical to vast degree you would have been practically kicking your brains out for having pulled any one of these three pc is going on and saying well i think i have blown that last gpm i think i have blown that well all right all right good lets check some of its items oh oh cut your throat man see just put the pcs attention on the wrong thing the wrong place its all going crash the pcs needle goes dirty get the idea you see youre split between wanting the pc to think well of you and getting your job done and these two things are very often attheyre dipolar phenomena you try and get your job done sometimes uphill against something and in the final analysis it just merely depends on did you get your job don see thats what it really depends on in the final analysis but in the process of getting your job done you happen to have arc broke the pc and cut the pcs communication line several times well the difference between good and bad auditor is not whether the auditor always audits smoothly with never cutting an itsa line but whether or not he attains his eventual objective without creating so many arc breaks that the pcs case has not improved thats the test if you go around training people on the basis of you must never cut an itsa line you must never create an arc break you must never upset the pcall of these things you seeits something like laying in gpm you know oh in the first place its an impossible attainment always train them with be as clever and adroit as you can and you can be little more adroit than that he dropped his emeter in the pcs lap halfway through the session poor handling of the attention line why pcs attention went on meter not on own case all right now how many dozen ways are there to shift the pcs attention i dont knowdozens thousands thousands ill give you an idea you got an alcoholic youre trying to process this alcoholic see alcoholics drunk most sessions and you know youre not supposed to audit somebody whos drunk all the alcoholicd do is sit there and say well alcoholics anonymous will tell you you cant cure anybody of alcoholism thats all hes going to say see he knows you cant help him hes saying well its impossible see and you say well the case is unauditable yes the case is unauditable to everybody except those who are surpassingly skilled with the attention line and the itsa line see the whatsit line is practically missing now what have you learned about alcoholics anonymous oh well thats something else well i met this fella down the street this fella and so forth and he gave this book see and i read this book and i threw it in garbage pail couldnt teach anything but i learned better after while when was that oh in about few days later i learned better see i had this awful hangover and i just got fired and i was being sued for divorce and i found out they were your friends thats what i found out then youre going to see that tone arm starting to move man he has just told you that you cant possibly audit him he has just told you that you cant possibly help him so you justhhhhhhpolish up the fingernails audit him help him and somewhere up the line he finds out about it as major cognition but all the way up the line hes improving because if you can get tone arm motion and get the guy with the session see by flicking that little old attention line right where it lives parallel what the mind is doing and it will do everything you want it to nothing newthats the beginning lines i think of one of the firstbook things but nevertheless this gives you the anatomy of how thats done you just find out about what this guys mind is on see and if you can produce tone arm action by having him locate things about it then he will recover from any obsessive or compulsive tendencies about it or toward it its the tone arm motion that takes off the compulsion not the significance of what he digs up given enough tone arm motion on any given subject and that subject will right itself in the head of the pc and man im talking from hardwon experience id say if weve learned anything in the last thirteen years man weve learned that tisnt the significance alone its the tone arm motion that can be obtained in relation to the significance that brings about the recovery now thats the fastest recovery is of course the tone arm motion plus the right significance to be run now thats your fastest recovery but your recovery takes place somewhat and eventually if you just produce tone arm motion thats all you have to do is produce tone arm motion on the case regardless of whats run and eventuallyat some vast distance why this pc is going to recover from these various targets and so forth in the case hes going to recover from them thats for sure but if you audit the right significance and get tone arm action the pc will never recover see those are terribly important data well now the most overcharged areas of the case are the casesparts of the case that give the high ta the high ta and the overcharged area compare the leastcharged aberrative area gives tone arm action you very often will find some alcoholic that gets tone arm action on the subject of alcoholism but hes got corns you can get tone arm action on the subject of corns you see in other words he cant face that highly charged approach so that sometimes the absolute direct approach to compulsion or obsession of some kind or another will get you nowhere at all because its such highly charged area that its over the pcs head and you get tone arm action on that well the answer to that is dont abandon it just get tone arm action see thats the thing to do just get tone arm action very remarkable because the mind is stacked up the way it is if you continue to get tone arm action hell all of sudden walk up on that thing do you see now undirectedlythats just not directing him toward any specific target or goal or aberration or anything else or any reason hes not able or anything at all anythingyou get tone arm action and hell eventually collide with something and he will know processing is helping him youll be utterly flabbergasted sometime you have this surprise in store for you if you havent collided it already knowing the idea about tone arm action you sit there and this pc babbles on and on and on and it doesnt have anything to do with anything you can see but my god that tone arm is moving youre getting up and down motions on that thingnot quarterdivision every twenty minutes man youre gettingits got to be bit healthier than that for pc to know something about itbut its certainly getting whole tone arm division every ten minutes and thats pretty fair tone arm motion see and thats acceptable i wouldnt buy much less than that myselftone arm division every ten minutes and that would say only down but you realize that it also has to rise in order to go back down again so if you added the plus and minus thatd be two tone arm divisions you seeone up and one downin ten minutes well thats thats just barely marginally acceptable see to produce this phenomena you get that all right pc talking about his grandmothers jam making well cripes you know this is about as aberrative dont you see as petting the pup but my heavens youre getting tone arm motion on it man well you cant do anything else much youve tried something else and gotten stuck tone arm so lets let him go on see and just completely neglect your attention line if you were very skilled you would be unable to totally neglect it you would punch it around little bit and increase your tone arm motion see pc leaves the session feeling finefeeling fine wonderful pc always makes gains if they have tone arm motion see if they have real tone arm motion they always make gains if they dont have tone arm motion they dont make gains now i can tell you at the threequarter point of session whether or not the pc will have anything to say decent in the goals and gains its just how much tone arm motion has there been during that session thats all its direct monitoring factor see so this becomes burningly necessary to produce tone arm motion at any cost produce tone arm motion and now you come into your own about the itsa line because tone arm motion only occurs when the itsa line is in and tone arm motion does not occur with the itsa line out now lot of you think the itsa line is communication line its not thats surprise isnt it just because its labeled cdistancee and because it is communication line well why dont we just call it the preclears line to auditor that would make it communication line but we dont we call it the itsa line why the itsa why why well one of the ways to get this across is to give the student drill just imagine thetan in various circumstances you know like guy in jail all right now how is his itsa line cut see it isnt just on the graph that isnt the only way you can show how the itsa line is cutin an auditing session lets just take it out in life and we say all right this guy is in jail give number of ways this fellows itsa line is cut and you may get some awful comm lags on the part of the student but hell eventually dig it up see hows his itsa line cut well let give you some notions then for definition of the itsa line well he cant go anyplace else to see if itsa he cant go anyplace else to itsa hes right there in jail isnt he lets say he was up in london in jail all right well he couldnt go down and itsa the coast could he he couldnt say itsa water and itsa beach and itsa resort and itsa brighton could he he cant get there how the hell can he itsa it well he can itsa it on via if somebodyd give him map or book or novel thats about the coast or something like that thats itsa on via substitute itsa by substitutes so its kind of an itsa well itsa by facsimiles is an itsa by substitutes too so this is not ineffective but his itsa line direct itsa lineis sure cut now there are other ways his itsa line can be cut by reason of being in jail i wont go into those particularly we have fellow sitting at table we put blindfold on him how is his itsa line cut do you see how his itsa line is cut he cant itsa thats what an itsa line is whats nightmare whats nightmare nightmare is the inability to itsa followed by mocking up something that can be itsad thats wrong thetan likes to be oriented he orients himself how does he orient himself itsa itsa ceiling itsa floor itsa wall itsa therefore im you hide somebody you hide somebody the itsa line is cut on himself nobody else can say itsa nobody can say itsa do you see that disassociate somebody from his identity hows his itsa line cut he cant say itsa itsa joe jones see cant be done he hasnt got an identity now well we get into whole tangled web of aberration and we find out that thats the basic aberration inability to orient or declare or identify or recognize not just solve you understand it isnt cure versus cure versus cure thats also itsas but thats only part of the picture how do you know youre here well thats easy thats easy you say itsa chapel itsa chair itsa notebook where you are itsa body up here itsa ron see you know where you are your itsa line is in youre oriented so you feel happy about the whole thing see fine you know where you are it isnt necessarily how dangerous the environment is you could be out in the jungle and youd be surprised how happy some hunter looked when he says itsa lion hasnt really anything to do with safety security andnone of these these are just extra considerations see so you just shred all these extra considerations off and itsa see itsa jungle itsa itsa gun itsa lion itsa bearer up tree well at least i know i was killed by lion my itsa line is in on the subject of that death well look if this is so important to power and it is and if this is so important to sanity and it is and if this is so important to memory and it is and if this is so important to ability and it isthen we would expect the major tricks on the track to comprise of cutting itsa lines one way or the other so youre standing up there loud and clear on the parapet gripping dramatically the flag of the lilies of france being shot at in shot and shell and all of sudden theres snick and you is disconnected well you at least know how you died you got some idea that it was flying object unfriendily directed and by god in the next half an hour or something like that theyre telling you you died some other way correct spoils your itsa line and then in the ensuing actions that take place on it why they give you completely false position as far as youre concerned and false situation and false here and false there and they throw your itsa out on time and they give you little gpm to carry home with you very happily give you some nice somatics to go along with it youre an idiot to ever go back you know i mean you move right around the corner of the thing and itsa where if its 706 trillionseven years ago which is right now that itsa is certainly for the birds isnt it you understand theyve misdated somatic on you because they say now were going to give you your future and somehow or another restimulate your facsimiles of the past and say theyre in the future and whats happening here well enough happened so that everybody on this planet believed they lived only once and thats how serious the cutting of an itsa line can be you combine this with plenty of force and you got it made man i can see it now the development of new psychiatry new medical psychiatry can be developed out of this you can get people so mixed up that theyd report back to the medical doctor every time they do insane patients are always reporting back for their shocks and so forth see wellknown fact the reportback mechanism is just used and used and used and used and used by these nuts by the way i thought of difference between scientologist and the world at large on this particular planet the people think that what were doing is unreal but we know the substance of their unreality which of course makes us top dog every time we know the substance of their unreality in other words we know where their itsa line is out see they know whattheyre not identifying see their itsas are just for the birds you know man is an animal he is biochemical protoplasm which goes place at death there is cessation of cellular commotion thats good itsa isnt it that just immediately makes nothing out of everybody ah so theres formula theres formula involved here and that is your itsa line can be out on arc and kucdeio and f how many ways can an itsa line be well its that whole scale i gave you for r2h known unknown curious desired enforced inhibited none of it and falseabsent and false this is how many itsa aberrations there can be see well false thats the easiest one of all you hold up somebodyyou say here have piece of candy sonny give him piece of chalk see he bites it his itsa line is out man got the idea you say there is nothing here boys there is nothing haunting this planet there is nobody after you nothing happens i mean youre just here and just natural and theres nobody after you see that itsa line is for the birds see youre paranoid you think people are pursuing you of course nobody is pursuing usthey dont have to they got us man so they say something isnt which is well of course you can get the reverse of that they say something is which isnt such as the darwinian theory which is just an old implant inhibited inhibited give guy pair of distorting glasses or make him look at things in twisted mirror like funhouse mirror his itsa line is inhibited tell him he must not examine suchandso and soandso because it is very dangerous and of course his itsa line is inhibited at once and of course enforced itsa you better damn well know about this or you will be shot tomorrow morning without cigarette or blindfold enforced itsa desired itsasee thats want to know sort of itsa somebody is very happy to know that youre all right you see thats desirable itsa and the itsa of curiosity is not just being curious about what is its an itsa which is curiosity its curiosity itsa dont you see now you go up higher than that and you get an unknown itsa hey you know there is an unknown itsa i just gave you an example of one you have complete reality on the unreality of people on this planet see the itsa is their unknownness see you recognize they dont know well that is an itsa and its pretty highscale stuff for thetan to be able to recognize that it is an unknown this thing really boxes him around because of course it mixes in with the actual desire to make something known which can be known and amongst that you get the accumulations of unknownnesses that are just unknown and will always be unknown will never be anything else because theyre tailored to be unknown and if you dont think that cant be look at the word unknown see theres perfect example yes there is such thing as an unknown theres word theres the concept that you back it up unknown unknown and that is something which is unknown isnt it i mean this is getting idiotic theres many religion man which is built 100 percent on beautiful building which houses nonexistence and they have created an unknown thats what they have created see it is something that can be created and thetans tolerance as it rises eventually gets up to point where he can actually confront an unknown without doing thing about it he can recognize that it is unknown its manufactured unknown like x in algebra theres another example somebody writes x all right he can confront the fact that x is unknown of course if hes nowhere near an algebra teacher he probably wont even be forced to find out known for that unknown either he probably wont even do the equation x z 0 of course you dont even know what the equation applies to and neither does anybody else mathematician is somebody whos gone overboard on the subject of unknownnesses and he has to solve all of these unknownnesses now if you dont think that isnt prevalentif you dont think that isnt prevalentthere is one of the things that holds up auditors in auditing is they get so upset about the pc being in an unknown while hes trying to itsa that they eventually grab hold of the meter and they say oh well lets see is it twenty years ago thirty years ago its thirty years ago yeah well we know about that now they say theyre just helping the pc its just they cant confront that well and so and so zazaza zaza zazaza i dont know i just dont know it couldnt have been so and they think oh my god if this goes on minute longer you know and they get the itsa line in for themselves and then of course an itsa line can be too known every once in while some murdermystery characters the thing is out because it is known every once in while some murdermystery writer has the postman do it because nobody ever sees postman see its too known i bet theres crime after crime on the books down here that remains unsolvable because it was committed in too known fashion see its known itsa itsa of knownnesses every once in while youre doing an arc break on some pc on r2h and cant quite find out what it is and you eventually will hit known communication you know known well of course he knows it he thought it was something else why because he knew it so you get how slippy that can be see thats this everybody knows that is talked about in dianetics evolution of science you see everybody knows these thingsthats known itsasso you never examine them thats another way of having known itsa but the pcs attention with his itsas rise up and down this whole new version of the cdei scale seegoes up and down each one in those various stages and he picks out this and he picks out that and he picks out something else and all hes doing is saying it is he is identifying in other words hes identifying something and when he cannot identify something then he identifies by classificationidentification by classification this is type of psychiatry does this all the time they say this is dementia praecox case theyve gotten so idiotic with it now that if somebody goes to that chestnut lodge where grahamthat publisher of newsweek and the post that was so against scientologywhere he went and went home on vacation and killed himself he went home for day he was supposed to come back up there at chestnut lodge ive told you about it before thats actually the name of the joint its up around and its very remarkable but its very remarkable up there but if person is transferred to chestnut lodge regardless of their symptoms before they now have schizophrenia and i have asked this several times trying to get the answer and i finally did get the answer and understood it was the answer and after that it didnt plague but its very interesting example of an interesting variation of itsa see and that is they are schizophrenic because they were transferred to chestnut lodge because thats all there are at chestnut lodge well now thats by classification plus idiocy see when you say it is cupboard you have pleasant sensation of familiarity and knowingness you seldom stop to think that you have classified something you know something because you know of similar something and so you get your gradients your gradients of classification establish familiarity in that particular direction every once in while this familiarity gets betrayed or something like that and you get an arc break with it you say it is cupboard and you open it up and find out that its mouse home or something see somebodys using it to breed white mice for something or something or it is an automobile and you get into it and find out its stage prop little minor arc break there of false itsa dont you see thats quite common in gpms pc goes halfway through the gpm and all of sudden does the right itsa haha these are just railroad carriages with painted backdrop of train going off in the distance theyre not trains see identified the character of the itsa this is all then on the subject of identification its all on the subject of familiarity its all on the subject of finding out its all on the subject ofof making oneself comfortable with what he is looking at its all on the subject of straightening out ones various grades of arc with the universe now what gives thetan such passion for this this is something else and not the subject of this lecture nor actually the subject of cases at the present moment but it opens up very interesting channel of research whats this passion to itsa see thats an interesting question but that you do get tone arm action when you itsa and the case does improve this is well established and this is germane to all cases so getting the itsa line in has nothing to do with getting the pcs communication in i say nothing to do thats another action thats more apt to be the attention lineto you or something of this sort dont you see thats getting his communication in thats not the itsa line getting the itsa line in is getting the pc to identify separate compartment differentiate inspect decide about things in his bankor in an objective process in the room you want to see tone arm fall you could probably produce it normally by saying whats that whats that whats that whats that and have the pc itsa you say whats that pointing at the fireplace pc says its fireplace actually you run it for very little while this is not broad general thing because there are other factors involved here pc is so introverted that its painful for him to extrovert his attention and he can only extrovert his attention on broad via and other special conditions arise here that doesnt make this pat process you understand its pat process though as far as his bank is concerned alwaysnot necessarily objectively but im giving you the objective version here which is limited version of it and you say whats that whats that whats that whats that see every time the pc says itsa normally if pc is not having too bad time and he isnt fouled up and you havent got him stuck on the track someplace and interested in something else youll see your tone arm fall you can also see pc getting very interested all of sudden he what is it yeah its fireplace butbut and hell want to go over and take closer look at the thing to make sure its fireplace built out of certain kind of brick see his itsas getting sharper you will see his identification rise now this is so good that touch assist works familiarization processes permit people to get drivers licenses who couldnt by just touching cars you know itsa itsa itsa car is all hes running you know he thought it was buffalo for while or something well listen if he couldnt drive the thing he must have thought something weirdthat i assure you so itsa itsa itsa itsathats familiarization you want to teach some girl to type well just have her familiarize herself with the tools of the trade very funny she can get up to an itsa itsa itsa to point and her ability will rise rise rise along with it which is very peculiar but then this has something to do with charge the change of case has to do with the release of charge because of the itsa theres two things happen the individual who is really itsaing things is also blowing off encysted charge caused by former confusions about them and that charge is encysted and that is force aspect and mass aspect with regard to this heres the phenomenon see heres this encysted little thing here see and you said whats in there see and he says oh sfoouhzoo and zoooo zoooo zoooo tone arm is moving see picking up those fingers one by one off the clasped hands you see and well thats off well thats off also i dont know lets see see whatwhat it is what it is oh palms you didnt think anything was in there did you thats just charge and you see that tone arm start moving well thats charge coming off of one of these bundles and the guy is looking and its just method of asising now while hes doing this what drives some auditors around the bend is he puts in lot of additional itsas why thats of great harm see he says itsa house itsa car itsa see itsa fingernailno oh oh i know what this is ii know what this is i know what this is watermelon and then as an auditor said to last night we get all set and weve both got watermelon and then all of sudden he says it isnt watermelon its diamond ring and the auditor starts feeling kind of confused because you see his itsa line is being thrown around by the pc but only only if the auditor doesnt completely understand what he is doing hes trying to find something and then be content with it well that isnt auditing man an auditors superior knowledge should be that if the guy says its watermelon he for sure is going to call it diamond ring shortly and if it really is diamond ring hell never mention it thereafter because its itsad but until it is itsad hes going to call it all sorts of things its going to be at billion years and its going to be 5 years into the future and its going to be back trillionsfive years and its going to be 465 years ago and its going to be yesterday and its going to be now and its going to be fifteen minutes ago and its going to be trillions ten ago and its going to be 18 trillion years ago and then all of sudden it settles down to 125 billion trillion years ago period bang thats it you dont hear about it anymore than that because he got it see its itsad so lot of apparent itsas come off in the process of obtaining an itsa and you almost could say that all the running of ease from the first moment of its processing on through to the final cognition of the case consists of conditional itsas conditional itsas thats the way it is for that circumstance and that certain place you see an auditor should never have any thought that hes got to get nothing but permanent itsas naturally you go through gpm you tear off the items according to plot well thats the itsa of it reason i dont have any trouble running gpm is i have doubt about the itsa of gpm see thats it it just is what it is there was nothing there to understand it was put there to louse you up and immobilize you and cut down your power and ability you see and its bunch of electronic circuits which go into couple of boxes and they have couple of things that fire on both sides of the thing and they start you in the top turn you upside down at the bottom and thats all there is to it and you go through and you say pow pow pow pow pow pow pow pow and thats the end of the gpm false itsa see actually in most cases not even much of protest you know not saying it should be some other way once in while spotted intention with false idea of the intention will hang it up for moment but thats an itsa see you dont have the immediate and direct itsa of how come i got into situation where i started getting these things in the first place you see well thats one of these big itsas see this finally starts dawning on the pc what the hell was i doing delivering myself up to comedy like this you see every few trillion years you know whats the matter with whatd i do what happened to well whats wrong with ead how come and youll find most pcs will start chewing on this after while and they chew on it and chew on it and chew on it and chew on it and chew on it andthey sometimes chew on it for two three four five six seven eight hundred hours see how come theres reason to blow your brains out about it or stretch your medulla oblongata all out of shape it all of sudden will rise up in your midst and there it will be the itsa of it is see oh thats why you see now the adroitness with which an auditor can use the little attention line to put the pcs attention into areas that can be explored that are easy enough for the pc to see into that will produce tone arm action is very skilled auditor and that is what is known as getting in the itsa line getting in the itsa line does not consist of sitting back and letting the pc talk for hours about nothing you understand we do not frown on that if you cant do anything else you understand but there is much more adroit level by which you put his attention on things that can be identified by him and which he will therefore unsnarl the thing called problem or the bank or that aberrated area and its the degree that you can obtain tone arm actionthat you can do thatthat marks the skill of the auditor that is the most skilled center and zone of auditing its almost so skilled that i hesitate to mention it again because ive had loses along this line now if you can do that there is its anatomy if you can do that you would be known as this fantastic thing called the touch intuitionall these other things would mount up back of this its quite awesome so getting in the itsa line isnt just sitting there its actually doing something else now letting the itsa line exist is descriptive of the lowest level of auditing on this you seejust letting the itsa line exist well get somewhere see well get somewhere if we just do that but dont go speaking carelessly of getting the itsa line in unless youre doing just that youre taking the pctoauditor communication line and you are putting it right into zones and areas where it will find itsas youre putting the pcs attention in there to where that line will be itsa and itsa and rurrurrumdaummmmm well itsa you see and rrrrr rarararm and so on and so on and so on well i guessi guess it was my complacence in college thats what gotyes thats right thats what really got in trouble i was complacent about everything i wasthats it bang you will all of sudden see your tone arm go right on down see you see the charge come off of the case in the bucketloads this is actually so skilled that its the production of cognitions you can produce cognitions if you want to you can be that skilled this is something that takes some familiarization with yourself you should know what the tools are the tools is the line 1 minor and that is used to produce searching attention on the part of the pc your whatsit line is left there more or less alone to produce this kind of phenomena why because the universe is full of whatsit lines the pc is suffering from too much whatsit and too little itsa and the net result of this is of course to jam his itsa line and you the auditor by letting it flow pull him out of the soup of course the direction of significances as powerful as gpm as powerful as superduper engram as powerful as this sort of thing on the way backtrack god elp us and so forthman thats putting in the itsa line on significance with magnitude and that thing actually requires considerable skill youve got to have line plots and the idea of cross listing and the doingness of the auditor is considerable the skill is considerable his drills are considerable and so forth nevertheless even those fail if you dont let the itsa line exist you got to leave that itsa line alone and let it rove now it also consists of not cutting it and there are numerous ways the itsa line can be cut in auditing its good drill to get somebody to come around and show you that august 4 plot have him find the number of ways you can cut that pcs itsa line then make him pass the drill how many ways could you aberrate somebody by cutting the itsa line and then he has to find out what the itsa line is thats an awfully good drill and that drives it home with thud all right audience mmhm i hope you get good grip on this one because its slippy one and of course itstrouble with it is its so known see its an everybody knows you know itsa lineobviously its the pcs communication line even though we went on saying itsa and calling it an itsa linewell why is it called an itsa line and so forth and youll see this one drift on through scientology and always forever in some part of scientology this one will be too known that i know for sure but the very skilled auditor and the very well reputed auditor and the auditor who gets terrific results will be the auditor who has this one down cold he knows an itsa line backwards and forwards pc sits down with present time problemit isnt necessarily speed factor involvedbut the pc talks to him for while and mysteriously this present time problem blows up and the pc is sitting right exactly in the middle of exactly what the auditor wanted him to be in and the pc is running on exactly what they ought to be running zippetybop and the pc is happy and the auditor is happy and everything is going as smooth as glass naturally there will be some jolts on the line every once in while youll wish you had never opened your big mouth and i hope you dont get into as many of those as i have in the last thirteen years thank you very much
