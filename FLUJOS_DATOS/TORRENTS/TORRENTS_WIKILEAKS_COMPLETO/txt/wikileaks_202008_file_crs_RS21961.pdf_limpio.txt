environmental policy resources science and industry division summary perchlorate is the explosive component of solid rocket fu fireworks road flares and other products used heavily by the department of defens dod and related industries perchlorate also ccurs naturally and is presen t in some organic fertilizer this soluble persistent compound has been detected in drinking water supplies especially in california it also has been found in milk and many foods because of this widespread occurrence concern over the poten tial health risks of perchlorate exposure has increased and some states water utilities and members of congress have urged the environmental protection agency epa to set federal drinking wa ter standard for this chemical regulatory issues involve the rela tive health benefits and costs of federal regulation including environmental cleanup nd water treatment co sts both of which are driven by federal and state standards california and mass achusetts have set standards epa has spent years assessing pe rchlorates health effects and occurrence including its occurrence in food to deter mine whether national st andard is warranted interagency disagreements over the risks of perchlorate exposure led several federal agencies to ask the national research counc il nrc to evaluate perchlorates health effects and epas risk analyses in 2005 the nrc issued its

particularly for infants in cer tain cases in october 2008 epa announced its preliminary determination not to regulate perchlorate in drinking water this report reviews perchlorate cont amination issues and related developments background ammonium perchlorate is the key ingredient in solid fuel for rockets and missiles other perchlorate salts are used to manufacture products such as fireworks air bags and road flares uncertainty about the health eff ects of perchlorate exposure has slowed efforts to establish drinking water and environmental cleanup standa rds however because of perchlorates persistence in water and ability to affect thyroid functi on concern has escalated with the detection of perchlorate in water in at least 33 states in the absencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21961crs2 1 epa federal facilities restoration and reuse known perchlorate releases in the us march 25 2005 at http wwwepagovfedfacdoc

fuel manufacturing facilities and disposal sites research facilities and military bases fireworks road flares construction sites and other manufacturing activities and facilities also have been sources of c ontamination moreover perchlor ate occurs naturally in west texas for example is present in organic fertilizer imported from chile and can occur as breakdown product of other pr oducts it has been detected in drinking water sources primarily in the southwest nd in scattered locations acro ss the country contamination has been found most often in ground water in cluding some large aquifers in california in 1999 epa required public water systems to monitor for perchlorate under the unregulated contaminant monitoring rule ucmr to determine the frequency and levels at which it is present in public water supplies nationwide the ucmr required monitoring by all systems serving more th an 10000 persons and by sample of smaller systems of some 3700 water systems teste d perchlorate was detected in 153 systems in 26 states and two commonwealths including 58 systems in california in 14 systems perchlorate levels exceeded epas prelimin ary remediation goal of 245 ppb california has required more comprehensive monitoring nd perchlorate has been detected at least twice in 241 active or standby sources of dr inking water in that state since 2002 in 2005 epa reported perchlorate cont amination at 65 dod facilities 7 other fede ral facilities and 37 private sites1 all sampling results combined ie soil public and private drinking water wells groundwater monitoring we lls and surface water the government accountability office reported that perc hlorate has been found at 395 sites2 monitoring also has been conducted to ssess the presence of perchlorate in foods in 2004 the food and drug administration f da tested 500 samples of foods including vegetables milk and bottled water for perchlorate samples were taken in areas where water was thought to be c ontaminated the fda found pe rchlorate in roughly 90 of lettuce samples average leve ls ranged from 119 ppb to 77 ppb for lettuces and in 101 of 104 bottled milk samples with an average level of 57 ppb to assess the presence of perchlorate in wider range of foods the f da began testing all samp in its total diet study in 20053 perchlorate was detected in 625 of 1065 50 of samples and in 211 of the 285 74 foods tested4 in most cases perchlorate levels were in the low singlehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21961crs3 4 continued 2008 110 5 michael kelsh et primary cong enital hypothyroidism newborn thyroid function

1865 digits however levels were higher in some foods eg shrimp tomatoes spinach and bacon the study found that 2yearolds have the highest total perchlorate intake per kilogram body weight per day followed by in fants 6 to 12 months of age and children 6 to 10 years of age the widespread detecti on of perchlorate in food is relevant to epas standardsetting efforts because epa cons iders nonwater exposures when determining whether to establish standard for contamin ant and at what level to set standard health effects perchlorate is not known to cau cancer it is known to disrupt the uptake of iodine in the thyroid and health effects associated with perchlorate exposure are expected to parallel those caused by iodi ne deficiency iodine deficiency decreases the production of thyroid hormones which help regulate the bodys metabolism and growth key concern is that impairment of thyroid function in pregnant women can affect fetuses and nursing infants and can result in delayed development and decreased learning capacity several human studies ve indicated that thyroid changes occur in humans at significantly higher levels of pe rchlorate than the amounts typically observed in water supplies5 however 2006 study by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc of representative sa mple of the us population found that environmental exposures to pe rchlorate have an effect on thyroid hormone levels in women with iodine deficiency effect was found in men fully 36 of the 1111 women in this study were found to be iodine deficient and the median level of urinary perchlorate measured in the women was 29 ppb6 epa assessment of perchlorate for regulation over the past decade epa has evaluated perchlorate to determine whether federal drinking water standard is needed u nder the safe drinking water act sdwa 1412b1 epa must regulate contaminant if the administrator determines that the contaminant 1 may have an dverse health effect 2 occurs in public water systems at frequency and level of public health concern and 3 in the sole judgment of the administrator regulation of the contaminan t presents meaningful opportunity for reducing health risks in 1997 when sens itive detection method became available for perchlorate and detections increased scientific inform ation was limited in 1998 epa placed perchlorate on the list of contaminants that were candidate s for regulation but concluded that information was insufficient to determine whether perchlorate should be regulated under the sdwa epa listed perchlorate as prior ity for further research on health effects and treatment technologies and for collecting occurrence data in 1999 epa required water systems to monitor for perc hlorate under the unregulated contaminant monitoring rule to determine the frequency and levels at which it is present in public water supplies nationwide in january 2007 ep reported that it had collected sufficienthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21961crs4 occurrence data and that furt her monitoring was not needed for the agency to make regulatory determination 72 fed reg 367 january 4 2007 perchlorate risk assessment in 1992 and again in 1995 epa issued draft reference doses rfds for perchlorate exposure an rfd is an estimate with uncertainty spanning perhaps an order of magnitude of daily oral exposure that is not expected to cause any adverse noncancer health effects during lifetime in developing an rfd epa incorporates factors to account for sensitive subpopula tions study duration inter and intraspecies variability and data ga ps the draft rfds range of 00001 to 00005 milligrams per kilogram mgkg body weight per day translated to drinking water equivalent level of 4 ppb18 ppb epa takes the rfd into account when tting drinking water standard it also considers costs the capabilities of monitoring and treatment technologies and other sources of perchlorat exposure such as food epas 1999 draft risk characterization resu lted in human risk benchmark of 00009 mgkg per day with 100fold uncertainty fact or which converted to drinking water equivalent level of 32 ppb however epa determined that the available health effects and toxicity database was inad equate for risk assessment in 1999 epa issued an interim assessment guidance for perchlorate which recommended that epa risk managers use the earlier reference dose range and drinking water equivalent leve l dwel of 418 ppb for perchloraterelated assessment activities at hazardous waste sites in 2002 epa prepared draft risk assessm ent that concluded that the potential human health risks of perchlorate exposures include effects on the developing nervous system and thyroid tumors based on rat studies that observed benign tumors and adverse effects in fetal brain deve lopment the document included draft rfd of 000003 mgkg per day which translated to drinking wa ter equivalent level of 1 ppb this document was controversial both for its implications for cleanup costs and for science policy reasons for example some peer revi ewers expressed concern over epas risk assessment methodology and relia nce on rat studies dod water suppliers and other commentors expressed concern that the draft rfd could lead to unnecessarily stringent and costly cleanups of perchlor ate releases at federal facilitie s and in water supplies in 2002 federal interagency perchlorate work ing group convened to discuss perchlorate risk assessment research and regulatory i ssues and related agency concerns working group members included dod epa the department of energy the national aeronautics and space administration the office of scie nce and technology policy the council on environmental quality and the office of management and budget nrc perchlorate study to resolve some of the uncertainty and debate over perchlorates health effects and the 2002 draft risk assessmen t the interagency working group asked the national resear ch council nrc to review the available science for perchlorate and epas draft assessment the nrc was asked to comment and make recommendations the nrc committee to assess th health implications of perchlorate ingestion issued its review in january 2005 nd suggested several changes to epas draft risk assessment the committee concluded that because of key differences between rats and humans studies in rats were of limited use for quantitatively assessing human health risk associated with perchl orate exposure although the committee agreed that thyroid tumors found in few rats were likely pe rchlorate treatmentrela ted it concluded that perchlorate exposure is unlikely to lead to thyroid tumors in humans the committee noted that unlike rats humans have multiple mechanisms to compensate for iodidehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21961crs5 7 national research council health implications of perchlorate ingestion committee to assess the health implications of perchlorate in gestion national academy of sciences 2005 p 9deficiency and thyroid disorders also the nrc found flaws in the design and methods used in the rat studies the committee concluded that the animal data selected by epa should not be used as the basis of the risk assessment the committee also reviewed epas risk assessment model it agreed that epas model for perchlorate toxicity represented possible early sequence of events after exposure but it did not think that the model accurately represented possible outcomes after changes in thyroid hormone producti on further the committee disagreed with epas definition of change in thyroid horm one level as an adverse effect rather the nrc defined transient changes in serum thyroid hormone as biochemical events that might precede adverse effects and identified hypothyroidism as the first adverse effect because of research gaps regarding perchlorates potential effects following changes in thyroid hormone production the committee made the recommendation that epa use nonadverse effect ie the inhibition of iodide uptak by the thyroid in humans rather than an adverse effect as the basis for the risk assessment the committee explained that inhibition of iodide uptake is more reliable and valid measure it has been unequivocally demonstrated in humans exposed to perchlorate and it is the key event that precedes all thyroidmediated effects of perchlorate exposure7 based on the use of this point of departure the reliance on human studi and the use of an uncertainty factor of 10 for intraspecies differen ces the nrcs recommendations led to an rfd of 00007 mgkg per day the committee concluded that this rfd should protect the most sensitive population ie the fetuses of pregnant women who might ve hypothyroidism or iodide deficiency and noted that the rfd was suppor ted by clinical studies occupational and environmental epidemiologic studies and studi of longterm perchlorate administration to patients with hyperthyroidism in add ition the nrc identified da ta gaps and research needs the committee has received some critic ism for the extent to which it relied on small shortterm human study and debate over perchlorate s health risks has continued epas response in 2005 epa adopted the n rc recommended reference dose of 00007 mgkg per day which translates to drinking water equivalent level of 245 ppb the dwel is the concentration of cont aminant in water that is expected to have adverse effects it is intended to include margin of safety to protect the fetuses of pregnant women who might have preexistin g thyroid condition or insufficient iodide intake epa based the dwel on the assu mption that all exposure would come from drinking water if epa were to develop drinking water standard for perchlorate it would lower the dwel to account for other sources of exposure particularly food in january 2006 epas superfund offi ce issued guidance adopting the nrc reference dose and the dwel of 245 ppb as th recommended value to be considered as the preliminary remediation goal prg to guide perchlorate assessment and cleanup at superfund sites in march epas childre ns health protection advisory committee chpac wrote to the epa administrator that the prg does not protect infants who are highly susceptible to neurodevelopmental toxicity and may be more exposed than fetuses to perchlorate the chpac noted that perchlorate is concentrated in breast milk and that nursing infants could receive daily doses greater than the rfd if the mother is exposed tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21961crs6 245 ppb perchlorate in tap water the co mmittee recommended that the superfund office lower the prg and that the office of water velop standard for perchlorate and in the interim issue drinking wate r health advisory that takes into account early life exposures in october 2008 epa announced preliminary determination not to regulate perchlorate noting that less th an 1 of water systems have perchlorate levels above the health reference level ep concluded that perchlorate failed to meet two of sdwas regulatory criteria ie that contaminant occur frequently at levels of health concern and that establishing national drinking water standard would provide meaningful opportunity for health risk reduction in response epas science advisory boards sabs drinking water committee argued that given perchlorates occurrence and well documented toxicity epa must have comp elling basis to suppor t determination not to regulate the sab request ed more time to review th new model epa relied on and to comment on the preliminary dete rmination if the final deter mination is not to regulate epa will develop nonenforceable health advisory to guide state and other officials on health effects monitoring nd treatment technologies and ex pected safe exposure levels department of defense perchlorate actions dod is responsible for some large releases of perchlorate c ontamination and has allotted significant resources to address this problem dod has spent more than 114 million on research activities rega rding perchlorate treatment technologies detection methods toxicity studies and substitutes additional funds have been spent on cleanup although remediation has proceeded at some sites cleanups typically are driven by drinking water standards or other established cleanup st andards with federal standard cleanup goals and re sponsibilities have been ambig uous outside of california and massachusetts where standa rds have been set in 2006 after epa established dwel for perchlorate dod adopted polic setting 24 ppb as the level of concern to be used in managing perchlorate releases unl ess more stringent federal or state standard exists the policy applies broadly to dod installations and form er military lands and directs the services to test for perchlorate wh it is reasonably expected that release has occurred if perchlorate levels exceed 24 ppb sitespecific risk assessment must be conducted if the assessment i ndicates that the pe rchlorate could result in adverse health effects then the site must be prioritized for risk management dod uses relative risk site evaluation framework to help prioritize environmental restoration work and to allocate resources among sites
