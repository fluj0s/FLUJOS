executive orders continuedthe use of union dues for political purposes legal analysis introduction in 1988 the supreme court in communications workers of america v beck hereinafter referred to as beck ruled against organized labor and held that non union employees could not be required to pay full union dues if some of those funds were to be used for activities unrelated to collective bargaining1 under 8a3 of the national labor relations act nlra2 labor union and an employer can enter into contractual agreement requiring all employees in the bargaining unit to pay union dues as condition of employment matter whether such employees became union members or not the supreme court in beck concluded that 8a3 of the nlra 1 does not permit labor union to expend funds on nonrelated union activities such as lobbying and political activities when duespaying nonmember employees object and 2 authorizes only those dues and fees necessary to the duties relating to labormanagement relations3 in 1991 the supreme court in lehnert v ferris faculty association expanded the scope of the beck holdings to include public sector employees so that such employees may not be compelled to subsidize political or ideological activities of public employee unions4 during the 1992 presidential election year on april 13 1992 president george bush issued executive order 12800 requiring federal contractors to post notices informing employees of their rights under the beck decision it required notification to federal contractor nonunion employees that their union dues may not be used to support political activities that they oppose it also required the secretary of labor to issue rules providing for financial disclosure and reporting requirements for labor unions in order to provide enforcement of the beck holdings5 however when president bill clinton took office he repealed former president bushs executive order by issuing executive order 12836 on february 1 1993 which revoked certain executive orders concerning federal contracting6 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97618crs2 6continued concerning federal contracting 1993 usccan b 24 72 usc 441ba prohibiting contributions and

issue in line of decisions which held that labor unions cannot use dissenting non union employees dues for political and ideological activities outside the scope of the activities related to collective bargaining such cases include 1 international association of machinists v street 367 us 740 1961 2 railway clerks v allen 373 us 113 1963 3 abood v district board of education 431 us 209

this report will not discuss the case in more detail since it does not concern labor unions note that in keller v state bar of california 496 us 1 1990 the supreme court held that an integrated state bar which by statute is the regulatory body for the legal profession in state and requires the payment of mandatory dues by its members is analogous to union therefore according to the court using mandatory dues to fund political and ideological activities where such expenditures are not necessarily and reasonably incurred for the purpose of regulating the legal profession or improving the quality of the legal services available to the people of the state the bar violated the integrated bar members first amendment rights labor union political activity under the federal election campaign act of 1971 as amended generally political activities by labor unions in federal elections are prohibited7 first the labor management relations act of 1947 prohibit ed labor union contributions to federal election campaigns8 later the federal election campaign act of 1971 as amended feca generally continued this broad prohibition of labor union activities and funds in federal elections however the feca provided for three broad exemptions to this general prohibition of labor union political activities in federal elections 1 communications by labor organization directed at its members or their families on any subject 2 nonpartisan voter registration and getoutthe vote activities by labor organization which are directed to its members or their families and 3 the establishment and administration of political action committee or separate segregated fund commonly known as pac for the purpose of the solicitation of contributions to such fund for political purposes9 generally any

certain types of labor union activities involving federal elections for example in the 1957 decision united states v united automobile workers the supreme court held that labor union expenditures in connection with federal election would be prohibited to the extent that such activity amounted to electioneering for particular candidate or political party25 the court asserted that the legislative history of provision of the federal corrupt practices act prohibiting labor union contributions and expenditures in federal elections would disallow the expenditure of union dues to pay for commercial broadcasts that are designed to urge the public to elect certain candidate or political party26 in united states v boyle in 1973 the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit

the federal prohibition against labor union contributions and expenditures in federal elections despite first amendment free speech and association rights of the labor union27 the court of appeals in boyle concluded that for labor union disbursement to be illegal under federal law it must be shown that the labor organization 1 made contribution or an expenditure 2 in connection with federal election and 3 for the purpose of active electioneering28 in 1972 supreme court decision in pipefitters v united states reversing certain convictions of labor union officers concerning the use of political fund the court concluded that legitimate labor union political fund must be separate from the labor union in that there must be strict segregation of the political funds monies from the unions dues and assessments29 the court noted that while former 18 usc 610 which prohibited labor organizations from making contributions or expenditures connected with federal election might be interpreted to prohibit the use of union funds to establish and maintain union political fund for the purposes of soliciting and making political contributions in federal campaigns the provision of the federal election campaign act of 1971 allowing labor unions to establish separate segregated funds or political action committees may have impliedly repealed section 61030 background of union security agreements the question frequently arises as to whether compulsory labor union dues may be used by union for political purposes and if so under what restrictions or conditions may such dues be used in order to understand that issue properly it is necessary to understand the various types of union security agreements between employers and labor unions that require employees to provide some form of financial support to the unions as condition of employment one type of security agreement is the socalled closed shop whereby the employer agrees to employ only members in good standing with the union this type of agreement was recognized by the national labor relations act of 1935 nlra popularly known as the wagner act31 but was later prohibited by the labor management relations act of 194732httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97618crs6 33see generally joseph jenkins labor law v 2 49 cincinnati wh anderson co 1969 34under the national labor relations act as amended union shop agreements are permitted whereby employees must obtain membership in the union within 30 days of being employed or within 30 days after the effective date of the agreement whichever is later see 29 usc 158a3 however under the railway labor act rla the union security requirements are substantially the same as in nlra except that the period whereby employees are required to join union is 60 days rather than 30 days see 45 usc 151158 35robert gorman labor law unionization and collective bargaining 64142 st paul west publishing co 1976 36id 64243 3764 stat 1238 codified at 45 usc 152 eleventhanother type of union security agreement is the agency shop agreement whereby the employees do not have to join the union or have full union membership in good standing within thirty days but must support the union by paying sum of money equivalent to union dues in order to retain employment33 most agency shop agreements provide for service fee which includes an initiation fee as well as certain dues that are paid by full union members another form of union security agreement is the union shop which does not condition employment on union member ship but requires that employees join the union after certain grace period on the job and remain members during the term of the labormanagement agreement34 maintenance of membership clause in union contract is another form of union security which imposes obligation to join the union but requires that one remain member once voluntarily becoming one until the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement35 other less formal union security agreements are 1 duescheckoff provision 2 fairshare agreement or 3 hiringhall provision the duescheckoff provision does not require anyone to join union or retain union membership but simply requires that the employer shall deduct from the salary of the union members their union dues and credit that amount to the union fairshare agreement would require all employees to pay the prorated share of the unions collective bargaining and representational expenses but not irrelevant expenses the hiringhall provision is device for job security in certain industries such as in the maritime and construction industries whereby the union and the employer agree that the unionhall is to be the exclusive mode for job referrals36 in 1956 the supreme court in unanimous opinion in railway employees dept afl v hanson upheld the union shop provision of 2 eleventh of the railway labor act as amended37 which provided that notwithstanding the law of any state carrier and labor organization may make an agreement requiring all employees within stated period of time to become members of the labor organization provided that there is discrimination against any employee and provided further that membership is not denied or terminated for any reason otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97618crs7 38351 us 225 228 238 1956 39id 238 40id 236 41the union shop authorization in the street case was pursuant to 2 eleventh of

shop provision of 2 eleventh was within the power of the congress under the commerce clause and did not violate either the first or the fourteenth amendments39 the hanson court noted that it is argued that the union shop agreement forces employees into ideological and political associations that violate their freedom of conscience freedom of association and freedom of thought however the court intimated that if the union shop arrangement were used to impose membership conditions other than the payment of periodic dues initiation fees and assessments involving ideological or political associations to which members may be opposed it might present first amendment problems40 supreme court decisions concerning the use of compulsory union dues for political purposes several years after the supreme court upheld the validity of union security agreements it was faced with the issue of whether union may use funds raised pursuant to unionshop agreement41 to support candidates for public office against the wishes of dissenting employees the court in international association of machinists v street42 found that such expenditures fall outside of the scope of the reasons that justified union shop agreements43 the court asserted however that any dissent by employees to the use of labor union funds for political causes is not to be presumed but must be made known by them to the labor union moreover only those employees who had identified themselves as being opposed to the political uses of their funds would be entitled to relief44 the court was quick to note that this holding would not curtail the traditional political activities of labor unions but required only that labor unions must not support those activities against the expressed wishes of dissenting employees45 the court also suggested the following two possible remedies 1 an injunction against expenditures for political causes opposed by complaining employees in the amount of union dues exacted from them in proportion to the unions total expenditures for political purposes to the unions total budget or 2 restitution to each dissentinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97618crs8 46id 775 47373 us 113 11819 1963

spreading political message were protected by the first amendmentemployee of the portion of his or her dues which was spent by the union for political purposes46 in 1963 the supreme court in railway clerks v allen reaffirmed that under 2 eleventh of the railway labor act labor unions cannot over an employees objection use exacted funds to support political activities which such employees oppose47 the allen court extended street finding that it would be impractical to require dissenting employee to allege and prove each distinct union political expenditure to which he objects48 but retained its requirement that such opposition be made known to the union by each dissenting employee the allen court reaffirmed the remedies suggested by the street court but offered suggestions of its own it suggested practical decree which would order 1 refund to the dissenting employee of portion of the exacted dues in the same proportion that the political expenditures bore to the total union expenditures and 2 future reduction of dues from the dissenting employee by the same proportion49 the court placed the burden of determining the appropriate proportions on the unions since they were in possession of the relevant materials in 1977 the supreme court in abood v detroit board of education extended street and allen to encompass dissenting nonunion public employees50 basing its decision however on constitutional grounds that were not at issue in the prior cases while labor organizatio n can constitutionally expend funds for the expression of political and ideological views which are not germane to its collectivebargaining activities it can only finance such expenditures from the dues of nondissenting employees51 dissenting nonunion employees have constitutional first amendment right to prevent labor union from using proportionate share of their service fees for certain political and ideological activities unrelated to the unions collective bargaining activities52 the abood court noted that in determining remedy the objective of the court would be to devise method to prevent the compulsory subsidization of political and ideological activities by dissenting nonuni on employees without restricting the unions ability to require all employees to pay for the unions collectivebargaining activities as it had previously in street and allen the abood court in remanding the case for further proceedings suggested remedies which included 1 refund of that portion of the exacted dues in the proportion that union political expenditures borehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97618crs9 53466 us 435 1984 54id 443 55id 444 56id 448 57id 44853 58475 us 292 1986to the total union expenditures and 2 reduction of future union dues to dissenting nonunion employees by the same proportion in ellis v brotherhood of railway clerks the court was asked to determine the validity of rebate scheme in which labor union collected dues from employees and used them for certain political and ideological activities later paying rebate to employees who dissented from the political and ideological use of such dues53 the court noted that under the rebate scheme the union obtains an involuntary loan for those political and ideological activities to which the dissenting employees object54 since there were readily available acceptable alternatives to such union borrowing such as advance reduction of dues andor interestbearing accounts the court found that union cannot be allowed to use the dissenting employees funds even temporari ly thus the court found that although the rebate scheme reduces the statutory violation it does not eliminate the violation55 in reaching its decision the court developed the following test for determining whether certain activities must be paid for by dissenting employees subject to labor management agreement the test must be whether the challenged expenditures are necessarily or reasonably incurred for the purpose of performing the duties of an exclusive representative of the employees in dealing with the employer on labor management issues under such standard dissenting employees could be required to pay their fair share of 1 the direct costs of negotiating collective bargaining contract 2 the direct costs of administering such contract 3 the costs of settling grievances and disputes and 4 certain costs of activities or undertakings by labor union to implement or effectuate the duties of the labor union as the exclusive representative of the employee56 the court found that dissenting employees could be charged for such union activities as 1 conventions which are essential to the labor unions discharge of its duties as collectivebargaining agent 2 labor union social activities which are reasonably related to the unions collective bargaining activities 3 labor union publications which report on labormanagement relations and collective bargaining activities 4 organizing expenses for the purpose of making the labor union stronger and 5 litigation expenses incurred in negotiating and administering labor contract or in settling grievances and disputes57 two years later in chicago teachers union v hudson58 the court was presented with an issue involving the procedural safeguards related to the collection of agency fees by union under the agency shop agreement between the union and the chicago board of education proportionate share payments which approximated 95 percent of the regular union dues were deducted from nonmembers paycheckshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97618crs10 59id 309 60id 30407 61id 310 62487 us 735 1988 63id 752 quoting ellis v railway clerks 466 us at 44748 64id 75154the union established threestage procedure with the unions administration to consider nonmembers objections to such deductions the court found that the unions procedure failed to minimize the risk that the exacted fees of nonunion employees might be used for impermissible ideological and political purposes59 the court concluded that this procedure was inadequate even though the exacted funds of the nonmembers were placed in an escrow account the procedure contained three fundamental flaws 1 failure to minimize the risk that nonunion employees contributions might be temporarily used for political and ideological purposes 2 failure to provide sufficient information to nonmembers about the basis of their proportionate shares and the method of determining their advance reduction of dues 3 failure to provide reasonably prompt decision by an impartial arbitrator in determining whether or not nonmembers dues should be further reduced60 accordingly the supreme court held that the constitutional requirements for the unions collection of agency fees from nonmembers would include 1 an adequate explanation for the basis of the fee 2 reasonably prompt opportunity to challenge the amount of the fee before an impartial arbitrator and 3 the establishment of an escrow fund for the amounts reasonably in dispute while any challenges are pending the supreme court remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with such holdings61 like the prior decisions the 1988 supreme court decision in communications workers of america v beck held that 8a3 of the national labor relations act does not permit labor union to spend funds exacted from duespaying nonunion employees on certain activities unrelated to collective bargaining when those employees object to such expenditures62 the court found that 8a3 of the national labor relations act was like 2 eleventh of the railway labor act in that it authoriz ed the exaction of only those dues which would be necessary to performing the duties of an exclusive bargaining representative of the employees in dealing with the employer on labormanagement issues63 in examining the legislative history of 8a3 the court found that congress wished to afford nonmembers adequate protection by allowing the collection of only those fees which would be necessary to finance collective bargaining activities even though congress under 8a3 did not in any way limit the uses for which the unions could expend such fees exacted from nonmembers such silence was not to be interpreted to mean that there was congressional acquiescence in the use of funds for activities that were unrelated to collective bargaining activities64 congress purpose in providing for compulsory unionism was to force employees to bear their fair share of the costs related to negotiations administration of collective bargaininghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97618crs11 65500 us 507 1991 66500 us at 519 67500 us at 52224agreements and the settlement of disputes but not to support union political activities which they oppose under 8a3 congress justification for the union shop would limit the unions expenditures which can be passed on to nonmembers only to those relating to labormanagement relations the court concluded that it was not the intent of congress under 8a3 of the national labor relations act to allow unions in agency shop agreements to have free rein to exact dues from nonmembers in any amounts they please and then to spend them on activities which are unrelated to collective bargaining activities beck however does not extend to union members the only way that such an employee may fall under the ruling in beck is to first resign his union membership and then object to the use of his exacted dues for political or other purposes unrelated to collective bargaining the last case concerning the use of agency fees decided by the supreme court was lehnert v ferris faculty association65 in lehnert the court upheld the constitutionality of the michigan statute providing for agencyshop agreements in the public sector and set forth threepart test for determining permissible nonpolitical and nonideological uses for the service fee that nonmembers are required to pay the unions for their services as sole collective bargaining agent for all employees the michigan statute applied to faculty members of ferris state college public educational institution who are represented by the ferris faculty association ffa local bargaining unit affiliated with the michigan education association mea and the national education association nea the nonunion faculty brought suit to challenge certain uses of the service fees which they were compelled to pay the ffa and which were equivalent to the amount of dues required of union member they claimed that the use of fees for purposes other than the negotiation and administration of the collective bargaining agreement was in violation of their rights under the first and fourteenth amendments of the constitution the supreme court established test derived from the preceding line of cases for determining whether particular expenditure of union funds could be charged to nonmember employees chargeable uses must 1 be germane to collective bargaining activities 2 be justified by the governmental interest in the maintenance of labor peace and the prevention of free riders who benefit from the unions collective bargaining activities without contributing to the costs of such activities and 3 not add significantly to the burdening of free speech inherent in the existence of an agency or union shop66 the court also rejected the petitioners contentions that they could only be charged for collective bargaining activities undertaken directly for their local unit and that there must be direct link between an activity and tangible benefit to the local unit67 four activities were found by the supreme court to be chargeable to the non members first nonmembers should
