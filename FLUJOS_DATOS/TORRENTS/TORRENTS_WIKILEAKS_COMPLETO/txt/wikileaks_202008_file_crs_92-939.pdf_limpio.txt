g146g151g561g4g155g146g142g143g343g561 public works infrastructure programs it often is argued that public works programs create worthwhile longlasting tangible outputs eg highways bridges water and sewer systems and teach workers marketable skills because implementation of infrastructure programs often has been slow however they may increase the demand for labor when the economy already is expanding and thereby drive up wages and the inflation rate if funds mainly are devoted to construction projects requiring expensive materials and equipment and utilizing highskilled workers then public works might be comparatively costly way to create jobs alternatively if funds are devoted to more laborintensive projects eg those involving maintenance and repair of roads and bridges more jobs could be created per dollar of spending public service programs countercyclical public service jobs programs typically have been quicker to startup than public works programs in addition larger share of public service expenditures go toward wages than materials and equipment as result more jobs can be created per dollar of spending on public service activities as compared to infrastructure projects public service job creation programs also tend to help broader range of workers by involving more lowskilled unemployed workers it commonly is claimed however that public service programs impart few skills to participants and that participants engage in makework projects ie activities that are not worthwhile revenuesharing programs revenue sharing can stabilize state and local budgets by giving governments funds so they might avoid cutbacks in services or increases in taxes due to recessioninduced revenue shortfalls spending cuts or tax increases at the state or local level could exacerbate recessions impact and offset federal counteryclical measures it is asserted that federal grants to governments can produce jobs fairly quickly if the money can be used for general purposes and if neither new regulations nor new administrative entities are required but if few strings are attached to the ways in which federal funds can be spent there is risk that governments might use the funds for purposes that create fairly few new jobs eg building up cash balances employment tax credits some analysts think that an employment tax credit is superior to public employment approaches because the former offers subsidized jobs at private sector firms where workers may learn skills that are more readily transferable to unsubsidized jobs other benefits claimed for jobs tax credit are that it neither requires new government program nor an administrative entity unless businesses believe there will be sufficient demand for their products however they are unlikely to increase hiring despite the credits availability and faced with only temporary subsidy of their labor compared to capital costs firms may be unwilling to change 1 in addition to the evaluations cited in subsequent

relatively less expensive workers one drawback that is common to each of these approaches is that they might not create any more jobs than would have been created in their absen ce for example federal funds could be used to pay for public works projects that state governments would have undertaken with their own money similarly employers could claim tax credit for already anticipated hiring however the likelihood of this occurring is greater if the programs are in effect when an economic recovery is underway

pl 87658 created the accelerated public works apw program the first effort in the postworld war ii period to create publicly funded jobs in construction and related private sector industries as way to combat rising unemployment in addition to redevelopment areas designated under the area redevelopment act areas eligible for assistance were those the secretary of labor determined had experienced substantial unemployment ie jobless rate above 6 for at least nine of the preceding 12 months the program coordinated by the commerce department was conducted through existing federal agencies it provided 852 million for such projects as water and sewer facilities hospitals and street construction the apw program and subsequent public works programs have been criticized for their delayed startup which resulted in projects not being completed until well after recessions end some observers have suggested that if there were program already in place with prescribed triggers for its initiation the issue of timeliness would be resolved in response others have said that it still would take time to allocate funds award contracts obtain materials hire workers and complete the projects themselves the local public works capital development and investment act of 1976 pl 94369 title i and the public works employment act of 1977 pl 9528 appropriated 6 billion for the local public works lpw program the economic development administration allocated funds to states on the basis of their unemployment levels and rates and to substate areas on the basis of complicated formula there was criticism that lpw funds were substituted for local funds that would have been spent on similar projects in the absence of the federal program the differing assumptions of analysts about the extent of this practice fiscal substitution resulted in markedly disparate estimates of the net number of jobs created by the program 3 in addition the lpw program largely provided 2 the section is

persons who did get jobs the experience and skills acquired probably were minimal because the average length of employment was short the emergency jobs appropriations act of 1983 pl 988 was designed to deal with some of the criticisms leveled at earlier job creation efforts by appropriating additional funds to existing programs with projects already underway congress expected that money would be spent and jobs would be created comparatively quickly according to an evaluation by the then general accounting office gao this was not the case gao also found that few jobs went to the unemployed despite the law requiring that funds be used as much as possible to create jobs for the jobless pl 988 provided some 9 billion to 77 programs and activities administered by 18 federal departments and agencies about 86 of the appropriations 78 billion went to 55 programs and activities that fund public works activities eg construction repair and maintenance of buildings and facilities the remainder went to 22 programs and activities that perform public service functions eg the maternal and child health services block grant the social services block grant and community health centers 620 million income support 400 million and employment and training assistance 230 million the supplemental appropriations act of 1993 p l 10350 was signed into law in july 1993 well after the 19901991 recession had ended like pl 988 pl 10350 provided additional funds for public works and public service programs eg 1665 million for summer youth employment 150 million for hiring police officers 50 million for the youth fair chance program 45 million for amtraks operating losses and capital improvements 355 million for rural water and sewer direct loans and 35 million for rural water and waste disposal

program pep authoriz ed by the employment act of 1971 pl 94 369 title i was the first sizeable 25 billion antirecessionary public service employment effort since the great depression the temporary program sought to provide public service jobs for unemployed and underemployed persons funds were allocated to units of government based upon the relative severity of unemployment funds were spent quickly which meant that jobs were created rapidly the program was labor intensive with large share of the funds going toward wages several studies found that many of the jobs subsidized by pep would have existed in its absence and that the program creamed ie took the best qualified members of the eligible population pep was designed to focus resources on those thought to be most in need the law called for targeting assistance to such groups as veterans younger and older workers the economically disadvantaged welfare recipients migrant workers nonenglish speakers and workers laid off due to

mandated that maximum salary of 12000 per employee could come from fede ral funds and excluding teaching positions maximum of onethird of the jobs created could be for professionals the emergency jobs and unemployment assistance at of 1974 pl 93567 amended the comprehensive employment and training act ceta to add title vi the emergency jobs program was established to mitigate cyclical unemployment by funding temporary positions in federal state and local governments and in nonprofits that provide public services title vi funds about 15 billion over the 19751982 period were allocated to prime sponsors based on measures of the relative severity of unemployment the program created many jobs quickly but ceta s public service program was criticized for creating make work dead end jobs that neit her provided society with worthwhile output nor ceta workers with skills as previously mentioned the public works approach is believed to create worthwhile outputs but it might not permit much skill acquisition because the time spent on projects can be quite short initially to be eligible for subsidized jobs under title vi individuals had to have been unemployed for 30 days or 15 days in areas where the unemployment rate exceeded 7 in both the 1976 and 1978 amendments to ceta the title vi eligibility criteria were tightened to target funds to lowincome unemployed persons eg the maximum annual federal subsidy per program participant was lowered to 10000 these changes were enacted to discourage what was perceived as widespread practice by state and local governments that reduced the net number of jobs created laying off current employees and then rehiring them using title vi rather than state and local funds to pay them

94369 at title ii established the antirecession fiscal assistance arfa program it operated from 1976 to late 1978 arfa funds were released only if the national jobless rate exceed 6 and the allocation to individual governments was determined by local unemployment rates over 45 and by their general revenue sharing allocations by law recipients of arfa funds were required to spend appropriate or obligate funds within six months of their receipt the use of arfa funds was largely unrestricted ie for the maintenance of basic services customarily provided by government the funds generally could be used for employment and acquisition of normal supplies or materials but not for construction or renovation gao report concluded that the program did not accomplish its objectives of preventing employee layoffs tax increases and service cutbacks it also stated that the unemployment rate is not necessarily good indicator of recessions impact on jurisdictions financial condition additionally

credit intended to promote private sector job growth as an antidote to cyclical unemployment the new jobs tax credit njtc was enacted in 1977 pl 9530 title ii it ended in late 1978 the revenue loss to the government associated with the credit less the required reduction by firms deduction for wages and including carryovers for several years was estimated by the treasury department to be 57 billion the njtc was general subsidy meant to increase employment among all workers as opposed to specific groups it gave employers credit against corporate or personal income tax liabilities for job growth above specified threshold that occurred in 1977 and 1978 thus njtc was an incremental marginal subsidy credits were issu ed to businesses only if their employment rose by given amount above certain base in this case the credit was equal to onehalf of the increase above 2 in an employers federal unemployment tax act wage base between the base and current year as marginal credit it tended to favor growing laborintensive firms and to help reduce windfall gains ie paying employers for hiring they would have undertaken in the absence of the program over time however it becomes increasingly difficult for employers to qualify for marginal credit the njtc was capped in three different ways firm could claim credit in excess of 100000 annually 25 of its unemployment insurance ui wages in the current year or onehalf of the difference in the firms total wages for the year above 5 of the previous years total wages the reason for limiting the credit by relating it to the increase in total wages was to prevent employers from claiming credits by artificially increasing their ui wages eg making fulltime job into parttime jobs or substituting lower paid for higher paid workers the reason for capping the credit at percentage of firms ui wages was to try to limit the amount that new expanding firms could claim the njtc was faulted for its complexity among other things because the credit was nonrefundable nonprofit groups could not benefit from it firms could carry back the credit against past income taxes and carry it forward against future taxes if the njtc exceeded the firms current income tax liability they had to reduce their wage deduction by the amount of the njtc when computing taxable income one survey found that relatively few employers knew about the credit and of the firms that were aware of it relatively few made special effort to increase employment because of the njtc or thought they were eligible to claim it alternatively other analysts credited the njtc with high em ployer use as shown by the amount claimed on tax returns 6 the section is drawn from john bishop the potential of wage subsidies final report to the employment and training administration
