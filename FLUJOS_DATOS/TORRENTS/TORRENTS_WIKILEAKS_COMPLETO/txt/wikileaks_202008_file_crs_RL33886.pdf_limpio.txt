homeland security and governmental affairs concluded that the agencys leader had lacked the leadership skills that were needed for his critical position in response the postkatrina emergency management reform act of 2006 pl 109295 120 stat 1394 stipulated that the fema administrator among other top agency leaders must meet cert ain qualifications president george w bushs signing statement for this act seemingly challeng ed the constitutionality of these requirements and it stated that the executive branch shall construe the applicable provision in manner consistent with the appointments clause of the constitution three members of congress then urged the president to reconsider his position and join them in calling for strong standards and the highest professional qualifications for the leadership of fema and for open dialogue between the executive and legislative branches on issues of such significant importance to out nations safety and security these events reflect broader interbranch differences over congressional authority to establish statutory qualifications the preponderance of evidence and historical practice suggests that congress generally has the constitutional authority to set such qualifications the boundaries of this authority have not been conclusively drawn however and the executive branch in recent years has asserted that congressional authority in this area is more limited than congressional practice would suggest statutory qualification requirements might continue to be an area of conflict between congress and the president inasmuch as these provisions are not selfenforcing their success as means of assuring competent leadership of the federal government will depend upon the two branches adherence to them during the selection and confirmation processes in practice it has not been unusual for congress to mandate that appointees to certain positions meet specified requirements some statutory qualification provisions like those for the fema administrator require that appointees have certain experience skills or educational backgrounds that are associated with competence other qualification provisions address variety of characteristics such as citizenship status residency or for the purpose of maintaining political balance on regulatory boards political party affiliation congress has used such statutory provisions selectively most executive branch positions do not have them this report provides background on the constitutional appointments framework discusses congresss

hurricane katrina some members of congress and others questioned the competence of leadership at the federal emergency management agency fema after investigating the federal response to the hurricane the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs concluded among other findings that the agencys leader had lacked the leadership skills that were needed for his critical position1 the committee went on to recommend that future leaders of national emergency management efforts have significant experience in crisis management in addition to substantial management and leadership experience whether in the public private or nonprofit sector2 at the time of hurricane katrina appointees to the top fema leadership position were not required in statute to meet any qualifications3 this was changed by the postkatrina emergency management reform act of 20064 under which the fema administrator among other top agency leaders is required to meet certain qualifications the act provides the following the administrator shall be appointed from among individuals who havea demonstrated ability in and knowledge of emergency management and homeland security and b not less than 5 years of executive leadership and management experience in the public or private sector 5 the bush administration seemingly challenged the legitimacy of this provision in the presidents signing statement for the act it reads in part as follows section 503c of the homeland security act of 2002 as amended by section 611 of the act provides for the appointment and certain duties of the administrator of the federal emergency management agency section 503c2 vests in the president authority to appoint the administrator by and with the advice and consent of the senate but purports to limit the qualifications of the pool of persons from whom the president may select the appointee in manner that rules out large portion of those persons best qualified by experience and knowledge to fill the office the executive branch shall construe section 503c2 in manner consistent with the appointments clause of the constitution 6 the president appears to take issue with the ex tent to which the qualifications might limit the pool of potential nominees to the position the statement does not make clear whether the administration sees section 503c2 as being in conflict with the appointments clause and if so in what way the final sentence in the excerpt suggests that to the degree that section 503c2 is seen to be in conflict with the administrations reading of the appointments clause the president might elect not to abide by the provision in response to the signing statement three 1 us congress senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs hurricane katrina nation

join them in calling for strong standards and the highest professional qualifications for the leadership of fema and for open dialogue between the executive and legislative branches on issues of such significant importance to out nations safety and security7 both congress and the president have an interest in assuring that the federal government is led by appointees who have the necessary qualifications to successfully and faithfully implement the law as discussed later in this report the preponderance of evidence and historical practices suggest that congress has the constitutional authority to set such qualificationsas long as those qualifications do not amount to facto legislative designation in many instances congress has mandated that appointees to leadership positions meet specified requirements some statutory qualification provisions like those for the fema administrator require that appointees have certain experience skills or educational backgrounds that are

the responsib ility of determining how most leaders of the federal government will be appointed the framework for this process is based in article ii the president shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall appoint ambassadors other public ministers and consuls judges of the supreme court and all other officers of the united states whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for and which shall be established by law but the congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers as they think proper in the president alone in the courts of law or in the heads of departments 8 this clause sets presidential appointment by and with the advice and consent of the senate hereafter referred to as pas positions as the default process for filling such positions9 but only certain officers of the united states must be appointed by that method at the discretion of congress inferior officers may be appointed either under the default process or by the president alone the courts or agency heads the supreme court has interpreted the phrase officers of the united states to mean any appointee exercising significant authority pursuant to the laws of

the nonpas processes in edmond v united states 11 the court reasoned that generally speaking the term inferior officer connotes relationship with some higher ranking officer or officers below the president whether one is an inferior officer depends on whether he has superior it is not enough that other officers may be identified who formally maintain higher rank or possess responsibilities of greater magnitude if that were the intention the constitution might have used the phrase lesser officer rather in the context of clause designed to preserve political accountability relative to important government assignments we think it evident that inferior officers are officers whose work is directed and supervised at some level by others who were appointed by presidential nomination with the advice and consent of the senate 12 this suggests that aside from officers in positions that the constitution specifically identifies such as ambassadors and judges of the supreme court the constitution requires only one layer of advice and consent positions in the hierarchy of each agency it indicates that appointees with pasappointed supervisors are inferior officers and that congress may therefore provide for appointment by one of the other specified authorities13 in the case of executive branch departments and agencies outside the white house congress usually elects either to use the pas process or to delegate authority to the agency head this enables the senate to play role in appointmen ts to the leadership positions where it is most interested in maintaining influence over programs and policies in some cases senators may influence nominee selection they also may obtain commitments to carry out implementation of laws in certain ways during confirmation hearings and they are likely to exact promises to testify before committees for oversight purposes

incident to its constitutional authority to establish the office historically it has established qualifications many times justice louis brandeis in dissenting opinion in myers v united states documented the longstanding nature of this practice he observed that multitude of laws have been enacted which limit the presidents power to make nominations and added that such restriction upon the power to nominate has been exercised by congress continuously since the foundation of the government 14 justice brandeis noted that congress has from time to time restricted the presidents selection by the requirement of citizenship it has limited the power of nomination by providing that the office may be held only by resident of the united states of state of particular state of particular

professional attainments of occupational experience it s in other cases prescribed the test of examinations it has imposed the requirement of age of sex of race of property and of habitual temperance in the use of intoxicating liquors congress has imposed like restrictions on the power of nomination by requiring political representation or that the selection be made on nonpartisan basis it has required in some cases that the representation be industrial in others that it be geographic it has at times required that the presidents nominees be taken from or include representatives from particular branches or departments of the government by still other statutes congress has confined the presidents selection to small number of persons to be named by others 15 when specifying qualifications congress has at times come close to specifying the individual who must be appointed in 1916 for example congress enacted law providing that of the vacancies created in the judge advocates department by this act one such vacancy not below the rank of major shall be filled by the appointment of person from civil life not less than fortyfive nor more than fifty years of age who shall have been for ten years judge of the supreme court of the philippine islands shall have served for two years as captain in the regular or volunteer army and shall be proficient in the spanish language and laws 16 these requirements would likely have limited the presidents potential choices to one or two people limitation on the presidents appointment power that might not withstand judicial scrutiny although congress enjoys broad discretion in establishing qualifications its constitutional power is probably not without limits in its majority opinion in myers the court noted that the legislative power comprehends the authority to prescribe qualifications for office or reasonable classification for promotion provided of course that these qualifications do not so limit selection and so trench upon executive choice as to be in effect legislative designation 17 g7g161g142g140g158g157g146g159g142g561g4g155g138g151g140g145g561g24g146g142g160g156g561 although the preponderance of evidence and historical practice supports the understanding that congress has broad authority in this area this view is not universally held executive branch views as articulated through presidential signing statements and opinions of the department of justice have ranged from the assertion that congress has such authority to an acknowledgment of some such authority that lacks clear boundaries

39 as enacted by subsections 501a and 601a of the act which purport to limit the qualifications of the pool of persons from whom the president may select appointees in manner that rules out large portion of those persons best qualified by experience and knowledge to fill the positions in manner consistent with the appointments clause of the constitution18 previous presidents in other signing statements also raised constitutional objections to qualification provisions in 1992 signing statement for legislation establishing the morris k udall scholarship and excellence in national environmental policy foundation for example president george hw bush stated that the bill he was signing into law purported to set qualifications including requirements as to political party affiliation for the trustees who will administer the foundation created by the bill in his estimation under the appointments clause of the constitution congressional participation in such appointments may be exercised only through the senates advice and consent with respect to presidential nominees he stated that he would therefore treat these provisions as precatory 19 signing statement by president william j cl inton raised specific rather than blanket objections to qualifications provision while agreeing to abide by its requirements section 21b of the act would forbid the appointment as united states trade representative or deputy united states trade representative of anyone who had ever directly represented aided or advised fo reign government or political party in any trade negotiation or trade dispute with the ited states the congress may not of course impose broad restrictions on the presidents constitutional prerogative to nominate persons of his choosing to the highest executive branch positions and this is especially so in the area of foreign relations however because as policy matter i agree with the goal of ensuring the undivided loyalty of our representatives in trade negotiations i intend as matter of practice to act in accordance with this provision 20

for congress to set qualifications in 1871 for example attorney general amos t akerman offered the following opinion the argument has been made that the unquestioned right of congress to create offices implies right to prescribe qualifications for them this is admitted but this right to prescribe qualifications is limited by the necessity of leaving scope for the judgment and will of the person or body in whom the constitution vests the power of appointment the parts of the constitution which confer this power are as valid as those parts from which congress derives the power to create

filled according to the constitutional rule though the appointing power alone can designate an individual for an office either congress by direct legislation or the president by authority derived from congress can prescribe qualifications and require that the designation shall be made out of class of persons ascertained by proper tests to have those qualifications it has been argued that right in congress to limit in the least the field of selection implies right to carry on the contracting process to the designation of particular individual but i do not think this fair conclusion congress could require that officers shall be of american citizenship or of certain age that judges should be of the legal profession and of certain standing in the profession and still leave room to the appointing power for the exercise of its own judgment and will and i am not prepared to affirm that to go further and require that the selection shall be made from persons found by an examin ing board to be qualified in such particulars as diligence scholarship integrity good manners and attachment to the government would impose an unconstitutional limitation on the appointing power it would still have reasonable scope for its own judgment and will but it may be asked at what point must the contracting process stop i confess my inability to answer but the difficulty of drawing line between such limitations as are and such as are not allowed by the constitution is proof that both classes do not exist 21 1979 opinion of the justice departments office of legal counsel olc was seemingly consistent with the earlier view stating that congress has power to prescribe qualifications for office but the power of appointment belongs to the president and it cannot be usurped or abridged by congress there is settled constitutional rule that determines how these two powersthe power of congress to prescribe qualifications and the power of the pr esident to appointare to be reconciled but it seems clear that there must be some const itutionally prescribed balance the balance may shift depending on the nature of the office in question for example congress has required that the president appoint members of both parties to certain kinds of boards and commissions there is serious question whether congress could constitutionally require the president to follow the same practice with respect to his cabinet 22 in 1989 however the department of justice articulated different point of view the office of legal counsel issued memorandum entitled common legislative encroachments on executive branch constitutional authority which stated in part the following congress imposes impermissible qualifications requirements on principal officers for instance congress will require that fixed number of members of certain commissions be from particular political party these requirements violate the appointments clause the only congressional check that the constitution places on the presidents power to appoint principal officers is the advice and consent of the senate 23 in 1996 the department of justice citing myers v united states the 1871 opinion of the attorney general and the 1979 olc opinion acknow ledged that congress has the constitutional authority to set certain qualifications nonetheless it asserted that the requirements for the us trade representative overstepped this authority because of the foreign policy responsibilities of the position and the positions close proximity to the president 21 13 op ag 516 520521 524525 1871 22 3 op olc 388 389 1979

qualifications for office restriction ruling out large portion of those persons best qualified by experience and knowledge to fill particular office invades the constitutional power of the president and senate to install the principal officers of the united states any power in the congress to set qualifications is limited by the necessity of leaving scope for the judgment and will of the person or body in whom the constitution vests the power of appointment akerman congress may not dictate qualifications unattainable by sufficient number to afford ample room for choice akerman even if there is settled constitutional rule that determines how the power of the congress to prescribe qualifications and the power of the president to appoint are to be reconciled we have opi ned that there must be some constitutionally prescribed balance and that this balance may shift depending on the nature of the office in question 1979 olc opinion here the restric tion is particularly egregious because the office in question involves representation of the united states to foreign governmentsan area constitutionally committed to the presiden t furthermore the position in question is especially close to the president the office of united states trade representative is established within the executive office of the president congress has also expressed in statute its sense that the united states trade representative be the senior representative on any body that the president may establish for the purpose of providing to the president advice on overall economic policies in which international trade matters predominate we believe that where an office thus entails broad responsibility for advising the president and for making policy the president must have expansive authority to choose his aides 24 although executive branch views as expressed in these signing statements and opinions from the department of justice are seemingly inconclusive about the precise range of congresss constitutional authority in this area they clearly do not endorse the view that this authority is broad

specific the director of the office of federal housing enterprise oversight for example is to be appointed from among individuals who are citizens of the united states have demonstrated unders tanding of financial management or oversight and have demonstrated understanding of mortgage security markets and housing finance the law further provides very specific disqualifying provision an individual may not be appointed as director if the individual has served as an executive officer or director of an enterprise at any time during the 3year period ending upon the nomination of such individual for appointment as director25 similarly the position of controller at the office of federal financial management in the office of management and budget omb must be filled from among individuals who possess1 demonstrated ability and practical experience in accounting financial management and financial systems and 2 extensive practical experience in financial management in large governmental or business entities26 these provisions seemingly provide objective criteria such as demonstrated understanding of specific topics and ability and experience in certain fields that must be used in the selection by the president and consideration by the senate of nominees to these two positions for other positions qualification requirements are more general the position of director of operational test and evaluation at the department of defense for example is to be filled without regard to political affiliation and solely on the basis of fitness to perform the duties of the office of director 27 similarly appointments to the position of archivist of the united states are to be made without regard to political affiliations and solely on the basis of the professional qualifications required

with the language of more specific requirements the phrases used in these provisionsregard for political affiliation fitness to perform the duties and professional qualifications required to perform the duties and responsibilitieswould arguably be subject to greater variety of subjective interpretations 25 12 usc 4512a 26 31 usc 504b 27 10 usc 139a1 28 44 usc 2103a

drawn from particular parts of the population for example at least seven of the 25 members of the architectural and transportation barriers compliance board must be individuals with disabilities29 in other cases congress has specified that special experience or sensitivity to population is required in selecting appointees for the committee for purchase from people who are blind or severely disabled the president is to select several nongovernmental appointees one of whom is conversant with the problems incident to the employment of the blind another of whom is conversant with the problems incident to the employment of other severely handicapped individuals third of whom represents bl ind individuals employed in qualified nonprofit agencies for the blind and fourth of whom represents severely handicapped individuals other than blind individuals employed in qualified nonprofit agencies for other severely handicapped individuals 30 although many individuals would meet these qualifications the requirements significantly reduce the size of the pool of individuals from which the president can select in some cases congress has applied qualification to broad category of positions for specific policy reasons for example many defenserelated leadership positions are required to be filled by civilians which reinforces the tradition of civilian supremacy in the united states government31 only civilian may be appointed as secretary of defense in addition an individual may not be appointed to the position within 10 years after relief from active duty as commissioned officer of regular component of an armed force32 military service restrictions of one kind or another apply to many other aders of the department of defense as well including the deputy secretary33 under secretaries34 and assistant secretaries35 other executive branch leadership positions with military servic restrictions include the director and principal deputy director of national

ability in the medical profession in healthcare administration and policy formulation or in healthcare fiscal management rather than all three areas40 this amendment emerged from the house committee on veterans affairs with the following explanation current law requires the under secretary for hea lth to be doctor of medicine restricting the pool of candidates that may be considered by the president for nomination to the position senior executives in the health care industry who may have exceptional credentials and experience but who are not doctors of dicine are excluded from

qualification requirements are more common for members of collegial boards and commissions than they are for other executive branch leadership positions for examples of requirements for collegial bodies see table a2 in the appendix of this report arguably such provisions serve to enhance both the independence and neutral competence of these entities collegial boards and commissions are generally structured so that they have more independence from the president than do other executive branch agencies as one congressional study stated with regard to regulatory bodies historically congressional interest in the re gulatory agencies is rooted in the notion that these commissions were created by congress vested with congressional authority to regulate interstate commerce and therefore had special relationship to the legislative branch the commission form as it has been created and developed by congress over the past ninety years is determined attempt to isolate the agencies both from precipitous change and from control by the executive branch it was for those reasons that congress established bipartisan commissions composed of multimembers serving set terms expiring at staggered intervals who could be removed by the president only upon showing of sufficient cause 50 qualification requirements for members of collegial body can also serve to enhance the agencys independence by emphasizing the importance of neutral competence relative to political considerations during the selection and confirmation processes in the postworld war ii era the quality of the membership and functioning of regulatory bodies was matter of concern for government scholars and observers in 1949 the first hoover commission observed that appointments to membership on independent regulatory commissions are sometimes below desirable standards because of the inadequate salaries offered or the failure of the executive to appreciate the importance of the positions 51

deterioration in the quality of our administrative personnel has taken place both at the top level and throughout the staff careful scrutiny of agency members from the standpoint of their qualifications as well as their prejudices in behalf of administering the legislative goals to which they were to be committed was during these years too often replaced by consideration of what political obligations could be repaid through appointments these attitudes have had serious impact upon the regulatory agencies at the top level initial expertise would be lacking and the want of devotion to the public service militated against its acquis ition through continuing tenure top administrative positions appear to have been sought frequently as stepping stones to further political preference or to positions of importance within the industries subject to regulation too common complaint at the bar is that the staffs have captured the commissions and that independent and bold thinking on the part of the members of these agencies is absent 52 in the late 1970s senate committee investigation found that the preeminent problem with the regulatory appointments process as it has operated in the past is that it has not consistently resulted in the selection of people best equipped to handle regulatory responsibilities53 the committee recommended that the organic acts for each collegial regulatory board and commission include the following language the president shall nominate persons for the commissionboard to insure commission membership shall be balanced with broad representation of various talents backgrounds occupations and experience appropriate to the functions and responsibilities of the commissionboard the commissionboard shall be composed of members who by reason of training education or experience ar qualified to carry out the functions of the commissionboard under this chapter 54 although this specific language has not been included in the organic acts of all boards and commissions many collegial bodies now have statutory provisions imposing similar requirements see table a2

although some statutory qualification requirements address characteristics that are not explicitly related to competence notably those setting civi lian and citizenship status requirements most appear intended to ensure that competent and qualified individuals are appointed to leadership positions one student of the administrative process observed the prime key to the improvement of the administrative process is the selection of qualified personnel good men can make poor laws workable poor men will wreak havoc with good laws 55 both congress and the president have an interest in ensuring that the federal government is led by competent leaders who have the ability to implement the law successfully and faithfully at the same time inasmuch as the president is seen to be responsible for coordinating the management of the executive branch it could be argued that he must be given the freedom to appoint leaders who will be accountable and to some degree politically loyal to him these interestscompetence accountability and loyaltyare not mutually exclusive nonetheless they can be in tension for example recent research suggests that executive branch programs headed by midlevel managers who are appointed at the agency level may be better managed than those run by top executive branch leaders in presidentially appointed senateconfirmed positions 56 it could be argued that establishing minimum qualifications for programs or agencys leadership position is likely to lead to improved performance by that program or agency this argument assumes that the president would select and the senate would consider nominee on the basis of these qualifications it also assumes that the senate would more easily reject on this basis poorly suited candidates finally it assumes that an appointee with these qualifications would do better job of leading the program or agency than would an appointee without these qualifications although these assumptions might hold true in many cases where qualifications are stipulated they are not guaranteed to hold in all situations the difficulties that may arise during the implementation of qualification provisions are illustrated by the nomination and appointment of julie myers to be assistant secretary of homeland security for us immigration and customs enforcement this position originally established by the homeland security act of 2002 as the assistant secretary of the bureau of border security is to be filled by an individual who has minimum of 5 years professional experience in law enforcement and minimum of 5 years of management experience 57 the president nominated myers to the position on june 29 2005 questions about whether or not myers met the specified qualifications were raised and addressed during her confirmation hearing before the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs58 in the months 55 us congress senate committee on the judiciary subcommittee on administrative practice

qualified for the position while others stated that her experience was insufficient and opposed the nomination on that basis59 the nomination was reported out of the committee and placed on the senate executive calendar but it was not considered by the full senate during the 109th congress60 although reservations about myerss qualifications may have prevented the nomination from coming to the floor at that time the nomination may also have been held up because of other concerns61 on january 4 2006 the president gave myers recess appointment to the position62 he again nominated her to the position on january 9 2007 at the beginning of the 110th congress on december 19 2007 after myers had served in the position for nearly two years and less than month before her recess appointment would have expired the senate confirmed her nomination although many qualified individuals are nominated to and confirmed for positions with statutory qualifications appointments to such positions can sometimes lead to tug of war between the president and congress in such case 1 congress establishes minimum experience requirements 2 the president nominates the individual of his choice who some argue has insufficient experience to meet these requirements 3 the senate does not confirm the nomination after some senators oppose it because of this perceived shortcoming 4 the president gives the nominee recess appointment that lasts up to two years and 5 the senate confirms the individual despite concerns about his or her qualifications or if the appointee is not confirmed he or she must leave office when the recess appointment expires it could be argued that this interbranch conflict is healthy exercise of constitutional checks and balances but this dynamic seemingly imposes potentially heavy cost on the federal bureaucracy an individual whose leadership and management qualifications are publicly cast into doubt in the senate can still serve in major federal government leadership position if the president elects to circumvent the confirmation process through recess appointment although the president can install his chosen nominee in this way the process might diminish the appointees stature and potentially his or her effectiveness the prospect of an interbranch tug of war over qualifications might raise concerns from an institutional perspective and on practical level about the worth of establishing such qualifications in the first place institutionally this tug of war might sometimes damage congress particularly the senate to the extent that the president circumvents the senate when nominees qualifications are in question congressional prerogativesthe authority of congress to specify the characteristics of an office and the role of the senate in the appointment processare undercut and seemingly these institutions are injured as practical matter it could be argued that qualification requirement is of little use if it is not sufficient to prevent an individual whose satisfaction of that requirement is in doubt in the senate from holding the office continued baker and julie l myers hearing 109 th cong 1st sess september 15 2005 pp 1621

typically lead to such open conflicts between congress and the president because these conflicts can impose political and institutional costs on the president as well he has an incentive in general to abide by the requirements established by congress when congress contemplates establishing qualifications the possibility of such conflicta disadvantagemight be weighed against the potential benefits of the proposed requirements conflicts concerning statutory qualifications have typically been resolved through the political process whether statutory qualifications legally bind the appointment process actions of the president or the senate remains an open question it is not clear what if any legal consequences might follow if either actor were to ignore such provisions establishing specific qualifications for an advice and consent position entails other potential disadvantages first it narrows the field of individuals from whom the president may select and otherwise worthy candidates might be eliminated prematurely from consideration second the inclusion of certain qualifications in law could l ead the president and the senate to overlook or undervalue other potentially important qualities when evaluating candidates third the qualifications that are necessary or most important for carrying out the responsibilities of position might change over time finally should the president and the senate determine that it would be preferable in given situation to appoint to given position an individual who does not technically meet its qualifications legislation might be necessary to waive the statutory requirements g17g153g157g146g152g151g156g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g146g152g151g138g149g561g5g152g151g156g146g141g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g561 with regard to statutory qualifications several approaches are available to congress most existing statutory qualifications will remain in force absent congressional action congress could reduce the number of positions with these kinds of requirements either through comprehensive review of such provisions or through incremental legislative changes during reauthorization process for example congress could increase the use of statutory qualifications options include the continued incremental adoption of qualification provisions the development of agencywide minimum qualification thresholds and the enactment of governmentwide standard for all government leadership positions the senate could also elect to establish threshold standards for confirmation of all or some presidential nominees g11g151g140g155g142g150g142g151g157g138g149g561g7g156g157g138g139g149g146g156g145g150g142g151g157g561g152g143g561g19g158g138g149g146g143g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 congress could continue recent legislative practices and establish statutory qualifications on casebycase basis under this option the number of positions with these requirements would slowly increase these provisions could be added where neutral competence is perceived to be of particular importance or where other attributes such as us citizenship or civilian status are deemed necessary this approach would be consistent with the view that the need for program or agency leaders with particular characteristics should be weighed on casebycase basis against the presidents need for flexibility in selecting hi s preferred leadership team it assumes that the balance between these two interests will vary according to the responsibilities of the position and its proximity to the president whereas congress might require members of an independent regulatory entity that deals with complex technical questions to have certain educational background for example it might not stipulate any requirements for an assistant secretary whose responsibilities are assigned by the secretary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33886g21g157g138g157g158g157g152g155g162g561g19g158g138g149g146g143g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g156g561g143

requirements in effect congress has instituted such threshold requirementcivilian statusfor most top leadership positions at the department of defense such thresholds have also been established for the membership of many collegial bodies especially regulatory boards and commissions as discussed above these entities differ from departments and other executive branch entities however because they each have only few uniform leadership positions in variation of this approach congress could establish agencywide requirements that vary according to each leadership positions level in an agencys hierarchy during the 109th congress senator daniel k akaka introduced legislation that used this model the bill would have established minimum leadership management and subject matter experience requirements for most top leaders at the department of homeland curity dhs it would also have required that appointees to top leadership positions in the department possess demonstrated ability to manage substantial staff and budget63 appointees to positions compensated at levels ii and iii of the executive schedule such as the administrator of fema and dhs under secretaries would have been required to meet the most rigor ous standards proposed by the bill appointees to level iv positions such as most assistant secret aries would have been subject to similar but slightly less stringent standards the bill would have excepted the dhs secretary and deputy secretary as well as the commandant of the coast guard from these requirements the agencywide qualifications approach might be particularly useful to congress where broad agreement exists particularly on the congressional committees of jurisdiction regarding threshold standards for particular agency agency wide qualifications might be more difficult to establish where broad agreement on minimum standards does not exist or where the leadership positions for given agency require broad range of talents or experience

that would be applied to all or most top leadership positions congress has established governmentwide requirements regarding citizenship through recurring provision of the funding bill for the department of the treasury and other agencies the provisions requirements are quite specific unless otherwise specified during the current fiscal year part of any appropriation contained in this or any other act shall be used to pay the compensation of any officer or employee of the government of the united states including any agency the majority of the stock of which is owned by the government of the united states whose post of duty is in the continental united states unless such person 1 is citizen of the united states 2 is person in the service of the united states on the date of the

are paid from appropriated funds in effect therefore the provision restricts appointments governmentwide to many top leadership positions if congress found it necessary such an approach could be used to put in place qualifications such as minimum experience or demonstrated ability qualifications that set discrete objective standards might be more easily enforced than those that set more subjective requirements arguably it is easier to measure whether or not nominee has specific educational credentials than whether he or she meets the threshold of related educational background notably the appropriations provision above includes number of exceptions if congress were to determine that nonus citizen should be appointed to particular position it would need to enact separate more restrictive provision for that post this example demonstrates the difficulty of establishing governmentwide standard that could cover all situations consequently if congress were to establish governmentwide minimum standards it might be necessary to create individual exceptions for certain positions g21g142g151g138g157g142g561g21g157g138g151g141g138g155g141g156g561 several of the options discussed above would set qualifications in statute the senate of course could establish confirmation standards that would in effect set qualifications for some or all nominations this approach was recommended for regulatory agency appointees by the senate committee on governmental affairs as result of its previously discussed late1970s study the committee recommended that the senate should establish the following general standards to be applied in confirmation of regulatory agency appointees that by reason of background training or experience the nominee is affirmatively qualified for the office to which he or she is nominated b that in considering regulatory appointment the senate shall consider the character and nature of the office and the needs of the agency to which the nominee has been named c that in considering regulatory appointment to collegial body the senate shall consider the existing composition of that body and whether or not members of single sector or group in society are too heavily represented d that the nominee is committed to enforcement of the 64 pl 110161 division d 705

that the nominee meet the statutory qualifications to hold the office to which he or she was nominated65 such confirmation standards might be established in the standing rules of the senate or by standing order either of which would be accomplished by senate resolution alternatively such standards could be adopted by individual committees for nominations within their jurisdictions these rules at either the committee or full senate level could establish either mandatory or optional consideration of standards during the confirmation process and they could require either that the standards be considered or that they be followed andor include waiver and enforcement provisions constitutional objection might be raised with regard to the establishment of senate confirmation standards unlike statutory qualifications which as discussed above can be seen to be an exercise of congresss constitutional authority to create offices senate confirmation standards would be established by the senate alone rather than the full congress on the other hand it could be argued that such standards would be legitimate exercise of the senates constitutional authority to set its own rules the rules would not directly limit the presidents authority to select nominee they would merely guide the senates advice and consent process

constitutional authority to establish statutory qualifications for federal government positions although congress enjoys broad discretion in this area there appears to be consensus that it may not set qualifications that limit the presidents sele ction to the extent that the appointment is facto legislative designation neither case law nor statute has established bright line that clearly defines the boundaries of this authority within this somewhat ambiguous environment congress at times has enacted standards that limit the pres idents selection pool to greater extent than the executive branch sees as legitimate in response the president has issued signing statements and the justice department has issued opinions that challenge the constitutionality of such provisions in practice this difference of opinion has occasionally led to conflict between the two branches in the appointment process arena whereas senators may sometimes block confirmation of nominee who is perceived to lack sufficient qualifications the president may use his recess appointment power to sidestep the senate and install his preferred nominee although this dynamic might be suboptimal for the smooth functioning of the federal bureaucracy for congress and for the president it is part of larger pattern of give and take between the president and congress in areas of shared c onstitutional power for the moment interbranch conflicts concerning statutory qualifications are likely to be resolved in the political realm if establishing such standards became legislative priority congress would have number of options for asserting its prerogatives in this area these options include continuation of present ad hoc practices establishment of agencywide or governmentwide standards and the
