bridge publications newsletter apr 16 2008 supposing every postulate would stick think of that for moment supposing every postulate you made would stick supposing every time you said i wish i was dead there you lay really wouldnt that be wonderful but supposing every time you said i can best serve this situation by being old and feeble and you were and supposing you said oh childhood childhood those were the times dadada so one of the best things this awareness of awareness unit does is hold gun on itself it says well these postulates are not going to stick im going on being joe jones and if i had my way of it i would be joe jones bessie smith pt barnum greyhound dog probably all in the course of half an hour and this would be disconcerting to my friends so i will take mercy on one and all and just be joe jones you could imagine how disconcerting it would be to have friend like that he makes postulate and there he is in full mass that would be upsetting so we do all sorts of devious things to keep from obeying all of our postulates at will because we know we cant trust ourselves of course thats the first thing we have to know and we do all kinds of things to make it automatic so that we will become surprised about it excerpted from the anatomy of the spirit of man congress lectures having an independent attitude toward existence an article by l ron hubbard from the anatomy of the spirit of man congress lectures i have had this odd experience i have been on ship which was having very hard time struggling in high seas and high winds which had its engines disabled and i had rescue party drop aboard all the sailors were convinced that the ship was going to pound itself to pieces and go down this was really not justified conclusion it was just that the sea was so violent that it appeared to be likely but they had all come to the conclusion that they were going through their last days right there in those last minutes each minute about twelve years long and the rescue party dropped down on the deck of the ship and didnt share this conclusion and three men in rescue party did work which twentyeight men on the derelict had been unable to accomplish and the three men in the rescue party did it in about ten minutes where the others had failed for almost ten hours different set of conclusions same situation same ship of course you could say well the crew that was already aboard were tired so was the rescue party they had to row across three miles of open sea to get there they were twice as tired as the boys who were still aboard so we conclude there that you must be able to have an independent attitude toward existence regardless of the circumstances of existence it is obviously possible to have an independent attitude toward existence independent of an existing attitude toward existence and it is not necessarily certain that the independent attitude of existence is going to succumb to the general attitude of existence this is not an absolute certainty well we started out talking about postulates person can have an independent attitude toward existence regardless of what is going on and make things better or worse at will to the degree that he retains his confidence and faith in himself and his ability to make postulates he can say he feels this way and he feels this way but he has to be able to trust himself to say that he should be able to say i can persevere i can succeed and then succeed he should also be able to say well i guess ill fail this time and simply fail he would have to be alike unimpressed by winning or losing he would have to be somewhat unimpressed but he would be able to do that he could then take command of the existing situation or better any situation without being tremendously influenced by the circumstances which surround him what do we call this we call this selfdeterminism an individual then is as capable of happiness or livingness i would rather call it livingness he is as capable of living as he is capable of determining the actions of himself and others by simple postulate and an individual who can do this is giant amongst his fellows and an individual who cant has been is and always will be slave l ron hubbard excerpted from the lecture component parts of beingness this lecture is available in the anatomy of the spirit of man congress lectures successes from listening to the congress lectures i had big win on the anatomy of the spirit of man congress lectures i listened to the first four lectures in one day my health started to improve i started to get more in communication with my body and my skin improved i was also able to rehabilitate perceptic the perceptic of gravity this was small win i was able to stay keyed out of my bank which before i was collapsed into i am functioning so much better without effort after rehabilitating this perceptic thank you to supposing every postulate would stick having an independent attitude toward existence message from the editor successes from the congress lectures message from the editor dear name hello there this is patrick from bridge one of the key programs we have been working on at bridge publications this past year is to keep in communication with those people studying their lrh congress lectures and collect up their wins and feedback and what we have found is that people are regularly increasing their income resolving longterm problematic situations in life and achieving postulated goals they never thought possible before just by using and applying the data in the lectures when you get educated in the scientology milestones directly from lrh and start applying this technology to your life you become more and more cause in life stuck flows and barriers that were always there seem to magically disappear the result of all this is obviously an increase in your personal wherewithal to achieve the goals youve always wantedincluding making faster bridge progress here are just few examples of what you will find out in these lectures what is the only way you can have positive direction why is it the harder you have to work on something the less creative you are how is the third dynamic violation of the communication formula if persons ability never diminishes what does what has to happen before someone can be harmed by something what is the only reason you have deteriorated relationship with someone what would happen if you were to tell the truth for twentyfour hours is there such thing as your own valence order your lrh congress lectures today by
