size of its membership the depth of its integration and the strength of its institutions formation mercosur the spanish acronym for the common market of the south was created in 1991 by the treaty of asuncion consisting of argentina brazil paraguay an d uruguay mercosur has combined gdp of 12 billion and population of 208 million in 1997 it is the third largest preferential trade grouping in the world after the european union and nafta brazil and argentina are the dominant members of mercosur 1 together these two countries account for 97 of mercosurs gross domestic product cooperation between these two historic ri vals remains crucial to the continued viability of the trade grouping the 1991 treaty of asuncion and its amend ments embodied in the 1994 protocal of ouro preto commits the members of mercosur eventually to form common market in common market goods services c apital and labor are provided free movement among its members sequential process to establish common market was

rebellious general moved against president juan carlos wasmosy mercosur foreign ministers traveled to asuncion and made clear he would face diplomatic and economic isolation the temporary exemption of products and sectors from the cet implies that majo r4 continuedfree trade area and customs union to be achieved first to lay the foundation for the2 creation of common market the treaty called for the coordination of labor monetary tax research and development and industrial policies while mercosur was created primarily for economic reasons it clearly has wider geopoliti cal rationale as well in drawing up their proposals for economic integration mercosurs charter members underlined the importance of political stability an d commitmen t to democratic principles subsequently they all proceeded to sign democracy clause which ensures that only those governments that are democratically elected will be welcomed as mem bers mercosur was also envisioned as mechanism to3 provide its members with more influence in the global trading system in terms of trade relations mercosur negotiates in united way as one single trading bloc status for the most part mercosur is fully functioning free trade area the vast majority of goods traded among its four members receive dutyfree treatment mercosur is als close to becoming fullfledged customs union but the establish ment of common market remains fairly distant aspiration mercosur has made steady progress toward becoming free trade area by january 1 1995 tariffs among the four countries were liminated on 85 or approximately 9000 dutiable items the remaining 15 included exceptions for sensitive products such s textiles steel and pape r products special arrangements are also scheduled to remain in effect until the year 2000 for two protected sectors automobiles and sugar in moving towards fullfledged customs union mercosur members bega n implementing common external tariff cet on january 1 1995 the cet which i s imposed on imports from nonmember countries applies to 85 of all tariff items th maximum tariff imposed is 20 ad valorem with various rates between 2 and 18 also in effect depending on the product the average tariff rate is about 14 ad valorem computers automo biles and capital goods which comprise 15 of the tariff items but higher percentage of trade will continue to be subject to national tariffs until the turn of the cent ury capital goods will have maximum cet of 14 effective from the year 2001 for bra zil and argentina and computer equipment and telecommunications goods will have maximum cet of 16 from 2006 in addition to these general exceptions each country has at least 300 products on which the cet will not apply until the yea r 2001 or 20064httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98432crs3 continued4

paraguay and uruguay both more dependent on imports than brazil and argentina agreed to the increase under the condition that they be allowed to exempt up to 600 items the 3 increase to be in effect for 3 years moves the average external tariff to 17 and the upper limit to 23 5 although the 1991 treaty of asuncion established 1995 as the date for completing the commo n market the goal has not been reached and it remains longterm objective lacking concrete deadline or strategy key issu such as free movement of labor have not been addressed and only minimal efforts have b een made to coordinate policies among mercosur members with respect to macroeconomic and exchange rate policies more intrusive economic ties entailed in common market would require close r political relations between brazil and argentina on the one hand historic rivalries and disparities in per capita incomes population and educational levels could imped movemen t in this direction on the other hand mercosur is broadly credited wit h bringing number of political developments that would not have been imagined possible decade ag these include the movement by brazil and argentina to renounce thei r incipient nuclear programs and the decision to conduct joint military exercises trade effects the economic integration achieved to date an most complete free trade area and partial customs union has boosted trade among the four members of mercosur since its inception us economic interaction with these four countries has also accelerated followin g the establishment of mercosur trade among its members intraregional trade has grown from about 4 billion to over 20 billion in 1997 the rate of increase since 1995 have been over 20 per year more than double the rate of trade growth with the rest

exports8 during this same period us imports from mercosur countries have increased b only 23 rising from 96 billion in 1990 to 121 billion in 1997 as result of very rapid increase in exports and stagnating imports the us trade balance with mercosur has improved from deficit of 39 billion in 1990 to surplus of 111 billion in 1997 with 63 billion accounted for by brazil and 36 billion by argentina the european union eu remains mercosurs largest trading partne r eumercosur trade totaled 427 billion in 1996 compared t 31 billion for usmercosur trade the eu supplied 29 of mercosurs imports and p urchased 23 of mercosurs exports the comparable percentages for the us were 23 and 15 respectively since 1990 the eu and the united states bo th have improved their share of mercosurs import trade up 56 percentage points for the eu and up 37 percentage points for the us but have t importance as destinatio n of mercosur exports down 85 percentage points for the eu and down 81 percentage points for the us9 regarding foreign direct investment the united states is by far the largest investor in merco sur with stock of foreign investment totaling about 34 billion in 1996 us foreign direct investment flows were almost three times greater than eu flows between 19901995 during this period us foreign direct investment flows totaled 21 billion compared to 8 billion for the eu over time the substantially larger presence of us multinational companies operating in mercosur mostly in ar gentina and brazil could help the united states gain larger share of mercosurs import market as those companie s increasingly source inputs and machinery from affiliates located in the united states10 policy challenges while the four mercosur countries have made considerable progress in integrating their economies more closely there are number of challenges they must address t ensure continued future progress among these challenges are the issues of expansion deepening and organization11 since the december 1994 summit of the americas most countries in the wester n hemisp here with the exception of the united states have been actively involved i n expanding subregional trade groupings mercosur has been the most active durin g 1996 mercosur reached free trade agreements with bolivia and chile that are designed to serve as stepping stones for full membership into mercosur preliminary talks with the andean community gave rise to much speculation that mercosur would be able to expand its membership to all of south america thereby creating b razilled south

mercosur s negotiations with the andean countries mexico and canada have made little progress and these countries all have much stronger trading relationships with the united state s than with mercosur and decision to commence any kind of formal negotiations with the eu is not expected to be made until 199912 the political allure of expan sion however is unlikely to fade away the creation of safta could position mercosur to play much more important role in regional an d world affairs and the prospect of negotiating with the united states and the u simultaneously over the terms of potentially rival free trade agreements would provide an enlarged mercosur with considerable negotiating leverage mercosu r currently appears to be paying increased attention to internal challenge s associated with the deepening of the integration scheme in september 1997 argentina and brazil attempted to address the pr oblem of bringing automobiles and sugar within the rules of the mercosu r free trade area at presidential summit in december 1997 other efforts at deepening trade integration were made these included decision to begin talks at freeing trade in services over 10year period as well as to begin study n government procurement rules the presidents of the member countries also announced efforts to improve border crossings13 final c hallenge relates to the organization of mercosur since its inception mercosur has been characterized by topdown org anizational strategy heavily dependent on presidential initiatives although the respective national parliaments approved th treaty of asuncion overwhelmingly they have played relatively small role in th development of mercosur to date currently ach individual problem and dispute must be resolved directly by mbers heads of state or foreign ministry officials this is not only time consuming but makes mercosur vulnerable to domestic political agendas that may change from administration to administration decision made by the presidents t december to inaugurate fo rmal mercosur headquarters in montevideo could be seen as modest step towards addressing this problem us interests in general the united states has viewed the establishment of mercosur as bein g supportive of us economic and political interests mercosurinspired trade an d economic reforms have contributed to the strong economic performance of membe r countries and helped facilitate large scale increases in us exports and direct investments in the region mercosurs existence by most accounts has also contributed to political stability and commitment

continues to be net agricultural exporter for fuller discussion see ahearn raymond j trade and the americas congressional15 research service issue brief 95017 continuously updatedusmercosur relations however have been som ewhat strained by differences over the tone and pace of discussions aimed at creating free trade area of the america s ftaa by 2005 most generally mercosur led by brazil has ba cked slow and staggered talks in support of the hemispheric free trade goal while the united states has supported more comprehensive and swift negotiating approach goslow approach would provide brazil with the opportunity to expand mercosur into larger south american free trade bloc buttressed by the diplomatic suppor t provided by larger mercosur brazil could be better positioned to negotiate with th united states from position of strengt h this is important because brazil and argentina both wish to extract from the united states concessions limiting washingtons use f unfair trade practice remedies eg antidumping and countervailing duties and to improve access to the us market for agricultural products in addition because mercosu r14 currently protects number of sectors such as financi services telecommunications and governme nt procurement longer period of time would provide these sectors wit h more leeway and capacity to adjust to increased import competition lacking fasttrack trade negotia ting authority the clinton administrations leverage to dominate the setting of the structure and scope of the ftaa negotiations has bee n arguably constrained most recently at march 1998 meeting of the trade ministers from 34 countries of the americas held in san jose costa rica the united state s accommodated number of mercosur interests and deman ds argentina for example was named as the chair of negotiating committee on agriculture the creation of which was top brazilian priority significantly brazil was also named cochair with the unite d states for the fin 3 years of the ftaa negotiations this position could provide brazil with the power to veto any unfavorable positions or to prolong the negotiations beyond 2005 these decisions were ratified by the 34 leaders of the hemis phere at second summit of the americas held april 1819 1998 in santiago chile15 the united states also gained numb er of its objectives at the costa rican meeting among these were the establishment of study groups on labor and the environment and the designatio n of miami as the official site of the negotiations until 2001 but the trade offs and compromises accepted left little doubt that mercosur has become stron g regional grouping that is ab to assert its economic interests forcefully as well as to play skilled diplomatic game mercosurs relati onship to the proposed ftaa will remain an outstanding concern at the san jose ministerial last march agreement was reached that subregiona l agreements such as mercosur and nafta can coexist with the ftaa only to the extent that the rights and obligations under those agreements are n ot covered beyond those of the ftaa this agreement appears to fly in the face of the notion particularly popular i n brazil that mercosur is an end in itself not stage toward ftaa
