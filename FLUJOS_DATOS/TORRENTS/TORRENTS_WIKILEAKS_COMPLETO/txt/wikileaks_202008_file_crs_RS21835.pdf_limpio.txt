vice president and first lady are almost always classified as official travel or political travel or combination of th two official or nonpolitical travel is normally defined as anything having to do with the carrying out of presidential duties and responsibilities official travel may involve for example presenting information giving direction and explaining and securing public support for administration policies2 political travel normally involves the president and vice president in their positions as leaders of their political party attending party functions participating in fundraising and campaigning for candidates are examples of political activities3 the terms are rather general and the white house determines whether trip is for official or political purposes or for combination of the two the travel policies of specific administrations concerning the reimbursement of expenses for unofficial travel generally are not publicly av ailable however the reagan administration established written guidelines in 1982 to determine when the president vice president and any assistants accompanying them on military aircraft travel at government expense and when they or the political organizations on whose behalf they travel are to reimburse the government with the equivalent of the airfare that they would have had to pay had they traveled on commercial airlines 4 the guidelines evolved in response to general legal principles that federal funds are to be used only for the purposes for which they are appropriated5 opinions from the office of legal counsel in the department of justice6 rules of the federal election commission fec7 and occasional audits by the general accounting office gao the guidelines which also cover the first lady and the vice presidents spouse apply only to trips in the united states and its territories since all foreign travel is considered official it appears likely that subsequent administrations have used the reagan administ ration guidelines as foundation for their own travel policies g17g143g143g146g140g146g138g149g561g138g151g141g561g23g151g152g143g143g146g140g146g138g149g561g22g155g138g159g142g149g561 when white house personnel are on official travel certain personal expenses which include per diem food and lodging car rentals and other incidentals are paid by the government these expenses are paid by the white house for domestic travel and by the state department for foreign travel members of the presidents staff and his immediate family including the first lady are on official travel whenever

vice presidents staff and his immediate family according to the office of the vice president the vice presidents wife uses military aircraft only when she accompanies him or when she is designated as the vice presidents representative to attend special function when travel is for political purposes the president vice president and first lady and any assistants accompanying them are required to reimburse the government the comparable airfare they would have paid had they traveled by commer cial airline on such trips they pay for their own food lodging and other incidental expenses certain staff accompanying them however such as secret service agents are always considered to be on official travel and all their travel costs are paid by the government when travel involves both official and political functions the white house uses formula to determine how much airfare is to be paid by the traveler and how any per diem and other travel related costs are to be paid by the government 9 for example if the day is divided equally between an official and an unofficial event then the president vice president first lady and accompanying staff or political organization must reimburse the government for 50 of the amount that would have been owed to the government if the entire trip had been political more detailed explanation is as follows in the instance of mixed trip the amount of the reimbursement for use of government aircraft will be prorated as indicated by the nature of the activity prorating the cost of air travel on mixed officialpolitical trips may be accomplished through formula based on the amount of time actually spent by the president and vice president in meetings receptions rallies and similar activity time spent in actual travel private study or rest and recreation will not be included in the computation the formula is as follows time spent in official meetings receptions etc time spent in political meetings receptions rallies total activity time time spent in official activity total activity time percentage of trip that is official time spent in political activity total activity time percentage of trip that is political the percentage figure that represents the political portion of the trip is then multiplied by the amount that would be reimbursed to the government if all of the travel was political the product of that calculation represents the amount to be reimbursed to the government 10 other factors may result in adjustments to an amount of reimbursement for example if traveling party would have returned to the point of departure on given day but delayed its return one day or more because of political activity then the cost of accommodations is to be assessed solely to the political sponsor sometimes it is difficult to determine whether trip or part of trip should be characterized as official or unofficial this is especially the case when trip involves certain activities having partisan consequences because an inherent part of the official duties of the president and vice president involve their efforts to present explain and secure public support for their policies and goals when they travel and appear in public to defend their policy positions the difference between their official duties and their activities as leaders of their political party can be difficult to assess as result the white house decides the nature of travel on casebycase basis 8 3 usc 105e authorizes the first lady to assist the president in discharging his duties and responsibilities 9 see fielding guidelines for travel by the president and vice president pp 59 10 ibid pp 67 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21835g18g155g142g156g146g141g142g151g157g146g138g149g561g22g155g138g159g142g149g497g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561 g138g151

each trip or part of trip is or is not official by considering the nature of the event involved and the role of the individual involved11 it is unclear how the white house designates travel that is not directly related to governmental or political function because of traditional reluctance to address this matter it appears that in most cases such travel is treated as official under the assumption that the president and vice president are always on duty vacation trips for example fall under the official travel category security considerations and the need to be able to communicate instantly with military and other officials at any time are the reasons the president flies on military aircraft when he travels moreover having military plane readily available enables the president to fly whenever and wherever he may wish to go security considerations are also the primary reason for use of military aircraft by the vice president and first lady g17g153g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g138g151g141g561g17g157g145g142g155g561g5g152g156g157g156g561 airfare and related travel expenses associated with the trips taken by the president vice president and first lady are only fraction of the total cost of such trips most of the costs involve operational costs of the aircraft and include fuel maintenance engineering support and per diem expenses for the crew the military aircraft used by the white house are operated by the 89 th airlift wing aw located at andrews air force base in maryland just outside washington dc among the aircraft in the 89 aw are two boei ng 747s also known as vc25as that have been specially configured for the presidents needs and that are exclusively for his use12 electronic and communications equipment in the 747s enables the president to keep in touch at all times with civilian and military officials the president flies on one of the 747s on most of his trips occasionally he will use smaller plane when the area he is visiting cannot accommodate 747 air force one is the designation given to wh atever plane the president is using at the time the vice president and first lady use an airplane different from the presidential 747 for fy1998 the white house military office estimated that the presidents 747 cost 34400 per hour to operate while the air force put the figure at 5680013 aircraft used by the vice president and first lady in the same period had much lower costperhour rates costs for the 11 when determining the nature of trip the white house fo llows the reasoning of the office of legal counsel in the department of justice which in 1982 recommended that as general rule presidential and vice presidential travel should be considered political if its primary purpose involves their the presidents and vice presidents positions as leaders of their political party appearing at party functi ons fundraising and campaigning for specific candidates are the principal examples of travel which should be considered political on the other hand travel for inspections meetings nonpartisan addresses and the like ordinarily should not be considered political travel even though these activities may have partisan consequences or concern ques tions on which opinion is politically divided the president cannot perform his official duties effectively without the understanding confidence and support of the public travel and appearances by the president and vice president to present explain and secure public support for the administrations measures are therefore an inherent part of the presidents and vice presidents official duties 6 op olc 1982 p 217 12 additional information about the 89th airlift wing and its aircraft may be found at

the first ladys between 2958 and 10789 depending on the aircraft used14 costs associated with these trips however generally involve much more than the operational costs of the specific passenger aircraft when the president travels abroad several passenger and cargo aircraft accompany air force one when the vice president or first lady make such trip single cargo aircraft accompanies either of them on domestic trips cargo aircraft and backup aircraft normally accompany only air force one if the president is accompanied by more than 75 assistants and subordinates including secret service staff an additional passenger aircraft also makes the trip sometimes an additional aircraft accompanies air force one to be available to take the president to second city whose airport cannot accommodate 747 finally in preparation for trip whether domestic or foreign an advance party may make several trips to the destination or destinations that will be visited in order to assure that everything goes as planned besides the maintenance and operational costs of the aircraft there are the per diem and related costs mentioned earlier when the trip is official and the costs for those designated official travelers when the trip is not official on presidential trip the number of these official travelers may be quite high since it includes secret service agents communications personnel and various other officials only recently has information become available regarding the overall cost associated with travel by the president vice president and first lady in 1992 the house committee on post office and civil service estimated that two presidential trips one to europe in 1989 and the other to hawaii in 1990 cost the air force 1 million to 15 million and that the average vice presidential trip cost the air force 250000 to 500000 15 these estimates involved operational costs they did not include per diem and other travelrelated expenses in 1999 gao estimated the incremental costs including per diem and related expenses of presidential trips in 1998 to africa chile and china to be at least 428 million 105 million and 188 million respectively16 in 2000 gao estimated that the department of defense spent at least 292 million to provide fixedwing airl ift and air refueling support for 159 white house foreign trips 27 by the president 20 by the first lady 8 by the vice president and 104 directed by the president from january 1 1997 through march 31 200017 these estimates did not include per diem and other travelrelated expenses comparable information is
