in posthussein iraq including th prospects that po ssible occupation force could mold the iraqi government into democracy the bush administration reportedly has looked at past us occupa tions particularly the democra tization experiences in japan and germany after world war ii as precedents some analysts question whether conditions in iraq today are sufficiently s imilar to the conditions in japan and germany to presume similar results ie functioning democracy and whether the level of sustained us commitment that was required there could be realistically expected this report provides information on those occupations and discusses their applicability to iraq major features of us occupa tions in japan and germany planning duration force size1 planning for both occupations which began as early as 1942 was marked by sharp disagr eements within the roosevelt administration that continued into the early phases of th occupations the first of many documents discussing the postwar

d eisenhower anticipated that the us military would provide garrison not government except for few weeks3 instead direct military government lasted four years the important fi rst phase of the occupation may 1945 may 1949 some analysts believe the us military occupation of germany was prolonged by problems in establishing selfgovernment because of differences with the other occupying powers great britain france and the soviet union each of which controlled its own sector in both cases substantial drawdown of u s occupation forces occurred after the first year as there was virtually armed resistance in japan peak level of 385649 was reached by november 1945 but droppe d to 160000 by the end of may 1946 in germany the 16 million troops in germany in may 1945 dropped to 277584 in 1946 119367 in 1947 and 79370 by 1950 4 in japan most major reforms had been accomplished within four years and six months in germany the us occupation was phased out in two stages germans in the us british and french sectors jointly gained control of most domestic affairs in may 1949 with the ratification of new constitution dubbed the basic law establishing parliamentary democracy the federal republic of germany or west germany until 1955 these occupying countries retained emerge ncy powers veto over laws inconsistent with occupation policy and aut hority over such matters as foreign relations foreign trade the level of industrial produc tion and military security in its zone the soviet union created an authoritarian sovietstyle state the german democratic republic or east germany the west and east tities persisted until re unification in 1990 objectives the objectives of the us occ upations of both countries have been summed up in two lists of four ds in both japan and germany the primary objective was demilitarization all us planners agreed that the ability of both countries to wage war in the future should be destroyed this included destroying elements of military power including the economic apparatus that fueled war and punishing war criminals in japan the next goals were the disarmament and decentralization of the economic apparatus the latter through the dismantling of the large industrial and banking groups in germany they were denazification and deindustrialization regarding the fourth dhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21404crs3 5 ward op cit p 428 6

japanese and germans had the cultural background and psychological disposition necessary to function in democracy af ter the occupations be gan democratization assumed greater weight in both experiences as those forces who had argued that the inhabitants of those countries were capable of establishing democracies gained credibility and as the start of the cold war fostered the concept of community of democracies as counterweight to the soviet union humanitarian situation the occupations commenced amidst grave humanitarian situation with large parts of the population homeless and on subsistence diets or below in japan according to one source the war had produced 18 million military and civilian casualties and destroyed 25 of japans national wealth air attacks had destroyed 20 of the countrys housing and greater amount in some cities and 30 of its industrial capacity5 in germany between quarter to half of housing and transport had been destroyed leaving some 20 million homeless in the western zones6 although the united states provided humanitari an aid at the outset to ward off mass hunger and starvation occupation authorities and oversight offi cials soon worried that the us will to continue such relief efforts would flag well before the need for aid diminished this trepidation was one consid eration reorienting ec onomic policies in 1949 under pressure from congress military governor lucius d clay abandoned central feature of occupation policy in germany with which he had originally agreed the punitive dismantling of what was left of germanys industrial

japa n selfsufficient through the early revival of the japanese economy and encouraging industrial growth nd foreign trade to enable japan to make its proper contribution to the economic rehabilitation of the world economy8 accomplishments in both countries the occupations are credited with the construction of functioning democracies in germany the direct occupation period ended in

dismantling of the rge familyrun industrial and banking groups and widescale agrarian reform are seen as essential to the creation of functioning democracy because they broke the pow er of economic nd military elites recent assessments of the importance of the occupation governments in establishing these democracies give much greater weight to their contribution in japan than in germany indeed one academic believes that while the united states was important to democratic outcome in japan by contrast the strength of democratic forces in west germany was such that the american contribution appears relatively marginal10 implications and questi ons for us policymakers11 some historians have noted that unique preconditions and circ umstances contributed to the success of these occupations partic ularly in japan four crucial points of convergence often cited as impor tant to the success of those occupations in establishing democracies raise questions concerning the applicability of these models to us occupation of iraq although there is pred ictably disagreement over their relevance these issues provide bac kdrop for postsaddam planning populations acceptance of us occupations and democratization objective occupation occupation by us forces and democratic reforms were widely accepted by the japanese and germans themselves who came to blame their own leaders for the war indeed although historica lly much is credited to the united states for remaking these democracies many analysts believe that the high degree of cooperation from postwar japanese and german lead ers was also crucial to their success analysts writing during the occupation of ja pan attributed success there largelyto the wholehearted cooperation of the average japanese citizen12 conclusion which subsequent research supports this cooperation has been attr ibuted to several factors including emperor hirohitos plea before th landing of us forces that the population cooperate fully with ccupation directives this ensure d not only the cooperation of the average citizen but more importantly of japans powerful bureaucracy moreover the great majority of japanese rejected the old political system

tion and implementation of occupation policies institutions had begun to develop with increas ing influence exercised by political parties and greater democratizati on of parliamentary practi ces culminating in 1920 193213 in germany us occupation officials qui ckly became convinced that most germans thoroughly rejected nazi fascism and desi red political change to successful democracy in line with democratic velopments before adolf hitler took power germany had experience with limited democracy and the rule of law within an authoritarian culture and political context during the second re ich or the german empire of 18711918 even before its experience with democracy during the weimar republic many democratic leaders of the weimar republic had remained in germany and were eager to work towards the restoration of democracy prospects for democracy may have been further enhanced because the areas of us occupation had more of democratic ethos in contrast to the legacy of prussian au thoritarianism in the soviet occupation zone to what extent would model of western democracy be acceptable to the iraqis even if iraqis accepted such model might problems arise from iraqs lack of experience with democracy if such model is not cceptable to iraqis to what extent do they share common purpose of unifying their country around political model acceptable to the united states given the histor of western colonialism in the middle east us support for israel and the drastic effects of curre nt us backed economic sanctions against iraq would the united states have the nearly unanimous backing of the iraqi population for an occupation as it did in japan and germany if not would force enjoy greater support what difficulties could arise fr om the lack of general consent homogeneity of occupied populations although politically diverse the japanese and the german populations as of 1945 were each ethnically homogeneous and largely without religious animosities to what extent will ethnic and sectarian d ifferences among iraqis impede effective government by us occupation force gi ven those differences will iraqis be able to govern themselves within short period of tim if not what arrangements such as co government as exists in afghanistan might be desirable to promote effective government what likelihood is there that such government would succeed ability to manage their own affairs largely using exis ting institutions although the us military governments held power and issued orders most of the functions of government were carried out by japanese and german institutions this delegation of functions was the decision of the two dominant figures in the occupation governments macarthur in japan and clay14 in germany the decision was based in their assessments of the willingness and ability of japanese and german citizens to perform these duties and the scarc ity of suitable americans to do so in japan macarthur retained and worked through

were also established at the prefecture ie state level and charged with observing investigating and reporting on compliance however according to one author the lack of an established policy for local military government activity resulted in abuses and patchwork of wide local variations developed16 macarthur entrusted the japanese government with demobilizing its forces in the us sector of germany the office of the military government united states omgus proceeded immediatel to reconstruct german government institutions to administer occupation laws and policies even before all u s officials were convinced that germans were ready for it with the german defeat the nazi government collapsed leaving the allies to replace fficials and structur from the beginning clay sought to turn government over to germans as quickly as possible starting at the local level in some cases the omgus appoint ed former german governme nt officials from the pre 1933 period as early as october 1945 clay issued an order that limited local omgus military activities to observing government ac tivities at the city c ounty and state level and reporting problems to higher headquarters elections fo r village officials were held in january 1946 followed by county officials in march and city officials in may clay then pushed for the drafting of state constitutions and establishment of state governments to what extent would iraqi existing in stitutions continue to function what governmental functions would us or other military forces have to assume and for how long what new institutions would have to be created to what ext ent might grievances of those displaced from existing institutions or of those removed and punished for crimes related to participation in the hussein regime be viewed as legitimate by other iraqis and other middle eastern governments and popul ations to what extent could such sympathies undermine effective administr ation by occupation forces how much autonomy would us or administration have to adapt to local conditions international legi timacy and support the us occupations in japan and germany were viewed by other countries as morally and legally legitimate and there was widespread support for them this international consensus meant that us policy could be developed re latively free of competing foreign policy interests this was especially true in the case of japan for germany however the development of economic policy was complicated by consider ations regarding other european economies if the united states were to invade iraq without the full backing of the international community to what extent would this lack of consensus or agreement undermine the basis of us international legitimacy or support w hat us interests would be affected by the presence of us occupation force in ir aq should the united states expect significant opposition to us occupation among the leaders or populations of neighboring countries to what extent would its short term success be judged by its ability to meet humanitarian needs
