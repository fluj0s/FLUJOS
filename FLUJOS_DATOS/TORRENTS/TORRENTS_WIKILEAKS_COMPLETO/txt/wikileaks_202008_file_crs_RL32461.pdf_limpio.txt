investment data james k jackson foreign aﬀairs defense and trade division may 13 2008 abstract broad comprehensive data on us multinational companies generally lag behind current events by two years and were not developed to address the issue of jobs outsourcing many economists argue however that there is little evidence to date to support the notion that the overseas investment activities of us multinational companies play signiﬁcant role in the rate at which jobs are created in the us economy instead they argue that the source of job creation in the economy is rooted in the combination of macroeconomic policies the nation has chosen the rate of productivity growth and the availability of resources this report addresses these issues by analyzing the extent of direct investment into and out of the economy the role such investment plays in us trade jobs and production and the relationship between direct investment and the broader economic changes that are occurring in the us economyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32461 order code rl32461 outsourcing and insourcing jobs in the us economy evidence based on foreign investment data updated may 13 2008 james k jackson specialist in

summary the impact of foreign direct investme nt on us employment is provoking national debate while local communities compete with one another for investment projects many of the residents of those communities fear losing their jobs as us companies seek out foreign locations nd foreign workers to perform work that traditionally has been done in the united stat generally referred to as outsourcing some observers suggest that current us experiences with outs ourcing are different from those that have preceded them and that this merits legislative actions by congress to blunt the economic impact of these activities other observers argue that investing abroad by us multinational companies impedes the growth of new jobs in the economy and thwarts the nations i nvestments in high technology sectors some opponents also argue that mid career workers who lose goodpaying manufacturing and servicesector jobs likely will never recover their standard of living economists and others generally argu that free and unimpeded international flows of capital have positive impact on both domestic and foreign economies direct investment is unique among international capital flows because it adds permanently to the capital stock and skill t of nation but it also challenges the general theory of capital flows because of the presence of strong crossborder and intraindustry investment s upporters contend that to the extent that foreign investment shifts jobs abroad it is minor component of the overall economic picture and that it is offset somewhat by the investment of foreign firms in the us economy referred to as insourcing whic h supports existing jobs and creates new jobs in the economy broad comprehensive data on us multinational companies generally lag behind current events by two years and we re not developed to address the issue of jobs outsourcing many economists argue however that there is little evidence to date to support the notion that the ov erseas investment activities of us multinational companies play significant role in the rate at which jobs are created in the us economy instead they argu that the source of job creation in the economy is rooted in the

february 3 2003 p 5060employment major source of contention in the united states regarding foreign investment focuses on the impact such investment is having on us employment12 s m observers argue that recent actions by us parent companies are different from previous experiences with foreign investment because the parent companies are shifting jobs capital and technology offshore to their foreign affiliates in ways that are distinctly different from previous pe riods and thereby are reducing employment in the united states the department of commerces bureau of economic analysis provides the most comprehensiv set of data on us direct investment abroad and on foreign direct investment in the unite d states these data however were not designed to link employment gains or losses in the united states either for individual jobs individual companies or in the aggr egate with the gains and losses of jobs abroad the data in table 4 indicate though that the employment trends of us parent companies are sensitive to ec onomic conditions in the us economy particularly during periods in which economic growth slows down as it did in the early 1980s 1990s and in the early 2000s foreign investment data seem to indicate that despite or perhaps because of the growing international linkages between economies an expansion or contraction in the rate of growth in the us ec onomy affects employment among us parent companies more than it affects employment among the overseas affiliates of these parent companies neverthe less changes in jobs among us parent companies that are related to the overall gr owth rate of the economy also affect the growth in employment among the foreign affiliate s though not necessarily by the same magnitude as indicated in figure 3 as result the number of employees in the parent companies and in the affiliates tend to rise and fall in generally similar pattern while international linkages between us and foreign economies mean that economic conditions in the united states have an impact on economic conditions abroad there appears to be distinct pa ttern between the creation or loss of jobs within us multinational companies and commensurate loss or creation of jobs among the foreign affiliates of those companies indeed within most of the major developed countries those econo mic forces that spur dir ect investment inflows also boost direct investment outflows as re sult foreign direct investment may create jobs in the foreign affiliate that substitute for jobs in the parent company but foreign investment may also positively affect job creation in both the parent company and the foreign affiliates which makes it difficult to identify any broad trend regarding outsourcinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32461 crs8 table

ins and losses among parent companies and their foreign affiliates likely arises from the many factors that can affect job gains and losses both within i ndividual companies and within the economy as whole economists typically categorize unemployment as cyclical structural seasonal and frictional only the first tw are relevant to the current discussion and are likely to account for the largest share of unwanted job changes during any given year when cyclical and structural unemployment coincide it often is difficult to distinguish one from another longterm changes in the basic structur of the economy especially in such dynamic economies as in the us economy alter the co mposition of jobs in the economy such changes occurred during the industrial revolution when large numbers of workers migrated from farms to the rapidly developing manufacturing industries in northern cities these struct ural changes represent the contraction and expansion of individual industries with in the economy that arise from changes in technology and productivity that also dir ect changes in the composition of the nations trade activities and foreign inves tment patterns other job changes are related to the impact of the business cycle on the economy such cycle is characterized by general slowdown or ex pansion in the rate of growth in the economy due to broad macro economic factors and genera lly affects large segments of the economy employment trends both us parent companies and their foreign affiliates lost employment during the economic cont raction of the early 1980s as is indicated in

p 4451these multinational companies apparently were affected more by the cyclical changes than were purely domestic firms as result the parent companies share of total us civilian employment dec lined until 2004 when it began to increase indicating that us parent companies had at least stemmed the decline in their share of us civilian employment the relative share of us employment represented by the us foreign affiliates is provided only for comparison purposes the affiliates of foreign firms operating in the united stat bucked this trend and added to their absolute level of employment except in 2003 when they reduced the number of workers and fell as share of overall us civilian employment during the entire period most of the workers added by the affiliates were added through acquisitions of existing us firms rather than by establishing new enterprises13 while such acquisitions do not necessarily add to the total number of firms in the economy they do support existing jobs and may even

employed abroad by the foreign affiliates of those parent companies throughout the 1980s an economic recessi on and broad restructuring of the economy caused us parent companies to lose employment while employment among the foreign affiliates of these parent companies generally held even by 1989 us parent companies reversed the downward slide in their employment and began expanding their empl

employment of us parent companies declined more sharply than it did among their foreign affiliates and the decline in employment lasted longer than it did among the employment of the foreign

show appreciable ch ange in the underlying trend that favors investment and jobs in deve loped economies in additi on us foreign affiliates as whole lost employment in the early 2000s s imilar to us parent companies employment losses were mostly concen trated among the highly developed economies of europe because their clos ties with the us economy made them highly susceptible to the slowdown in the us economy among the developing countries us investors have long been attracted to latin america likely because of its close proximity to the united states in 2005 us affiliates in mexico had over 1 million employees third behind ffiliates in canada with 11 million employees and affiliates in the united kingdom with nearly 13 million employees between 2001 and 2002 us direct investme nt employment in latin america and asia increased while employment in frica and the middle east dropped leading some observers to conclude that investment and empl oyment among the developed and developing countries re present two relatively inde pendent groups and that little employment is exchanged between th em this proposition woul d mean that employment shifts occur primarily between developing countries such as in latin american and asia and among developed countries primarily within europe and between europe and japan and canada on average the us economy created about 2 million civ ilian jobs per year from 1982 to 1992 and bout 17 million jobs per year from 1992 to 2002 from 2003 to 2006 the economy created an average of more than 2 million jobs per year the foreign affiliates of u s parent companies created an average of about 24000 jobs per year from 1982 to 1992 and about 300000 jobs per year from 1992 to 2002 in 2004 and 2005 these affiliates created mo re than 300000 jobs per year reflecting the increase in economic activity abroad there is indication from the data however how many if any at all of the jobs created abroad by us affiliates may have come at the expense of jobs created in the united states by us parent companies15 over both periods about twothirds of the jobs that were added were in developed countries as result us foreign affiliates created on average about 100000 jobs per year in lowcost deve loping countries during the 1992 to 2005 period or about 6 of the average number of jobs created by the us economy in year gross product another concern expressed about us dir ect investment abroad is that as us parent companies shift jobs abroad they also transfer economic production abroad thereby permanently replacing us dom estic production with foreign production this effect is partially muted by foreigners investing in the united states large share of such investment is comprised of foreign acquisitions of existing us firms

developing countries fell from 28 in 1999 to 25 in 2003 the shift in us direct investme nt abroad over the last decade reflects fundamental changes that occurred in th us economy during the same

those changes consequently us direct investment abroad focused less on th extractive processing and basic manufacturing industries in developing countries and more on high technology finance and

want the dded risk of investing overseas foreign investors also tend to opt for larger scale and higher capitalintensity plants than the average us firm to offset the risks inhe rent in investing

representing two periods of fast growth separated by peri od of slower growth to measure the performance of us parent firms and their foreign affiliates during these periods in particular the data are compared to determine if there has b een any noticeable shift in production or jobs from us parent companies to their fo reign affiliates in the 1999 to 2002 period when economic growth slowed in the united states that is diffe rent from what has happened during the 1995 to1998 period nd 2003 to2005 period when growth was relatively stronger the data are then used to determine if sh ifts in production from parent companies to foreign affiliates can be attributed to structural changes in the economy or to cyclical changes that are asso ciated with the busine ss cycle structural changes for instance can occur in indus tries that are maturing and experiencing economies and improvements due to technolog ical improvements or in declining industries that are shedding jobs and capital it is not always possible to tell which stage of economic change certain sectors are experiencing but such distinction is important in order to understa nd how direct investment is affecting the economy and for determining what if any legisla tive prescription woul d be appropriate the data in table 8 compare two periods of economic expansion 1995 to 1998 and 2003 to 2005 with the economic slowdown in the 1999 to 2002 period these three periods are useful for co mparing the overall economic performance of us parent companies and their foreign affiliates by examining their rates of growth in output and employment during the first and third periods when the us economy grew at an annual average rate of more than 3 per year and the later period when the economy grew at an average annual rate of about 25 if us parent companies are prone to outsourcing more jobs during periods when the us economy is growing more slowly then industries that are experi encing longterm stru ctural decline would be expected to show relatively poor ec onomic performance by the parent companyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32461crs20 in both periods relative to more robust performance by the foreign affiliates in contrast industries that are experiencing strong growth during the expansion part of the business cycle would be expected to s how stronger growth in gross product and employment by the parent

foreign affiliates experienced rebound in employment about 10 sectors mostly the same sectors which makes it difficult to track trend of outsourcing by us parent companies to their foreign affiliates trade another aspect of foreign direct investment that causes concern is the impact foreign direct investment has on the amount of foreign trade associated with those investments some observers argue that us direct investment abroad supplants us exports jobs and research nd development funds thereby reducing employment and wages in the us econom others are concerned that outward direct investment alters the industrial composition of domestic production and trade flows which can affect the sectoral and regional distribution of employment and the relative demand for skilled and unskilled labor21 according to this scenario as firms invest abroad they shift production abroa d thereby eliminating jobs in the united states as production shifts abroad jobs ar lost in the united states and goods once produced in the united states are now impor ted from abroad most studies indicate that on balance direct investment abroad increases us exports and helps sustain employment and wages at home22 if foreign direct investment is subs titute for trade and replaces jobs in the parent company it would be reasonable to expect the share of intrafirm trade to increase over time along with the flow of foreign investment such intrafirm trade represents trade between us parent companies and their foreign affiliates and the us affiliates of foreign firms and their foreign parent company in particular if foreign investment is displacing jobs and domestic production or outsourcing jobs it would be reasonable to expect imports from us foreign affiliates to the us parent company to increase over time ther is little doubt that some firms do indeed replace domestic production with production from abroad which would shift trade patterns but the share of us trade represented by us parent companies and their affiliates during the 1990s did not increas as would be expected instead as indicated in figure 11 intrafirm exports and imports fell as share of total us exports and imports during the 1990s fr

of us exports shipped by the us affiliates of foreign parent companies fell from 23 in 1990 to 19 in 2005 in addition to the decline in the overall share of us exports intrafirm trade or exports from us parent companies to their foreign affiliates fell from 27 of us exports in 1990 to 20 in 2005 as exports to firms not associated with the parent firm increased the exports of us affiliates of

of us exports remained relatively stable during the economic downturn in the early 2000s suggesting that such intrafirm trade is more stable than exports as whol so that its share rises or falls as us

us parent companies to those parent companies fell from 21 of total us imports to 13 of us imports from 1990 to 2005 whic h raises serious questions concerning the concept of us outsourcing of production abroad during the same time imports from foreign parent companies to their us affiliates fell from 37 to 27 of us imports so that intrafirm imports as whole fell from 48 of total us imports to 35 ove r the 1990 to 2005 peri od due in part to imports shipped to importers outside the in trafirm trade relationship these data do not seem to conform with the argument th at us firms have shifted some production facilities abroad and have s upplanted domestic production w ith imports at the same time data are not conclusive and may also indicate that foreign investment can stimulate foreign sales which boosts domestic production and mitigates the economic impact of foreign outsourcing sales another way of viewing the impact foreig n direct investment has on us jobs is by examining the sales patterns of us multinational companies if us parent companies are embarking on more extensive effort to outsource jobs abroad it is reasonable to expect that this pattern would affect the sales from these foreign affiliates to the us parent company or that sales to other us persons by foreign sourced goods would increase over time in addition some observers are concerned that certain types of service jobs are being moved abroad with service activities being outsourced to foreign workers the bea data on sales of us multinational companies however follows pattern similar to that of the trade patterns of these companies and does not offer conclusive evidence of an increase in jobs or activities being outsourced abroad as table 12 indicates the foreign affiliates of us parent companies had 37 trillion in sales in 2005 the largest share of affiliate sales bout twothirds is in the local market where the affiliate is located us parent companies also use their foreign affiliates as springboard to increase sales in neighboring areas or countries such sales to other foreig n countries in 2005 accounted for about one fourth of the affiliate s sales european affiliates which account ed for slightly over half of all affilia sales also accounted for the lowest share of their sales back to the united states where over onethi rd of their sales is to

ra tes of return are very s imilar in addition those countries that are large i nvestors are also recipients of large amounts of direct investment and investment flows into and out of thes countries seem to move together so that those economic conditions that encourage inflows of direct investment also promote outfl ows of direct investment26 economists generally believe that firms invest abroad to increase their profits they are less certain about which factors trigger the initial investment decision about why firms choose to invest where they do and about what distinguishes firms that invest abroad from those that remain purely domestic in most cases economists conclude that broad range of factors influence firms decision to invest abroad that include far more than simple search for lowcost labor the united nations characterizes the major determinants of foreign direct investment as the confluence of three sets of determin ing factors that exist simultaneously the presence of ownershipspecific competitive advantages in transnationa l corporation the presence of locational advantages in host country and the presence of superior commercial benefits in an intrafirm as against armslength relationship between investor and recipient27 for some foreign direct investment seems to be characterized by relatively simple process of firms seeking out wcost production locations and lowcost resources including lowcost labor multinational firms however are motivated by more than single factor and likely invest abroad not only to gain access to low cost resource but to improve their efficiency or to improve their market share in all direct investment is complex ac tivity that involves longterm commitment to business venture in foreign country that requires the coordination and management of considerable resources and assets acros s countries the relative importance of characteristics that determine where investments are located depend on broad range of factors that can chan ge over time and with economic conditions although lowcost abundant labor is pr incipal resource that some firms seek academic studies of foreign direct investment indicate that it is always labor plus other advantages particular ly industrial infrastructure that influence firms investment decision based on observa tions through 1998 the united nations concluded that investments ba sed solely on lowcost labor have been highly mobile and have increased dramatically the risk of losing any locati onal advantage based on just that factor alone28 according to the united nations tec

reliable transportation systems and such skills as accountancy legal services purchasing and marketing finance and rd capabilities and large markets29 at times economists have puzzled over the presence of foreign direct investment because it seemed unthinkable to most of them that nations would simultaneously import and ex port the same good and that investments would occur within the same industry between two diffe rent trading countries and by the same company for some economists trade and investment were t hought to be opposites therefore as long as international trade was free there was reason for international investment to occur these economists ba sed their conclusions on the argument that free trade caused commodity prices betw een countries to converge such convergence was expected eventually to qualize wage rates and rates of return on investments and to ma ke investing abroad of little economic value30 t h s observations have not been borne out over time as foreign direct investment has become prominent feature of the globalization process this suggests that complex set of factors account for the continued presence of foreign direct investment ownershipspecific advantages economists generally argue that foreign investment is viable option for some firms due to economic advantages that arise from unique set of characteristics that are related to specific types of firms these characteristics include managerial ability technical advantages or market strength which give firms an incentive to invest abroad and to provide the advantages necessary to be competitive in markets at home and abroad31 these analysts conclude that market imperfections and firm specific factors32 give some firms economic advantages over their competitors

advantages over comp etitors and production is centered in the home country with fo reign subsidiaries acting primarily as marketing agents in later phases competition increases as the innovation is acquired by other producers in this stage businesses invest abroad in order to maintain the market shares they gained through exporting as result the transition from exporting to assembling to producing in the foreign market may be natural pr ocess with foreign investment being the facilita ting link while some of the motivation for shifting production abroad may be to avoid tari ffs or other export restraints lower transportation costs and proximity to the foreign market are important considerations40 this shift is apparent in us direct investment abroad where large shares of foreign production are consumed in the local market or shipped to neighboring countries rather than bein g exported back to the united states evidence indicates that there is little empirical basis for expecting universal linkage between foreign investment and trade41 if there is tendency for overseas production to substitute for some exports fro m an area it appears to be offset by influences that tend to increase expor ts of related produc ts or services42 studies show that the higher the level of output by us firm in foreign area the higher are the firms exports from the united states to that area and the smaller are the exports of other foreign firms this patte rn may be influenced by the host countrys trade policy which may discourage imports thereby encouraging the affiliates of foreign companies to produce locally43 moreover multinational companies may gain added economic flexibility as result of their foreign subsidiaries which allows the parent companies to alter their sources of inputs in response to cheaper imports instead of altering prices of domestica lly produced goods to remain competitivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32461crs39 44 williamson peter j multinational

productivity trade restraints and th desire to acquire technology47 are among the most important factors in determining foreign investments as result of these market conditions48 multinational firms compensate for such market failures as poorly developed or nonfunctioning capital or labor markets by investing abroad and by shifting resources among their fore ign subsidiaries the importance of these factors in motivating direct investment varies over time and among companies and foreign markets for example economists trace much of the surge of us direct investment into common market countri in the late 1950s and the 1960s to attempts by us companies to avoid trade barriers to expectations of an increased rate of economic growth in these countries and to efforts to overcome the perceived overvaluation of the dollar once these initial investments were established high level of earnings from them continued to be reinvested probably to maintain market shares and profit margins49

various s ubsidiaries in supplying major markets to maintain their competitive position without ltering the market price of their goods52 as result local prices may grow less sensitive to changes in the costs of imports linkages between the foreign affiliates and the parent companies apparently allow the affiliates to curtail price changes which might erode their price competitiveness during periods of fluctuating exchange rates in order to maintain or even to enlarge their market shares in foreign countries53 conclusions this report utilizes broad collection of data on direct i nvestment published by the bureau of economic analysis of the u s department of commerce to assess the impact of us direct investment abroad nd foreign direct investment in the united states on the us economy these data we re analyzed to determine if us parent companies are shifting jobs abroad in wa that is different or unique from previous experiences with such investment data published by the bea are the most extensive set of published data on foreign investment activities but they were not developed to address the issu of jobs outsourcing and it is not possible with the bea data to track job losses or gains in specifi c industries specific co mpanies or specific plants with changes in jobs abroad broad comprehensive data on us multinational companies published by the bea lag behind current events by two years which means that assessing these activities may seem to be out of sync with the more limited anecdotal examples that appear in the popular press and raises questions about the relevancy of the da ta to assessing s hortterm developments compared with long term trends despite these caveats the data offer conclusive evidence that current investment trends are substantially diffe rent from those of previous periods comparison of gross product and employme nt between us parent companies and their foreign affiliates over three distinct time periods indicates that us business cycles have stronger impact on us parent companies than on the foreign affiliates but that even the affiliates are affected any longterm structural changes that arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32461crs41 occurring in the economy apparently are reinforced by the business cycle in the economy but these same business cycles aff ect the foreign affiliates as result of this partial synchronization ffect us direct investment abroad and foreign direct investment in the united states generally m ove in the same direction from the data examined it is not apparent that us pa rent companies are outsourcing jobs at faster pace or in manner that is fundame ntally different or distinct from previous periods an increase in economic growth in the us parent companies relative to the rate of growth in the fore ign affiliates likely increases pressure within the economy to complete structural changes and to shift capital and labor from declining sectors to expanding sectors such changes may also lead to greater number of jobs being outsourced but this effect likely would be muted by the overall strong demand for jobs within the economy and by new foreign investments in the economy on the other hand an economic slow down among us parent companies relative to the rate of growth among foreign affiliates likely would lead to an overall decline in employment throughout the econom this overall decline in employment would make it difficult to distinguish between those sectors that are undergoing long term structural changes compared with thos sectors that are experiencing shortterm job losses due to the relatively slower rate of economic growth us parent companies may or may not respond to th economic slowdown by outsourcing jobs abroad because the dominating presence of the us economy in the world economy means that an economic slowdown in the united states likely reduces economic growth abroad as well and that the foreign affiliates of those parent companies may not be position to add more jobs th uneven effect of an economic slowdown among us parent companies on their inve stment behavior abroad likely means that jobs outsourcing may appear to be more acute during periods in which the longterm structural changes in the economy co incide with the shortterm economic adjustments that arise from slowdown in the rate of growth of the us economy trade and sales data also indicate that there is perceptible change in previous patterns that would signal shift towa rd greater emphasis on foreign production and imports in fact bea data indicate th at intrafirm trade has declined over the last decade although not conclusive th is result is contrary to what would be expected if us parent companies were outsourcing greater share of their production abroad and importing more goods from their foreign affiliates these results also seem to challenge estimates that predict large shift of jobs abroad over the next half decade concerns about the currency of bea do not seem to be warranted one characteristic of us direct investment ab road and foreign direct investment in the united states is the relative stability in the patterns of that investment over time this pattern is unlikely to change over short period of time so that the lag in publication of bea data is unlikely to alter appreciably any general conclusions about the role of direct investment in the economy large share of us direct investment abroad remains concentrated in the most highly developed economies and the share of jobs supported by the foreign affiliates comprises small share relative to the us economy employment and jobs in the us economy continue to arise from economic factors that are unique to the us economy and to us economic policies on average us foreign aff iliates are expected to continue to producehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32461crs42 about 300000 jobs year small share of the average number of jobs produced by the us economy during any given year for congress the data on direct investme nt seem to indicate that the number of jobs created by us parent companies and by the foreign affiliates of those parent companies is tied closely to the overall performance of the us economy such economic measures as employment trade and investment will rise and fall among us parent companies and their foreign affiliates generally in tandem swings in the rate of growth in the economy that are associated with the business cycle tend to affect us parent companies more than they affect their foreign affiliates and more than those us firms that are purely domestic firms policies that ameliorate the business cycle especially the downside of the cycle when the economy is experiencing slow rate of economic grow th likely would do the most to help us parent companies furthermore c ongress may choose to address the economic plight of those workers and communities th at experience disproportionate share of the adjustment costs that are associated with the business cycle by providing specialized assistance or other types of shortterm support workers and communities that are invol ved with economic activities that are facing longterm structural decline may require support to assist displaced workers regain employment or to find new business partners to sustain economic development in those communities workers in industrie s that are undergoing longterm structural decline may well see production and jobs move abroad addressing such longterm structural decline however is especially challenging because the economic forces that are working against such industries can be immense
