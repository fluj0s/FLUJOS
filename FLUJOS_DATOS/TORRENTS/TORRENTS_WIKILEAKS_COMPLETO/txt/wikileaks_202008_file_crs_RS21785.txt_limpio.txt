program was first authorized in the education amendments of 1972 pl 92318 the pell grant is awarded to undergraduate students on need basis and is intended to serve as the foundation of all federal student aid awarded the size of the award is primarily based upon the individual students and where applicable their familys ability to contribute to the costs of their education1 students who are

service the library of congress crs2 background prior to 1992 individuals who were incarcerated and pursuing postsecondary education were eligible to receive pell grant in the 1992 amendments to the higher education act hea pl 102325 congress prohibited persons who were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole and those who were sentenced to death from receiving pell grant persons who were incarcerated and not serving life sentences without the possibility of parole or sentenced to death remained eligible for pell grants however the only permissible expenses were tuition fees books and supplies room and board could not be covered several proponents of the new provisions maintained that prisoners who were sentenced to death or life without the possibility of parole would never reenter society thus there was need to educate them in addition the oppositions argument that education reduced recidivism was not applicable to individuals with life sentences or those who had received the death penalty in 1994 the violent crime control and law enforcement act pl 103322 amended the hea and completely eliminated pell grant eligibility for persons incarcerated in state or federal penal institution3 during the passage of the 1994 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21785 violent crime control and law enforcement act many argued that providing pell grants to prisoners was displacing more deserving students from the program but in fact in any given award year funds are available to ensure that all eligible students attending eligible institutions receive pell grant4 therefore the number of prisoners receiving grant does not affect the number of grants available to nonincarcerated students nevertheless an overall increase in pell grant recipients does increase the total costs of the program and would increase the cost of raising the size of the maximum grant5 previous participation prior to the enactment of the 1994 violent crime control and law enforcement act prisoner participation in the pell grant program was very minimal it is estimated that in the 19931994 program award year approximately 23000 prisoners out of 4 million total pell grant recipients participated in the pell grant program6 furthermore the general accounting office gao estimated that during this same program year inmates received 35 million of the 6 billion awarded in grants this represented less than 1 most inmates who participated in the pell grant program were enrolled in programs of at least two years but less than four years in duration conducted by public postsecondary institutions7 for example local community college might conduct program in prison 3 incarcerated students who are not incarcerated in state or federal penal institution are eligible for federal pell grant fws and fseog 4 for additional information regarding pell eligibility see crs report rl31668 5 for additional discussion on increasing the maximum pell grant see crs report rl31668 6 general accounting office gao pell grants for prison inmates hehs94224r letter of aug 5 1994 7 ibid crs3 prior legislative action since the initial enactment of the prohibition of pell grants for prisoners policy makers have continued to debate some issues for example opponents contend that the elimination of pell grants has resulted in an increase in recidivism because inmates longer have the means to pay for their education the proponents of the prohibition maintain that education is luxury and prisoners should not be eligible to receive pell grant especially considering funds for the program are limited since the initial passage of the prohibition various members have introduced legislation to amend andor eliminate this provision this section presents brief discussion of prior legislative activity during the 108th congress representative ric keller introduced the financial aid for sex offenders act hr 33858 which prohibited sex offenders confined to civil commitment facilities from receiving pell grants or federal student loans9 at present the hea does not define either imprisonment or penal institution as result of the absence of definition it is not clear how to apply the current provisions of the hea to civil commitment facilities these facilities present an unusual set of circumstances with regard to the inmates who enroll in postsecondary institution and apply for pell httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21785 grant10 these facilities are considered mental health facilities by the states and courts and are usually managed by the states health or social service agency as opposed to corrections department because the person being treated in the facility has been sentenced to reside in the facility and cannot leave until he is permitted to do so many argue that civil commitment centers function as prisons 8 the bill was introduced in the house on oct 29 2003 and referred to the subcommittee on 21st century competitiveness in nov 2003 there has been further action since 9 according to representative keller this past year 54 violent sexual predators in florida obtained over 200000 in pell grants at taxpayers expense they got free ride by exploiting loophole that is they were involuntarily confined in something called civil commitment center as opposed to being called prison representative ric keller financial aid for sex offenders act hr 3385 remarks in the
