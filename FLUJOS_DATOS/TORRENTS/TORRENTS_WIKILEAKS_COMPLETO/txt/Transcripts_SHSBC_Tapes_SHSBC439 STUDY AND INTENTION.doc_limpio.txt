study and intention lecture given on 18 august 1966 thank you thank you well now if i lookif i look little bit used today and secondhand theif anybody thought clear research took it out of man ot research wow yeah you think you got it all solved you know how did you get in this much trouble how did i get in this much trouble yeah man you try to take the postulate of 190milehigh being and while youre only five foot ten and half or something like that take it apart its wheres your head you know this is very interesting when you get clear ive got little piece of advice for you why get enrolled in the ot course and do it step by step politely and quietly dont get ambitious im the only one thats expendable around here every time anything happens to they say well it serves him right and any time anything happens to you thats my fault yeah anyway whats the date audience 18th of august ad 16 eighteenth of where audience august august audience ad 16 ad 16 thank you youre helping out today and what planet audience earth earth what yeah good earth well actually what this is all abouti really dont have anything to talk to you about today i want to make little bit of awell i want to make little bit of correction if you as i did after the last lecture go and look up dharma dharma to find out what has been preserved of all that why save yourself the trouble dharma is anything from supreme law to the total caste system of india to fate and respelled love and rephrased some other way it is something else some other way and so forth and in authoritative reference book that ive looked at to date that i have around at this particular time is there any correct definition for dharma boy that is really great you know its really great and in buddhism it means the way see now i tell you you go around getting your name synonymous with things you know and then your name becomes the thing you know if you make very good frigidaires why eventually all iceboxes are known as frigidaires you see but its worse than that its worse than that the name becomes identified with the product rather than the source of the product which i think is very fascinating i just thought i would give you that as little side note on the last lecture because i thought i wonder what theyre saying about that these days you know i wonder if theres any record of it around you know by george there isnt i notice however in many books such as the theosophy texts and so on that it is bounteously mentioned but it doesnt really say wherein well the age were in by the waythe age we started by the way already has been named this might also be an interesting side note to you its the age of love there was the age of reason and the age of science and the age of lot of other things but twentyfive hundred years ago why gautama siddhartha said that in twentyfive hundred years the age of love would begin in the west and this is an interesting prediction because the first thing that clears start talking about is love you know its interesting of course nobody ever made this before so how was he to know but anyway this is supposed to be the age of love longer the age of reasonthank cod well there are probably lot of things i could talk to you abouti dont know any of them at the present moment that would be more useful to you than another completions are up so i dont have to worry about that and you seem to be doing fine on the course so i dont have to worry about that but there is lecture that i think you could use in high degree of generality and that is roundup of the study materials there was never really final lecture on the study materials and in this lecture i will not for moment adventure to give you summary lecture which includes all the salient points of the study materials there are quite few of them but there are some additional materials about the study materials in general which i think you might find of great interest and that is the basis of intentintent during study now this is very very important subject as you study what do you intend to do with the information very important point there are points on the basis of faulty source as you are studying this we havent really looked at we have presupposed that all sources that we are studying are themselves perfect you see and have 1 have information to deliver and 2 are delivering it in way that it can be assimilated weve more or less assumed that and the student is always asked to take the effect point and assume that he is studying comprehensible worthwhile material this fact all by itself tends to knock the whole subject of study appetite over tin cup because very little of the material you are asked to study has any value or comprehensibility out in the wog world and it is rare textbook which actually relays the information and subject matter which you are supposed to assimilatea very rare textbook now when you get study gone mad you really have mess this is one of the reasons why there are such tremendous number of suicides in universities and there are great many suicides in universities the proportion is fantastic it is not as high as psychoanalytic practice suicides which amount to one third in the first three months did you know that well for some reason or other its never been advertised the source of that is the psychoanalytic bureau or whatever they called it in new york weve more or less finished that subject by the way very little of it left but the suicides which occur in french universities is probably the highest in the world and french students blow their brains out and jump out of windows all over the place come examination time the number of failures in university do not however have anything whatsoever to do with the product turned out by the university none of these things are related because their examinations are very hard does not make it good university you see the ones with the hardest examinations are not necessarily those that produce the most brilliant students its not coordinated fact there are many other facts which dont coordinate with regard to this and that is because study is very fruitful field for suppressive it like government attracts suppressives like honey attracts flies and you can get all types of suppressive reactions found in textbooks as well as behind the lecture rostrum as resultas result we have to when we speak of the subject of study discuss whether or not the subject itself has clean bill of health is the subject an ethicsor the rendition of the subjectis this an ethics subject now i will tell you field which without any doubt whatsoever would keep thousand ethics officers busy thousand years and that is the field of navigation now im somewhat expert in this particular line but i very seriously doubt if i could walk into board of trade or bureau of navigation and pass today my masters examinations in the field of navigation i doubt this very very much because it has so little to do with navigation and i have had the unfortunate experience of having had to navigate in many oceans off the cuff on my owninadequate equipment stopped chronometers and all of this sort of thing and missing tables and so forth and somehow or another these barriers would not put you into positionmust not put you into position where of course you lose the ship so you navigate and the method by which you navigate is the allimportant thing in an examination on navigation and that you navigate is the only test that old man sea requires of you and i usuallyusually when some chap has just passed his navigation examinations with and walks aboard ship that i have anything to do with well i get very alert because this doesnt say to that he can navigate at allhas nothing to do with navigation ive had such chap walk aboard take look at the helm and say so that is wheel well ive often wondered and that is binnacle thats compass oh goodness and thats an engine room telegraph how interesting and i thought to myself how interesting the man had his ticket he must have passed his examination but he hadnt even reached the point of where he knew the environment in which he was supposed to do his navigation and you break navigation down to its basic principles you just have certain elementary principles which are just the facts of it and they are very very streamlined obvious facts for instance the whole subject is dedicated to the location of where you are on sphere and in view of the fact the sphere also has rocks shoals and land masses also has somewhat tempestuous areas which are less safe than others and has calm areas that you jolly well better stay out of it becomes somewhat important that you know where you are and in view of the fact that the sea is water surface which obscures the things even few inches below it i remember one time sailing along in perfectly beautiful flat calm and doing all right and looking over to port and seeing sea gull walking on the water you dont think at that moment i went slightly pale because of tideraces which had been caused by storm or were going backwards according to the tide tables and so onthe depth of water over shoal just alongside of was not twenty feet but was one inch so you see it was supposed to be high water at that time now therefore all navigation performed with mathematical activities only can only be counted on to do one thing wind you up on the rocks that youre fairly sure of because the whole subject is dedicated to knowing where you are and the next thing is not running into on or colliding with objects which youre not supposed to frequent or associate with thats easy and then we have some other facts that the stars dont move very much and cliffs and headlands dont move very much and the sun it moves pretty regularly and the moon moves erratically but very regularlyyou can predict its erraticness and so you can look at these things and if you have chronometer which happens to have been wound up or can get time signal from some place you normally can locate where you are on the sphere by its reference to stellar bodies or in case of piloting by recognition of land masses thats actually all there is to the whole subject now do you understand something about the subject audience yes i assure you that you now understand far more about the subject than firstyear midshipman at the naval academy because hes given book that is named dutton dutton is the bible now dutton might have been good textbook to begin with but it has gotten into the hands of admirals and it has been ceaselessly rewritten now the primer of navigation by mixter was the elementary textbook which kept the officers who stayed off the rocks off the rocks in world war ii he published it in 1940 it became the bible of the young officer of world war ii and it nowmixter is deadis now in the process of being rewritten by the admirals and when i read it the other day i just picked up copy of it and lookedread itthis doesnt sound like mixter so last night i got ahold of copy of my world war ii copy of mixter and brandnew copy of mixters that just came off the press and i read them page by page against each other and its considerably different the words have gotten longer now bowditch has undergone this process for so many years that from little tiny textbook published at the end of the eighteenth century in simple languageso that even bowditchs cook could navigate after cruise to chinahas become textbook about three or four inches thick which is staggeringly full of sines cosines haversines tables traverse tables equations and all kinds of mad things and its become an enormous book of tables if they dont know what to do with navigational table they put it in bowditch it is now an official textbook of the united states navy i imagine there are things in the royal navy which have gone this same evolution but the main point im making here is that you would have thought somebody would have paid attention to such subjectlack of knowledge of which kills men see you can die awful quick through an absence of navigation you see and not sometimes not so quick sometimes rather messily youd have thought they would have made every effort to make it simpler well its true that theyve evolved simpler methods of taking star sights but their textbooks are so complicated that the first time i ever picked up copy of the naval academy textbook on navigation dutton i read the first four sentences i read them again they still didnt make any sense i read them again i put the book down and thats as far as ive ever gotten with dutton many years latermany years later i read the first four sentences again and i found out that if you were an expert navigator and needed information of any kind on the subject the first four sentences of dutton made sense well i think thats very interesting the encyclopaedia britannica in its earliest editions is rather simple encyclopediavery interesting i dont like editions later than the eleventh because you find all sorts of things in editions up to then theyre rather simply written theyre written on the basis that person owns an encyclopedia because he doesnt know certain things and hell want to look them up and find quick rundown on them well more recent encyclopaedia britannica im sorry to say publish articles on the subject of landscape gardening that only landscape gardener could comprehend or be interested in weve gotten into the world of the expert now the expert in writing textbook very often goes mad last night i picked up textbook on the subject of im using navigation at this particular time instead of photography as i was using in the subject before just to get parallel subject i picked up textbook on the subject of yacht equipyacht cruising equipment oh very very authoritative text very modern and there was chapter there on binoculars so i looked into this chapter on binoculars and its just page after page after page about binoculars its very interesting because it takes it up from the days of galileo it tells you how to buildwithout being specific about it but being very complex with complete formulas galilean telescope i think its very useful i can see now out on yacht in the middle of the pacific building galilean telescope i can see this now so anyway it goes on from thiswhich is comprehensibleyou say well anybody would put that in the first paragraph he puts that in the first two or three pages and we go on from there to the assimilation andof light by glass and various types of glass and how the glass is made and we go on and on and on about the formulas now by which you grind glass i can see now you see just outside the diamond head at waikiki wondering which binocular to pick up and lets see now what is the glass formula that ground the glass of that binocular you see silly so anyway it just goes on at this mad rate and at the end of it finally concludes without any preamble of any kind whatsoever that yachtsman needs 7 x 50 type pair of binocularsan authoritative conclusion based on all of the optical formulas yachtsman is not an optician whats he got the formulas there for completely batty now the truth of the matter is that that chapter does not contain the following how to preserve waterproof and clean glasses being used at sea and you can wreck pair of glasses just that fast if you dont know that how to set pair of glasses to your own eye prescription and be able to set up any binoculars that you pick up instantly so that you can use it instantly without fiddling aboutdidnt contain that didnt contain the fact that in small vessels the vibration and the bounding about is such that the shake of the glass makes it impossible for you to detect numbers on buoys or identities of or names of ships at any distance if you use too high powered glass and 7 x 50 will inevitably blur out on the motion of small yacht it is not the glass for yacht at all what you want is three or fourpower for small boat and then you can read the numbers on buoys so even his conclusion was wrong fascinating he spends all these pages see but somebody comes along thats had to live with binoculars knows all the things that dumb brandnew untrained quartermasters can do with binocularsyou see hes used binoculars under all circumstances and he finds out that what the fellow wrote has nothing whatsoever to do with the subject but wait minute wait minute fellow thats been using them for years under those conditions doesnt need that textbook does he and if that textbook doesnt inform the user of any of the data that he will require in order to use what is this wow theres more to this than meets the eye considerably more to this than meets the eye lets read few books picked up at random off the shelf on the subject of the sea and unless you are very cleverand scientologistyou will not notice that all it speaks of is disaster it just tells you consistently page after page after page after page how disastrous it all is how you must do this and that because this is going to happen how you must do that and this because something else is going to happen how you must not do soandso because something else is going to happen you read in vain how to get another half knot out of your sail set but you read all about how the tracks to the front of the sail as they attach it to the mastnot to go technical on youhow these little gimmicks that they put on the sail to go up the marconi track how they tear loose in storms and jam sideways and make it necessary for people to get up and climb up mast which is impossible and if you read very much of this you would not go to sea you would be scared stiff just scared stiff and even on person of considerable experience this creeps up on him and he doesnt notice it and eventually he starts going to sea and he gets in sort of halfhysterical frame of mind beautiful calm day hes out in the middle of channel fifty miles wide there are ships in sight and hes worrying about his azimuths or did the subpermanent magnetism of the hull change the last time she was in dry dock and is his compass reading right and will he pick upoh just worry worry worry worry worry worry hell never sit back you know and say great you know now if you want to go into hysterics sometime read coast pilots for light reading for those who like horror stories that is what one recommends i remember one time considering taking the big jump down from alaska just going outside all protection in the middle of winter and tearing on down across the wide reaches of the pacific and fetching up at california port as direct bang you see with an expeditionary vesselwithout going behind anything and so forth and i sat there and the mate i had was sitting there and we were both readingwe had two copies of the same coast pilot and we were looking it all upand it wasntbut it was not the same coast pilot his was british and mine was americanand we read it it seems that five hundred miles off of the coast there are fantastic currents which when the wind and fog come togetherbecause the wind comes with the fog at the same time in the middle of december and januaryyou can absolutely count on being torn to pieces sunk engaged involved becalmed messed up and in general finished and it was so badits much worse than im sayingand it was so bad that he and i sitting up it was already you see complete black dark outside at high noon you know and we were going to take this run and somehow or other we were going to get the hell out of there and we all of sudden simultaneously broke into hysterical laughter nothing could be that bad you see but nothing the british pilot american pilotnothing could be that bad one time i read about terrible tiderace and it was tiderace and it told all about how it had sunk canadian gun boat and lost two hundred men and that this tiderace went sixteen knots and every time the tide changed and there was huge rock in the middle of it that split vessels apart but was visible at night because of the spray leaping into the air well normally you would go through these things at slack water anyway i went through it at slack water and the cook all the time we were going through it was cooking up hot flapjacks and pushing them up on the bridge because i was sitting there eating my breakfast the entire distance through this mad tiderace i shot another tiderace one time narrows where anybody that entered it was practically sunk but sometimes the ships caromed off the sides of the cliffs and kept afloat somehow and i was in the middle of this thing in the middle of the night because there was an error in the american tide tablesa twohour errorand id hit the thing at race instead of at slack and the water was going through there just boiling white and man i came near that in sailing ship and i was into it before i could do another thing and the lights of the cabin were shining through ports on the cliffs so close up that you could see the moss and the tiller broke and left us with tiller so i rigged an emergency tiller in the middle of all of this and steered her on out the other side and suddenly realized wed gotten through it and i realized something else about it i never really at any time ever had to know anything about that millrace at all if id hit it at slack water high water or any other way it didnt matter if it was fast it always sends boat through what was i studying tide tables for so it runs fast you get the idea well of course its very nice to know all these cautions but what did the captain of the indianapolis he was us naval captain and they have stripes you know that go clear up to their cap this fellow took the cruiser indianapolis through this first narrows i was talking to you about and the local pilots cautioned him about it and hed read all the tide tables and he was graduate of the naval academy and he was man of great experience im very sure and so forth and he had all this information because every time they graduate you know upi mean every time they get promoted they have to pass complete examinations on everything you know im sure he had the informationa student all the way and he got the uss indianapolis crossways in that channel at full race with its stern stuck on one bank and its bow on the other this he managed i cant for the life of know how he could possibly have done it but if you look very carefully through these textbooks you will find the bulk of them simply tell you not to go to sea that its very dangerous and person who studies them very very hard and abides by them totally eventually loses all the fun of going to seaand doesnt so there is suppression throughout that field now of course it is very nice for them to tell you that if you let the boat flood with butane gas and then strike match the boat will blow up were glad to know that its very nice to know where the rocks are but lets not concentrate on them for the rest of our lives lets also point out where the open easysailing water is but we never hear about that we just hear about the rocks and we could then take any subject and write it up for study purposes as suppressive subject now you want to tell people the dangerssometimes you can tell them too lightly thats true for instance itid hate to tell people theres two extremes here id hate to have to omit the idea that if you do an incorrect search and discovery you can make your pc quite ill you get the wrong sp the person can be sick he can now get sick because youve restimulated the right one you see and that is whats making him sick youre not making him sick the right one is now i can tell you that but now to go on raving and ranting and describing sd as only how not to get the wrong one because youre sure going to do it i could get you into frame of mindi dont say i would but you could be gotten into frame of mind whereby you would probably never do an sd because its too dangerous interesting you could be scared right off of doing the right thing because its too deadly well now that would be how you would curve subject and make it suppressive thats suppressive rendition of the subject its not the subject thats but we could just go on talking about people get sick when you do an sd on them if you do not soandso and you want to set up your meter because people will get sick and your meter has to be trimmed your trim knob has to be soandso because people are going to get very sick and then its your fault as the auditor you see and then so on and we never talk about anybody ever recovering because of an sd we just talk how sick theyll get if you do it wrong do you see then it becomes too dangerous to do now theyve done this about the mind and they managed to have scared offthe sp on the track managedhas managed actually to scare off all intelligent research on the subject of the mind and soul youve heard time and again how dangerous it is you mustnt fool around with the mind perfectly all right to take meat ax to the brain but you mustnt fool around with the mind i got my belly so full in 1950 of psychoanalysts telling how dangerous it was to fool around with the mind but i finally more or less rejected it with laughter because i looked at who was talking and when he said fool around man he meant fool around because i found out he could not study dianetics he could not do it and do you know our main departure from training psychoanalysts and psychiatrists and medical doctors is not really based on the fact we are antipathetic toward them at all its the fact that they cant seem to duplicate study materials and its just so hard its so tough person comes off the street you can teach him comm course in week well youll teach psychologist comm course in something like six or eight weeks rough see because the guy has been very suppressively taught he cant duplicate anymore on this subject and its everything else he has been taught you see so its all going in sideways and backwards and hes got preconceived notions and hes actually in remedy b of the book of case remedies thats what he needs now the suppressive subject then is something which boobytraps study and all of the work which you put in to get somebody to know his algebra and so on might be all lost because he hasnt got textbook which teaches him algebra you see now what is needed is an appreciation of the study materials by the people who write materials to be studied now blokes will try theyll try very hard i was reading book on ocean cruising the other night it was very fine it was not ocean cruising but coastwise navigation wrinkles and he said but what you should use if you have crew who isnt trained something like that and its much safer you should always have grid compass grid compass he starts it out with the fact that everybody must understand his work that was the condition under which he wrote it and in the first few sentences here is this phrase grid compass theres further explanation of any kind whatsoever so just for fun i picked up various navigational and equipment texts to find if i could find grid compass picture of one definition of one i picked up two or three nautical dictionaries to try to find definition of grid compass didnt existvery hard very rough now there was guy who was honestly trying to do good job and he skidded because he didnt know that he mustnt put in word that people wouldnt know now in dianetics and scientology weve been consistently up against the fact that were beyond the limit of language the english language does not include the parts of subject which was unknown you understand i mean if you dontif nobodys known anything about any of these things you see well they have to be named which unfortunately gives us lot of nomenclature and so on which we could be very happy without we have to have it because it isnt in the language now once in while psychoanalyst tries to turn it around or psychologist tries to turn it around to his own nomenclature and you get the real reason why some things which could have been called by old terms arentis because hes got an entirely different definition and his definition is in argument with the other definitions in his own field so they dont know what theyre talking about so its completely messedup area now where they did have some words the words didnt mean what theyre supposed to mean do you see and then theres argument about the definition of those words so the solution to this was actually to turn verbs to nouns where possible to use nomenclature which was expressive to some degree of what it represented now not knowing the study materials when the material was originally written it was not possible to apply all this and go back to the beginning and sort it all out up the line now this would be very very long and rough passage this would be tough passage to try to rewrite everything all the way down the line now we suffer to the degree that we dont even have dictionary we do not have real dictionary at this time which would giveand that is because every time i get copy of dictionary and so forth i have to myself check the whole thing and i find myself making changes and corrections in it and then i have to work very hard you see on it and then somebody else has been working on it and its major project and just about the time i will get started you see somea lot of its been done and then ive got to carry on through with correctionssomething will come up something will be totally demanding of total time and it doesnt get done and this dictionaryweve been on dictionaries for i dont know how long trying to get you dictionary well its rough job its rough job at best but you will find nearly everything is defined in the text where it originally appears therefore were you to cover all of the data you would get all of the language and that is one of the reasons why i said that saint hill student had better go back to the original method of study and the original method of study is you covered it all lightly you covered it all lightly and you wound up then with good grip on the entirety of the subject and then what you really had to know well you then studied that hard for starrate but volume was what it took now of course youre up against not knowing where the word was originally used and there are probably great many tapes missing i dont imagine we have many wichita tapes and i know we have few or elizabeth tapes compared to the lectures there were eight hours of lecture day there on many days five hours was routine teaching different classes and units but this gives us difficulty right there but were clever enough to know we have that difficulty and now what im going to tell you is going to solve this to very marked degree and this is the subject of the intentions of study for what purpose are you studying now until you clarify that you in actual fact cannot make an intelligent activity of it now most students study for examination thats folly complete folly youre not going to do anything with the examiner youre sitting there studying for examination studying for an examination studying for an examination how will i regurgitate this when i am asked certain question how will i respond how will i pass my checkout well its very hard to keep demonstrate and example and clarify into examination its so much easier to fall back on what did it say in the bulletin you see and get direct quotes of the material itself when in actual fact thats really not proper examination because the fault that can be found with education in the university the argument the practical man has with the academically trained man when he first gets him on the subject and has to make him fully acquainted with ityou know like the guy whos been out there building houses for long time and he all of sudden gets an assistant whos just been trained in the university to build houses he goes mad guy doesnt know anything about the subject at all hes been studying it for years yet he knows nothing about it and he doesnt know why this is well i can tell you why it is because the fellow who just went through the university studied all of his materials so that he could be examined on them he didnt study them to build houses and the fellow whos been out there on practical line is not necessarily superior in the long run at all but he certainly is able to get houses built because all of his study is on the basis of how do i apply this to house building every time he picks up an ad or literature or anything else hes asking the question throughout the entirety of his reading how can i apply this to what im doing and that is the basic and important difference between practical study and academic study scholastic or academic study is not worth very much why you have fellow go through course and wind up at the other end of the course unable to audit its because he in actual fact studied for the examination he did not study to apply it to people so he winds up with the material unapplied thats regrettable this is why you get failures in practice after certification and is the whole reason now if fellow were just studying for the examination he would not have to know the exact meaning of all of the words he could sort of gloss over it and pass it off because he could include the word in the totality of its sentence and merely quote the sentence if he was asked the question and he wouldnt really have to know the meaning of the word so he tends to move out the material over here and have sort of nothing to do with the material while he is busy studying the material because he can just rattle it off and this explains the student who can rattle off his material so beautifully but doesnt know anything about the subject see you say to him fulcrums he doesnt know what fulcrum is he hasnt clue but he knows it fits in sentence that says the law of the fulcrum is ratatattat tatatattat so he can write it all down ratatattat and he knows how to solve fulcrums because those are the formulas by which you solve them distance weight so on so he just applies it for the problem hes given ratatattatatattat trrmpa there we are one fine day hes got to move barrel and he stands around and he looks around at this barrel and he scratches his head and he doesnt know how hes going to move that barrel because he cant get one end of it picked up to slide anything under it and he couldnt hold it up if he did and so forth and finally somebody who doesnt know anything about fulcrums at all comes along takes pole sticks it over the top of stump and sets up fulcrum see and moves the barrel with the big lever the person watching this is not likely to connect his lessons in physics with what the workman did and therefore we can get very educated dumbbells and thats how theyre made its on the intention of the study hes studying it to be examined on or hes studying it to apply it and its just those two different things now where subject is boobytrapped and suppressive in the extreme it can be studied for examination but cant be studied for application doesnt matter how complex study is matter how suppressively written matter how badly organized it still can be memorized it can be spat back on the examination paper if you work hard enough and your memory is good enough but you cant apply it you cant begin to apply that subject because there was understanding in it with which to apply it isnt that horrible there was nothing there to be understood and if there was nothing there to be understood of course it couldnt be applied i imagine you could write up whole textbook on the subject of weejacks and nobody would ever know what they were you didnt know what they were or anything else you could write very learned text that was full of mathematical equations by which the whole situation of weejacks could be completely fixed up and wind up at the other end of it with subject on which some students could get totally synthesized subject now on the other side of the picturethe other side of the pictureif you studied that subject for application every time you hit bump that was incomprehensible in the text you yourself would require clarification if it wasnt in the text to be understood and if it wasnt in any parallel text to be understood why in order to apply it you would have to clarity it and you wouldnt run into bunch of misunderstoods because you would stop at them when you arrived at them and you would get them clarified do you see now your difficulty in studying dianetics and scientology is basically the lack of dictionary but i call to your attention that i just got through turning you out two tapes and bulletin which if you look through them very carefully you will not find anything in them that isnt defined in them you noticed that about them well thats the dianetic materials which is directly being applied at this moment in the practice of dianetics now thats totally defined for total application and so therefore the application is possible and you can study it for application and we notice that students who are auditing in dianetics are getting rather interesting results now in addition to that theyre told to study this material so they can go audit right now do you see now that would produce this other frame of mind of studying it for application now if anybody is making anyhaving any trouble with the dianetic materials at all it is simply that they have not studied the dianetic tapes or bulletin for application they have studied them for examination now if you were to go back brandnew as though youd never heard of it before and study it for application and every time you got single sentence of it wondered how you were going to apply this to pc or what this had to do with your performance as an auditor in the application of dianetics to the pc you would wind up at the other end with case of indigestion you would wind up with complete grasp of the subject able to get results bang bang bang do you see but one is taught very bad habits of study in universities and in schools in this society at this time because so much stress is put on examination the stress on examination is so terrific that one can become social outcast through failing his examinations i notice in the united states now they call them dropouts rrrhh dropouts guy flunked hes finished but its also interesting to note that of the four fellows who dropped out i think it was princeton in one semesternow this is very paraphrased data im not going to try to give you their histories four dropouts in one semester at princeton from the lower classes of princeton you know freshman sophomore and so on all were making in excess of twentyfive thousand dollars year within the year wait what whoa whats that those werent the failures they were the successes in that class now we check in vain to find single philosopher except mills who ever got passing grade in school or who stayed in school to its end read the list man bacon spencerjust read them off bang bang bang this one that one the other one oh yeah well he was kicked out he was in there seventeen days he was at oxford and they gave him the deep six and so on so on why why well man for long time has just avoided this he knows it exists but hes avoided it totally because its complete assignment of failure to his educational system if it cant teach the bright boys and hes given many explanations to it and so on but the explanation is simply that the study materials that are given are not for application and these birds are doers in life and they want material for application and the university texts are not arranged to apply anything to anything now im not riding hobbyhorse in my own resentments but i will tell you this brief anecdote i was flunked in analytical geometry and i was flunked resoundingly i was given great big f i know it sounds like mathematics and unless youre acquainted with mathematics in general youve probably never even heard of it and thats because its dead mathematics it has possible use according to the professors but id sat back at the end ofthe back of the class and i got intrigued with this stuff because it could be applied to aerial navigation and i found out that you could draw up formula out of it which would solve the drift of windyou know wind drift and few other things could be applied very easilyand i found out that it might be jolly useful mathematics oh i made mistake man that finished it i made mistake i told the professorname was hodgson if you ever saw flame light in any mans eye it was to see this beautifully dead mathematics being given purpose and application i told him rather indifferently i didnt try to push it through i wasnt doing anything not arguing very polite he flunked just like thatthe whole course well fortunately i was able to go over to the chair of mathematics of the university his name was taylor he was one of the twelve men in the united states at that time who could understand einstein and i dont think he knew whether he was talking to or not talking to but i told him that i required reexamination on the subject so he ordered hodgson to take off and make new examination and so hodgson put every formula in the bookyou had to know every formula in the entire text verbatim you had to know every theorem in it verbatim and so forth and he said ill fix himtrying to make live mathematics out of dead mathematics i got ninetyeight on the examination but this was direct assault on the citadels of weve got knowledge nice and dead lets keep it that way and i erred there by telling him there was use for the stuff it was fatal error on my part i should never have opened my mouth i was also flunked one time in class on free thinking and so forth because id decided that you could think freely the entirety of study materials depends then on the material to be studied and the attitude with which it is being studiedthe purpose and intention of the student now if you were to go over dianetic materials and scientology materials just on the basis of how could i apply this and how can i use that and how can i apply this and if you examined principally on the basis of all right weve got bulletin number 642 i would expect people to know the auditing commands verbatim but how do you apply this hcob blanketyblank date you know and the examiner saidhe didnt say whats in this bulletin seehe said how do you apply this bulletin you just read it i bet you would get an awful look of horror in many students eye he has read it to be examined on he hasnt read it to apply it but now he in actual fact will have use for it of any kind whatsoever if he has read it to be examined on but if he has read it to apply it then he will find it is useful information got that now i say you have the liability in the fact that youre dealing with subject which has tradition in its vocabulary its vocabulary is new there is singularly horrible to have it missing theres missing dictionary and so on but most of the materials if youre studying them broadly are defined in the text themselves and you can gather what those things are also your instructor generally will know what it is and you can ask questions to clarity them and you should clarity them well now these materials concerning study amplify of course the other materials we had about study and im very amused at one particular subject which is one of probably the biggest football and causes more trouble to man than any other single subject and that is the subject of economics and the subject of economics has been used to forward political ideologies so for every ideology there is an economics written up to fit it to point where people longer believe there is subject called economics but the odd part of it is there is subject called economics and it has certain raw fundamental basics which if violated wreck the works but these things have all been carefully set aside and brandnew facade has been erected in its particular position in order to forward communism or fascism or some other ism ism ism and then you of course you get the socialist using capitalistic economics the capitalist using socialistic economics i dont know how they do that but they do you know you know the labor party right now uses nothing but capitalistic economics theyre dedicated to the destruction of capitalism but theyre using capitalistic economics i dont know how theyre going to succeed with that the conservative on the other hand who is dedicated to capitalism is using nothing but socialist economic proposals to remedy things i think its the most wonderful mess i ever saw but there was where subject was taken to fit certain to use crude word pitch you see the subject was written up to have curve this is communist economics see and the rudigadders of the whuterbuds all go whirwhir and the formulas are for every man according to his bla bla you know yuck the second you start applying it it violates the subject that there is basic subject there is subject called economics and it is very simple subject indeed and its been obscured so theres something else you can do with subject you can pervert subject to such point that the subject is longer applicable or assimilable or if applied becomes catastrophe so thats something else that can be done with subject thats what they did with freuds work im sure freud had lot of workable technology its doesnt survive in the practice of psychoanalysis i assure you because what i was taught in 1924 as freudian analysis isnt in any textbooks anymore i know it seems long time ago to be taught the first time about psychoanalysis but it is true that was when i first got this stuff and it sounded very interesting its all gone i havent heard any of that for years ive heard other things ive heard how the autoerotic economic system very often recoils upon the society because of the perversion of the id you want to take one of horneys books or something like that on psychoanalysm and toread it to party sometime just take paragraph at random read it out of context theres nobody at that party will believe that that is in that book they will be sure that you are just quoting gobbledygook theyre absolutely positive that you will be quoting gobbledygook because textbook could be like that but thats how you could take subject now all of man is being caught up in an economic web hes being caught in an economic net at this particular time every hour of his day is being monitored by economics it isntinteresting that the subject of economics has been so overcomplicated and so bent and so badly defined and turned off and made so suppressive that nobody can get at the root of what theyre doing the most beautiful obfuscation the most beautiful obscuring of motive which i have ever seen now you are studying subject in which there is curve if it errs in any direction its probably you arent warned enough at certain places but there isnt any curved intent in this youre studying actually along the line it was researched so that if you were to study this subject for application you would quickly find out in it what was not applicable and you would find out what was incomprehensible to you or just is there but is incomprehensible you would find these things out and gradually you would get any kink shaken out of your materials whether i sat down and wrote dictionary or not you see so anyway the next time you want good laugh pick up some text on some subject you know like landscape gardening for the beginner and find out whether the book is an ethics case or not its quite interesting you will find amongst the texts by which man is hoping to carry forward his culture and civilization you will find the sp very well represented you will also find perfectly good blokes who go right along fine but you will also find that some of these chaps who are very good and have done good job are the most damned people that anybody ever heard of for instance will durant in writing the story of philosophy and attempting to clarify philosophy and so on if hes still alive actually spent the entire latter part of his life in seclusion in california in shame and horror because so much hell was raised with him for writing that textbook to make philosophy simple and comprehensible to others interesting they hounded the man till he just didnt want to do anything but die theres fellow by the name of thompson thatnearly every calculus student in the university will sooner or later get ahold of this fellow thompsons oh its either thompson or carpenter little textbook and it begins with what calculus is and explains calculus and you read the book you find out what calculus is and its sufficiently simple that you wind up laughing you see and you go ahead and you can do something with calculus but that isnt the calculus textbooks in the university i have had professors who severely warned their students against this book because it permitted the mathematics and its very abstruse language to be communicated to the student so you will even find teachers who warn people against simple textbooks and you will find large stratas of the society get down on simplification well study materials study materials needed few other remarks maybe this lecture has helped you out little bit maybe its clarified what youre doing the next time youre studying something why take look at it and youll find yourself upand the examiner 5 going to ask this and so forth and you just haul yourself up at that particular point and ask yourself this question instead does this have application does this amplify my understanding of the mind does this broaden my grip of the subject and if so how how can i apply this if i knew this datum out in life and so forth of what use would it be to and you all of sudden will find yourself recover from any indigestion you have from studying too much too fast thank you very much thank you
