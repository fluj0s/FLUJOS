and october 2005 in accordance with the international standard s for the professional practice of internal auditing 2 com mercial operations such as the united nations com missary and petrol station were established in 1992 and 1995 respectively to help united nations agencies their staff and members of the diplom atic com munity cope with the problem of availability of com modities in the country and fuel shortages experienced during the gulf w ar in 1991 3 other operations such as united nations gift centre and recreation centre were established in 1991 and 2005 respectively to prom ote awareness of the united nations and the environm ent and to provide health sports and recreational f acilities in an am iable secure and environm entally f riendly atm osphere to united nations staf f members their f amilies and members of the diplom atic com munity 4 prior to 1996 existing com mercial operations were m anaged by the united nations environm ent program unep and the unite d nations hum an settlem ents program habitat unons office of adm inistrative services took up m anagem ent of the com mercial operations in 1996 through the com mercial operations unit cou under the support services service 5 com mercial operations advisory board coab com prising representatives of united nations agencies was established in 1999 to oversee the operations of cou and m ake recom mendations to the director division of adm inistrative services prior to 1999 governance body was in place but this did not allow for full representation across united nations agencies 6 cou is financially selfsufficient it draws its incom from markup on the various commodities and services provided and m anages these accounts independent of unon administrative accounts over the period january 1999 to august 2005 cou generated an incom of approxim ately us4 m illion with cum ulative surplus of approxim ately us15 million as at 30 july 2005 7 oios previously reviewed the united nati ons petrol station in 1999 aa1999503 and com mercial operations in 2000 aa2000164 the findings and recom mendations were reviewed as part of this audit and any issues which were still open are discussed f urther in the body of the report 8 draft of the report was shared with dir ector division adm inistrative services and the managem ent and staff of support services servi ce whose com ments which were discussed in series of exchanges that took place in february 2006 are reflected in the attached final report in italics unon has accepted m ost of the recom mendations and is in the process of implem entation ii audit objectives 9 the overall objective of the audit was to provide the directorgeneral dg unon with an page 1 assessm ent of the adequacy of the arrangem ents for com mercial operations under the responsibility of cou this included evaluating the adequacy effectiveness and efficiency of internal controls b evaluating whether adequate guidance and procedures were in place c determ ining the reliability and integrity of the f inancial data d reviewing com pliance with united nations regulations and rules and adm inistrative instructions assessing effectiveness and efficiency of arrangem ents for operations iii audit scope and methodology 10 the audit focussed on the adequacy of overall arrangem ents for m anagem ent of com mercial operations and the specific arrangem ents for m anagem ent of the united nations com missary and united nations petrol station the gift shop was not reviewed at the request of unon because it was closed while an internal study was conducted into its future the recreation centre was the subject of separate audit aa200521103 audit of unon support services recreation centre 11 the audit covered activities for the period january 1999 to october 2005 it included review and assessm ent of internal control system s interviews with staf f analysis of applicable data and review of the available docum ents and other relevant records 12 oios also followed up on the im plem entation of the 20 recom mendations raised in previous audits of com mercial operations and the petrol station referred to above iv audit findings and recommendations organiz ation and management of commercial operations roles and responsibilities of com mercial operations unit cou 13 as recommended in the audit report on com mercial operations aa200016411 review of the roles and responsibilities was conducted by an external consultant in 2002 with the intention to im plem ent the findings when the com mercial operations m anager was appointed the m anager was appointed in october 2004 and at the tim of the audit he was in the process of im plem enting the findings progress with im plem entation was considered satisfactory the recom mendation is closed and oios does not propose any further action b roles and responsibilities of com mercial operations advisory board coab 14 as recom mended in the audit report on com mercial operations aa200016411 review of the roles and responsibilities was conducted by an external consultant in 2002 oios reviewed and noted that the recom mendations of the consultant were out of date and needed to be reviewed page 2 15 unon commented that it had initiated review of governance structures and financial reporting arrangements for cou and that this review should be completed by mid 2006 oios thanks unon for this additional inform ation and does not propose any further action c st affing 16 as recom mended in the last audit of com mercial operations aa2000164013 the commercial operations m anager reviewed and am ended the roles and responsibilities of cou staff but at the tim of issuing the draft report staff job descriptions had not yet been updated and subm itted for reclassification as per sta i19989 which requires reclassification when the duties and responsibilities of the post have changed substantially or as result of restructuring within an office the old recom mendation is closed and replaced with the following recommendation ¾ to ensure form adoption of the redesigned structure for unon commercial operations unon should prepare job descriptions in line with the new structure and subm it them to unon hum an resource services for approval and reclassification and ensure that staff perform ing these functions possess the skills and com petencies required f or the positions and that the new job descriptions are reflect ed in the work plans produced for the perform ance appraisal system rec 01 17 unon accepted this recommendation and the estimated implementation date is april 2006 oios thanks unon for the prom pt action taken and will close the recom mendation upon receipt of copy of the classified job descripti ons and confirm ation that they have been used for 20062007 pas cycle d accounting policies and procedures 18 oios is concerned that its recom mendations on accounting policies and procedures for commercial operations in accordance with united nations accounting standards aa200016406 09 and 10 are still open and there was evidence of any action plan to address these issues as consequence there was evidence of adequate accounting controls to ensure the accuracy and com pleteness of accounting inform ation for com mercial operations these recom mendations rem ain open and oios encourages unon to im plem ent them as quickly as possible to m inimize the risks associated with financial m anagem ent reporting of cou budget and account s under unon program budget and accounts 19 oios recom mended in 2000 that unon should com ply with financial rule 1074 by including the cou budget and accounts in unons program budget and accounts aa2000164005 the existing recom mendation has been overtaken by events and has been closed unon commented that it had initiated review of governance structures and financial reporting arrangements for cou and that this review should be completed by mid 2006 oios thanks unon for this additional inform ation and does not propose to take any further action page 3 f custom er satisfaction 20 as recom mended in its prior audit of com mercial operations aa2000164012 unon conducted client satisfaction surveys but there was evidence that the surveys led to any changes or im provem ents consequently oios c oncluded that cou lacked the expertise to put in place an effective m echanism to collect and analyse custom er inform ation to assist in improving com mercial operations the old recom mendation is closed and in the light of the following inform ation oios is not proposing any further action on this issue unon commented that work is underway to ensure that meaningful performance information is collected on unon commercial operations in june 2005 consultant with experience in the catering and hospitality industry was recruited this consultant has been involved in among other things the design and development of mechanisms for identifying and measuring whether client expectations are being met the initial focus has been on catering and the commissary unc but the scope will be widened to include all commercial operations in the future in march 2005 the chief commercial operations unit prepared document outlining key performance measures to be used for identifying and measuring client expectations for the unc this was supporting document justifying the extension of the current contractors contract for another 12 months review of the uncs performance is due in february 2006 after which any required adjustments will be made 21 catering survey which proved to be very ccessful elicited over 320 responses 250 in the first two days was completed in february 2006 an online planning inventory management tool based on customer purchases and surveys is under consideration estimated implementation date december 2006 g inform ation technology 22 oios in 2000 recommended that unon should determ ine cous inform ation technology requirem ents and prepare an action plan for im plem enting these requirem ents aa2000164015 w hilst there was evidence that critical system s had been identified and planned to be purchased as part of purchase of an integrated com mercial operations system in the 2006 these did not form part of any detailed analysis of inform ation requirem ents which oios considers is critical for the longterm success of com mercial operations and hence the recom mendation is kept open h percentage m arkup and recovery of overhead costs 23 since the restructuring of cou in 2005 cou is now in position to quantify its overhead costs for adm inistering the various com mercial operations however m echanism needs to be developed to link these overhead costs to the various percentage m arkups that should be charged to each activity to ensure that cou only charges what is necessary to sustain itself while ensuring com petitive prices unon commented that procurement activity is limited to that mandated under the host country to contro l importation of taxfree goods eg requesting approval of pro1b from ministry of foreign affairs the contractor operating the commissary handles all other procurement and importation administration cou personnel undertake receipt and inspection procedures page 4 recommendation ¾ to ensure reasonable m arkups on com modities and reim bursem ent of costs incurred in adm inistration of unon com mercial activities unon should develop m echanism to link overhead costs for adm inistering the various commercial operations to the percentage m arkups rec 02 24 unon commented that it accepts this recommendation and will conduct the formal review of markups by the end of 2006 efforts are underway to quantify the cost of administering commercial contracts estimated implementation date december 2006 oios notes the response and will close the recom mendation upon receipt of copy of the m echanism to link overhead costs for adm inistering the various com mercial operations to the percentage m arkups b united nations commissary rationale for and design of the united nations com missary 25 w hen the united nations presence in africa was established in nairobi in 1972 the availability of com modities was very lim ited and the united nations staf f members were required to ship supplies to last them for long durations to alleviate this problem the united nations environm ent program unep and th united nations hum an settlem ents program unhabitat entered into an agreem ent with kenya to enable them to establish united nations com missary for sale of agreed articles to their officials and m embers of accredited delegations 26 over the years there has been an increase both in the num ber of united nations agencies served by the united nations com missary over 3000 custom ers and the range and nature of international goods available in the local m arket place but there has not been any comprehensive review of the nature and type of united nations com missary that is now needed if one is still needed recommendation ¾ to determ ine the continued need for united nations com missary in nairobi and to ensure that the united nations com missary reflects the needs of the enlarged united nations com munity now present in nairobi unon should undertake review into the need for united nations com missary and if one is needed what services it should provide the m echanism for its operation and whether the united nations com missary should be run by unon or outsourced form review of services provided at vienna and new york should be included as part of this review rec 03 27 unon commented that it accepts this recommendation due by mid 2007 in time for the opening of the new commissary oios notes the response and will close the recom mendation upon receipt of copy of the results of the review into the need for united nations com missary and if one is needed what services it should provide the m echanism for its operation and whether the united nations co mmissary should be run by unon or outsourced page 5 b operation of the united nations com missary 28 the united nations com missary since its establishm ent in 1992 has been outsourced to commercial contractors due to the lack of inhouse expertise which has m eant that unon has been unable to properly control and dem onstrate that the united nations com missary represents value for m oney to staff in october 2004 unon hired m anager with com mercial expertise putting unon in position where it has the expertise to review whether it would be m ore cost effective for unon to play m ore significant role in running the united nations com missary this issue has been addressed in recom mendation 03 above and further action is proposed c policiesprocedures for operation and use of the united nations com missary 29 policies on use and operation of the united nations com missary have been drafted but have not been finalized or com municated to users and ffected parties this issue has been addressed in recom mendation 03 above and further action is proposed d monitoring operations of the united nations com missary 30 oios recom mended aa2000164002 that to ensure that the contractor operating the united nations com missary was delivering satis factory level of service unon should review and m ake recom mendations on pricing of goods profit m argins payable and arrangem ents for monitoring all aspects of contract perform ance this recom mendation has been closed on the basis of the inform ation provided below i initial pricing of com modities 31 initial pricing of commodities sold at the united nations com missary is dependent on percentage m arkup on the landing cost proceeds to the contractor ranging between 14 to 17 percent for various com modity groups the landing costs are dependent on origin quantity and shipping and handling the first two are left to the contractors expert judgem ent while shipping and handling were reviewed by unon in 2000 and the cheapest option determ ined for trial period of six m onths elim inating excessive costs ranging from us4000 to us10000 as consequence of the above unon explained that like com modities available in the local m arket could be cheaper or m ore expensive depending on origin and quantity these conditions appear never to have been revisited since 2000 and there has never been any consideration of clause in the contract that th contractor should guarantee to always sell at the same or lower price than can be obtained in the local m arket place 32 unon commented that it has already put in place procedures to ensure monthly price comparisons are conducted as part of the key performance measures the operator has been asked to comply with as part of the recommendation to the local committee on contracts lcc to extend the contract of the existing contractor in march 2005 very clear set of nine key performance measures kpms were identified the second kpm 332 clearly stated that there would be an ongoing focus on price through extensive surveys and price comparisons of the local market the operator has conducted regular price surveys through external data collection companies and unon has also now agreed as part of this kpm that the operator will conduct formal trolley for trolley comparison once month starting february 2006 to prove that on average for monthly shop covering approximately 50 purchased items the commissary is consistently about 30 cheaper than the local market leader unon would also like to explain that volume advantage to local supermarkets must also be taken into account this sometimes erodes the taxfree differential oios thanks page 6 unon for the clarification and will close the recom mendation aa2000164002 ii shelf pricing of com modities 33 shelf pricing of com modities sold at the united nations com missary is dependent on the five percent m arkup on the contractors retail price for luxury item s proceeds to cou oios established in its last audit aa2000164 that there was basis for the five percent m arkup and why it was only levied on luxury item s at the tim of this audit cou were still unable to link the overhead costs of cou to the percentage markup and this part of the old recom mendation is dealt with under the earlier section on percentage m arkup and recovery of overhead costs iii quality of com modities 34 in contrast to prior periods the audit noted an im provem ent in the quality of commodities sold at the united nations com missary f or exam ple the quality of sports wear and equipm ent is now com parable to the leading sports outlet in nairobi this is further reinforced by the introduction of perform ance m easures m entioned in paragraph 32 iv planning for sufficient supply of commodities 35 during the audit oios noted that popular commodities were bought at very high rate and replenishm ent of the sam com modity was only ffected after durations of between two weeks to four m onths f or exam ple janisberg wines 5 litre juices all chocolates and channel 5 perfum unon has put in place m easures to address this issue which are described in paragraph 32 above v financial monitoring 36 in the absence of autom ated system s in cou m onitoring im plem entation of the contract for the united nations com missary has proved to be difficult due to the absence of link to the contractors system s thereby only allowing for m anual checking of volum of transactions average of 1000 sales with daily value of approxim ately us12000 the presence of the contractor in the com pound and availability of all united nations com missary transactions provide good m onitoring environm ent which cou has not been able to take advantage of due to lack of resources required to conduct m anual checks oios is of the opinion that the proposed purchase of an integrated com mercial operations system in the 2006 will address this issue and further action is proposed entitlem ent and access to dutyfree com modities 37 the executive directors of unep and unhabitat have been delegated authority by the kenyan governm ent to issue regulations on reasonable quantities of agreed articles f or use by its staff and m embers of delegations unon being the adm inistering authority for this activity has issued regulations on allowed quantities f or different levels of staff as follows page 7 restrictions staff level approximate net salary per month us commissary value ceiling per month us salary portion allowed under ceiling spirits litres other alcoholic beverages litres tobacco assorted grams g1 g4 360 880 198 55 22 2 4 500 g5 g7 1100 1700 463 42 27 2 4 500 international gs 900 national offi cers and volunteers 2600 5200 1000 38 19 p1 p4 2900 5300

echanism to control abuse of privileges by suspension or complete withdrawal depending on severity the privilege scale has not been reviewed since 1992 and oios is of the opinion that the above table suggests that review is needed to better align privileges with salary levels as can be seen from the table above the allowance for g12 is around 50 percent of their take hom pay which increases the likelihood that purchase in this category m ay be for private sale rather than hom consum ption unon commented that the statistics above do not take into account the total disposable income at these grades since the majority of staff below the g3 level are in roles that include an overtime entitlement eg security officers and drivers which could be quite significant in relation to the their actual income unon believes that the problem is in the area of the table marked unlimited and proposes to look further into whether limits should be placed on all levels oios thanks unon for the clarification and agrees with the proposal to look into placing lim it on all categories of staff recommendation ¾ to strengthen unons m echanism for control of abuse of dutyfree privileges unon should develop branding m echanism to identify commodities sold at the united nations com missary f rom those available in the local m arket rec 04 39 unon commented that it accepts this recommendation which will form part of the contract negotiated for the new commissary estimated implementation date mid 2007 oios notes the response and will close the recom mendation upon receipt of details of branding m echanism to identif com modities sold at the united nations com missary f rom those available in the local market c united nations petrol station rationale and design for the united nations petrol station 40 as result of fuel shortages experienced during the gulf w ar in 1991 the united nations in nairobi decided to establish petrol station to cater for em ergencies operation of the united nations petrol station com menced in 1995 and cater ed for united nations official vehicles and staff vehicles with diplom atic num ber plates because of problem s experienced in use of commercial petrol stations the ministry of fo reign affairs in 1998 directed all em bassies page 8 high com missions and international organizations to purchase dutyfree fuel from the united nations petrol station the need for the united nations to m aintain its own petrol station to cope with em ergencies rem ains however the increase in num ber of united nations and diplom atic staff and the growth of reliable sources of petrol nationwide such as shell ltd with 131 service stations and kenolkobil ltd with 185 service stations nationwide has not resulted in any review of whether usage of the united nations petrol station could be supplem ented by use of com mercial petrol stations nationwide using som form of an enhancem ent of the existing electronic card system 41 unon commented that the current political sit uation in kenya does not warrant the use of the fuel station just to deal with emergencies currently the primary use of the petrol station is the supply of the duty free fuel to those so entitled the current host country agreement places limit on the amount of duty free fuel that can be purchased and unon sees value in opening this discussion the kenyan government does not currently require local fuel stations to provide the facility to diplomats or united nations staff to purchase fuel at duty paid prices and then receive receipt identifying excise duties to allow for individual claims the kenyan government asked unon to provide solution to duty exempt customers through supply of duty free fuel through the unon fuel station unon believes it has demonstrated willingness to comply with this and by doing so is able to provide beneficial service to both united nations staff and also to the wider diplomatic community oios thanks unon for the clarification and proposes further action beyond requesting that this issue be kept under review and discussed at the host country liaison com mittee should need to revise this situation occur b policiesprocedures on use and operati on of the united nations petrol station 42 policies on use and operation of the united nations petrol station have been drafted but have not been finalized or com municated to users and affected parties oios was inform ed that they would be issued march 2006 and therefore oios proposes further action c monitoring operations of the united nations petrol station 43 oios recom mended aa1999503001 that the coab in consultation with unon should docum ent what costs should com prise the operational costs of the cou and determ ine what percentage m ark up is required to cove r these costs and aa1999503002 develop policy on any additional percentage m ark up above that required to cover operational costs unon explained that the recom mendation had not been im plem ented because of the following i initial pricing of fuel 44 initial pricing of fuel sold at the united nations petrol station is dependent on m arkup on the landing cost proceeds to the contractor of ksh 375 us004 per litre of diesel m arkup was reduced to 275 for one m onth only in october when the high price of diesel m ade it alm ost impossible to sell at the unon fuel station nd ksh 395 us005 per litre of petrol these markups have however not been docum ented in the contract docum ent between unon and the contractor and cou does not know how these figur were arrived at or whether they were reasonable unon commented that unon considers the current markups of 375 and 395 kenya shillings per litre of diesel and petrol respectively as reasonable this is the status now and has been for the past many years unon will ensure that any change in the markup is reflected in an amendment to the current contract oios thanks unon for the clarification and has closed recom mendation aa1999503001 page 9 ii dispensing price of fuel 45 dispensing price of fuel sold at the united nations petrol station was dependent on cous markup on the contractors retail price cou in october 2005 revised the 25 percent m arkup ksh 1372 previously applied to fixed rate of ksh 800 approxim ately us01 per litre despite the reduction the m arket rate for diesel duty paid in october 2005 was ksh 6349 whereas it sold for ksh 6240 at the united nations petrol station as result and in contrast to petrol there was hardly any price difference between duty free sold at the united nations petrol station and duty paid diesel sold at any other petrol station which defeats the purpose of granting tax free privileges to the united nations and its staff m embers oios established in its last audit aa1999503 that there was basis for the initial m arkup which was m ore than sufficient to cover the operational and adm inistrative costs of cou at the tim of this audit cou were still unable to link the overhead costs of cou to the m arkup and this part of the old recom mendation is dealt with under the earlier section on percentage m ark up iii financial monitoring 46 at the tim
