questions relevant to federal policymaking these include how msis are defined the role they play in educating minority students the diversity within and among msis their geographic distributi on and the racial ethnic and income characteristics of their students this re port will be updated as warranted by major legislative or other re levant developments for the purposes of this analysis msis

targeted to these institutions undergraduate enrollment is at least 20 alaska native or 10 native hawaiian some institutions are in more than one msi group certain institutional and student characteristics are shared by many msis yet there is substantial diversity among these institutions significant portion of msis in the aggregate are twoyear public institutions 41 yet nearly all hbcus are fouryear institutions 87 most msis are small often enrolling fewer than 1000 students yet 10 of hsis enroll 20000 or more students msis are located primarily in the southern and coastal states many in areas with high concentrations of particular racialethnic groups though most states have msis few have none the total students in each group of msis differs markedly some 13000 undergraduates are in annhis but over 2 million are in mmis students in msis are predominantly from minority backgr ounds ranging from about 60 to over 80 of undergraduate enrollment msis play an important role in educating minority students often accounting for large shares of students from different minority groups msis in the aggregate enroll 61 of ll hispanic undergradua tes nevertheless with the exception of hispanic students the majority of students from individual minority groups do not attend msis large pe rcentages of students at some msis are low income msis account for significant shares of all undergraduate degrees awarded to minorities particularly for hispanics hsis award more than 40 of hispanic bachelors degrees the relative distribution of fields in which these degrees are awarded does

for additional information regarding federal funding for minorityserving institutions see crs report rl32396 federal funding for minorityserving institutions of higher education by charmaine jackson 3 relevant hea programs include institutional aid title iii developing ins titutions title v and minority science and engineering improvement program title iii these are all administered by the department of educa tion among relevant programs administered outside of the department of education are the educational partnership program with minority serving institutions department of commerce and the minority university research and education program nationa l aeronautics and space administrationminorityserving higher education institutions analysis of selected institutional and student characteristics introduction federal education policy recogniz different groups of minority1serving institutions msis of higher education and targets financial resources to them2 as the congress considers the reauthorization of the higher education act hea it will be deliberating on key programs directing aid to these institutions3 better understanding of the diversity and range of attributes of the various groups of institutions that are often collectively described as msis may assist in this federal policymaking process this report analyzes selected characteristics of the institutions and students making up five separate ms i groups of institutions ma jorityminority institutions mmis historically black colleges and universities hbcus hispanicserving institutions hsis alaska native and native hawaiianserving institutions annhis and tribal colleges and univers ities tcus the definition of each of these groups of institutions is provided below data on msis in the aggregate are also analyzed informing federal policy the msis analyzed here are tied directly to current federal programs and provisions see following section this analysis will help address number of basic background questions relevant to federa l policymaking for msis among these questions are the followinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32674crs2 how are msis defined and what are the implications of those definitions what role do msis play in educa ting minority students particularly with regard to number and propor tion of minority students served how different or similar are the several groups of msis how do they differ within groups across groups and from postsecondary education institutions in general how many and what types of degrees do msis award do theyaward the full range of postsecondary degrees how widely distributed are msis across the country are therestates with direct ties to msis what are the racial ethnic and income characteristics of studentsserved by these schools the answers that emerge from this analysis may assist in deliberation on federal policies and support for these institutions pr imarily because they help paint more complete picture of the msis consider for example the two primary and different ways in which the federal g overnment has defined msis by the historical role they have played in educating minority popula tions eg hbcus or by the current composition of their student body eg hs is these two approaches may have some effect on the reach of these msis among all minority students it may not be surprising that hsis identified by the current level of their hispanic enrollment serve majority of all hispanic undergra duates in contrast as shown in this analysis majority of all other minority undergraduates are being educated outside of the msis as another example it may be important for policy purposes to understand that while the msis share some common characteristics eg most are twoyear institutions there is significant divers ity within and across msi groups eg over 80 of hbcus are fouryear institutions policymaking premised solely on basic similarities among all msis may be less effective than efforts that also recognize diversity across these institutions finally there are limitations to the present analysis with regard to federal policymaking this report addresses selected characteristics of the msis it is beyond its scope to address wider range of issues that are potentially relevant to federal policymaking possible issues include the effectiveness of msis in educating minority students the impact of federa l support on these institutions and the education of minority students in general defining the groups this section defines the groups of minorityserving ins titutions that are included in the analyses presented in this report although the groups of msis are distinct membership is not exclusive as result single institution can be classified in more than one group to large extent all msi groupings were constructed based upon definitions found in the hea specifically titles iii and v as result all of the institutions examined in this report msis and comparison group of institutions are degreegranting twoyear and fouryear institutions that are either public or private nonprofit proprieta ry institutions are not eligib to participate in heahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32674crs3 4 for additional information regarding title iii eligible institutions see crs report rl31647 reauthorization of title iii and title v of the higher education act issues for the 108th congress by charmaine jackson 5 this additional requirement which is not specified in title iii or t itle v is intended to limit institutions to those meeting broader rray of eligibility requirements that are shared across these hea titles eg being accredited this has very small impact on only some msi groups and on the comparison group to be eligible for title iv student assistance postsecondary institution must be licensed or otherwise legally authorized to provide postsecondary education in the state in whic h it is located be accredited by an agency recognized for that purpose by the secretary of education and be deemed eligible and certified to participate in federal student aid programs by the department of education for additional information on institu tional eligibility for title iv student aid see crs report rl31926 institutional eligibility for pa rticipation in title iv student aid programs under the higher education act background and issues by rebecca r skinner 6 unlike the mseip the definition of mmi used in this analysis includes asian americans mseip does not include asian americans in its definition of minority students 7 using the title iii part b eligib ility criteria to select instituti ons for inclusion in the hbcu category produces group that is slightly di fferent from some other listings of hbcus specifically both mary holmes college m s and morris brown college ga are ineligible to receive title iii aid due to their loss of accreditati on thus they are excluded from this analysis in addition title iii part b section 326 provides grants to 18 selected institutions based on their contribution to certain professional fields charles drew university of medicine and science ca is included in this analysis because it is one of the 18 designated institutions although not always included in listings of hbcus finally continuedtitle iii and v and hence none could be considered to be msis for this analysis4 they are also excluded from the comparis on group of schools see below to allow for more accurate comparison with msis the msis and the institutions included in the comparison group are limited further to those that also meet the eligibility criteria for participation in the student aid programs under title iv of the hea5 majorityminority institutions mmis are identified by the percentage of an institutions student body that can be identified as racial or ethnic minority specifically mmis are those institutions whose enrollment of single minority or combination of minorities exceeds 50 of the total student enrollment this follows the heas minority science nd engineering improvement program mseip definition for minorityserving institution6 for the purposes of this analysis each institutions nority enrollment percentage was calculated by dividing the reported racialethnic nority student population by th total student enrollment resulting in 474 institutions being defined as mmis historically black colleges and universities institutions are classified as hbcus if they are eligible to receive grant under title iii part b of the hea to qualify for grant under title iii part b of the hea an ins titution must have been established prior to 1964 and have as its principal mission the education of african americans this is an hist orical designation not one pr edicated on the current racial composition of the institutions as result several hbcus are majority white in terms of enrollment there are 102 ins titutions classified as hbcus for this analysis7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32674crs4 7 continued although hinds community college ms is incl uded in this analysis the enrollment figures are not limited to the utica campus which is the designated hbcu hinds reports enrollment figures to the department of

eligible institutions must have low educational and general expend itures eg requisite enrollment of needy students be legally authorized within its re spective state to award bachelors degrees or be

analysis was limited to institutions with these characteristics to allow for an accurate comparison between groups there are 3407 postsecondary education institutions included in this analysis this universe of postsecondary institutions also includes any institution that is included in any of the msi categories previously outlined data the data presented in this report are derived primarily from ipeds ipeds is series of surveys of postsecondary educa tion institutions that gather information on such variables as location institutional control types of degrees awarded the number and minority

ipeds data used for this analysis come from surveys of this universe of postsecondary education institutions and are not derived from survey samples12 nevertheless some of the data reported in ipeds have been imputed by ed to compensate for missing or rroneous data thus all values presented in this report should be interpreted as estimates the da ta on instituti onal characteristics including student enrollment are for fall 2001 while that for degrees completed apply to academic year 20012002 the raceethnicity categories used in this analysis are derived from ipeds currently ipeds uses five basic racialethnicity categories american indian or alaskan native asian or paci fic islander black not of hispanic origin hispanic and white not of hispanic origin th categories do not disaggregate data for american indian alaskan native asian or pacific islander separately as result the student data presented in this report may differ somewhat from the

educations integrated postseco ndary education data system conclusion minorityserving institutions play special role in the education of minority and lowincome students this group of ins titutions nnually receives significant amount of federal funding to pursue thei r educational mission and educate minority students the preceding analysis reveals that th ere are some institutional and student characteristics shared by many of the groups of msis considered in this report at the same time it shows that there is dive rsity among these groups of institutions both findings are potentially important for federal policymaking in this area in general msis are disp roportionately twoyear public institutions yet this attribute does not characterize all msi groups nearly all hbcus are fouryear public or private schools most msis ar likely to be small institutions often enrolling fewer than 1000 students though some are large enrolling 20000 or more students msis are concentrated in certain regions with large majority of the institutions located in areas where high concentrations of particular racialethnic group reside most states have one or more msis within their borders although several have none not unexpectedly students in msis are predominantly from minority backgrounds the proportion of undergradua tes in these schools who come from minority backgrounds ranges from about 60 to in excess of 80 msis play significant role in educating minority students often accounting for substantial shares of all postsecondary student s from minority backgrounds nevertheless with the exception of hispanic students the ma jority of undergraduate students from individual minority groups do not attend msishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32674crs22 substantial shares of undergraduate enrollment in msis are likely to be composed of lowincome students for so groups of msis this lowincome share of undergraduate enrollment is significantly higher than the comparable share of all undergraduates at title iv pseis in gene ral more than 45 of undergraduates at hbcus received pell grant compared to 19 of undergraduates at all title iv pseis analyzed as noted most msis primarily award undergraduate degrees as their highest degree these degrees represent significan t shares of all degrees awarded to minority undergraduates particul arly for hispanic degree recipi ents the relative distribution of fields in which these degrees are awar ded does not differ for most groups of msis in comparison to the distribution of unde rgraduate degrees for all title iv pseis included in this analysis
