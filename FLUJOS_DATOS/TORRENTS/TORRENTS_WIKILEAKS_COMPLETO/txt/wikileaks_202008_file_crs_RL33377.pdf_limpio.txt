than 30 types of organizations that qualify for exemption from the federal income tax each type is described in particular section or subsection of the internal revenue code irc the organizational definition in that section or subsection determines the extent to which the organization may participate in political activity including lobbying and campaign intervention the majority of taxexempt organizations are described in irc 501c3 which describes public charities and private foundations irc 501c4 which describes social welfare organizations irc 501c5 which describes labor unions irc 501c6 which describes trade associations and irc 527 which describes political organizations these organizations receive the most attention with respect to their political activities in general the basic parameters of these organizations ability to participate in political activity is understood from the irc treasury regulations and irs guid ance with respect to the other types of tax exempt organizations the irc restrictions on their political activities are less clear and there is almost irs guidance to help clarify the situation the lack of guidance is not unexpected because it does not appear that these other organizations participate in significant amount of political activity this report discusses the irc limitations on political activity by irc 501c3 organizations 501c4 c5 and c6 organizations 527 organizations and the other types of taxexempt organizations it ends with summary of the irc reporting and disclosure requirements although this report discusses the political activity limitations in the irc it is important to realize that organizations must abide by any applicable election laws for example since campaign finance laws ban corporations from making any contribution or expenditure in connection with federal elections an incorporated taxexempt organization is generally prohibited from doing so 1 for more information on campaign finance laws see crs report rs21571 campaign finance and prohibiting contributions by taxexempt corporations fec v beaumont by l paige whitaker for more information on irc 527 organizations beyond that contained in this report see crs report rl33888 section 527 political organizations 1 under 11 cfr 11410 qualifying incorporated irc 501c4 organizations may make independent expenditures expenditures that expressly advocate for candidate but are made without the candidates cooperation and electioneering communications broadcast cable or sate llite advertisements that refer to clearlyidentified federal candidate within sixty days of general election or thirty days of primary election and if house or senate election are targeted to the relevant electorate among other things the organization must have the promotion of political ideas as its sole express purpose this exception reflects the supreme courts decision in federal election commission v mass citizens for life inc 479 us 238 1986 in which the court held that limits on electionrelated independent spending by certain incorporated advocacy gr oups were unconstitutional b ecause the government had failed to show compelling reason for infringing on the groups free speech rights the court stated that while the government may have compelling corruptionrelated interest in restricting the independent spending of incorporated businesses it had not shown that similar interest existed for treating incorporated nonprofit organizations differently than other nonprofit organizations id at 26364

section describes these organizations as organized and operated exclusively for religious charitable scientific testing for public safety literary or educational purposes or to foster national or international amateur sports competition but only if part of its activities involve the provision of athletic facilities or equipment or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual substantial part of the activities of which is carrying on propaganda or otherwise attempting to influence legislation except as otherwise provided in subsection h and which does not participate in or intervene in including the publishing or distributing of statements any political campaign on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office 2 there are two types of irc 501c3 organizations public charities and private foundations public charities receive contributions from variety of sources whereas private foundations receive contributions from limited sources due to fear of abuse private foundations are subject to stricter regulation than public charities this includes additional restrictions on their political activities as discussed below examples of public charities include the red cross churches schools hospitals boy scouts girl scouts animal shelters and little league examples of private foundations include the john d and catherine t macarthur foundation the ford foundation and the mars foundation

the organizational definition in irc 501c3 restricts the ability of these organizations to participate in political activity in two ways 1 they may only conduct an insubstantial amount of lobbying and 2 they may not intervene in political campaigns organizations that violate either restriction may lose their taxexempt status and the eligibility to receive deductible contributions additionally the organization may either in addition or as an alternative to the loss of taxexempt status be required to pay an excise tax on its political or lobbying expenditures be enjoined from making further expenditures and receive termination assessment of all taxes owed the lobbying restriction and political campaign prohibition are discussed in detail below

the lobbying limitation was enacted in 1934 and the political campaign prohibition was enacted in 1954 the legislative history of both provisions is sparse 2 irc 501h provides test for measuring the amount of lobbying done by an organization it is discussed below

organizations formed to disseminate controversial or partisan propaganda were not educational for purposes of qualifying for tax exempt status under the precursors to irc 501c33 one consequence of this rule was that contributions to these organizations were not deductible several lawsuits were brought that challenged this treatment but clear standard emerged from the court decisionssome courts denied the deduction if the organization advocated for any type of change whereas others looked at factors such as how controversial the advocacy was or if the organizations actions were intended to influence legislation4 in what is generally recognized as the seminal case slee v commissioner 5 the us court of appeals for the second circuit used another rationale in that decision the court held that contributions to an organization were not deductible because it did not appear that the lobbying was limited to causes that furthered the organizations charitable purpose 6 with this background congress enacted the lobbying limitation as part of the revenue act of 1934 there is very little legislative history for the provision but it appears that congress was concerned with organizations that lobby also being able to receive taxdeductible contributions7 while discussing the provision on the senate floor one member complained about the deductibility of donations that were made for selfish reasons and specifically mentioned an organization with which he was apparently having problems8 although this member apparently believed the provision was too broad in that it applied to organizations without selfish motives9 other members argued that all contributions to organizations that lobby should be nondeductible because of the difficulty in trying to distinguish between organizations that deserve the benefit and those that do not10 it has also been suggested that congress enacted the provision in order to codify the slee decision11 although this may be true it should be noted that the slee test and the lobbying provision are not identical this is because the focus of the test under slee is whether the lobbying furthers the organizations taxexempt purpose whereas the focus of the lobbying provision is whether the lobbying is substantial part of the organizations activities the 1934 act had also included provision that would have restricted the ability of charities to participate in partisan politics however that limitation was removed in conference apparently because of concerns it was too broad 12 3 treas reg 45 art 517 1919 4 for discussion of the

mischaracterized the lobbying limitation by saying that organizations that lobbied were denied taxexempt status as opposed to only those organizations that substantially lobbied13 the legislative history contains further discussion of the prohibition including whether senator johnsons overlybroad description of the lobbying provision and inaccurate analogy were noticed although senator johnsons motives behind the provision are not clear from the legislative history it has been suggested that he proposed it either as way to get back at an organization that had supported an opponent or because he wished to offer an alternative to another senators proposal that would have deni ed taxexempt status to organizations making grants to organizations or individuals that were deemed to be subversive 14 g14g152g139g139g162g146g151g144g561g139g162g561g11g20g5g561g535g561g347g342g343g507g140g508 g507g345g508g561g17g155g144g138g151g146g163g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 the organizational

against the limits in irc 4911 some irc 501c3 organizations including churches and private foundations are not allowed to make the election 24 the irc 501h election has two effects first it imposes an excise tax on organizations whose lobbying expenditures exceed the limits in irc 4911 irc 4911 sets limits for total lobbying expenditures and for grass roots expenditures in order not to be taxed for excessive lobbying an organization may not spend more than 20 of its first 500000 of expenditures on lobbying nor more than 15 of its second 500000 of expenditures nor more than 10 of its third 500000 of expenditures nor more than 5 of its remaining expenditures and more than 1 million on lobbying in the year in order not to be taxed for excessive grass roots lobbying the organization may not spend more than 5 of its first 500000 of expenditures on grass roots lobbying nor more than 375 of its second 500000 of expenditures nor more than 25 of its third 500000 of expenditures nor more than 125 of its remaining expenditures and more than 250000 on grass roots lobbying in the year if an organizations lobbying expenditures exceed these limits irc 4911 imposes an excise tax equal to 25 of the excess second the irc 501h election provides safe harbor so that organizations that do not exceed that amount will not lose their irc 501c3 status due to substantial lobbying specifically an organization will not lose its exempt status so long as its lobbying expenditures do not exceed 150 of the irc 4911 limitations over four year period thus depending on its activities in prior years an organization could conduct lobbying in the current year that is significant enough to be subject to tax but not lose its taxexempt status nonelecting organizations for organizations that do not make

test and the percentage of expenditures spent on lobbying is not determinative26 rather the determination is made by examining the lobbying in the broad context of the organizations purpose and activities which requires looking at such things as how important lobbying is to the organizations purpose the amount of time devoted to lobbying as compared with other activities and the extent to which the organization is continuously involved in lobbying27 unlike electing organizations nonelecting public charities are only subject to an excise tax on their lobbying expenditures if they lose their exempt status because of substantial lobbying28 the tax equals 5 of the organizations lobbying expenditures and the same tax may also be imposed on the organizations manager some organizations including churches are not subject to the tax private foundations on the other hand must generally pay an excise tax on any lobbying expenditures they make29 thus although private foundations may conduct an insubstantial amount of lobbying there is disincentive for them to do so the tax equals 10 of the expenditures note that unlike the case with electing public charities any amount spent by the private foundation on lobbying is subject to tax additionally foundation manager who agrees to the expenditure may individually be subject to tax equal to 25 of the expenditure limited to 5000 if the foundation fails to timely correct the expenditure it is subject to an additional tax equal to 100 of the expenditure and the manager may be subject to an additional tax equal to 50 of the expenditure limited to 10000

in 1983 the supreme court ruled in regan v taxation with representation of washington that the lobbying limitation is constitutional30 in that case the irs denied the application of taxation with

speech under the first amendment the group also argued that it was being denied equal protection under the fifth amendment because irc 501c19 veterans organizations were allowed to lobby substantially and still qualify for taxexempt status and to receive taxdeductible contributions the supreme court rejected both claims with re spect to the first amendment the court found that congress had not prevented twr from speaking but had simply chosen not to subsidize it by means of the tax exemption and taxdeductible contributions31 the court also noted that twr could qualify for exemption under

decide not to extend the taxpayerfunded benefit of unlimited lobbying to charities because of concerns they may lobby for their members benefit 34 the court also stated that distinguishing charities

the organizational definition in irc 501c3 prohibits these organizations from participating in or intervening in including the publishing or distributing of statements any political campaign on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office the irc does not further elaborate on the prohibition treasury regulations define candidate as an individual who offers himself or is proposed by others as contestant for an elective public office whether such office be national state or local 36 as to what types of activities are prohibited the regulations add little besides specifying that they include the publication or distribution of written or printed statements or the making of oral statements on behalf of or in opposition to such candidate 37 thus the statute and regulations do not offer much insight as to what activities are prohibited clearly irc 501c3 organizations may not do such things as make statements that endorse or oppose candidate publish or distribute campaign literature or make any type of contribution monetary or otherwise to political campaign on the other hand irc 501c3 organizations are allowed to conduct activities that are not related to elections such as issue advocacy lobbying for or against legislation and supporting or opposing the appointment of individuals to nonelective offices additionally irc 501c3 organizations are allowed to conduct certain electionrelated activities so long as the activities are nonpartisan and do not indicate preference for any candidate whether such an activity is campaign intervention depends on the facts and

bias and the determination will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of each case for example guide could display bias by not including all candidates on an equal basis another way guide could be biased is by rating candidates such as evaluating candidates and supporting slate of the bestqualified candidates even if the criteria are nonpartisan eg based on professional qualifications38 voter guide could also indicate bias by comparing the organizations position on issues with those of the candidates39 more subtle way in which guide may show bias is by only covering issues that are important to the organization as opposed to covering range of issues of interest to the general public40 some guides consist of candidate responses to questions provided by the organization according to the irs factors that tend to show these guides are candidateneutral include the questions and descriptions of the issues are clear and unbiased the questions provided to the candidates are identical to those included in the guide the candidates answers have not been edited the guide puts the questions and appropriate answers in close proximity to each other the candidates are given reasonable amount of time to respond to the questions and if the candidates are given limited choices for an answer to question eg yesno supportoppose they are given reasonable opportunity to explain their positions41 it is important to realize that the above two graphs are just examples of how guide could be biased the determination of whether guide is campaign intervention depends on the facts and circumstances of that case thus it is possible that guide that is neutral according to the above paragraphs could still be treated as campaign intervention because it indicates preference for candidate in some other way on the other hand guide is not necessarily biased just because it has or lacks characteristic from the above examples other factors that may be important in specific factual situation include the timing of the guides distribution and to whom it is distributed for example the irs ruled that an irc 501c3 organization could include in the edition of its monthly newsletter after the close of each congress compilation of the members voting records on issues important to the organization and the organizations position on those issues 42 the newsletter was sent to the usual small number of subscribers and not targeted to areas where elections are occurring in this specific situation the irs stated that the publication was permissible because it was not timed to an election or broadly distributed 38 see rev rul 6771 19671 cb 125 39 see irs fs200617 february 2006 40 see rev rul 78248 19781 cb 154 41 see irs fs200617 february 2006 rev rul 78248

activities may not indicate preference for any candidate or party according to the irs factors that may indicate these activities are neutral include candidates are named or depicted on an equal basis political party is named except for purposes of identifying the party affiliation of each candidate the activity is limited to urging acts such as voting and registering and to describing the hours and places of registration and voting and all registration and getoutthevote drive services are made available without regard to the voters political preference48

of lobbying an organization may do because there is rule that political campaign activity only occurs when an organization expressly advocates for or against candidate 49 the line between issue advocacy and political campaign activity can be difficult to discern according to the irs key factors that indicate an issue advocacy communication is not political campaign intervention include the communication does not identify any candidates for given public office note that candidates may be identified by means other than their name eg by party affiliation or distinctive features of candidates platform the communication does not express approval or disapproval for any candidates positions andor actions the communication is not delivered close in time to an election the communication does not refer to voting or an election the issue addressed in the communication has not been raised as an issue distinguishing the candidates the communication is part of an ongoing series by the organization on the same issue and the series is not timed to an election and the communications timing and identification of the candidate are related to nonelectoral event eg scheduled vote on specific legislation by an officeholder who also happens to be candidate for public office50 47 see rev rul 200741 200725 irb 1421 48 see 2002 eo cpe t ext supra footnote 14 at 379 49 see rev

organizations whose primary purpose is influencing elections the irs did not generally require these organizations to file tax returns apparently because the irs treated contributions to political organizations as nontaxable gifts68 by the early 1970s it became apparent that these organizations had sources of income besides contributions such as investment income and gain from the sale of donated appreciated property in 1973 the irs announced it would begin requiring political committees and parties with investment and other types of income to file tax returns and pay tax 69 congress responded in 1975 by enacting irc 52770 which generally grants taxexempt status to political organizations as discussed below the 1975 version of the section is similar to the version that currently exists with the exception of the reporting requirements added in 2000 prior to the 2000 amendments irc 527 organizations only had contact with the irs if they were required to file tax return because they had taxable income the lack of reporting requirements may have been because political organizations were generally thought to be candidate funds and political parties and committees ie the same types of entities that when involved in federal elections are regulated by the federal election campaign act of 1971 feca and required to report to the federal election commission fec by 2000 as an increasing number of groups known as stealth pacs spent money on elections it became clear that not all irc 527 political organizations were being regulated under feca stealth pacs were organizations designed to qualify as political organizations under irc 527 without having to report under feca to the fec it appears the reason these organizations began growing in number during the late 1990s was because the fact that organizations could qualify under irc 527 without reporting to the fec was largely unnoticed until 1996 which was when the irs began issuing guidance on the types of activities that qualify as irc 527 exempt functions 71 in response to the issue of stealth pacs congress amended irc 527 in 2000 to generally require that most organizations that do not report to the fec report to the irs and that the information be available to the public72 in 2002 congress made changes to some of these provisions in order to among other things remove duplicative reporting requirements73

to be used for an exempt function75 if an organization spends more than an insubstantial amount on nonexempt function the organization will be subject to tax on the amount in the segregated fund76 there is definition of insubstantial although the irs has indicated that the determination is made using principles similar to those used in determining whether nonelecting public charity has violated the lobbying limitation discussed above77 thus although these organizations may conduct nonexempt function activities the activities may increase their tax liability

activity is less clear than it is for irc 501c3 501c4 501c5 501c6 and 527 organizations furthermore for most of these other organizations there is irs guidance on the topic this may be because the need for guidance has not arisen due to the fact that there are not as many of these organizations and they do not appear to participate in political activities to the same extent as irc 501c3 501c4 501c5 501c6 and 527 organizations these other types of organizations fall into three categories 1 those that appear to be prohibited from participating in most if not all types of political activity 2 those that may be able to participate in political activity but are limited in the amount they may spend and 3 those that appear to be treated like irc 501c4 c5 and c6 organizations the first category would appear to include taxex empt organizations that are trusts whose funds must be dedicated to their exempt purpose thes would include such trusts as irc 501c17 supplemental unemployment benefit trusts irc 501c21 black lung benefit trusts and irc 501c22 multiemployer pension plan trusts due to the restriction on what these organizations may use their funds for it appears these organizations are generally unable to participate in political activities it has been suggested that these organizations may lobby for limited purposes such as on legislation that affects their existence or status78 the first category also appears to include the organizations that the irs has indicated in unofficial guidance may not participate in political activities because the subparagraph in which they are described limits them to an exclusive purpose for example irc 501c2 title holding companies irc 501c20 group legal services plans79 it could be argued that this rationale is suspect because irc 501c3 requires those organizations be organized and operated exclusively for an exempt purpose but the irs has interpreted the term to mean primarily in this context 80 and they may participate in nonpartisan political activity nonetheless this rationale could prohibit irc 501c10 domestic fraternal societies for example from participating in political activities because their net earnings must be devoted exclusively to religious charitable scientific literary educational and fraternal purposes to the extent that any organizations are precluded from participating in political activities there could still be exceptions for such things as lobbying for legislation that affects the organizations existence or status 81 the second categoryorganizations that may be able to participate in political activities but are limited in how much they could spendcould include irc 528 homeowners associations irc 528 requires that at least 90 of the organizations expenditures be for the acquisition construction management maintenance and care of association property and in the case of time share association for activities provided to or on behalf of members of the association the third category consists of the organizations that appear to be treated in the same manner as irc 501c4 c5 and c6 organizations it appears that they would not be limited by the tax laws with respect to their ability to participate in lobbying and political campaign activity so long as such activity is consistent with the organizations taxexempt purpose these could 78 see webster abegg 6133rd tm

irc 527 exempt function include the absence of one or more of the above factors the communication identifies specific legislation or an event outside the organizations control that the organization hopes to influence the communications timing coincides with specific event outside the organizations control that it hopes to influence the candidate is identified solely as government official who is in position to act on the issue in connection with specific event eg will vote on the legislation and the candidate is identified solely in list of the legislations key sponsors 95 finally illegal activities are not exempt function activities96 thus the making of expenditures in violation of election laws is not an exempt function activity

g17g155g144g138g151g146g163g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 in general an irc 527 exempt function means the same thing with respect to irc 527 organizations and irc 501c organizations there are however several exceptions treasury regulations specify that there are several instances where an exempt function expenditure made by an irc 501c organization will not be subject to tax 97 these expenditures include those related to requested appearances before legislative body and those for nonpartisan activities furthermore the regulations state that two types of expenditures are taxable only to the extent provided in the regulations indirect expenses and certain expenditures that may be made by unions and trade associations under feca 98 although the regulations state that these indirect and fecaallowed expenses are taxable only to the extent provided in the regulations the treasury department has not yet promulgated regulations that state what that extent is until the regulations address the matter it appears these expenses are not for an exempt function99 g20g142g149g138g157g142g141g561g17g155g144g138g151g146g163g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 it is not uncommon to see related taxexempt organizations for example an irc 501c3 organization may be paired with an irc 501c4 social welfare organization or an irc 501c6 trade association it is not unusual for trade association such as the american bar 95 see id 96 see treas reg 15272c4 97 see treas reg 15276 98 although feca generally prohibits unions and corporations from making electionrelated expenditures feca does allow these organizations to make expenditures for internal communications with members stockholders and their families that support candidates conducting nonpartisan re gistration and getoutthevote campaigns

similarly named charitable foundation that conducts charitable activities it is also common to see group with need to lobby as well as conduct charitable activities set up both an irc 501c4 organization and an irc 501c3 organization the organizations must be legally separate entities and their activities and funds must be kept separate additionally as discussed above the irc enc ourages irc 501c organizations to set up separate segregated fund under irc 527 in order to avoid the tax on irc 527 exempt function expenditures incorporated taxexempt organizatio ns and irc 501c5 labor unions also have another reason to establish separate segregated fundas mentioned above federal election laws generally ban these entities from making contributions and expenditures in connection with federal elections any irc 501c organization that is prohibited from participating in political activities by the irc may not use an irc 527 organization to get around the prohibition 100 for example an irc 501c3 organization may not establish separated segregated fund to conduct electionrelated activities because that would be an indirect way for the irc 501c3 organization to participate in political campaign activity there are however several ways that an irc 501c3 organization may be connected to an irc 527 organization for example individuals involved in the irc 501c3 organization such as its directors or managers could establish an irc 527 organization separate from the irc 501c3 organization another possibility is if the irc 501c3 organization was established by or related to an organization that has also established an irc 527 organization in any of these situations it is imperative that the irc 501c3 organization be separately organized from the other organizations this means that all contributions collected by the irc 501c3 organization must be kept separate from other funds additionally if the irc 501c3 organization and other organizations share offices or staff the expenses must be allocated between the two organizations and adequa records must be kept in such situation the irc 501c3 organization must be careful not to make contribution to the irc 527 organization by for example paying expenses that should be allocated to it or providing unreimbursed services or supplies to it

internal revenue code generally does not require taxexempt organizations to report detailed information about their political activities nonetheless some types of information reported by irc 501c organizations may give an idea about the extent of the organizations political activities eg the total amount it spends on these activities these reporting and disclosure requirements are summarized below it is important to note that taxexempt organizations are subject to campaign finance laws and therefore may be required to report information to the fec many irc 527 organizations must report to the fec as political committees additionally organizations that make electioneering communications must file report with the fec electioneering communications are broadcast cable or satellite
