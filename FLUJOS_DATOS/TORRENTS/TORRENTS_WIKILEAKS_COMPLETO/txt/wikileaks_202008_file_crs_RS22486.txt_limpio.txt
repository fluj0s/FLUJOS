updated as warranted by events overview july 2005 joint statement resolved to establish usindia global partnership through increased cooperation on economic issues on energy and the environment on democracy and development on nonproliferation and security and on hightechnology and space us policy is to isolate iran and to ensure that its nuclear program is used for purely civilian purposes india has never shared us assessments of iran as an aggressive regional power indiairan relations have traditionally been positive and in january 2003 the two countries launched strategic partnership with the signing of the new delhi declaration and seven other substantive agreements1 indian leaders regularly speak of civilizational ties between the two countries reference to the interactions of persian and indus valley civilizations over period of millennia as us relations with india grow deeper and more expansive in the new century some in washington believe that new delhis friendship with tehran could become significant obstacle to further development of usindia ties however indiairan relations have not evolved into strategic alliance and are unlikely to derail the further development of usindia global partnership at the same time given clear indian interest in maintaining positive ties with iran especially in the area of energy commerce new delhi is unlikely to abandon its relationship with tehran or accept dictation on the topic from external powers 1 declaration text at httpmeaindianicindeclarestatement20030125jd1htm crs2 many in congress voice concern about indias relations with iran and their relevance to us interests some worry about new delhis defense relations with tehran and have sought to link this with congressional approval of usindia civil nuclear cooperation2 there are further us concerns that india plans to seek energy resources from iran thus benefitting financially country the united states seeks to isolate indian firms have in recent years taken longterm contracts for purchase of iranian gas and oil and india supports proposed construction of pipeline to deliver iranian natural gas to india through pakistan the bush administration expresses strong opposition to any pipeline projects involving iran but top indian officials insist the project is in indias national interest some analysts believe that geostrategic motives beyond energy security including great power aspirations drive indias pursuit of closer relations with iran3 of immediate interest to some member of congress are press reports on iranian naval ships visiting indias kochi port for training indian officials downplayed the significance of the port visit and secretary rice challenged the reports veracity although she did state that the united states has made very clear to india that we have concerns about their relationship with iran such concerns include the proposed gas pipeline secretary of energy sam bodman visiting new delhi in march 2007 reiterated us httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22486 opposition to the pipeline project4 strategicpolitical relations according to the 20062007 annual report of the indian ministry of external affairs indias relations with iran are underlined by historical civilizational and multifaceted ties the bilateral cooperation has acquired strategic dimension flourishing in the fields of energy trade and commerce information technology and transit during 200607 relations with iran were further strengthened through regular exchanges past reports have lauded further deepening and consolidation of indiairan ties with increased momentum of highlevel exchanges and institutional linkages between their national security councils iranian leaders always looking for new allies to thwart us 2 in april 2007 eight us senators sent letter to prime minister singh requesting that new delhi suspend its military cooperation with iran asserting that indias own interests are damaged by its support for the iranian military and that indias principles are also poorly served by deepening its military relationship with iran in may eight us representatives including the chair and ranking member of the house foreign affairs committee sent singh letter expressing grave concern at indias increasing cooperation with iran in july letter to president bush signed by 23 members of the house expressed concern with indias deepening militarytomilitary relationship with iran which places congressional approval of the agreement for nuclear cooperation in jeopardy 3 see for example c christine fair india and iran new

agence france presse march 23 2007 crs3 attempts to isolate iran reciprocate new delhis favorable view and insist that warming usindia relations will not weaken their own ties with new delhi5 however there are signs that following the 2005 launch of usindia global partnership and plans for bilateral civil nuclear cooperation new delhi intends to bring its iran policy into closer alignment with that of the united states yet india is home to sizeable constituency urging resistance to any us pressure that might inhibit new delhitehran relations or which prioritize relations with the united states in disregard of indias national interests while top indian leaders state that friendly new delhitehran ties will continue concurrent with or even despite growing usindia partnership some observers see such rhetoric as incompatible with recent developments6 indian policy toward irans nuclear program the indian government has made clear that it does not wish to see new nuclear weapons power in the region and in this context it has aligned itself with international efforts to bring irans controversial nuclear program into conformity with non proliferation treaty and iaea provisions at the same time new delhis traditional httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22486 status as leader of the nonaligned movement its friendly links with tehran and domestic constituency that includes tens of millions of shiite muslims have presented difficulties for indian policymakers there are also in new delhi influential leftist and opposition parties which maintain high sensitivity toward indications that india is being made junior partner of the united states these political forces have been critical of proposed usindia civil nuclear cooperation and regularly insist that indias closer relations with the united states should not come at the expense of positive ties with iran the current indian national congressled coalition government has thus sought to maintain careful balance between two sometimes conflicting policy objectives indias main opposition the bharatiya janata party has voiced its approval of the present governments policy toward irans nuclear program there were reports in 2005 that india would oppose bringing irans nuclear program before the security council and was likely to abstain on relevant iaea board votes7 however on september 24 2005 in what many saw as the first test of indias position new delhi did vote with the majority and the united states on an iaea resolution finding iran in noncompliance with its international obligations the vote brought waves of criticism from indian opposition parties and independent analysts who accused new delhi of betraying friendly country by capitulating to us pressure in january 2006 the us ambassador to india explicitly linked progress on proposed us india civil nuclear cooperation with indias upcoming iaea vote saying if india chose not to side with the united states he believed the usindia initiative would fail in the congress new delhi rejected any attempts to link the two issues and opposition and 5 iran sees good ties with india despite indiaus nuclear deal agence france presse march 30 2006 6

straining its friendship with us new york times september 15 2005 crs4 leftist indian political parties denounced the remarks yet on february 4 2006 india again voted with the majority in referring iran to the security council even as it insisted that its vote should not be interpreted as detracting from indias traditionally close relations with iran overt us pressure may have made it more difficult for new delhi to carry out the policy it had already chosen some independent observers saw indias iaea votes as demonstrating new delhis strategic choice to strengthen partnership with washington even at the cost of its friendship with tehran in july 2006 the house passed legislation hr 5682 to enable proposed us civil nuclear cooperation with india the bill contained nonbinding language on securing indias cooperation with us policy toward iran an amendment seeking to make such cooperation binding was defeated by vote of 235192 the senate version of enabling legislation s 3709 contained language on iran the resulting hyde act which became pl 109401 in december preserved the houses statement of policy language and added prerequisite that the president provide to congress inter alia description of indias efforts to participate in us efforts to prevent iran from obtaining weapons of mass destruction8 in their explanatory statement hrept 109721 congressional conferees called securing indias participation critical and they emphasized an httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22486 expectation of indias full cooperation on this matter weapons of mass destructionrelated relations in recent years there have been occasional revelations of indian transfers to iran of technology that could be useful for irans purported weapons of mass destruction wmd programs these transfers do not appear to be part of an indiangovernmentdirected policy of assisting irans wmd but could represent unauthorized scientific contacts that have resulted from growing indiairan energy and diplomatic ties some indian persons have been sanctioned by the bush administration under the iran nonproliferation act ina pl 106178 according to determinations published in the federal register in 2003 an indian chemical industry consultancy was sanctioned under the iraniraq arms nonproliferation act pl 102484 in september 2004 determination two indian nuclear scientists dr chaudhary surendar and dr ysr prasad were sanctioned under the ina the two formerly headed the nuclear power corp of india and allegedly passed to iran heavywater nuclear technology9 surendar denied ever visiting iran and sanctions against him were ended in december 2005 in that same december determination two indian chemical companies were sanctioned under the ina for transfers to iran in august 2006 the united states formally sanctioned two additional indian chemical firms under the ina for sensitive material transactions with iran the firms denied any wmd related transfers and new delhi later said the sanctions were not justified in february 2007 india moved to impose restrictions on nuclearrelated exports to iran in accordance with security council resolution 1737 of december 2006 8 pl 109401 requires the president to describe and assess for congress the specific measures that india has taken to fully and actively participate in us and international efforts to dissuade isolate and if necessary sanction and contain iran for its efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction see also crs report rl33016 us nuclear cooperation with india 9 john larkin and jay solomon indias ties with iran pose challenge for us wall street journal march 28 2005 crs5 defense and militarytomilitary relations india and iran have established steady but relatively low level defense and military relations since the formation of an indoiran joint commission in 1983 three years after the start of the iraniraq war there is evidence that india provided any significant military assistance to iran during that war which ended in 1988 iran reportedly received some military advice from pakistan during the conflict following the war iran began rebuilding its conventional arsenal with purchases of tanks combat aircraft and ships from russia and china major purchases from india were reported during this time however iran reportedly turned to india in 1993 to help develop batteries for the three kiloclass submarines iran had bought from russia the submarine batteries provided by the russians were not appropriate for the warm waters of the persian gulf and india had substantial experience operating kilos in warm water there have been expectations that iranindia military ties would further expand under the 2003 new delhi declaration in which the two countries decided to explore opportunities for cooperation in defense and agreed areas including training and exchange of visits10 some experts see this as part of broad strategic cooperation httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22486 between two powers in the persian gulf and arabian sea but the cooperation has generally stalled since it was signed and has not evolved into noteworthy strategic alliance instead the cooperation appears to represent manifestation of generally good indoiranian relations and an opportunity to mutually enhance their potential to project power in the region india had reportedly hoped the declaration would pave the way for indian sales to iran of upgrades of irans russianmade conventional weapons systems major new iranindia deals along these lines have not materialized to date but iran reportedly has sought indian advice on operating irans missile boats refitting irans t72 tanks and armored personnel carriers and upgrading irans mig29 fighters11 under the declaration the two countries have held some joint naval exercises most recently in march 2006 the first joint exercises were in march 2003 in march 2007 apparently at irans request the two countries formed joint working group to implement the 2003 accord which iran apparently feels has languished during visit of the commander of irans regular navy the first such high level exchange since 2003 india reportedly deferred specific iranian requests such as an exchange of warship engineers12 economic and energy relations indiairan commercial relations are dominated by indian imports of iranian crude oil which alone account for some 90 of all indian imports from iran each year the value of all indiairan trade in the fiscal year ending march 2007 topped 9 billion by 10 the state department was seen as complacent saying new delhi had reassured washington that the agreement doesnt involve military and technical assistance iranindia pact not security concern state department official says inside the

comparison usindia trade was valued at about 32 billion in 200613 iran possesses the worlds secondlargest natural gas reserves while india is among the worlds leading gas importers with rapidly growing economy india is building energy ties to iran some of which could conflict with us policy and the iran sanctions act isa isa requires certain sanctions on investments over 20 million in one year in irans energy sector under reportedly finalized 25year 22 billion deal the stateowned gas authority of india ltd gail is to buy 5 million tons of iranian liquified natural gas lng per year to implement the arrangement gail is to build an lng plant in iran which iran does not now have some versions of the deal include development by gail of irans south pars gas field which would clearly constitute an investment in irans energy sector india currently buys about 100000150000 barrels per day of iranian oil or some 75 of irans oil exports it is also widely reported that indian refineries supply large part of the refined gasoline that iran imports gasoline is heavily subsidized and sells for about 40 cents per gallon in iran and iranian refining capacity is insufficient to meet demand the purchase of iranian petroleum product is not generally considered an isa violation major aspect of the iranindia energy deals is the proposed construction of gas httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22486 pipeline from iran to india via pakistan with possible extension from pakistan to china some of the indian companies that reportedly might take part in the pipeline project are ongc gail indian oil corporation and bharat petroleum corporation14 iran india and pakistan have repeatedly reiterated their commitment to the 4 billion7 billion project which is tentatively scheduled to begin construction later in 2007 and be completed by 2010 pakistani president musharraf said in january 2006 that there is enough demand in pakistan to make the project feasible even if india declines to join it since january 2007 the three countries have agreed on various outstanding issues including pricing formula and the indian and pakistani split of the gas supplies but talks continue on several unresolved issues including the pipeline route security transportation tariffs and related issues during her march 2005 visit to asia secretary of state rice expressed us concern about the pipeline deal other us officials have called the project unacceptable but us official has directly stated that it would be considered violation of isa successive administrations have considered pipeline projects that include iran as meeting the definition of investment in isa cooperation on afghanistan india and iran are tacitly cooperating to secure their mutual interests in afghanistan iran has perceived the sunni islamic extremism of the taliban regime as threat to irans shiite sect india saw the taliban as manifestation of islamic extremism that india is battling in kashmir and which is held responsible for terrorist attacks in india india and iran both supported afghanistans minoritydominated northern alliance against the taliban during 19962001 in contrast to pakistan which supported the taliban both countries also seek to prevent taliban return to power and have each given substantial economic aid to the usbacked government in kabul indias presence in afghanistan is
