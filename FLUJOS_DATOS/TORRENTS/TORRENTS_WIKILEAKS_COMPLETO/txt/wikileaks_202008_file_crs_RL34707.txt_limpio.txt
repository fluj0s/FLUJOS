2008 d andrew austin analyst in economic policy government and finance division auction basics background for assessing proposed treasury purchases of mortgagebacked securities summary to address the turmoil in financial markets the emergency economic stabilization act eesa hr 1424 pl 110343 enacted on october 3 2008 authorizes purchases of troubled assets the act passed the senate on october 1 2008 passed the house on october 3 2008 and was signed into law the same day the administration proposed using reverse dutch auctions to purchase troubled assets primarily mortgagerelated securities from financial institutions in reverse dutch auctions buyer purchases multiple objects from private parties at price set by the last accepted bid the government has used reverse auctions since the revolutionary war designing efficient reverse dutch auctions may present some tradeoffs between enhancing competition among bidders and overpaying for assets relative to their quality careful auction design however can help minimize these problems auctions are especially useful for selling assets whose value to potential owners is unknown to the seller reverse auctions are useful when buyer does not know what value sellers place on assets auction results could clarify the market value of troubled assets the price discovery properties of auctions could stimulate trading by reducing private traders uncertainty about the value of troubled assets reverse auction program essentially swaps treasury securities for troubled mortgagebacked securities if treasury securities are exchanged for troubled assets at prices close to those assets current market prices costs to the taxpayer would be minimized financial institutions however may gain some liquidity but might not receive much additional capital some economists have argued that other means of injecting capital into the financial sector such as purchases of preferred stock or capital injections balanced by equity warrants ie options to claim an equity stake might be better strategy since passage of eesa the us treasury has been working to design methods to inject capital into firms and restore market liquidity the heterogeneity of troubled assets may present challenges to the treasury auction program the reverse dutch auctions would need to be adapted to buy highly diverse and relatively smallvolume securities in way that minimizes risks of trading manipulation reverse dutch auctions may be vulnerable to adverse selection meaning that the average credit quality of submitted assets of given type may be systematically worse than the average credit quality of all assets of that type auction mechanisms might be designed that could mitigate these problems recent academic research in auction theory and in experimental economics has examined how various types of auctions work auctions may capture higher revenues for governments and can often allocate scarce resources more efficiently than traditional methods of selling or purchasing different policy problems however call for different types of auctions government economists involved in designing reverse auctions to buy troubled assets have drawn

purchases of mortgage backed securities to address the turmoil in financial markets congress passed and the president signed the emergency economic stabilization act eesa hr 1424 pl 110343 on october 3 2008 the act authorizes the secretary of treasury to restore liquidity and stability to the financial system of the united states sec 2 by purchasing or insuring troubled assets the secretary will design the mechanism for purchasing the troubled assets and methods for pricing and valuing these assets the act broadly defines troubled assets as 1 mortgages and any securities based on such mortgages whose purchase the secretary determines will promote financial market stability and 2 any other financial instrument whose purchase the secretary and the federal reserve board chairman determines will promote financial market stability the act authorizes secretary paulson to use 700 billion to enhance liquidity and to inject capital into financial markets by purchasing 1 mortgages and pools of mortgages 2 preferred stock in ailing financial institutions and 3 troubled mortgagebacked securities mbss1 the secretary has indicated that reverse auctions will be used to purchase mortgagebacked securities from troubled financial institutions welldesigned auction could help determine the price and value of these assets in an efficient manner the act establishes congressional oversight panel to review the current state of financial markets the regulatory system and the administration of the troubled asset relief program tarp by the secretary this report provides congress with information on the uses design and functions of auctions it reviews some common types of auctions used by the federal government and some of the complexities of auction design that the secretary will have to deal with in the tarp 1 mbss are debt obligations representing claims to the cash flows principal and interest from pools of mortgages primarily on residential property the main use of mbss is to transform relatively illiquid financial assets mortgages owned by mortgage originators into liquid and tradable capital market instruments given the problems with the housing market and subprime mortgages it is difficult to know the true value of mbss consequently mbss have become illiquid crs2 dutch auctions and reverse dutch auctions the administration has proposed using reverse auctions to purchase mortgage related securities from financial institutions which are similar to the multipleunit dutch auctions that the treasury uses to sell government securities in reverse auction buyer accepts bids from multiple potential sellers in reverse multiunit dutch auctions buyer eg the us treasury buys given number of units from private parties eg financial institutions at price set by the last accepted bid2 figure 1 below contains hypothetical example of reverse dutch auction auctions provide means of selling objects whose value to potential owners is unknown to the seller many different auction mechanisms are in common use large research literature in economic theory and experimental economics examines how different types of auctions work on the one hand welldesigned auctions can provide an expeditious and efficient method for selling or acquiring objects on the other hand poorly designed auctions have caused governments to forego large amounts of revenue moreover poorly designed auctions may increase the likelihood that valuable resources are allocated to buyers who value those resources less than others source of inefficiency3 in particular auctions suitable for some applications may be unsuited for other applications the american government has used reverse auctions since robert morris who headed the treasury department used them to procure supplies for troops in the revolutionary war4 in recent decades the treasury department has used auctions to sell federal securities5 over time the federal government has gained valuable experience in conducting and designing auctions which has reduced costs and increased revenues compared to other methods 2 dutch auctions usually refer to fallingprice auctions which are described in more detail below the reverse multiunit sealedbid auction outlined by the treasury is strategically equivalent to certain fallingprice multiunit auction which is why the former is usually called dutch auction 3 paul klemperer using and abusing economic theory lessons from auction design journal of the european economic association 2003 available at httpwwwpaulklempererorg in some situations auction designers may face tradeoff between maximizing expected seller revenue and maximizing the likelihood that resources are allocated to those who value them the most 4 robert wright one nation under debt hamilton jefferson and the history of what we owe new york mcgrawhill 2008 p 61 5 various federal agencies have used different auction mechanisms for many years the department of interior has run auctions to distribute outer continental shelf ocs oil and gas leases since 1954 since 1994 the federal communications commission has used complex auction mechanisms to license slices of electromagnetic spectrum for use in wireless communications crs3 figure 1 hypothetical reverse dutch auction suppose government agency wished to purchase 1000 desktop computers of given specification potential sellers would submit sealed bids with price and number of units the agency would then sort bids by price in ascending order the agency would accept bids starting with the lower price and continuing until units offered in bids reached 1000 hypothetical bids are shown below bids for hypothetical government procurement reverse auction hypothetical firm bid price per unit number of units hang10 it 450 400 crash computers 470 500 macrohard inc 510 200 hal systems 525 300 the agency would accept the bid from hang10 it and buy 400 units because it had the lowest bid price although hang10 its bid price 450 would not be the purchase price the agency would also accept crash computers bid for 500 units because its bid price was the second lowest finally the agency would buy 100 computers from macrohard inc to reach the total of 1000 computers because macrohard was the last successful bidder all computers would be bought at unit price of 510 hal systems would sell computers to the agency some may wonder why the government agency would not force firms to sell computers at their bid prices which might seem to save the agency money such strategy would probably be unsuccessful in saving money because firms would change their bidding strategies if they knew that they would have to sell at their bid prices in particular sellers would tend to shade their bids upwards which might raise costs to the agency specific rules and operation details for reverse dutch auctions used by governments and private firms have varied some central banks use multipleprice or payyourbid auctions to sell securities others use uniformprice auctions and some have used both differences between multipleprice and uniform price auctions are discussed in more detail current us treasury auctions which use multiunit dutch auction mechanism to sell securities have apparently provided starting point for administration proposals to buy troubled assets via reverse dutch auctions because the reverse dutch auction process would in approximate mirror fashion resemble treasury auctions of government securities to primary dealers key market participants could quickly familiarize themselves with new bidding procedures those administering treasury reverse auctions however recognize that differences between treasury securities and troubled assets have consequences for auction design6 designing reverse dutch auctions may present some tradeoffs between enhancing competition among bidders and overpaying for assets relative to their quality careful auction design however can help minimize these problems 6 discussion with government official sept 26 2008 crs4 in the dutch auction mechanism used to sell us treasury securities all successful buyers pay the same price in other words it is uniformprice mechanism uniformprice mechanisms according to some experts may encourage more aggressive bidding which raises expected revenues7 while details of the treasury reverse dutch auctions remain unspecified the us treasury would probably announce that it wished to buy given amount of mortgagerelated securities mbss of specific types or issues for given auction bidders would then list securities they wish to sell and specify prices the treasury would then buy the securities listed at the lowest prices until the specified amount was reached the price offered by the last successful bidder would then be paid to all successful bidders quality differences of troubled assets presents challenges for auctions the diversity or heterogeneity of troubled assets may present challenges to the treasury auction program the mortgagebacked securitization process was intended to create marketable assets with credit characteristics that could be readily assessed by credit agencies and buyers credit rating agencies claimed that the rating process sorted assetbacked securities and other assets into categories with essentially homogenous profiles all assets of specific type receiving given rating were supposed to embody essentially similar risk characteristics confidence in the credit rating process has deteriorated over the past two years however credit rating agencies according to the securities and exchange commission sec struggled to keep up with more complex types of securities and had difficulty assessing risks embedded in subprime mortgagebacked assets in addition according to the sec none of the rating agencies examined had specific written procedures for rating residential mbss and collateralized debt obligations8 thus some buyers may doubt that credit ratings represent true gauge of asset quality tightened market liquidity in capital markets since august 2007 may stem in part from potential buyers uncertainty about the credit quality of mbss and other assets buyers may worry that sellers could have incentives to sell assets with difficulttodetect risks before assets without such hidden hazards similar problems may occur with reverse dutch auctions used to buy troubled assets typical treasury auction sells large volume of identical government securities whose characteristics are well understood the reverse dutch auctions used by the treasury would need to be adapted to buy highly diverse and relatively smallvolume securities whose characteristics may not be well understood by many 7 the us treasury has run multipleprice in which buyers pay their bids and uniform price auctions in the past in particular multipleprice auctions may be more susceptible to the winners curse which may cause bidders to shade their bids downwards the winners curse and other issues relating to differences between multipleprice and uniformprice auctions are discussed below 8 us securities and exchange commission summary report of issues identified in the commission staffs examinations of select credit rating agencies july 2008 crs5 buyers typical mortgagebacked security issue while enormous relative to single housing mortgage is small when compared to the size of typical treasury security issue and individual tranches slices of mbss are smaller still9 different mbss and related structured finance assets are very diverse although their structures and pricing follow some general principles10 thus selling treasury securities is like selling commodity steel buying mortgagebacked securities is like buying used cars if the treasury were to run large number of narrowly defined reverse auctions it would be more difficult to prevent certain types of market manipulation11 for example bidder who gains control of large proportion of an issue might exert influence on auction outcomes but if wider variety of securities or assets were allowed in the same auction which would sharpen competition sellers may have an incentive to submit bids for those assets with hidden flaws reverse dutch auctions may therefore be vulnerable to adverse selection meaning that the average credit quality of submitted assets of given type may be systematically worse than the average credit quality of all assets of that type in addition if assets submitted to an auction were on average worse than other assets of given type then auction prices might be biased downwards some empirical research has found that adverse selection problems can lower prices on ebay auctions12 if reverse auctions for troubled assets generated downwardly biased prices that could affect valuations of assets held by other firms through markto market accounting requirements thus downward bias in auction prices due to adverse selection could affect the market value or even solvency of some firms whether or not they participated in auctions moreover managing portfolio bought via reverse dutch auctions susceptible to adverse selection could present financial risks to the federal government while adverse selection could push prices down relative to prices appropriate for the average of all assets of given category the quality of assets accepted by the 9 most treasury issues are generally sized in the tens of billions of dollars range although cash management and other concerns may lead to smaller issues us department of treasury treasury bulletin various issues structured product issues ie asset or mortgagebacked securities or collateralized default obligations cdos are generally sized in the hundreds of millions of dollars range and are often divided into half dozen or so tranches tranche comes from the french verb tranchez meaning to slice or to carve 10 the bond market association and american securitization forum note that each product sector is distinct based on issuers investors origination servicing and collateral management trading and pricing systems and type and volume of available information these differences lead to distinct pricing and valuation conventions liquidity levels and risk exposures and sensitivities an analysis and description of pricing and information sources in the securitized and structured finance markets oct

electronic markets evidence from online stamp auctions journal of industrial economics vol 52 4 pp 497516 dec 2004 crs6 treasury through the reverse auction mechanism could also be lower relative to average quality of all assets of given category to the extent that treasury overpays for assets relative to their quality due to adverse selection costs to the taxpayer rise whether this effect presents significant financial risk to the taxpayer is difficult to determine before the reverse dutch auctions have been running for some time auction mechanisms however might be designed that could mitigate these adverse selection problems13 analysts close to government auction design discussions have outlined design in which several similar securities could be listed for an auction14 price offsets or handicaps could be applied relative to benchmark security for instance an auction might encompass specified set of mbss underwritten by the same investment bank in the same month bids offering specific mbs issue with higher average default rate on the underlying mortgages would be reduced by an offset calculated using financial asset pricing model other auction mechanisms might also mitigate these problems for example firm could be required to let the government select an asset randomly from all of its holdings of specific type of asset if its bid were successful or participating firms could be required to post performance bond that could be used to compensate the government if firms assets sold in auctions turned out to be systematically worse than average15 charles plott pioneer in auction design has designed and tested reverse dutch auction that was able to mitigate adverse selection concerns in another context16 adverse selection and firms asset holdings uncertainty about the composition of firms holdings could be an additional source of adverse selection in the administration of the troubled asset relief program some claim that financial institutions have avoided offering to sell large amounts of subprime and other troubled assets out of concern for the institutions reputation other market participants might infer that wouldbe seller has large inventory of subprime and other troubled assets and thus may be risky counterparty17 that inference could adversely affect potential sellers stock price and its ability to raise capital thus providing reason for firms to hold troubled assets in other words some firms may worry that attempting to sell troubled assets may damage its reputation market value 13 justin lahart economists look

however many view the former investment bank merrill lynchs sale of troubled assets as sound strategic move18 reputational issues and participation if financial markets were to associate participation in the troubled asset relief program tarp including bidding in treasury reverse auctions with financial weakness then firms might be less willing to participate reputational issues in the view of many financial experts have discouraged some firms from participating in certain federal government or federal reserve programs for example in recent years some have viewed firms using the federal reserves discount window as desperate19 the federal reserve term auction facility taf in the view of some was designed to provide liquidity to firms while avoiding the stigma that some might perceive to be associated with the discount window20 us treasury however has stressed that tarp is not targeted at failing firms but instead is designed to attract broad participation among financial institutions21 the effectiveness of the reverse auction asset purchase program could be reduced if reputational issues caused some firms to forego participation in tarp factors that reduce the number of active bidders in an auction can decrease expected revenues and can dampen competition among bidders the choice of how auction results are released and how much detail is disclosed may affect firms willingness to submit bids for example if firms believe that market analysts can observe or infer from announced auction results that the firm holds large inventories of troubled assets then that firm may become reluctant to participate in the auction designing treasury reverse auctions for troubled assets and associated announcements of results to avoid any such possible reputational effects may enhance firms willingness to participate sequencing issues the order or sequencing in which reverse securities auctions take place may affect the results of auctions first the initial reverse auctions might be learning process for both bidders and the us treasury this might imply that smaller simpler auctions should precede larger and more complex auctions in the past new 18 merrill lynch merrill

problems or unforeseen strategic vulnerabilities careful design and testing of auction mechanisms however can minimize such problems second if the treasury interventions in financial markets do start to unfreeze credit markets as intended then asset prices will change bidders anticipation that asset prices will rise after the initial auctions or because of other types of government intervention could induce bidders to submit fewer assets in earlier auctions third sequencing may raise operational issues because of the large number of asset types and because of the intrinsic complexity of some mortgagerelated securities will auctions unlock credit markets the september 20 2008 treasury proposal suggested that reverse auctions would play central role in restoring liquidity to credit markets it argued that auctions could help stabilize asset and credit markets in two ways first firms with illiquid assets would sell them at prices determined by competitive process which would supply firms with liquid proceeds of those sales second auction results could provide pricing benchmarks that might stimulate trading in other assets some believe that this could improve liquidity conditions in credit markets others however are skeptical22 the reverse auction program essentially swaps treasury securities for troubled mortgagebacked securities if the prices at which treasury securities are exchanged for troubled assets are close to current market prices for those assets then financial institutions may gain liquidity but might not receive much additional capital what prices the troubled mortgagerelated assets will sell at is therefore key question merrill lynch for example sold large stake of senior mortgage related collateralized default obligations cdos to lone star funds private capital fund for about 22 cents on the dollar23 if other assets sold at treasury reverse auctions at prices reflecting similar discounts the solvency of some financial institutions might be put in doubt some commentators however have suggested that treasury might believe that such assets are underpriced in current conditions24 assets might be underpriced relative to fundamental factors because of the rapid deleveraging of financial 22 paul krugman claims that treasury secretary paulson has never been able to explain clearly why buying up bad mortgage assets at market prices will solve the

liquidity rises measured as the cost of overnight interbank borrowing relative to comparable treasury rates highly leveraged financial institutions may come under additional pressure to sell assets thus deleveraging and falling asset prices may create selfreinforcing spiral to the extent that buying assets via reverse auction process might strengthen the link between assets and their underlying values more normal market conditions might be restored but others argue that the low prices of troubled assets reflect their intrinsic value and that previous prices were above those justified by fundamentals26 federal reserve chairman ben bernanke spoke of hold to maturity valuations of assets which would seem to imply that prices above current market levels might be paid27 while paying abovemarket prices for assets would inject capital into financial institutions it would also increase the costs and risks to taxpayers how auctions could be designed to ensure hold to maturity valuations of assets is unclear one economist with knowledge of auction design discussions has said that reverse auctions would be designed in hardnosed manner to minimize taxpayer costs but if current asset prices accurately reflect fundamental value and if the treasury reverse auctions are run efficiently comparatively little capital would be injected into the financial sector while this would minimize costs and risks to taxpayers such an auction program might provide limited support for financial institutions some economists have argued that other means of injecting capital into the financial sector such as purchases of preferred stock or capital injections balanced by equity warrants ie options to claim an equity stake might be better strategy28 on october 8 2008 the us treasury emphasized that eesa gives it authority to directly inject capital into firms and is developing strategies to do so29 asset purchases and direct capital injections may have different implications for affected firms proceeds of asset purchases would presumably be counted as trading profits which firms can use without restriction capital injections however 25 leverage is the value of firms assets relative to its debts deleveraging typically means selling assets or restructuring positions to reduce debt levels 26 nikki kahn away from wall street economists question basis of paulsons plan

changes or equity warrants treasury purchases of preferred equity shares would probably commit firms to make regular specified payments back to the treasury proceeds from asset purchases however might be available for dividends executive compensation reducing debt or other purposes costs and risks to taxpayers federal interventions to restore more normal conditions to financial markets would provide substantial benefits to those connected to the financial sector either directly or indirectly of course some may receive greater benefits than others from resuscitation of the financial sector largescale federal intervention could impose substantial costs and risks on taxpayers and federal program beneficiaries although the scale and nature of those costs and risks may depend on how interventions are structured and administered if treasury reverse auctions were conducted in hardnosed and efficient manner direct costs to taxpayers and beneficiaries could be minimized furthermore the federal government might well eventually sell assets for more than their purchase price such auctions however might supply little extra capital to the financial sector and thus may fail to achieve normalization of market conditions other measures such as debtequity swaps purchases of preferred stock or trading stock warrants for capital injections might present the taxpayer with greater financial risks but might also be better suited to addressing current financial conditions auction design auctions in recent years have been used to address wide range of policy issues auctions may capture higher revenues for governments and can allocate scarce resources more efficiently than traditional methods different policy issues however may require different types of auctions to achieve reasonable results to provide basis for evaluating the reverse auction mechanisms that may be used in tarp this section discusses potential problems that may arise in using auctions and how those problems can be minimized by careful design of auction mechanisms singleunit auctions the most common auction mechanisms used to sell single items are the first price sealedbid auction the english or ascendingprice openbid auction and the dutch or descendingprice auction in the firstprice sealedbid auction bidders submit bids to the seller who then selects the highest bid when selling an item or the lowest bid when buying an item in the english or ascendingprice auction bidders announce prices that must exceed previous prices by set amount the last bidder to remain receives the object at her last announced price in flower markets in amsterdam and other trading centers in the netherlands bidders watch price clock that starts at high price and descends at constant rate the first bidder to press crs11 button buys the lot of flowers at the price indicated on the price clock30 similar descendingprice mechanisms are called dutch auctions31 why are treasury auctions called dutch auctions treasury auctions for government securities which use sealedbid rules are often described as dutch auctions even though they do not use descendingprice mechanism as in flower auctions treasury securities auctions however are strategically equivalent to particular descendingprice dutch auction an auction mechanism is strategically equivalent to another auction mechanism when bidders incentives the identity of the winner and the final sale price are the same for both some auction rules however may be operationally easier to carry out for example bidders can mail in responses for sealedbid auction while english auctions require bidders or their agents to gather in the same place descendingprice dutch auction under certain conditions is strategically equivalent to sealedbid firstprice auction rational bidder calculates what the item for sale is worth to her32 if bidder bid her value however she would make zero gain in firstprice auction because the price paid would exactly match the items value to her rational bidder therefore shades her bid downwards trading off larger gain value minus price paid if she wins the auction against the possibility that she would lose the item by lowering her bid33 the same calculation applies to both the sealedbid firstprice auction and to the descendingprice auction so the two auctions may be considered strategically equivalent an english ascendingbid is strategically equivalent to secondprice sealedbid auction when bidders know what the object up for auction is worth to them34 imperfect information common values and the winners curse when bidders have imperfect information about the value of an item an english or ascendingbid auction may force betterinformed bidders to reveal valuable information to less well informed bidders35 for example the value of an antique 30 for details see httpwwwfloranlenaboutflorahollandauctioningpages defaultaspx 31 fallingprice auctions were invented to avoid napoleonicera taxes on risingprice auctions 32 rational here only means that bidder has internally consistent preferences and is self interested so that the bidder can compute bids that best achieve her ends 33 bidders here are assumed to keep the object and cannot resell it in technical terms values are private and independent when values are linked or common results can differ 34 when the value of objects are linked such as when an auctioned object will be resold some of these equivalences may not hold for example in an english auction among wholesalers bidders may learn about an objects resale value in retail markets through the bids of others in that case the equivalence of an english auction to secondprice sealed bid auction would not hold 35 for example in ebay auctions informed bidders often use sniping strategies in which bids are submitted seconds before the auction closes this prevents less informed bidders from gleaning information from the bidding behavior of an informed bidder for details see continued crs12 may depend on who made it how rare it is and on who owned it before knowledgeable bidder who may know more about an items value will attempt to use bidding strategies that conceal private information the value to bidders of some auctioned items may be linked for example the value one energy company places on an offshore continental shelf ocs lease that would allow exploration and extraction of oil and gas will correlate to the value other energy companies place on the same lease different companies might have strengths and weaknesses in exploration and extraction techniques so the value of the lease will not be the same to each company any company that got the lease however would sell oil and gas on the same world markets auctions that sell items whose value to bidders is correlated are called commonvalue auctions bidders in commonvalue auction may have different indications of an items value for example many energy companies may have private information about the geological structures of areas covered by an ocs lease company holding an ocs lease in nearby area that had run seismic tests might have more precise information about those geological structures and thus would have more precise estimate of the value of the ocs lease up for auction when bidders have imperfect signals of value bidders with overly optimistic signals are likely to win auctions such bidders however will suffer losses because the true value of the item is less than their optimistic estimate this is the winners curse such auction winners would have been better off losing sophisticated bidders in commonvalue auctions shade their bids downward to account for the winners curse sophisticated auction designers release as much information as possible about an items value so that revenues are not reduced by bidders who shade their bids downwards36 that is bidders with better information bid more aggressively revenue equivalence certain auction mechanisms as noted above are functionally equivalent to certain other auctions run using different rules the auctions discussed above dutch english firstprice and secondprice sealed bid in theory deliver the same profits to bidders and the same revenues to sellers moreover any independent private value auction that awards the item to the highest bidders and attracts the same pool of participants also in theory provides the same profits to bidders and the same revenues to sellers37 this result known as the revenue equivalence theorem implies that to affect expected revenues requires changing who participates in an auction for example minimum bid rules can raise expected revenue but may lower an auctions economic efficiency experimental 35 continued httpwwwesnipecom 36 john h kagel and dan levin common value auctions and the winners curse princeton 2002 37 this result assumes that bidders are riskneutral when values are uncertain auction revenues will not in general be equivalent when bidders are riskaverse elmar wolfstetter topics in microeconomics industrial organization auctions and incentives cambridge 1999 pp 186188 for more detailed discussion see paul milgrom putting auction theory to work cambridge 2004 ch 3 crs13 research has found that some expected auction equivalences hold while others do not38 experimental testing of revenue equivalence of auction mechanisms is an active research area multipleunit auctions auctions in which multiple units are sold simultaneously are more complex than singleunit auctions computing optimal bidding strategies in multipleunit auctions may be complex and difficult designing multipleunit auctions so that government revenue is maximized and so that scarce resources are likely to be assigned to those who value them the most can be challenging the federal government however has successfully used complex multiunit auctions to allocate electromagnetic spectrum for wireless communication and related uses manipulation and demandreduction strategies bidders in some situations can benefit by strategically withdrawing bids on some items in order to lower prices on other items39 the logic of this strategy is analogous to standard monopoly or oligopoly pricing models monopolist or firm with some market power can raise profits by reducing output below the level that would prevail in competitive market just as entry by new competitors can reduce the market power of existing firms auction designs that encourage many bidders to participate can limit the effect of demandreduction strategies complementarities auctions that sell complementary goods can be extraordinarily complex40 items are considered complements when groups of items are more valuable than the sum of individual items for example takeoff rights from specific airport that government might auction off will be more valuable if the airline can obtain landing rights at different airport federal communications commission auctions of electromagnetic spectrum involve complementarities because license in one geographic area may be more valuable to telecommunications firm that holds license in an adjacent area complementarities among troubled assets may complicate current reverse auctions implemented as part of tarp for instance some assets backed by sub prime loans were often linked to collateralized default obligationscdos which provided something akin to insurance to investors holding those assets in that case the asset backed by pool of subprime loans and the associated cdo would share strong complementarity which could affect behavior in reverse auction dutch auctions with multiple units the us treasury as noted above uses multiunit dutch auction mechanism to sell government securities to primary 38 david luckingreiley
