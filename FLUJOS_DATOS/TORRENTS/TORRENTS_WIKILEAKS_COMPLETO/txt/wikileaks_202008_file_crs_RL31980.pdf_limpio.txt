officers of the united states by and with the advice and consent of the senate the method by which the senate provi des advice and consent on presidential nominations referred to broadl as the confirmation process serves several purposes first largely through committee investigations and hearings the confirmation process allows the senate to examine the qualifications of nominees and any potential conflicts of intere st second senators can influence policy through the confirmation process either by rejectin g nominees or by extracting promises from nominees before granting consent also the senate sometimes has delayed the confirmation process in order to increase its influence with the executive branch on unrelated matters senate confirmation is required for several categor ies of government officials military appointments and promotions ma ke up the majority of nominations approximately 65000 congress and most ar confirmed routinely each congress also considers close to 4000 civilian nomin ations and again many of them such as appointments to or promotions in the foreign service and the public health service are routine civilian nominations considered by the senate also include federal judges and specified officers in executive departments independent agencies and regulatory boards and commissions some categories of civilian nominations are treated specifically and in greater depth in other congressional research service crs reports1 approximately 99 of pres idential appointees are conf irmed routinely by the senate with tens of t housands of nominations each congress the senate cannot possibly consider them all in detail regularized process facilitates quick action on thousands of government positi ons the senate may approve bloc hundreds of nominations at time especially military appointments and promotions although most nominees are swiftly and r outinely confirmed by the senate the process also allows for close scrutiny of ca ndidates when necessary each year few hundred nominees to highlevel positions are regularly subject to senate investigations and public hearings most of these are routinely approved while small number of nominations are disputed and receive more attention from the mediahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31980crs2 2 for more information on the consideration of supreme court nominations see crs report rl33225

history see crs report rl31948 evolution of the senates role in the nomination and c onfirmation process brief history by betsy palmerand congress judicial nominations pa rticularly supreme court appointees are generally subject to greater scrutiny than nominations to executive posts partly because judges serve for life2 among the executive branch positions nominees for policymaking positions are more likely to be examined closely and are slightly less likely to be confirmed than nominees for nonpolicy positions3 there are several reasons for the high percentage of c onfirmations most nominations and promotions are not to po licymaking positions and are of less interest to the senate in addition so sentiment exists in the senate that the selection of persons to fill executive branch positions is largely presidential prerogative historically the president has been granted wide latitude in the selection of his cabinet and other highranking executive branch officials4 another important reason for the high percentage of confirmations is that senators often are involved in the nomination stage the president would prefer smooth and fast confirmation process so he may decide that it is in his interest to consult with senators in hi s party prior to choosing nominee senators most likely to be consulted typically by white house congressional rela tions staff are senators from nominees home state leaders of th committee of jurisdiction and leaders of the presidents party in the senate senators of the presidents party are sometimes invited to express opinions or even propose candidates for federal appointments in their own states5 there is longstanding custom of senatorial courtesy whereby the sena will often decline to proceed on nomination if homestate senator expresses opposition6 positions subject to senatorial courtesy include us attorneys us mars hals and us district judgeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31980crs3 7 for list of appointee positions requiring

numbers to the presidential messages not to individual nominations so message listin g several nominations would receive single number except by unanimous consent the senate cannot vote on nominations the day they are receive d and most are referred immediately to committees senate rule xxxi provides that nomina tions shall be refe rred to appropriate committees unless otherwise ordered in few instances by unanimous consent the senate has conf irmed nominations without refe rral to committee particularly when the nominee is current or former nator formally the presiding officer but administratively the executive clerks office refers the nominations to committees according to the senates rules and precedents the senate rule concerning committee jurisdictions rule xxv broadly defines issue areas for committees and the same jurisdictional statements generally apply to nominations as well as legislation7 an executive department nomination can be expected to be referred to the committee with jurisdiction over legislation concerning that department or to the committee that handled the legislation creating the position in some instances the committee of jurisdiction for nomination has been set in statute8 the number of nominations referred to various committees differs considerably the committee on armed services which handles all military appointments and promotions receives the most the two other committees with major confirmation responsibilities are the committee on judiciary with jurisdiction over the confirmation of judges us attorneys and us marshals and the committee on foreign relations which considers ambassadorial and other diplomatic appointments occasionally nominations are referre d to more than one committee either jointly or sequentially joint referral might occur when two committees each have claim to nomination both committees must report on the nomination before the whole senate can act on it unless the senate discharges one or both committees if two committees have unequal jurisdictional claims then the nomination is more likely to be sequentially referred in this case the first committee must report the nomination before it is quentially referred to the second committee the secondhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31980crs4 9 see for examplejoint referral of department of energy nominations congressional record vol 136 june 28

requirement that the committee report within certain number of days typically nominations are jointly or sequentially referred by unanimous consent sometimes the unanimous consent agreement applies to all future nominations to position or category of positions9 committee procedures written rules most senate committees that consider nominations have written rules concerning the process although committ ee rules vary most contain standards concerning information to be gathered from nominee many committees expect biographical resumé and some kind of financial statement listing assets and liabilities some specify the terms under wh ich financial statem ents will or will not be made public committee rules also frequently contain timetables outlining the minimum layover required between committee actions common timing provision is requirement that nominations be held for one or two weeks before the committee proceeds to hearing or vote permittin g senators time to review nomination before committee consideration other co mmittee rules specifically mandate delay between steps of the process such as the receipt of prehearing information and the date of the hearing or the distribution of hearing transcripts and the committee vote on the nomination some of the written rule s also contain provisions for the rules to be waived by majority vote by unanimous consent or by the chair and the ranking minority member10 investigations committees often gather and review in formation about nominee either before or instead of formal hearing because the executive branch acts first in selecting nominee congressional committees are sometimes able to rely partially on any field investigations and reports conducted by the federal bur eau of investigation fbi records of fbi investigations are provi ded only to the white house although report or summary of report may be sh ared with the presidents authorization with senators on the relevant committee the practices of the committees with regard to fbi materials vary some ra rely if ever request them on other committees the chair and ranking member review any fbi report or summary but on some committees these materials are available to any senator upon request committee staff usually do not review fbi materialshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31980crs5 11 the estimate excludes military appointees as well as civilian appointees usually submitted on lists to the senate civilian nominations usually submitted on lists include appointments to and promotions in the coast guard foreig n service national oceanic and atmospheric administration and public health servicealmost all nominees are also asked by th office of the counsel to the president to complete an executive personnel fina ncial disclosure re port sf278 which is reviewed and certified by the relevant agency as well as the director of the office of government ethics the documents are then forwarded to the relevant committee along with opinion letters from ethics officer s in the relevant agency and the director of the office of government ethics in c ontrast to fbi reports financial disclosure forms are made public all committees review financial disclosure reports and some make them available in committee offices to members staff and the public to varying degrees committees also c onduct their own informationgathering exercises most committees have their own financial disclosure and personal background forms that nominee must comp lete some committees after reviewing responses to their standard questionnaire might ask nominee to complete second questionnaire committees fre quently require that wr itten responses to these questionnaires be submitted before hearing is scheduled the committee on the judiciary sends form letters sometimes called blue slips to senators from nominees home state to determine whet her they support the nomination the committee on the judiciary also has its own investigative staff the committee on rules and administration ndles relatively few nomina tions and conducts its own investigations sometimes with the assistance of the fbi or the general accountability office gao it is not unusual for nominees to meet with committee staff prior to hearing highlevel nominees may meet privately with senators generally speaking these meetings sometimes initiated by the nominee serve basically to acquaint the nominee with the members and committee sta ff and vice versa they occasionally address substantive matters as well nominee also might meet with the committees chief counsel to discuss the fina ncial disclosure re port and any potential conflictofinterest issues hearings approximately half of ll civilian appointees are c onfirmed without hearing11 all committees that receive nominations do hold hearings on some nominations and the likelihood of hearings varies with the importance of the position and the workload of the committee the committee on the judiciary for example which receives large number of nominations does not usually hold hearings for us attorneys us marshals or members of parttime commissions the committee on agriculture nutrition and forestry nd the committee on energy and natural resources on the other hand typically hold hearings on most nominations that are referred to them committees often combine related nominations into single hearinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31980crs6 12 roger h davidson and walter j oleszek congress and its members 7th ed washington cq press 2000 p 314 13 for more details concerning hearings see crs report 98337 senate committee hearings scheduling and notification by betsy palmer and crs report 98392 senate committee hearings witness testimony by betsy palmerthe length and nature of hearings vari one or both homestate senators will often introduce nominee the nominee typi cally testifies at the hearing and occasionally the committee will invite other witnesses including members of the house of representatives to testify as we ll some hearings function as routine welcomes while others are directed at influencing the policy program of an appointee in addition to policy views hearings might address the nominees qualifications and potential conflicts of interest senators also might take the opportunity to ask questions of particular concern to th em or their constituents committees sometimes send questions to nominees in advance of hearing and ask for written responses nominees also might be asked to respond in writing to additional questions after hearing especially for highlevel positions the nomination hearing may be only the first of many times an individual will be asked to testify before committee therefore the committee often gains commitment from the nominee to be cooperative in fu ture oversight activities of the committee12 hearings under senate rule xxvi are open to the public unless closed by majority vote for one of the reasons specified in the rule witness testimony is sometimes made available online through the website of the relevant committee and also through several commercial services including congressional quarterly and lexisnexis most committees print the h earings although rule requires it the number of senators necessary to cons titute quorum for the purpose of taking testimony varies from committee to committee but it is usually smaller than majority of the membership13 reporting committee considering nomination has four options it may report the nomination to the senate favorably unfavorably or without recommendation or it may choose to take action at all it is more common for committee to fail to take action on nomination than to report unf avorably committees occasionally report nomination favorably subject to the commitment of the nominee to testify before senate committee sometimes committees choose to report nomination without recommendation even if majority of senators on committee do not agree that nomination should be repor ted favorably majority might agree to report nomination without recommendation in orde r to permit vote by the whole senate it is rare for the full senate to consid er nomination if committee chooses not to report it and the committee is not discharged by unanimous consent the practice of discharging committee of the consideration of nomination is discussed below the timing of vote to report nomination varies in accordance with committee rules and practice most committees do not vote to report nomination on the same day that they hold hearing but instead wait until the next meeting of the committeehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31980crs7 14 the reference in the rule to day refers to calendar day not legislative day see floyd m riddick nd alan s frumin riddicks

recommendation on nomination to the senate is the same that the committee requires for reporting measure every committee reports majority of nominations favorably most of the time committees do not formally present reports on nominations on the floor of the senate instead senator typically the committee chair informs the legislative clerk stationed at the sk of the committees decision the executive clerk then arranges for the nomination to be printed in the congressional record and placed on the executive calendar if report were presented on the floor it would have to be done in executive session executive session and the executive calendar will be discussed in the next section ccording to senate rule xxxi the senate cannot vote on nomination the same da it is reported except

technically senate rule xvii permits any senator to submit motion or resolution that committee be discharged from the consideration of subject referred to it motion to discharge committee from the consideration of nomination is like all business c oncerning nominations in order only in executive session15 if there is an objection to the motion to discharge it must lie over until the next executive session on another day it is fairly common for committees to be discharg ed from noncontroversial minations by unanimous consent often with the support of the committee as means of simplifying the process it is far less common for senators to attempt to discharge committee from nomination by motion or resolution16httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31980crs8 floor procedures the senate

nomination if the senate simply resolves into executive session the business immediately pending is the first item on the executive calendar motion to proceed to another matter on the calendar woul d be debatable and subj ect to filibuster in practice the senate expedites the process by specifying the business to be considered as part of the motion or unan imous consent request to go into executive session the majority leader by custom ffectively determines when or whether nomination will be called up for consideration for example the majority leader may move or ask unanimous consent to immediately proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination on the executive calendar by precedent the motion to go into executive session to take up specified nomination is not debatable17 the nomination itself however is debatable it is not in order for senator to move to consider nomination that is not on the calendar and except by unanimous c onsent nomination on the calendar cannot be taken up until it has been on the calendar at least one day rule xxxi clause 1 in other words nomination reported and placed on the calendar on monday can be considered on tuesday even if it is the same legislative day18 holds hold is request by senator to his or her party leader to prevent or delay action on nomination or bill holds ar not mentioned in the rules or precedents of the senate and they are enforced only through the agenda decisions of party leaders recent directive of the senate aims to ensure that any senator who places hold on any matter including nomination make public his or her objection to the matter19 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31980crs10 20 in the 109th congress some senators proposed changing senate procedures for limiting debate on nominations procedures were not changed but in response to the effort bipartisan group of senators entered into memorandum of understanding on judicial nominations on may 23 2005 the memorandum did not change the procedures of the senate described in this report it was commitment that nominees should only be filibustered under extraordinary circumstances and an agreement to oppose any amendment to or any interpretation of the rule s of the senate that would force vote on judicial nomination by means other than unani mous consent or rule xxii the cloture rule for more information on this bipartisan agreement see crs report rs22208 the memorandum of understanding senate compromise on judicial filibusters by walter j oleszek for more information on the proposed procedural change see crs report rl32843 entrenchment of senate proce dure and the nuclear option for change possible proceedings and their implications by richard s beththe effectiveness of hol d ultimately is grounded in the power of the senator placing the hold to filibuster the nominati on and the difficulty of invoking cloture the rules governing cloture in relation to nominations are discussed in later section of this report in another sense however holds are connected to the senate traditions of mutual deference since they may have originated as requests for more time to examine pending nomination or bill senators place holds on nominations for number of reasons one common purpose is to give senator more time to review nomination or to consult with the nominee senators may also place holds because they disagree with the policy positions of the nominee senators have also admitted to using holds in order to gain concessions from the executive branch on matters not directly related to the nomination depending on the timing of th hold and the support for the nomination hold can kill nomination by preventing it from ever coming to the senate floor consideration and disposition the question before the senate when nomination is taken up is will the senate advise and c onsent to this nomination th senate can approve reject or recommit nomination most nominations are brought up by unanimous consent and approved without objection routine nominations often are called up and approved all together or bloc small proportion of nominations gene rally to higherlevel positions can be controversial when ther is debate on nomination the chair of the committee usually makes an opening speech for positi ons within state senators from the state may wish to speak on the nominee par ticularly if they were involved in the selection process while floor debate is rarely lengthy there are time limits except when conducted under cloture or unanimous consent agreement20 majority of senators pr esent and voting quorum being present is required to approve nomination because nomin ations are vulnerable to filibusters however stronger support may be necessary in order to i nvoke cloture as discussed

transmits it to the white house recommital in addition to approving and rejecting nomination the senate has the option of sending nomination back to committee for further consideration although infrequently used the motion to recommit is available and may allow panel to reconsider its recommendation when information concerning nominee comes to light after the committee has reported to the full senate the motion to recommit is debatable and so may be subjected to filibuster nominations recommitted may be rereported and have the same status as when originally reported if not rereported however the senate will be unable to vote on recommitted nominations unless the committee is discharged the senate may vote to recommit nomination with instructions to rereport perhaps by set date or after gathering more information on the nomination motion to recommit nomination is not in order if unanimous consent agreement to vote on the confirmation at sp ecified hour is in ffect furthermore groups of nominations cannot be r ecommitted without unanimous consent reconsideration according to senate rule xxxi any senator who voted with the majority has the option of movi ng to reconsider vote on the nomination the motion to reconsider is in order on the day of the vote or the next two days the senate meets in executive session the mo tion is made in executive session or by unanimous consent as in executive session only one motion to reconsider is in order on each nomination often the motion to reconsider is laid upon the table by unanimous consent shortly after the vot on the nomination this action prevents any subsequent atte mpt to reconsider senate rule xxxi requires that the s ecretary of the sena wait until the time for moving to reconsider has expired be fore sending notice to the president in practice however notice is usually sent immediately permitted by unanimous consent if nomination has already been sent to the president motion to reconsider is accompanied by request to the president to return the nomination if the president does not comply with the request the senate cannot reconsider the nomination21 cloture in most instances the senate imposes
