summary from 1910 to 1990 farmers share of th overall gdp of the food and fiber system fell from 21 to 5 while the share contributed by the agricultural input and distribution subsectors rose from 13 to 30 congress is concerned about how these and other changes in agriculture are affecting rural america and the role value added agricultural production might play in future rural economic development strategies valueadded production is legislative concern in the 107th congress the rural development title in the 2002 acted farm bill pl107171 includes provisions for the development of valuea dded agricultural enterprises by adding to and capturing the value in commoditie s grown and processe d locally proponents of valueadded production argue that farm households rural businesses and rural communities will benefit through new and higherwage employment new markets for agricultural commodities and more vibrant rural and regional economies us agriculture is also changing rapidly from sector characterized by production of undifferen tiated bulk commodities sold in spot markets to one of specialized markets driven by new end user demands as production shifts away from commodity agriculture to product agriculture vertically integrated agribusiness firms are increasingly organizing production into agrofood value chains to synchronize all stages of production from seed to supermarket valueadded production is central element of agrof ood value chains and control over specific identity preservedip tra its is basic to the devel opment of product agriculture many farmers and ranchers are beginning to consider how they might reorganize their operations to better anticipate these changes and to participate in them for example by forming new generation valueadded cooperativ and engaging in increased contract relations with value chain integrators some producers see ip traits and contract production as sources of new mark ets lowered risks and higher farm and ranch incomes emerging opportunitie s for biomassbased fuels and materials processing facilitie s new food processing plan ts and alternative farming systems eg organic could create importa nt new markets for producers smaller scale producers too may find new opport unities in regionally branded products farmers markets new specialty crops ethnic markets or in establishing direct marketing links between fa rms and regional groceries while capturing more of commoditys value at the site of primary production can have positive impacts on some farm household incomes and farmrelated businesses important questi ons arise regarding the extent to which valueadded agriculture might become significant rural development strategy for the future these identified opportunities however welcome are unlikel to significantly alter the diminishing role production agricu lture plays in most rural economies moreover because of its comparatively low wages low net employment generation and low laborskill requirements valueadded commodity manufacturing may not become as effective driver of broad sustainable rural economic development and new competitive advantage as rural comm unities and advocates might hope for httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31598contents introduction 1 s c p 3 c u r r n t c n g r s s i n l i n t r s t 4 rural americas new competitive environment 5 demographic overview

2valueadded expresses the difference between the value of goods sold and the cost of materials or supplies used in producing them the term is applied to manufacturing processes where raw commodities are initially pr ocessed into intermediate goods which are then processed in further stages adding increasi ng market value at each stage in this report the term retains that meaning but also refers to other processes that add or might add market value through product differentiation foods grown and processed organically or in environmentally benign ways regionallybranded food products hormoneantibioticfree livestock processing waste products into goods and renewable energy production can also constitute agricultural valueadded processes and products valueadded production in forestry and fibers is not considered in detail here but the same logic applies to those products as wellvalueadded agricultural enterprises in rural development strategies1 introduction technological development and in tensifying global competition are fundamentally reshaping us indus trial agriculture from production of undifferentiated bulk commodities sold in anonymous spotmarkets to production system of segmented and specialized markets identitypreserved ip commodities valueadded food products and focus on the enduser this emerging shift from commodity agriculture to product agriculture that is from quantity to quality is likely to have important effects in many rural areas especially where largescale industrial agriculture remains signifi cant part of the economy but potentially where smallerscale production also predo minates heightened global competition and declining profit margins in the pr oduction of undifferentia ted bulk commodities are leading some us growers and ranchers to pursue efforts to add value to their products and in so doing to capture greater part of the downstream value dominated by processing and marketing sect ors efforts to develop and expand new types of and uses for bulk agricultural commodities eg alternative fuels bioplastics alternative ag ricultural production systems eg organic intensive pasture rotation niche markets and specia lty crops are regarded by many observers as creating new opportunities for improving the economic viability of agriculture and rural communities2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31598crs2 3identitypreserved ip products are commod ities with special traits that differentiate them from other bulk commodities ip products are traced from their site of production to final food or feed products to ensure that th ey are not mixed with similar undifferentiated commodities by documenting the path from growing to final consumption of food product ip products can command higher prices by essentially guaranteeing their distinctiveness from nonip products for example prepackaged organic vegetables must be able to guarantee that the vegetables ar grown organically and kept separated from non organic vegetables expanding local processing of agricultural products has been rural development strategy for some time for example soybean crushing flour and rice milling and beet sugar refining are long standing valueadde d food manufacturing enterprises that sited their manufacturing facilities near the raw material source the valueadded agriculture of toda is developing in the contex t of vertically coordinated and integrated production systems or agrofood value chains that organize production to meet the quality assurance mands of specialized consumer markets in such systems ip grains eg nongene tically engineered corn highoil corn may be traced from grower to firststage processo r to intermediate food processor to final product on grocery shelf or restaurant3 valueadded enterprises may hold significant income and risk diversificati on benefits for grower s and ranchers across wide spectrum of agricultural producti on traditional commodity production of high volumes at the lowest labor cost is characterized by low profits and the need to constantly expand the size of the fa rming operation this has had significant effects in many rural areas as less comp etitive producers continue to leave farming advocates of valueadded production expect valueadded agriculture to create the potential for higher profit margins for pr oducers and expanded opportunities for rural communities in processing and marketing these products to endusers as well as stimulating growth and expansion of rural businesses important policy issues however arise bout the contribution these enterprises can make to reversing the economic stagnati on of many rural areas in reducing rural unemployment in helping rural areas capture larger share of national income and in creating new sources of rural competitive advantage for the future while some valueadded production and marketing systems suggest new opportunities for some rural areas other valueadded productio n systems may produce small employment gains or do little more than shift jobs from one rural area to another farmerowned manufacturing facilitie s that process locally produ ced commodities especially commodities with highvalue ip traits may create nonfarm employment in areas where employment is scarce as well as enhance the economic viability of local businesses that service the new facilities on the other hand other facilities eg ethanol plants soy oil meat packing ow ned by external investors could offer relatively little in the way of longterm local development potential beyond improving incomes of some farm househol ds selling bulk commodities to the facility or to those who find work in the manufacturing facility production systems for certain value added products may be smallerscale operations that avoid some of the disadvantages they cu rrently have under traditional industrial agricultural production for ex ample valueadded organic cooperatives may be able to achieve scale efficiencies that would elude single producers value added cooperatives that can develop new alliances with consumers eg farmerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31598crs3 grocer contracts internet marketing may create new entrep reneurial opportunities for some growers and ranchers valuea dded products might so benefit from the increased attractiveness of food products grown under some form of enhanced environmental management system that can be branded or identified with particular farm or rural area finally farming and ranching operations near cities and suburban areas may be esp ecially wellpositioned to ta ke advantage of consumer demands by serving new markets for par ticular agricultural products in each of these cases proponents believe that developing new value added businesses in rural areas that reflect emerging changes in agriculture production may represent successful rural economic deve lopment strategy that also preserves local farming operations scope this report 1 provides an overview of rural america in the 1990s and some of the socioeconomic issues facing contemporary rural areas 2 discusses the role of agriculture in the rural economy and implica tions of the valuechains beginning to shape the contemporary structure of agriculture and 3 assesses the characteristics and potential of the more prominent valu eadded agricultural production systems as strategies for rural economic development three general questions serve as an organizing framework for the report what are the major sources of change in rural economies today and what is the role of agriculture in local economies how and where might emerging changes in valuechains and valueadded agriculture affect rural development strategy in coming years could federal policies supporting valueadded agricultural entrepreneurs assist rural areas in developing broader rura l income growth employment and new sources of competitive advantage valueadded foodprocessing and industrial valuea dded manufacturing are the two dominant categories of agricultural va lueadded commodity processing the report provides data and analysis of thei r potential role as rural development strategy and concludes that their impact on employment and income is unlikely to be significant in most rural areas agricultural commodity processing represents declining proportion of manuf acturing activity even as valueadded manufacturing generally has tended to locate predominantly in rural areas large producers currently dominate such valueadded enterprises as ethanol production and marketing raising questions about the degree to which economic benefits might accrue locally production of specialty crops or ag ricultural products produced through environmentally sound practices eg orga nic approaches however may offer some smallscale producers the opportunity to develop new marketing channels especially producers located near or with in metropolitan areas such products are valueadded in the general sense that the way they are produced can add price premium over conventionally raised pr oducts new markets for valueadded products coul d create the basis for some producers to remain in farming

important to sustainable rural areas significant changes in the structure of agricultural production are discussed in the report particularly the rise of agrof ood value chains evidence for the increasing coordination and integration of production processing an d marketing through value chains suggests that new organizationa l arrangements in farm production are developing these developments can be seen most clearly in the increasing contract arrangement between producer and agrofood integrator the developing importance of identity preserved ip products reinforces the deve lopment of agrofood value chains the report discusses these developments and suggests that few rural areas may be able to take advantage of these structural changes leading to further diminution of the role of agriculture in most rural economies current congressional interest less than 8 of the rural workforce is employed in farming and ranching today and only 17 of the rural population is enga ged in farming as fulltime occupation agriculture however remains the dominan t vehicle through which federal rural development policies are considered4 programs that enhance agricultural producerhousehold income are widely rega rded as enhancing general rural well being although most observers recognize the connection has declined significantly5 congress has expressed its concern with rural communities most directly through periodic omnibus farm bill legislation most recently in the 2002 farm bill the farm security and rural inve stment act pl1071716 of particular interest to congress is the role that valueadded agricultura l production and other innovative enterprises might play in rural economic development strategies rural development titles in both house and senate versions of the farm

especially in heavily rural and farmingdependent states believe that renewed emphasis on agriculture can become an effective rural development strategy sectoral emphases whether agriculture or manufacturing have not pr oduced the kinds of growth and generalized social welfare that rural advocates had hope d for over the past 30 years the search for comprehensive integrated rural development

usda on the basis of counties metr areas contain 1 core counties with one or more central cities of at least 50000 or with census bureaudefined urbanized area and to tal metro population of 100000 or more and 2 fringe counties that are economically tied to the core counties nonmetro counties are fined as those places either outside the boundaries of metro areas or town with populations under 50000 rural areas comprise places with open territory and fewer than 2500 residents urban areas comprise larger places and densely settled areas around them as the relation between metro and nonmetro areas becomes more complex researchers are beginning to use more precise categories eg nonmetro adjacentnonmetro nonadjacent areas rural urban commuting codes etc see john b cromartie and linda l swanson census tracts more precisely define rural population and areas rural development perspectives vol 11 3 pp3139 may 2001urban expansion and the globalization of markets are key sources of contemporary rural change proximity to urban areas transforms rural areas physically in terms of land use and settlement patterns and socially in terms of labor markets transportation systems and demography indeed the ruralurban dichotomy is arguably even less helpful analytically today in urban adjacent areas because there is such extensive flow of goods people and ideas between rural and urban places9 t conventional rura l development thinking and planning have made sharp distinction between rural and urban often without attending to other important spatial and political dimensions for example regional interactions the rural proportion of the population still tends to be regarded largely as residual category ie those areas that are not within metropolitan statistical area msa as defined by the bureau of the ce nsus andor the office of management and budget or are cities and towns with populations greater than 50000 box 1 even usdas office of rural development uses different definitions of rural to administer its programs business development loans for example can go to communities with as many as 50000 people wastewater grants and loans may go to towns smaller than 10000 and loans to build hospitals and fire stations may be targeted to communities of 20000 or less special technical assi stance grants can be reserved for rural areas as small as 2500 while the us as other advanced i ndustrial economies may be considered postrural across broad spectrum of cultural and socioeconomic criteria approximately 55 million persons lived in nonmetropolitanrural areas in 2001

was not as pronounced as it was in the 1970s all non metro net growth in the 1990s is the product of migration the annua l rate of natural ie birth and death as opposed to immigra tion growth fell by third in nonmetro counties during the 1990s10 nonmetro population growth was highest in the mountain west and lowest or nonexistent in the great plains mississippi delta and corn belt much of this growth stemmed from metro residents relocating to ad joining nonmetro areas and from other sources of immigration sign ificant portion of contemporary rural migration also stems from hispanic immigrants arriving to take jobs in agriculture related industries such as meat produc t manufacturing nonmetro counties adjoining metro areas accounted for almost twothirds of ll nonmetro growth increasing about 12 on average over the decad despite this net inflow of people from metro areas the rate of net migration into rural areas which had steadily increased during the early and mid 1990s dropped to about 05 from 19971999 the number of nonmetro c ounties with decreasing population rose from 600 from 19901995 to 855 in 199911 this more recent decrease in rural migration also occurred among college graduates although the number of college graduates entering rural areas was slightly higher than thos graduates leaving table 3 although overall nonmetro population change is not fully determined by migration for economic reasons many lowgrowth farmin g dependent areas that lack the attraction of natural amenitie s such as those found in the mountain west or florida are unlikely to

of the labor force even as their education levels have increased in 1997 rural areas lagged behind urban ar eas by at least 9000 in r eal per capita income this gap has widened ce the late 1980s

constant 1999 dollars in part lower rural earnings may reflect the lower college graduation rates of rural workers although as noted earlier highschool comple tion rates have come close to matching those of urban areas another possible explanation is that income returns to education are generally lower in rural than in urban areas14 the proportion of lowwage employment in rural areas actually increased over the past decade local officials and business elites eager to promote probusiness environment can also be very influential in determining the types of employers that locate to rural areas the manufacturing operations that have relocated to many rural areas eg branch plant assembly textiles metal fa brication for example are predominantly nonunion and generally requi re lowerskilled workers than urban manufacturing jobs the fact that rural areas have also seen growth in economically vulnerable populations eg minorities and single fe male headed households may also partly explain the metrononmetro gap in real ear nings per job although by substantial margin most rural poor are not minorities current lowwage employment rates in rural areas remain higher than in the late 1970s despite better educated workforce and very low national unemployment rate this may suggest that public policies that attend primarily to improving the employability of workers in at least some rural areas may not be effective in and of themselves although most lowwage wo rkers are women mens share of lowwage work in rural areas has risen over the past 20 years despite an increase in job growth in late 1998 the pace of employment growth in rural areas slowed from an average of 18 between 1990 and 1995 to about 15 in 1999 rural poverty the poverty rate for rural areas in 1999 was higher than that for urban areas 143 versus 112 the changing loca tion of economic activ ities within the us and across international borde rs technological changes and stagnant or falling real

relativel strong since the early 1950s manufacturing was regarded by economic deve lopment practitioners and policy makers as the key source of jobs to replace those being lost in agriculture import competition in the 1980s led ma ny metropolitan manufacturing firms to move some of their operations to rural areas to take advantage of lower labor costs property taxes and land costs this had the

of more fundamental restructuring occurring in the global food and fiber syst em today growing share of commodity producers mostly within animal producti on currently are joining supply chains33

material to the grocery shelf broiler production is the exemplar of this trend pproximately 40 firms now cont ract to produce 97 of all broilers these trends are appearin g increasingly in pork production and are beginning in cash grains distinguishing characteristic of supply chains is their re liance on contractual agreements licenses joint ventures in tegrated ownership and other business arrangements with different segments of the agrofood system these alliances with producers may permit contracting firms to bypass more traditional commodity markets to better insulate themselves from price volatility and dwindling markets many commodity producers are abandoning their independent operations and adopting contract commodity producti on and marketing arrangements with agribusiness firms according to the usdas economic research service about 35 of the total value of us agri cultural production in 1998 was produced under some form of contractual arrangement34 over half of large

tracing the ingredients that go into food products to the upstream raw commodity producer identity preservation ip of agricultural products eg nongenetically engineered or organic commodities can confer value premiums by assuring the end user that such grains are traced through each stage of food production box 2 nominally undifferentiated corn and soybeans have for example enough naturally occurring variability to potentially justify 1030 centsper bushel value differentials 39 this premium however is less than the expected costs of special trait preservation which is likely to mean that most of these grains will still be handled as bulk grains in the system research has suggested that grains of highvalue more than 50 cents per bushel justify the costs of nontraditional ip tracing nd handling methods such ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31598crs25 40ibid 41for example field tests are currently underway for genetically engineered corn variety that produces gastric lipase enzyme useful in treating digestive disorders in cystic fibrosis sufferers segregation through testing and monitori ng shipments throughout the value chain40 trade issues because many consumers t oday have greater choice over where their food comes from and how it is produced value chains give agribusiness the organizational structure both for cr eating new markets and for meeting the demands of these consumers speci altydriven product markets will require sophisticated means of traceability and speci handling for example genetically engineered product tracing and labeling are becoming an increasingly important factor in exporting not only raw commod ities but also animal feeds and food products taiwan australia new zealand japan south korea and china each have or will have within the year mandatory genetically engineered product labeling laws specifying minimum tolerances under such regulatory regimes documenting the source of commodity from seed to food product will become cr itical factor in agrofood trade genetically engineered s eed with valuable output traits sought by particular end users will also require similar ip tracing and handling this will mean the need to control the planting tilling harvesting storage processing and distribution to target the end user willing to pay premium over other similar products for the assurance of knowing where the product came from how it was grown and how it was processed41 with ip produc tion producers nd processors will need to better understand particular markets eg seed food proce ssing or export because each market may demand different characteristics for example premium market in distinctive variety of soybean for the japanese tofu market requires that contract growers and handlers of these soybeans segregate thei r product to avoid any comingling with other soybeans this means that an ups tream grower must be able to provide documented assurances to the handler and processor that all the soybeans in shipment contain the desired trait or do not contain othe r undesirable traits from the end users perspective similarly new european union rules that set very strict limits on dioxin in food feed or feed ma terial suggest that farmers may find ip production an increasingly necessary part of their marketing strategy the recent starlink episode where genetically engin eered variety of corn not approved for human consumption found its way into f ood products would have been much less likely to occur under wellintegrated agro food value chain the substantial costs of that comingling error underscore the rising importance of controlled production and tracing integrated through an agrofood value chain grain attribute testing tracking and auditing systems organized by valuechains for new end uses are being establishe d these developments may create new opportunities for growth of specialized agri cultural services and equipment rural areas could become sites of new busine sses serving the needs of

fully lie down and slaugh tering some animals before they are fully unconscious dedicating equipment and facilities to specific crops to avoid any chance of co mingling with other varieties such

environmental issues in valueadded production farms operating as part of value chain may find that some form of environmental certification could become significant valueadded component of production agriculture is under intense pr essures to improve its environmental performance environmental management systems ems and associated eco labeling or branding of pr oducts are becoming significant aspects of valueadded production while emss are not new they could take on significantly greater importance in the future as ip production gains market share for over 20 years germany has had the

ietary product lines may come to rely exclusively on contract production and mark eting in the future production of crops with particular output traits eg tra its affecting human food nutritional quality processing characteristics or animal feed quality may be done on contract basis between few individual farming operati ons and those owning or licensing the proprietary crop value chain integrator for new line of tomato products for example could hold license for genetically engineered tomato variety with elevated levels of lycopene an anticancer agent the value chain integrator starts the ip process by contractin g with particular farming operations that grow the tomato under highly controlled conditions eg par ticular soils wateri ng schedules growth innoculants among others the processor in turn must segregate the tomatoes and ship them along to canners or food proce ssors who use the particular tomatoes in other valueadded products which are then tested to veri fy their contents so that they may be labeled and sold at premium the market for these traits is not unlimited the proprietary owners of the genetically engineered products are likely to require very specific growing cultivating harvestin g and processing conditions in order to assure the price premiums for these produc ts such requirement s make contracting with few specialty growers with custom farming operations highly desirable arrangement for value chain integrators44 value chain developments could make some form of contract production necessity for many producers as integra tion of the agrofood value chains deepens however fewer producers would be neede d only those with contracts may find ready markets for their products because firms could find it costly and unwieldy to contract with many producers those farmer s and ranchers who b ecome part of value chains may find that significant aspects of their status as independent commodity producers may become the price for being

welcome these changes some farmers and ranchers are deeply concerned about the implications of these changes in production and marketing their concerns range from stions about the viability of smaller family farms under highly integrated production nd marketing systems to questions about the increased power that agrofood value ch ains could have in shaping farmer and rancher options in the future antitr ust issues and related concerns over concentration in various agricultural sectors eg livestock have becoming increasingly important public policy issues over the past several years particular concerns have included the transparency of production contracts the power of producers to contest terms in court and the levels of market competition in some commodities new valueadded agricultural enterprises retaining locally produced capital and increasing the recirculation of money in local and regional economies are key velopment strategi valueadded production is regarded by many observers as way to keep more value of commodity within local economy and thereby s timulate ec onomic growth and development much of the current discu ssion of valueadded ag riculture and rural development focuses on two general categor ies 1 valueadde d food products that offer or are perceived to offer higher quality better nutrition or greater convenience and 2 industrial nonfood va lueadded products derived from grains oil seeds or nontraditional plants these two genera l categories have potentially different implications for rural communities food processing food processing is very competitiv global business requiring constant product differentiation and i nnovation high valueadded food products that offer greater quality or different nutritional factors or increased convenience for consumers also tend to be labor intensive and to require more skilled workers especially in product deve lopment and marketing valueadded specialty food processing however uses relatively sma ll quantities of agricultural inputs and thus has less of an impact on agricultural prices or profitability small innovative firms may be particularly capable of developing this type of production for both domestic and international markets for exampl valueadded produc tion of food produced through organic systems or regionally br anded items are examples of enhanced economic value for which consumers are apparently willing to pay premium over similar but undifferentiated products packaging such products in microwaveable pouches for example coul d create further value based on the convenience of the product over traditionally processed frozen or canned products available data on the local impact of valueadded agricu ltural production tends to take existing commodity processing data and project the future importance of the sector to state or regional economy th example of iowa discussed above is one of the better examples of this type of analysis the operating lives of the more recently established facil ities have probably not been long nough to draw valid conclusions and there are relatively few examples of the socioeconomic impact of valueadded production in the re

survive on average growth and average profits whether that will happen or whether single facility can survive is difficult to predict an important factor for sustained economic development however may be whether valueadded agricu ltural facilities can generate regional economics of agglomeration or clustering of other facilities and supporting industries the presence of valueadded agricultural plant that can attract other businesses would suggest potentially much greater economic impact than single plant there is some evidence that this can happen wet milling ethanol plant operated by

rural welfar was creating new rural industries and improving the efficiency of industries processing and mark eting farm products because many food processing facilities were located near farming areas at that time major concern was increasing the supply of commod ities hence the need to improve local primary produc tion marginal agricultural production dominated the poorest rural areas then it was understandable that efforts to improve the efficiencies of that sector through farmer education technical assistance extension among other activities were desi rable for laying foundation fo r emerging manufacturing and industrial employment today however there is shortage of commodities food manufacturing facilities with the exception of meat produc ts manufacturing grain processing and some fruit and vegetable processing are more likely to be located in metropolitan areas close to the consumer markets and to other inputs rather than where raw material supplies exist also the role of agriculture in most rural areas has declined in only about fifth of nonmetro countie s does agriculture account for 10 or more of labor and proprietor inco today and in only 312 of those counties does it rise to 20 or more these counties are locat ed predominantly in the great plains western corn belt the southeast and pa rts of the northwest and are significant producers of bulk grains soybeans

agriculture is significant are also likely to continue to decline in number as farms within these counties decline and the average size of the remaining ones increase these 312 coun ties have also

consumers might also supply regional food markets including retail outlets such as restaurants and grocery outlets consistency and reliability in supply and quality of product are significant hurdles for any valueadded producer agrofood value chains are designed to increase such consistency and reliability new genera tion cooperatives that can develop and manage the links in valu chain may benefit from this emerging development in the organization of pr oducti on modifica tion and improvement to local and regional transportation infrastructure to complement value chain agriculture may also become necessary existing rail and water infrastructure for example is based largely on the requireme nts of traditional agriculture that is the movement of undifferentiated bulk grains to market sm allscale niche producers may require new technologies that can better s upport ip shipping and handling71 entrepreneurs able to master the links along the value chain could create new opportunities for themselves as well as creating viable agricultural sector within more diversified regional economy from policy perspective it is perhaps helpful to distinguish between value added and nontraditi

production as mo re general rural ec onomic development strategy low labor costs and access to raw commodities in rural areas will continue to be attractive to some valueadded processors for some farmers in some locations capturing more value in their farm crop th rough an ethanol plant or from their durum wheat through pasta plant can also ma ke important contributions to household income and provide opportun ities for new manufacturing em ployment in rural areas investing in alternative production syst ems such as organic agriculture or intensivelygrazed livestock or devel oping new markets for regionally branded products might also contribute to maintainin g agriculture in some areas or on farms that are not able to compete on the indus trial logic of eve rlower unit production costs job diversification in many areas dominated by agriculture is limited most rural areas are increasingly tied to urba n suburban and global systems in complex ways that steadily shrink agricultures ro in the rural economy relative to other sectors agriculture is becoming mo re technologically sophisticated and knowledgebased industry with closer ties to metropolitan ar eas some job seekers and entrepreneurs may find rural valueadded agricultu ral production attractive for other than monetary reasons eg living in rural area but most rural job seekers will continue to find areas with more diversified economies more attractive for employment rural areas with diversified economies will be better positioned to develop new growth opportun ities in the future agriculture however will remain an important if diminished part of many rural economies valueadded agriculture can very likely improve local opportunities in some areas where nonfarm jobs are scar ce or nonexistent where viable local opportunities can be identifie d and developed they shoul d probably be encouraged and supported enhanced fede ral investment in research and demonstration could be targeted to better ensure that farmers entrepreneurs and rural communities are well positioned to benefit from valueadded production and new uses from new crops efforts to support smallerscale farming opportunities can also contribute to the overall stability of many rural economies but as new gine of rural development in the sense of creating significant source of stable wellpaying local jobs generating the basis for expanded local and regional development and improving the general welfare of most rural citizens and rural communities valueadded agriculture production shows promise in comparatively few places valueadded agriculture as significant programmatic vehicle for rural development suffers from the fundamental weakness of viewing rural policy issues largely through the lens of agriculture and more specifically through farming with over 90 of todays rural population unconnect ed to farming and with most income for most farm households originating in offfarm sources farming or new agriculturallyrelated businesses appear unlikely to stem the trend of declining employment opportunities in many rural ar eas especially remo farmingdependent counties traditional farming and modern agribusiness increasingly consist of two separate socioeconomic enterprises the fo rmer connected closely to place the latter increasingly independent of an particular location while it is
