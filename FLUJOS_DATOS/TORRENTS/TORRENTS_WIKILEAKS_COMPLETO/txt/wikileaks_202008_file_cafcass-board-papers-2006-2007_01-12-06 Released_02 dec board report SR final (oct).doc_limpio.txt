children and family court advisory and support service paper for the board meeting on 01 december 2006 monthly finance update 1 aim and purpose 11 to update the board on cafcasss latest financial position including details of the expenditure and balance sheet to october 06 and the results of the quarter 2 forecasting exercise 2 action for the board 21 to note the latest financial position and the results of the quarter 2 forecasting exercise 3 overview 31 cafcass total annual budget is 105715m this consists of baseline resource budget of 1008m cafcass income of 0225m plus one off funding of 469m to support it improvements and the change programme in 0607 10 based on 0506 expenditure levels all other things being equal cafcass began the year with budget pressures of 35m to 45m 2 based on the latest forecast produced by budget holders quarter 2 cafcass is projecting an outturn of between breakeven and 06m overspend this represents reduction on the quarter 1 forecasts and marks the significant progress that has been made across cafcass to address and control the significant budget pressures faced at the beginning of the year and the rising demand experienced during the year 13 number of significant financial and operational risks remain and these are being carefully monitored and managed 15 during october there have been number of fixed asset purchases as part of the itc capital project there are significant movements in the balance sheet 16 cafcass continues to show cash shortfall for the year further work is required during december to revisit the cash requirements taking into account the latest projections and the timing estimates relating to the oneoff cash particularly ict and early retirement cash draw down to october is currently running at less than profile this may mean we can close the forecast shortfall we continue to monitor this on monthly basis 4 the management accounts 41 table 1 provides details of budget actual expenditure and forecast expenditure by expense category table 2 provides details of budget actual expenditure and forecast expenditure by budget holder regiondepartment 19 the tables show expenditure in october of 84m against budget of 87m an underspend in the month of 3 the cumulative expenditure to date is 585m against budget of 595m an under spend of 1m 17 against budget 20 the underspend largely relates to slippage across number of national office budgets such as the change programme estates childrens rights communications legal and kld further analysis of expenditure has been done as part of the q2 forecasting exercise and is explained in the q2 forecast section 21 regional expenditure to october is showing breakeven compared with forecast 1 overspend at q2 similarly national office budgets are showing an underspend to october of 9 compared with 1 under spend at q2 quarter 2 forecasts 24 cafcass undertakes quarterly forecasts all budget holders were required to submit quarter 2 expenditure forecast based on the position as at september 2006 by 27th october 2006 the results of this exercise are shown in table 1 and 2 table 2a provides comparison of quarter 1 and quarter 2 forecasts by budget holder 25 in addition to showing the quarter 1 and quarter 2 results table 2a also shows regions rolling activity position as at september 2006the rolling activity target is calculated by taking all activity ie referrals in the last 12 months and converting the work into staffing target based on the workload policy overall cafcass budgets currently stand at 99 of the current workload level this is consistent with the quarter 2 forecast of 1 overspend on regional spend the activity levels have increased and the overspend reflects this 26 the position within regions varies ne and em are budgeted at 94 of current activity levels however they are forecasting breakeven the regions are therefore absorbing the increased activity within current resources london and so are all showing increased activity and similarly overspends east sw and wm are showing reductions in activity and breakeven against budget nw and yh are showing static or reducing activity and forecasting an overspend the financial and activity targets need to be considered against the service performance and backlogs in particular 27 based on the forecasts submitted by budget holders cafcass is forecasting an underspend of 02m at quarter 2 28 finance has undertaken detailed review of the forecasts submitted taking into account 0607 spend to date and the risks identified by budget holders additional risk of approximately 08m has been identified at quarter 2 cafcass is therefore forcasting an outturn of between breakeven and an overspend of 06m at quarter 1 cafcass was forecast position of an overspend between 08 and 15m 29 the main area of risk relates to secflexible workforce expenditure in general the regional forecasts are based on further reductions in spend in this area in the latter half of the year whilst regions have put in place systems to supportdeliver this reduction due to the nature of the sec contract and volatile demand this does still present significant risk the 08m is based on spend continuing at existing levels this is fairly conservative approach and represents significant reduction in 0506 spend levels 2 at quarter 1 the budget holders were forecasting an overspend of 08m the q2 forecast represent 1m reduction compared with q1 the key movement is explained by 05m reduction in the regional expenditure net 02m reduction in national office and 03m reduction in central costs 3 the areas of significant movements within are case recording due to contract issues finance slippage on posts kld slippage on courses plus additional income and corporate legal assumed worst case at q1 at this stage know new casescommitments 4 the reduction in central costs has resulted from detailed review of depreciation charges the deprecation budget was set based on 0506 actuals the q1 forecast assumed spend to budget further detailed analysis has now been undertaken factoring in existing assets and the planned itc capital spend the revised forecast represents significant reduction compared to budget and 200506 outturn the reduction is caused by two factors firstly many of our existing fixed assets now have book value of zero and there will be further depreciation charge in year secondly there has been slippage on the itc capital spend with purchases occurring later in the year than originally anticipated with subsequent reduction in the number of months deprecation incurred in 0607 note this will create an additional budget pressure in 0708 when full years depreciation costs will be incurred on significantly increased fixed asset base 5 there are number of risks associated with the quarter 2 forecasts pay awards the forecast assumes that pay awards are containable within the existing budget ie at the current offer level discussions with the unions are at an early stage however they have already indicated that they are not prepared to recommend the current offer to members demand all of the forecasts produced by budget holders have been produced on the assumption of fairly static demand and limited backlogs significant growth in referrals or backlogs would have direct impact on the forecasts produced change programe other than it formal forecasts have been submitted for the change programe budgets based on detailed discussions with the national change manager andrew guymer breakeven continues to be forecast against these budgets there are number of areas of potential slippagerisk however at this stage it is believed that these resources could be diverted to existing pressures within other areas of the change programe meetings have now been arranged with all budget holders to discuss this further pension liability the forecasts ignore the impact of the pension liability and the frs 17 charges in effect assuming movement from the 200506 position whilst this is highly unlikely we have means of accurately forecasting this and the results of the frs 17 calculations will only be available post march 2007 in addition cafcass current resource budget allocated by dfes makes allowance for the frs 17 pension liability the balance sheet 35 the cafcass balance sheet is analysed and reviewed on monthly basis table 3 provides summary of the balance sheet at october and comparative data for the previous month and the 200506 yearend 36 further fixed asset additions have been made during october the additions relate to further expenditure on it projects with the majority of additions relating to the wan upgrade and crs enhancement project this has resulted in net increase in total fixed assets to 4634m after accounting for accumulated depreciation and cost of capital charges to date 37 there was net increase in current assets from 2348m in september to 2822m in october this increase resulted from decrease in debtors due to reduction in the level of prepayments and an increase in the bank balance due to timing differences 39 creditors increased from 6627m in september to 7014m in october the increase relates to increased accruals coverage by budget holders 0506 accruals currently stand at 0920m in october the majority of 0506 accruals relate to disputed or outstanding accommodation costs 41 provisions are reviewed on monthly basis and october provisions remain unchanged at 0326m 42 the cafcass pension liability continues to be reported as at 31 march 06 ie 58449m the position as at 31 march 2007 cannot be predicted the value will only be available after the yearend when the 0607 frs 17 valuations have been completed all forecasts produced during 0607 will assume movement in the pension liabilities and use the 0506 values as the most accurate estimate available cash 44 table 4 summarises the cash budget actual drawn down and actual spend for 0607 45 in july revised cash profile was submitted to dfes including the one off funding the budget submitted represented the most realistic estimate of cash spend at that time the revised cash budget is 1062m shortfall of 16m against cash allocation the shortfall represents the savings target in 0607 in cash terms 47 dfes have advised that they expect cafcass to deliver balanced cash budget the cash profile of the change programe will be key to this following further discussion with change budget holders revised cash profile will be developed during december factoring in the latest information and quarter 2 forecasts 49 the cash spend to date is in line with the drawdown with cash balances minimised the actual draw down to october is 15m less than the original cash profile this represents timing differences in profiled spend much of this relates to the change programe 50 during 0607 cafcass month end cash holdings have been within the dfes tolerance limits they have however been higher than in previous years this is direct result of the high levels of uncertainty and volatility in the spending of the one off funding compliance bugetary delegation purchase orderspayment performance 52 po compliance continues to show improvements as at the end of october compliance increased to 74 by invoice numbers and to 73 by invoice value if we remove the significant outliers this increases to 85 in october with respect to invoice value there are two outliers with many regions performing well above the overall figures further work has been undertaken with the outliers and improvements are anticipated with effect from november po compliance issues continue to be monitored on monthly basis 53 in line with all government departments cafcass must pay bills in timely manner in 0506 cafcass achieved performance of 815 against the 100 target this area has been targeted for improvement in 0607 with monthly statistics issued to budget holders the october and year to date statistics show some small improvement on 0506 levels 83 further work will need to be undertaken to identify and address the issues the target continues to be to move towards 9095 which would be in line with other government departments sharon reed head of strategic finance audit 21 november 2006 pic
