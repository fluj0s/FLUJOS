appropriations acts brief overview of recent practices by sandy streeter was hington december 14 1999 10 ppreventing federal government shutdowns proposals for an automatic continuing resolution for several decades difficulties in enacting regular appropriations acts and continuing resolutions in timely manner pe riodically have resulte d in funding gaps in 1980 and 1981 revised interp retations of the law governing agency behavior during funding gaps led to more aggressive enforcement of the law causing the federal government to shut down affected ag encies during funding gaps in an effort to ameliorate the consequences of th tardy enactment of appropriations some members have proposed that an automatic continuing resolution be set in place so that funding gaps would not occur and federal government shutdowns would be prevented congressional inte rest in automatic continui ng proposals was spurred by two especially troublesome funding gaps that occurred in late 1995 and early 1996 this report examines the concept of th automatic continuing resolution outlines legislative action on such proposals in the 105th and 106th congresses and provides background information on the incidence of c ontinuing resolutions and funding gaps background the annual appropriations process the routine activities of most federal agencies are funded by means of annual appropriations provided in one or more of the 13 regular appropriations acts when action on the regular appropriations acts is dela yed congress turns to continuing resolution cr to provide stopgap funding1 the cr is so named because it provides continuing appropriations in the form of joint re solution occasionally however continuing appropriations are provided in bill form crs usually fund activities under form ulatype approach that provides spending at restricted level such as the lesser of the amount passed by the house or the senate in appropriations bills not r eady for transmittal to the president in many instances the amount of funding ava ilable for particular activities is increased when the regular appropriations act is s ubsequently enacted congress is not bound by these conventions in determining fundi ng levels however and there have been many variations in practice in recent crs further crs usually do not allow new activities to be initiated funding is available only for activities conducted during the past year and existing conditions and limitations on program activity are retainedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30339crs2 2 although regular appropriations measures for fy1953 were enacted into law after the start of the fiscal year on july 1 1952 continuing appropriations were provided section 1414 of pl 82547 july 15 1952 supplemental appropriations measure for

july 28 1999 pages 127131over the past several decades the timing patterns for c ongressional action on regular appropriations acts ve varied considerably but tardy enactment has been persistent problem congress and the pres ident were not able to enact all of the regular appropriations acts on time in any year during the 25year period running from fy1952 through fy1976 as result one or more crs were enacted each year during this period except for fy19532 in an effort to reduce the reliance on crs the congressional budget act of 1974 lengthened the time available for congress to act on annual appropriations measures by moving the start of the fiscal year back three months from july 1 to october 13 notwithstanding this change there have been only four instances beginning with fy1977 when procedures under the 1974 congressional budget act first were implemented fully in which all of the regular appropriations acts were enacted on time fy1977 1989 1995 and 1997 consequently one or more crs were needed each year during this period except for fy1989 1995 and 19974 in most years more than one cr was needed as congress worked to complete action on the regular appropriations acts the number of crs enacted during the period ranged from zero to seven excep t for fy1996 when 14 separate measures providing continuing appr opriations were enacted5 in some years especially during the 1980s the final cr provided funding for one or more of the regular appropriations acts for the rema inder of the fiscal year the legal underpinning for funding gaps and shutdowns the antideficiency act 31 usc 13411342 15111519 generally bars agencies from continued operation in the absence of appropriations6 exceptions are made under the act for certain activities primarily those involving the safety of human life or the protection of property the interval during the fiscal year when agency appropriations are not enacted into law either in the form of regular appropriations

washi ngton november 8 1999 6 poctober 1 at the beginning of the fiscal year they may occur any time cr expires and another cr or the regular appropriations act is not enacted immediately thereafter also multiple funding gaps may occur for fiscal year in 1980 and 1981 attorney general be njamin civiletti issued opinions regarding the antideficiency act clarifying the need for federal agencies to begin terminating regular activities immediatel upon the occurrence of funding gap7 the narrowness of the exceptions allowe d under the act was reaffirmed by the budget enforcement act of 1990 which in part stated that the exceptions do not include ongoing regular f unctions of government the suspension of which would not imminently threaten the safety of hum an life or the protection of property8 accordingly when funding gap occu rs the federal government begins shutdown of the affected agencies shut down entails the prompt furlough of non emergency personnel9 and curtailment of agency activities including the provision of most services to the public10 the general practice of the federal government over the years has been to pay furloughed em ployees after the shutdown has ended for time missed even when work was performed when funding gap is expected to ccur the affected agencies are given guidance on the preparation for shutdown by the office of management and budget usually in the form of bulletin and the office of personnel management history of recent funding gaps as shown in table 1 there were 17 funding gaps during the 24 fiscal years covering fy1977 through fy2000 one or more funding gaps occurred in 12 of these years but there were funding gaps in the remaining 12 years in three instances for fy1983 fy1985 and fy1996 there were two funding gaps for one fiscal ear and in one instance for fy1978 there were three funding gaps the gaps ranged in duration from one to 21 full days six of the seven lengthiest funding gaps lasting from 8 to 17 days occurred between fy1977 and fy1980 before the civiletti opinions were issued in general the duration of funding gaps shortened cons iderably after the issuance of these opinions ranging from one to three days with the longer gaps occurring over weekend however fiveday and 21day funding gap for fy1996 occurred between midnovember of 1995 and early january of 1996httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30339crs4 table 1

failure to enact the initial continuing resolution by the start of the fiscal year on october 1 in the remaining 11 cases nine occurring after the civiletti opinion the funding gaps occurred between c ontinuing resolutions as the fiscal year already was underway although nine funding gaps occurred at the start of the fiscal year or during october another eight ccurred as late as november or december in some instances funding gaps resulted in the widespread furlough of federal employees and the shutdown of federal agencies the disruption was minimized most of the time because the funding gap occurred during weekend one of the most dramatic of the earlier shutdowns occurred in november 198111 funding gap began at midnight on friday november 20 when continuing resolution expired presiden t reagan vetoed further continuing resolution on the morning of monday n ovember 23 prompting shutdown the budgetary confrontation between the presid ent and congress was resolved later that day and further continuing resolution was si gned into law that evening ending the shutdown another notable shutdown occu rred during the columbus day weekend in october of 199012 perhaps the most dramatic of all s hutdowns involved fiveday and 21day shutdown for fy1996 occurring between late 1995 and early 1996 the shutdowns were due to unusually difficult and protract ed negotiations between president clinton and congress over appr opriations and other budgetary issues13 during the first of the two shutdowns about 800000 fede ral employees were furloughed automatic continuing resolution extensive reliance on crs and the occu rrence of funding gaps and federal government shutdowns have been persiste nt features of the annual appropriations process proposals have be made from time to time ove r the years to alleviatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30339crs6 14 see for example the report of the general accounting office funding gaps jeopardize federal government operations pad8131 march 3 1981 the print of the house government operations committee reform of the federal budget process an analysis of major proposals june 1987 pages 47 and the print of the senate governmental affairs committee proposed budget reforms critical analysis april 1988 pages 3235these problems by establishing an automatic continuing resolution acr14 the common feature of these proposals is the tablishment of mechanism to ensure fallback source of funding for activities at restricted level in the event the timely enactment of appropriations is disrupted the funding would become available automatically and remain ava ilable as needed so that funding gap would not occur and the furlough of federal employees would be avoided or at least severely limited features of acrs the two major variables in the design of an automatic continuing resolution are fundi ng level and duration with regard to funding level most acr proposals would set funding for th new fiscal year at level consistent with the rate of operations for the prior fiscal year or some percentage of that rate this would allow agencies to continue ope rating at close to the status quo without prejudging which programs should be increased or scaled back on the issue of duration acr proposals range from providing continuing appropriations for short interval like month to the full fiscal year or even indefinitely so that continuing appropriations would become available automatically year after year as needed some propos als stop short of providing comprehensive automatic continuing appr opriations and instead focus on continuing only basic civilian and military pay and benefits arguments for proponents of acr proposals identify several categories of problems that could they assert be avoide d if funding gaps and the ensuing federal government shutdowns were not allowed to occur first shutdowns may incur significant costs to the federal governme nt for various reasons including program inefficiencies that arise from the disruption and from making payments to federal employees after the shutdown has ended fo r period when work was not performed if the shutdown is fairly large in scale as occurred in late 1995 and early 1996 the cost to the federal government runs into hundreds of millions of dollars in addition federal employees themselves may have to contend with delayed or reduced paychecks the interruption of official travel and similar problems second shutdowns may incur significant costs to private sector entities that have business arrangements with the fede ral government or otherwise are closely aligned with federal activities lengthy shutdown may impede the timely payment of federal contractors for example ss directly businesses dependent on federally sponsored activities such as hotels and rest aurants that service visitors to national parks and monuments may suffer economic losses when these facilities shut down third shutdowns may disrupt the provision of services to program beneficiaries and the general public ce rtain benefit payments involving such programs as veterans assistance and medicare payments to health maintenance organizations may not be paid when shutdown lasts fo r any significant period citizens intendinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30339crs7 to travel overseas may not be able to obtai n passport services tourists making long planned vacations may be barred from entry at many public sites fourth many acr proponents believe that shutdowns create strong negative perception regarding the ability of elected officials to govern effectively and that the onus falls principally on congre ss rather than the president finally an acr in the view of some may promote an atmosphere at the end of the session more conducive to the cons tructive resolution of negotiations over legislation too often they assert the crisis atmosphere surrounding funding gaps late in the year pressures members into accepting lessthandesirable solutions to break legislative impasses arguments against the major concern of opponents of acr proposals is that they could serve as disincentive to enact the regular appropriations bills in timely manner or even at all by knowin g that failsafe funding mechanism in the form of an acr exists which woul d prevent the disruption from government shutdown negotiations over nnual appropriations could slow down considerably as different sides see an advantage in taking more time to pursue their goals if negotiations extended weeks past the beginning of the fiscal year without clear signs of impending agreement an acceptance of th status quo or something near to it and adjournment might be the most appealing option to many at that time in this view an acr therefore could offer congress convenient escape hatch from difficult situation when time has run out further acr critics mainta in that supporters of re duced funding levels for annual appropriations might very well see thwa rting action on the regular appropriations bills at least those that would increase spending as an important means of achieving their goal funding formula set much lower than 100 percent of the prior years level probably would encourage congressional majority to seek enactment of the regular bills but the 98 percent or 100percent formula may be seen by many as an adequate f unding level given the interest in constraining spending growth reliance upon an acr could allow congress to achieve this goal without actually taking any tough votes to cut discretionary spending significantly finally the chief drawback to form ulabased approach opponents of an acr assert is that it may engender inequitie s and undermine accountability many would argue that the notions of congressional accountability and responsibility in exercising the power of the purse entail the exercise of deliberate choice the development of annual appropria tions bills through the regular gislative process entails making thousands of separate decisions the ffects of increasing funding or decreasing funding for each account and the programs projects and activities within those accounts are carefully weighed according to various criteria all members have an opportunity to take part in th is process at some level resort to formulabased approach however treats all items the same programs in need of significant increases are treated in the same manner as programs that can be cut significantly if not eliminated altogether from this perspective when members are denied the opportunity to influence outcomes for partic ular programs they may not be held as clearly accountable for themhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30339crs8 15 see title vii the government shutdown prevention act on pages 8185 of s 672 as reported

senate appropriations committee15 the provision was sponsored by senators john mccain and kay bailey hutchison nd was based upon freestanding acr proposal they had introduced earlier s 547 pursuant to the provision the 98 percent funding level c ould remain in effect for as l ong as the entire fiscal year but would have effect bey ond fy1998 several provisions dealing with such matters as the terms and conditions coverage and charging of expenditures under continuing appropriations also were in cluded in the proposal these provisions essentially were boilerplate from recent continuing resoluti ons according to senators mccain and hutchison the funding formula 98 per cent of the prior years level was consistent with past budget resolution policy aimed at balancing the budget by fy2002 accordingly if circumstances dict ated that the funding formula remain in effect for all programs during the entire fi scal year that action would not undermine balancedbudget efforts an unsuccessful motion to strike the provision was made in committee by senator robert byrd on may 5 1997 dur ing senate consid eration of s 672 senator byrd again offered an amendment 59 to strike the provision from the bill during discussion of the proposal senato r mccain obtained unanimous consent to modify the provision raising the funding formula from 98 percent to 100 percent he explained that the recent budget mmit agreement which provided for modest increases in discretionary spending made the adjustment reasonable the byrd amendment was tabled the next day by vote of 5545 and the modified provision was retained in the bill the house considered its version of the supplemental appropriations measure hr 1469 on may 15 representative geor ge gekas offered an amendment 7 proposing an acr that was

and s 558 in addition to issues pertaining to the advantages or disadvantages of particular approaches to framing an acr cost estimates for the two proposals developed by the congressional budget
