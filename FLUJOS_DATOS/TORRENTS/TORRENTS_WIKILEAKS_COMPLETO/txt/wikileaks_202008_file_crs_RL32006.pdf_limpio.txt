commission to strengthen social security summary in 2001 president bush established the presidents commission to strengthen social security to make recommendations on ways to modernize and restore fiscal soundness to the social security system in accordance with six principles one of which mandated the creation of voluntar personal retirement accounts the commission proposed three alternative r eform models under all three proposals workers could choose to invest in personal acc ounts and have their traditional social security benefit reduced by some amount model 1 would make other changes to the program model 2 would slow program growth through one major provision that would index initial benefits to prices rather than wages model 3 would slow program growth through variety of measures including one that would index initial benefits to projected increases in life expectancy to mitigate the effects of traditional benefit reductions models 2 nd 3 would guarantee minimum benefit for lowwage earners and make changes designed to improve benefits for widowers the social security administration prepared estimates of the effect of the commissions reform models on benefit level s for future retirees and on the federal budget consistent with these stimates this repor t illustrates initial monthlybenefits for future retirees under each of the commissi ons reform plans and three alternative measures of current law benefits promised under current law benefits payable within the systems currentlaw revenue projections and benefits paid to todays retirees it also shows the projected effect on debt held by the public under model 1 if workers account earns real rate of return higher than 35 benefits would exceed those promised under current law model 1 is not projected to restore longrange solvency to the system under model 2 in most cases projected benefits would be lower than levels promised under current law under all yield assumptions projected benefits for lowwage earners would be higher than benefits payable under current law model 2 is proj ected to restore solvency to the system although general revenue tran sfers would be required under model 3 at the lower yield assumption in most cases projected benefits would be lower than those promised under current law at the higher yield assumptions in most cases projected benefits would be higher than currentlaw promised benefits under all yield assumptions projected benefits fo r lowwage earners would be higher than benefits payable under current law model 3 is projected to restore longrange solvency to the system although general revenue transfers and new dedicated revenue source for the program would be re quired this new revenue source was not specified by the commission because the funding approach under the three plans draws from redirected payroll taxes and general fund revenues it would increase debt held by the public for example assuming either twothirds or 100 of workers participate in personal accounts under model 2 additional borrowi ng is projected to peak at 25 trillion and 47 trillion constant 2001 do llars respectivelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32006contents background 1 p r s i

to the social security payroll tax the social security payroll tax is 62 of earnings up to maximum the amount of taxable earnings the taxable wage base is indexed to average wage growth in the economy in 2003 the taxable wage base is 87000 the trustees project that the payroll tax would have to be increased on average by 192 percentage points over the period to eliminate the systems longrange funding gap alternatively revenue would have to be raised by 15 or benefits would have to be reduced by 13 immediately policymakers also focus on the large imbalance between costs and revenues at the end of the 75year projection period when revenues would cover only twothirds of promised benefits thus as time goes by the imbalance portrayed in future projections will continue to increase requiring more remedial action than an immedi ate increase of 192 percentage points in the payroll taxsocial security reform effect on benefits and the federal budget of plans proposed by the presidents commission to strengthen social security background congressional interest in social secu rity reform is largely driven by the systems projected longrange financing pr oblems which are attributable primarily to ongoing and projected demographic changes rising program costs resulting from the retirement of the baby boom genera tion persons born between 1946 and 1964 is the more immediate concern in the longer term projected increases in life expectancy and declining birth rates contribute to growing imbalances in the system as fewer workers will be supporting future r ecipients the social security trustees project that between 2000 and 2025 the number of persons age 65 and older will increase by 76 while the number of workers paying into the system will increase by only 16 the ratio of covere d workers to recipients is projected to decline from 33 today to 23 in 2025 in terms of financing the trustees project that the social security trust funds will be depleted by 2042 under the intermediate assumptions once the balances in the trust funds are dep leted annual tax revenue payroll taxes and federal income taxes paid on benefits is projected to cover approximately 73 of benefit payments and less in later years1over the next 75 years on average trust fund expenditures are projected to exceed income by 14 the longrange trust fund deficit is projected to equal 192 of taxable payroll2 to many policy analysts the important date in social security financing is not 2042 the point at which the trust funds are projected to become insolvent ratherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32006crs2 3the balance in the social security trust funds represents form of iou from the general fund these ious consist of federal securities credited to the trust funds in amounts equal to annual social security surpluses plus interest trust fund balances are projected to increase through 2027 peaking at 75 trillion nominal dollars beginning in 2028 the balance in the trust funds would be drawn down to meet program expenses until depletion in 2042 over 14year period the general fund would have to come up with projected 75 trillion to cover ious credited to

of those years money would have to be drawn from the general fund of the treasury to pay benefits and administrative expenses3 policymakers have considered variety of ways to remedy the programs long range funding problems some support maintaining the existing structure of the program through traditional measures suc h as an increase in the retirement age or payroll taxes others favor redesigning the system to incorporate personal retirement accounts to supplement or replace traditional benefits the range of options is reflected in the 1997 social security advisory council report unable to reach consensus on single approach the counc il devised three different reform plans each plan received only par tial council endorsement4congressional reform proposals introduced in recent years reflect similar range of ideas5in the current congress hr 75 representative sha w would establish voluntary personal accounts social security guarantee accounts funded with general revenues account

social security in may 2001 president bush established the presidents commission to strengthen social security executive order 13210 the 16member commission appointed by the president included eight republicans and eigh t democrats all of whom had previouslyexpressed public suppor t for personal retirement accounts the president directed the commission to recommend ways to modernize and restore fiscal soundness to the social security system in accordance with the following six principles of reform modernization must not change social security benefits for retirees or nearretirees the entire social security surplus must be dedicated to socialsecurity only social security payroll taxes must not be increased government must not invest social security funds in the stock market modernization must preserve social securitys disability andsurvivors components modernization must include i ndividually controlled voluntary personal retirement accounts which will augment the social security safety net on december 21 2001 the commission issued its final report strengthening social security and creating wealth for all americans the report which was unanimously approved by the commission in cludes three alternative plans for reforming social security under all thre plans workers could choose to invest in personal retirement accounts8and their traditional socia l security benefit would be offset the amount of the offset would vary under the three plans the first plan model 1 would make other changes to the program the second plan model 2 is projected to slow the growth of socia l security benefits through one major provision that would index initial benefits to prices rather than wages the third plan model 3 would slow future program growth through variety of measures to mitigate the effects of benefit reductions models 2 and 3 would guarantee minimum benefit for lowwage earners and make changes designed to improve benefits for widowers the commission described model 1 as flexible framework in which the personal account contributions might be fina nced entirely as redirection of payroll tax revenue carveout entirely from the general revenue of the treasury an addon or combination of the two u nder model 2 portion of existing payroll tax contributions would be used to f und the accounts carveout funding approach under model 3 workers could make additional payroll tax contributions to fund their accounts an addon fundi ng approach and receive matching contributions carved out of existing pay roll taxes these additional contributionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32006crs4 9the annual contribution limit creates progressive system in which lowerwage earners would be allowed to contribute higher percenta ge of their earnings for example worker who earns 20000 year would be allowed t contribute 800 to personal account 20000 x 4 800 or 4 of earnings w orker who earns 80000 year would be allowed to contribute 1000 to persona l account 80000 x 4 3200 subject to the annual limit of 1000 or 125 of earningswould be subsidized for lowerwage workers according to the commissions report model 1 would not restore solvenc to the social security system models 2 and 3 are projected to restore solvency to the system on average over the next 75 years however annual cashflow deficits are expected to occur at points during the projection period and general revenues w ould be required to close the systems financing gap in the case of model 3 ne w permanent revenue source would also be required see effect of reform models on the federal budget below commission reform models commission model 1 under model 1 workers would be allowed to divert 2 percentage points of their social security payroll taxes 2 of taxable earnings to personal retirement account or an quivalent amount could be drawn from the general fund and their tra ditional social security be nefit would be reduced the amount of the reduction would be equal to w hat the personal account would provide had it earned 35 real rate of return ie for purposes of determining the benefit offset the account is assumed to earn 35 in real terms in practice the payment worker would receive from his or her account would depend on the actual rate of return therefore if the actual rate of r eturn earned by the account is higher than 35 the workers combined benefit tr aditional social security benefit plus personal account would exceed benefits pr omised under current law conversely if the actual rate of return is lower than 35 the workers combined benefit would be lower relative to promised currentlaw benefits model 1 would make other changes to the program commission model 2 under model 2 workers would be allowed to divert 4 percentage points of their payroll taxes to personal retirement account up to an annual maximum of 1000 indexed to average wage growth9and their traditional social security benefit would be reduced the amount of the reduction would be equal to what the account would provide had i t earned 2 real rate of return ie for purposes of determining the benefit offset the account is assumed to earn 2 in real terms the payment worker woul d receive from his or her account however would depend on the actual rate of return if the actual rate of return exceeds the assumed rate the payment provided by the account would exceed the benefit offset if the actual rate of return is lower than the assumed rate the payment provided by the account would be smaller than the benefit offset in terms of traditional benefits mode l 2 would change the social security benefit formula in order to constrain the gr owth in initial benefits for future retirees under current law initial benefits are indexed to the growth in average wages wageindexing in the benefit formula results in benefit levels that provide each generation of workers constant earnings replacement rate ie initial benefitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32006crs5 10under current law longrange replacement rates are estimated at 56 for lowwage earners ie earnings equal to 45 of the average wage 42 for averagewage earners and 28 for maximumwage earners ie earnings at or above the maximum taxable wage 11once benefits begin they are adjusted annually according to price growth annual cost ofliving adjustments allow benefits to ma intain their purchasing power over time 12there are different approaches to price indexing the mechanism used by the social security administration ssa actuaries in timating benefit levels under model 2 involves downward adjustments in the replacement factors in the benefit formula which are currently fixed at 90 32 and 15 see footnote 14 for description of the currentlaw benefit formula other components of the be nefit formula average indexed monthly earnings and bend points would rem ain indexed to average wage growth 13while price indexing initial social security benefits would result in lower replacement rates for future retirees benefits paid to future retirees would provide the same level of purchasing power as benefits paid to todays retireesreplace approximately the same percentage of preretirement earnings for workers with equivalent lifetime earnings10by design this feature of the program allows successive generations of workers to share increases in the standard of living when they retire11model 2 would alter this aspect of the program by indexing initial benefits to price growth rather than wage growth beginning in 200912because wages are projected to grow faster than prices over time shift to price indexing would result in substantial benefit reductions and lower replacement rates for future retirees thereby reducing social securitys role as an earnings replacement program13 to mitigate the effects of price indexing model 2 would provide minimum benefit and make changes intended to imp rove benefits for widowers workers who earn the minimum wage for at least 30 years would be guaranteed benefit equal to 120 of the poverty level wi dowers would receive 75 of the couples combined predeath benefit compare d to 5067 under current law although widowers would receive higher percenta ge of the couples combined benefit as benefits are reduced over time eventually some widowe rs would receive benefits under the plan that would be lower than those promised under current law commission model 3 under model 3 workers would be allowed to contribute an additional 1 percentage point of payroll taxes to personal retirement account and receive 25 percentage point matching contribution up to 1000 annually from current payroll taxes low erwage workers would receive partial rebateon their additional 1 contributio n through refundable tax credit workers who choose to participate in personal acc ounts would have their traditional social security benefit reduced under this pla n the reduction would be equal to what the account would provide had it earned 25 r eal rate of return ie for purposes of determining the benefit offset the account is assumed to earn 25 in real terms the payment worker would receive from his or her account would depend on the actual rate of return if the actual rate of return exceeds the assumed rate the payment provided by the account would exceed the offset to traditional social security benefits if the actual rate of return is lower than the assumed rate the payment provided by the account would be less than the benefit offsethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32006crs6 14under the current benefit computation formula three replacement factors are applied to three brackets of workers average indexed monthly earnings aime to determine the basic monthly benefit amount to get the aime workers past earnings are indexed to reflect the growth in average wages over time and an average monthly amount is computed based on the 35 highest years the two aime amounts that separate the three brackets called bend points are indexed to average wage growth in 2003 the basic benefit formula is 90 of the first 606 of aime plus 32 of aime over 606 through 3653 plus 15 of aime over 3653 under model 3 the third replacement factor would be lowered gradually from 15 to 10model 3 would reduce socia l security benefits for fut ure retirees by slowing the growth in initial benefits to reflect projected increases in life expectancy it would reduce benefits for higherwage workers thr ough other changes in the benefit formula the third replacement factor in the benefit formula would be lowered gradually from 15 to 1014as under model 2 it would provide minimum benefit and make changes designed to improve benefits for widowers workers who earn the minimum wage for at least 30 years would be guaranteed benefit equal to 100 of the poverty level widowers would rece ive 75 of the couples combined pre death benefit compared to 5067 under current law as under model 2 widowers would receive higher percenta ge of

social security personal account structure the commission makes only broad recommendations on how personal accounts s hould be structured within the social security system the commission speci fies that personal accounts should be administered by governmentappointed boa rd possibly modeled after the thrift savings plan board which manages define d contribution plan for federal workers or the federal reserve board once the acc ount reaches certain value the worker should be allowed to transfer the acc ount to private provider the co mmission further recommends that workers invest in broadlydiversified portfolio of corporate stocks corporate bonds and govern ment bonds and that workers be allowed to change investment allocations more than once every 12 months according to the commission workers should have access to their accounts only upon retirement and they should be re quired to take account distributions as an annuity guaranteed payment for life or as periodic payments lumpsum distributions should be allowed only on the portion of the account that exceeds the level of assets needed to provide the retired worker combined benefit traditional social security plus personal account above the poverty level married couples who annuitize their account balances should be r equired to purchase twothirds joint and survivor annuity which provides the surviving spouse with benefit equal to twothirds of the couples combined pre death benefit upon divorce account assets attributable to contributi ons made during the marriage and earnings on account balances

which workers have the same relative level of earnings each year throughout their careersretirement the account bala nce should be tra nsferrable to the account of the surviving spouse if applicable or to the workers estate it is important to note that s ocial security benefit cons traints prescribed under models 2 and 3 would apply acrosstheboard to retirement survivors and disability benefits regardless of whether the wor ker chooses to participate in personal retirement accounts however the co mmission acknowledged that the disability component of the program warrants more car eful deliberation nd recommended that reform of the disability program be considered separately ssa benefit estimates in january 2002 the social security administrations ssas office of the chief actuary prepared benefit estimates for future retirees under each of the commissions reform plans15these estimates are based on the intermediate assumptions of the 2001 social security tr ustees report and additional assumptions made bythe actuaries regarding returns on private securities administrative expenses for personal accounts and annuities and p ersonal account participation rates hypothetical workers the ssa actuaries provide benefit estimates for both one and twoearner couples at different earnings levels retiring in 2012 2022 2032 2042 2052 and 2075 when viewing the followi ng figures depicting these estimates note that the jump from 10year intervals from 2012 to 2052 to the 23year interval in 2052 to 2075 tends to make the slope reflec ting growth in benefit levels appear relatively steeper at the end of the projection period the change in intervals is noted with brackets on the figures thus one should not assume necessarily that there is some feature in particular model that accelerates benefit growth in those years in the case of twoearner couple both members are assumed to have equal earnings in all cases both members of couple are assumed to retire at the same time at age 65 illustrative earnings levels because social security benefit levels are based on workers earnings history the ssa actuaries provide benefit estimates using four illustrative earnings patterns scaled low earnings scaled medium earnings scaled high earnings and steady maximum earnings16the illustrative earnings patterns are defined as followshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32006crs8 17the availability of inflationindexed annuities is very limited in the current annuity market the actuaries prepared second set of estimates based on variable annuity option which results in higher projected initial monthly benefits the actuaries consider the fixed annuity option to be the primary set of estimates in their view individuals would be less likely to choose the variable annuity option because payments could decline from one year to the next 18a jointandtwothirdssurvivor annuity provides the surviving spouse an amount equal to twothirds of the couples combined predeath amountscaled low earner earnings of 15875 in 2002 scaled medium earner earnings of 35277 in 2002 scaled high earner earnings of 56443 in 2002 steady maximum earner earnings of 84900 in 2002 the scaled low earnings pattern approximates the average lifetime earnings of steady lowwage earner ie someone who always earned 45 of the national average wage the scaled medium earnings pattern approximates the average lifetime earnings of steady averagewage worker ie someone who always earned the national average wage the scaled high earnings pattern approximates the average lifetime earnings of steady highwage worker ie someone who always earned 160 of the national average wage the steady maximum earner is someone who always earned at least the maximum amount of earnings subject to the social security payroll tax ie the taxable wage base traditional social security benefits are based on average career earnings therefore scaled and steady earnings patterns result in approximately the same level of benefits personal account accumulati ons however depend on the level of earnings in each year of workers career among other factors as such scaled and steady earnings patterns result in diffe rent annuity values the ssa actuaries use scaled earnings patterns which they consider to be more representative of actual experience to estimate future benefit level s under the reform models and current law yield assumptions the ssa actuaries provide be nefit illustrations under three alternative investment yields for t he personal accounts low yield 50 equity yield and high yield the low investment yi eld reflects the longterm rate on us treasury bonds the 50 equity yield is designed to represent an average investment portfolio of 50 equity 30 corporate bonds and 20 treasury bonds the high investment yield reflects tfolio of 60 equity 24 corporate bonds and 16 treasury bonds the actuaries used these assumptions to project the following illustrative yields low yield 30 real investment yield 50 equity yield 46 real investment yield high yield 53 real investment yield estimates assume that at the time of retirement the entire balance in the personal account is converted to an inflationindexed17jointandtwothirds survivor annuity18administrative expenses for persona l accounts and annuities are

assumptions of the 2001 social security trustees report while projecti ons are made on 75year basis annual fluctuations in these variables are typically projected for only the first 10 years for the remainder of the 75year projection period these factors are held steady at their ultimate values on the basis that changes in these f actors over the long run average out to the ultimate values changes in average wage growth inflation interest rates and other variables are difficult to predict over 75year period outcomes projected under the commissions reform plans would vary to the extent that actual experience differs from the intermediate assumpti ons in the 2001 trustees report individuals assume degree of risk whe n personal account contributions are invested in equities personal account outco mes projected by the actuaries are based on 30 46 or 53 real investment yi eld in each year of the investment period in practice yeartoyear fluctuations in i nvestment yields would affect the eventual balance in the account the account balance could be hig her or lower based on the actual annual returns actual personal account balances would depend on several factors including the length of the investment period the level and timing of account contributions and investment yields and administrative costs in addition benefit levels under the pr oposals would be affected by the monthly annuity the personal account would provide in practice annuity values would be very sensitive to the annuitization rules sp ecified in the law and regulations and tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32006crs10 21for more information on annuitization issues please refer to crs report rl31324 social security reform the effect of economic variability on individual accounts and their annuities by geoffrey kollmann dawn nuschler and patrick purcell 22the use of unisex life expectancy tables is somewhat controversial as result of 1983 supreme court decision employers ponsored retirement plans such as the federal thrift savings plan must use unisex life expectancy tables to compute annuity payments the court held that the use of genderspecific life expectancy tables in employersponsored plans had violated title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 arizona governing commission for tax deferred annuity deferred compensation plans v norris 463 us 1073 the ruling does not apply to individually purchased annuitiesthe prevailing interest rates at the time the annuity is purchased21for example the actuaries projections assume that the ntire account balance would be annuitized if some workers were allowed to take par t of the account balance as lump sum as recommended by the commission monthly annuity values would be lower furthermore projected annuity values are based on average life expectancy for the total us population as opposed to life exp ectancy weighted by income and gender life expectancy adjusted for income w ould result in somewhat higher annuity payments for lowerpaid workers and somewhat lower payments for higherpaid workers because women live longer than men on average life expectancy adjusted by gender would result in somewhat low er payments for women and somewhat higher payments for men22 illustration of benefit effects consistent with the benefit estimates prepared by the actuaries this report illustrates initial monthly benefits for fut ure retirees under each of the commissions reform plans and current law estimates are shown in constant 2001 dollars it should be noted that the actuaries have constr ucted the benefit examples to reflect the amount payable on workers record the refore in the case of oneearner couple the amount shown represents the combined benefit payable to the retired worker and spouse in the case of twoearner couple th amount shown represents the benefit payable to each retired worker or each member of the couple for example as shown in figure 8 twoearner couple with scaled low earnings retiring at age 65 in 2012 is projected to receive 734 each under model 2 based on 30 real investment yield as shown in figure 11 under the same scenario oneearner couple is projected to receive combined benefit of 1093 alternative baselines for comparison purposes each figure shows initial monthly benefits projected under the commissions reform plans and three alternative measures of current law benefits promised under current law benefits computed under the cu rrentlaw benefit formula benefits payable under current law amount of currentlaw benefits th at would be payable if benefits were adjusted to fit within the systems projected revenuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32006crs11 23it can be said that it is unreasonable to portray situation where legislative action is ever taken to correct social securitys financial imbalance leading to precipitous benefit cuts in 2038 however by definition current law means change in the programs financing or benefit structure furtherm ore to posit when or what action would be taken is purely speculative2001 benefit levels benefits paid to todays retirees the reader must use caution when comparing these projected benefit levels neither promised benefits or proposed bene fits are fully funded under current law both require additional revenue benef its projected under models 2 and 3 require general revenue infusions benefits pr omised under current law imply the use of increased payroll taxes andor general revenue infusions to pay benefits in full after 2037 based on the 2038 insolvency date projected in the 2001 trustees report in contrast the currentlaw pa yable baseline does not llow for additional revenue sources so benefits must be constrained t fit within projected revenue under current law therefore it is hardly surprising that after 2037 benefits projected under the reform models and benefits promised under current law are always higher than benefits payable under current law23 several other points are worth keepin g in mind when comparing projected benefit levels under the proposals and the lternative measures of current law first the estimates are based on the assumptio n that personal accounts would first be available in 2004 to workers who were under age 55 at the beginning of 2002 ie workers born in 1948 or later therefore among the illustrations shown here only workers retiring in 2052 and 2075 at age 65 could experience full career under the personal account system assuming workers begin investing in personal accounts at the start of their career these individuals would have the advantage of longer periods over which to grow their accounts this advantage would be offset by the second point which is that under models 2 nd 3 the effects of proposed reductions in traditional social security benefits w ould be cumulative eg price indexing initial benefits under model 2 therefor younger cohorts would experience increasingly larger reductions in traditi onal benefits over the projection period effect of commission model 1 on benefit levels under model 1 the only change to currentlaw social security is the reduction in benefits that occurs when worker chooses to participate in per sonal retirement accounts this reduction is equal to what the pers onal account would p rovide had it earned 35 real investment yield how workers fare comp ared to current law is therefore entirely function of the real investment yield n the personal account if the account earns less than 35 the worker will do less we ll than under current law if it earns more than 35 the worker will do better this is clearly shown in the benefit illustrations provided by the ssa actuaries in all instances where the real investment yield is portrayed as 3 the illustrated couple does less well than under current law in all instances where the real investment yield is portrayed as 46 or 53 the illustrated coupl does better than under current law the same conclusion pplies if comparisons are made to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32006crs12 24the projected benefit effects discussed below are for twoearner couples the more typical case projected benefit effects for oneearner couples are shown in the figures and in the data tables in appendix baseline of social security be nefits payable under current law as an example of the effect of model 1 figure 7 shows projected benefit l evels for twoearner couples with medium earnings under all thre investment yield scenarios see tables a1 through a3 in appendix because of the simplicity and obvious effects of model 1 and the fact that it has so little impact on the systems financing this report focuses analysis on models 2 and 3 effect of commission model 2 on benefit levels figures 831 illustrate the effects of model 2 on future benefit levels for range of hypothetical workers24 currentlaw promised baseline under model 2 early in the projection period lowwage earners are projected to receive higher benefits than those promised under current law even under the lowyiel d assumption under the 30 investment yield scenario twoearner couple retirin g in 2022 is projected to receive benefits that are 11 higher than benefits pro mised under current law for retirees in 2042 and later proposed benefits would be low er than benefits promised under current law under the 46 and 53 investment yield scenarios twoearner couples retiring in 2012 through 2052 are projected to receive higher benefits than promised under current law however by the end of the projection period under all investment yield scenarios lowwage earners would receive benefits below levels promised under current law depending on the investment yield assumption reductions are projected to range from 7 to 28 for workers at other wage levels benefits are projected to be below levels promised under current law except for two cases where they are unchanged the largest reductions occur late in the projec tion period due to the cumulative effects of price indexing the primary change in traditional benefits under model 2 while retirees in 2012 are projected to receive bene fits less than 1 below levels promised under current law workers retiring in 2075 would experience reductions ranging from 16 to 42 depending on earnings level and investment yield assumption for example with 53 investment yi eld twoearner couple with medium earnings retiring in 2075 is projected to receive 16 lower benefit under the proposal with 30 investment yield twoearner couple with maximum earnings retiring in 2075 would receive 42 lower benefit compared to levels promised under current law all workers would be subject to the reduc tions in traditional benefits projected under model 2 whether or not they choose to p articipate in personal accounts by the end of the projection period traditional b enefits would be significantly lower than benefits promised under current law pr imarily due to the effect of price indexing over time for example traditional benefits are projected to be 35 lower for two earner couple with low earnings and 46 lower for twoearner couple with maximum earnings see table 1 below and table a4 in appendix httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32006crs13 25in 2012 2022 and 2032 benefits payable under current law would be the same as benefits promised under current law because the system would be able to pay promised benefits in full until 2038 under intermediate assumptions of the 2001 social security trustees report in 2042 2052 and 2075 there would be substantial differences in projected benefit levels under

benef its under model 2 relative to the currentlaw payable baseline for example with 46 investment yield twoearner couple with low earnings retiring in 2012 is pr ojected to receive 2 higher benefit similar couples retiring in 2042 and 2075 woul d receive projected benefits that are 51 and 34 higher respectively than those payable under current law this outcome is attributable to the minimum benefit guarantee for longterm lowwage earners and the way personal account cont ributions are structured under model 2 lowwage earners may contribute larger percentage of their earnings because of the dollar limit on account contributions except for two cases where benefits are unchanged workers at other wage levels retiring early in th projection period 2012 2022 and 2032 are projected to receive lower benefits compared to those payable under current law later in the projection period in most cases project ed benefits would be higher than those payable under current law pr imarily at

for twoearner coupl with low earnings retiring in 2012 are projected to be around 16 higher than thos paid to todays retirees twoearner couple with low earnings retiring in 2075 is projected to receive 38 higher benefits under the 30 yield assumption and 81 higher benefits under the 53 yield assumption under the 46 yield scena rio twoearner couple with maximum earnings retiring in 2012 would

projected to eliminate the systems longrange actuarial deficit and improve the systems fiscal outlook over the infinite horizon beyond the t raditional 75year projection period using carveout funding approach for p ersonal accounts under model 2 is projected to result in larger annual cashflow defic its compared to current law for roughly 30 years coinciding with period of increasing fiscal pressure related to the aging of the us population and significant projected growth in health care costs among other factors supporters argue that while the c ommissions reform models are projected to increase the nearterm fiscal burden they would have positive fiscal effects over the long run they argue that partially advancefunded system would reduce the longterm cost of the program to the government and allow workers who choose to participate in personal accounts to mak up for some or all of the reductions in traditional benefits that would be needed to bring the system into balance

security appendix b general accounting office analysis of commission reform models at the request of the senate committee on aging the general accounting office gao issued report37that analyzes the reform models recommended by the presidents commission the gao repor t focused primarily on model 2 the gao used two alternative outcomes one with uni versal 100 participation in personal accounts and one with participation in p ersonal accounts the assumptions used regarding economic growth were those contained in the intermediate assumptions of the 2001 trustees report presumably under these assumptions the projected average real rate of return on persona l accounts inve sted in broad mix of funds would be 46 about 8 in nominal terms t he same as used in the intermediate rate of return scenario shown in ssas benefit examples in terms of benefit adequacy and individual equity the report found that under model 2 future retirees who chose to partic ipate in personal accounts would receive combination of social security and pers onal account benefits that despite the benefit offset would be higher than for retirees who chose not to participate in personal accounts if participation in p ersonal accounts were universal the combination of benefits would be higher than those that would be paid in the future if benefits were reduced to fit within the programs projected revenue if participation in personal accounts were not universal retirees who did not choose to participate in personal accounts eventua lly would receive benefits that would be lower than those that would be paid in the fu ture if benefits were reduced to fit within the programs projected revenue the c ohort results under model 3 are generally similar to model 2 in terms of the effect on the program financing the gao found that model 2 would reduce the cost of the program and provide sustainable solvency without general revenue subsidies and regardless of whether workers participate in personal accounts however if all workers chose t participate in personal accounts over three decades of general revenue transfers would be needed to achieve trust fund solvency model 3 also restores solven cy over the 75year period regardless of whether workers participate in personal accounts although general fund revenues are needed throughout the projection period t keep social security solvent however if participation in personal accounts were universal at the end of the projection period the social security trust fund ratio would be declining whereas if participation were zero it would be risinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32006crs90 appendix c members of the presidents commission to strengthen social security cochairmen patrick moynihan democrat former new york senator and
