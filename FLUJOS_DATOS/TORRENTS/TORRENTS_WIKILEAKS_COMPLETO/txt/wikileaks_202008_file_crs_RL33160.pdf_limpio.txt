efforts of the 110th congress to understand and apply broad base d objective criteria when evalua ting progress in the nations efforts to combat terrorism it is not intended to define specific indepth metrics for measuring progress against terrorism how one perceives and measures prog ress is central to formulating and implementing antiterror strategy perception has major impact as well on how nations prioritize and allocate resources on the flip side the parameters used to measure progress can set the framework for the measurement of failure the measurement process is also inextricably linked to strategies progress is possible using diverse strategies under very different approaches the goals of terrorists and those who combat them are often diametrically opposed but may also be tangential with both sides achieving objectives and making progress according to their different measurement systems within the context of these competing views and objectives terrorist activity may be seen as process which includes discrete quantumlike changes or jumps often underscoring its asy mmetric and nonlinear nature an approach which looks at continuous metrics such as lower numbers of casualties may indicate success while at the same time the terrorists may be redirecting resources towards vastly more devastating projects policymakers may f ace consideration of the pros and cons of reallocating more of the nations limited resources away from ongoing defensive projects and towards preventing the next qua ntum jump of terrorism even if this means accepting losses measurement of progress or lack thereo f may be framed in terms of incidents attitudes and trends common pitfall of governments seeking to demonstrate success in antiterrorist measures is overreliance on quantitative indicators particularly those which may correlate with progress but not accurately measure it such as the amount of money spent on antite rror efforts as rrorism is complex multidimensional phenomenon eff ective responses to terrorism may need to take into account nd to some degree be individually configured to respond to the evolving goals strategies tactics and operating environment of different terrorist groups although terrorisms complex webs of characteristics along with the inherent secrecy and compartmentalizati on of both terrorist organizations and government responses limit available data the formulation of practical useful measurement criteria appears both tractable and ready to be addressed this report will not be

defining budgets in terms of inputs and program outputs to focus on outcomes and results the statute defines output measures as the tabulation calculation or recording of activity or effort and can be

dynamics of the phenomenon to be measur ed ie terrorism and what would generally be required from any entities government or otherwise tasked with establishing and evaluating measures of ffectiveness it is not intended to define counterterrorism activities nor to creat definitive indepth methodology for measuring progress against terrorism rather it is designed to provide added tools and insights to support congress in its fforts to coordinate fund and oversee the nations antiterrorism activities importance of measuring progr ess in antite rror efforts the government performance and results act gpra requires agencies to set goals and objectives for their performance and to measure progress against these goals and objectives under the law antiterror efforts are not exempt from these requirements without which the objectiv evaluation of progress to the full satisfaction of congre ss might be impeded1 rising costs of antiterrorism efforts have become an increasing problem the vast land area of the united states and widespread us interests abroad are impossible to protect entirely billions of dollars have been spent to develop anti terror technologies establish crisis ma

security jan 14 2005whether the money would be better spent for instance building secular schools in islamic countries or promoting public re lations efforts aimed at young muslims remains an important policy question veloping robust measurement criteria might assist government officials in answering such questions it is unclear just how much the unite d states spends overseas annually in non military areas to combat terrorism but the am ounts are in the billions of dollars for fy2004 the government accountability offi ce gao put the figure at 11 billion2 at home dollar amounts spent on terrorismre lated security by the 50 states are elusive as well but fy2006 appropriations for the department of homeland security topped 30 billion 308 b illion3 arguably existing legislation requires government agencies to be held accountab for the costeffectiveness of these mammoth expenditures on combating terrorism demonstrable measurable effective progress against terrorism is the desired goal challenges in measuring progress among the various us government agen cies involved in antiterrorism efforts there is currently common set of crite ria for measuring success although over four years have elapsed since the tragic events of september 11 2001 many agencies are still attempting to estab lish and define precise crite ria and standards without which they cannot measure organizational performance4 uncertainty with respect to both strategies and measurements makes it difficult to describe progress accurately and to demonstrate progress to the public or us allies different types of terrorist threats may carry different risks and potential impacts and strategies may need to adapt accordingly for instance different strategies may be applicable to terrorism rooted in political or economic vs cultural or theocratic origins such differences in threats and our response strategies make measurement of progress more difficult for the greatest success the war on terrorism like the war on drugs must arguably be conducted and measured in multifaceted manner on many fronts with sufficient resources allocated to each strategi c element it is usually not possible to achieve this approach due to funding limitations and the resu lt is vulnerabilities in certain areas where acknowledgment of lack of progress may be politically unpopular of concern to some is that efforts to gauge progress may be compromised should measurement criteria selectively targ et areas of apparent relative progresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33160crs3 5 note that the 911 commission report has estim ated the cost of the 911 attack at under 500000 others put at under 35000 the cost of the oct 12 2002 nightclub bombing in bali and at under 50000 the cost of the bombing of the uss cole on oct 12 2000 6 for an overview of us anti terror strategy see crs report rl32522 us antiterror strategy and the 911 commission report by raphael perl the us government strategy is currently undergoing review at the nsc such as increased airport security while other areas such as port security may remain underaddressed another area of concern is th at antiterrorist actions might be undertaken for wide range of reasons without being clearly linked to previously defined antiterror goals in such circ umstances caution woul d likely be warranted before characterizing results as progress common misconception is that by increasing expenditures the nation is necessarily making good progress as practical matter the nation cannot secure everything everywhere terrorist operati ons are relatively inexpensive to organize and carry out especially in comparison to the damage they may inflict or the cost of trying to prevent them from happening5 consequently spe nding more money may not necessarily increase security proporti onally moreover some suggest that the united states is bleeding itself dry economically like the soviet union did in its attempts to match western military spending during the cold war some contend that the biggest threat to democracy from terrorism is not destruction of property and life but rather an inexorable erosion of civil liberties worldwide other concerns are loss of in ternational unity due to policy differences loss of opportunities due to budget and po licy constraints nd reduction of us stature and public relations image abroad these and many other factors form mosaic of measurements that highlight the complexities of analyzing progress impact of perceptions on strategy how one perceives and measures prog ress is central to formulating and implementing antiterror strategy6 the perception of progress has major impact on establishing priorities and allocating resources the parameters used to measure progress can also set the framework for meas urement of failures to better define the parameters of success it is important to determine what both the terrorists and those who fight them see as their goals and priorities critical to the measurement process is the realization that measurements are inextricably linked to strategies positive progress is possible using diverse strategies which may employ very different tactics for example some nations take hard line against radical islamists including target ed assassination while other nations appear to have more laissezfaire if not conciliatoryacco mmodating approach both strategies can claim progress using different measurements an important consideration in formulating measurable stra tegies is reduction of uncertainty through clear enunciation of policyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33160crs4 7 see httpwwwwhite housegovnewsreleases200509images 20050928_ p092805pm0055jpg515hhtml 8 see httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases20030220032147html similarly in

national endowment fo r democracy on october 6 200512 measurement issues though some 200 million is said to have b een have been confiscated it is not clear how much damage has been done to th terrorists ability to raise or transfer additional funds moreover if one terminat 23 of the senior leadership of particular terrorist organization the ra nks of the organization may grow and decentralize similar to the impact of att acks on drug cartels evolving into more resilient adversary another key issue is how one measures the impact of unintended consequences or side effects and byproducts nd other results such as diverting scarce resources from one policy area to another increasing spending and possibly adding to the budget deficit or eroding civil liberties13 these types of issues were often not addressed in the patterns of global terrorism reports of previous years14 however in contrast the successor to patterns titled country reports on terrorism now emphasizes indepth comprehensive analysis15 describing and measuring progress against terrorism terrorism as process the phenomenon of terrorism can be s een as comprising human elements supporters and hard core rrorists and ideological ements to the degree that terrorism is viewed as process the phe nomenon is similar to pipeline or factory assembly line with key stations along the way the process includes ideological outreach acquisition of funding nd support recruitment organization indoctrination training planni ng targeting attack explo itation of resu lts financialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33160crs6 16 note that antiterror is also process w ith its own pipeline and its own targeting this raises the issue of whether the us ability to get inside the terrorist planning cycle and provide credible warning and suggested pr otective measures is better today than in preceding years see crs report rl32897 post 911 threat notification efforts by john rollins 17 see crs report rs21937 911terrorism global economic costs by dick nanto rewards and other factors which lead to production of terrorist acts any such proposed antiterrorism model would be ad apted for specific terrorist groups since such groups may operate differently challenge facing those who seek to measure progress against terrorism is to identify critical outcomedetermining elements and assess how well they have been mitigated disrupting the process of terrorism as early as possible is vital since it can eventually become an economic engine in its own right with increasing numbers of individuals and businesse s deriving financial benef its and developing vested interests the terrorists initial search for ideolo gical or financial supporters and physical recruits comes at the beginning of the proce ss important here is the level of state support or opposition to such activities at subsequent phase one might look at the organization or network and seek to measure its effectiveness and resiliency in addition to measuring the terrorism process itself structural and environmental factors also require evaluation is the dependance on certain factors that terrorists or antiterrorists can exploit as vulnerabilities increasing or decreasing how seamlessly do terrorist organizations and networks inter act how seamlessly do new government antiterrorist organizati onal structures and networks interact is the international operating environment becoming more or less inviting or restrictive for terrorists or fo r those combating them is it easier or harder today for terrorists to inflict the damage they seek to do16 also important is the postattackrecove ry period since not all targets can be protected at all times some will likely be hit hence the effectiveness of post attackincident recovery is significant factor in measuring the success or failure of terrorist operations is the ability of the united states to recover from bombings or similar attacks stronger today than it was several years ago or not increasingly as terrorist groups seek to cause economic damage the ability of governments to recover rapidly economically in the aftermath of terrorist attacks becomes an important indicator of progress in combating the phenomenon of terrorism17 success at each stage of the process can be measured in various ways including relatively continuous metrics such as the number of recruits the dollars expended the economic value of targets the number of casualties inflicted etc similar assessment categories can be veloped for other pertinent factors such as societal or environmental aspects of terrorism related factors ma sometimes be grouped for convenience of discussion or to re nder them more amenable to certain mathematical treatment measurements may be compared at various points in time or otherwise analyzed inferentiallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33160crs7 18 note that correlation between terrorism and poverty as well as correlation between poverty and other forms of violent crime has yet to be clearly established major concern is that anger frustration and rese ntment fueled by poverty may be subject to manipulation and channeled into terrorist causesit is natural to assume that decreases in terrorist activity or even slowing rate of increase reflect progress in antiterror efforts arguably however this type of measurement may underestimate the varied nature of terrorist actions the often asymmetric nonlinear nature of terrorist operations frequently characterized by abrupt changes increases the deadliness of the threat and necessitates measurements of progress that more accurately reflect this additional danger measuring terrorism as quantum change it is important to recognize that terrorist activities and concomitant antiterrorist efforts evolve as set of actions incidents and othe r manifestations evidenced by quantumlike jumps and changes in state this may make it more difficult to measure success or failure but this view is compatible with the complexities in this area for instance once suicide bombing starts it presents qualitatively different environment than before and changes the nature of the threat likewise small bombings may be on continuum but the attacks of 911 were qualitatively different phenomenon once terrorism calates to new plateau it becomes increasingly dangerous like the mutation of virus to more virulent strain as terrorism mutates so must an eff ective response designed to counter it once terrorism has escal ated to higher level previous response may be less effective hence terrorism requires proactive and quickly malleable policy of prevention and mitigation one concern is that the phenomenon of rrorism if not effectively challenged and disrupted may at some point jump to become regional or global pandemic of violence as an accepted modus operandi for social change yet another concern is that terrorism will become the ballot box for the dispossessed if the gap between the haves and have nots continues to widen18 arguably therefore it is important not only to measure where terrorism is but also how close terrorists are to the next quantum jump the potential quantum jump currently of greatest concern to many w ould be to wmd chemical biological or radiologicalnuclear in th is view focal point of m easurement would be how close the terrorists are to this next level what it would take for them to achieve it and how well the nation is preventing them from getting there what are possible indicators that quantum jump is imminent indicators of quantum change some of the possible indicators expe rts look to or might look to as an indication that terrorist group is about to move to anot her level includehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33160crs8 intelligence ability of terrorists to ascertain specific knowledge critical to exploiting the nations vulnerabilities or to thwarting anti terror operations technology closeness of access to critical quantum change producing technology or equipment incorporating such technology impact on society both material and psychological impact beyond critical threshold such as disr uption of the banking system or establishment of such pervasive fear that key civil liberties or moral principles underlying the national identity are set aside by the government in the interests of security targets and their protection shifts from individual targets to mass casualties shifts from focus on highvisibility targets to coordinated attacks against multiple softer targets yielding domino effect with megaimpact including megaimpact on morale generally dramatic shifts in the scale and brutality of attacks alliances the emergence of new synergistic terrorist alliances and the willingnessability of terrorist organizations to form alliances with other terrorist and criminal networks andor rogue states this synergy could escalate terrorist operations in nonlinear manner disruption largeimpact unexpected attacks which could force antiterror operations into solely defensive posture amount of unproductive energy expended the degree to which terrorists force governments to expend critical limit of funds or resources beyond which certain antiterror efforts become unsustainable and mu st be curtailed sophistication of effort hijacking an airplane to hold passengers hostage vs doing so to use it as missile suicide bombings by lone individuals vs suicide bombings by trucks with high explosives hijacking of web pages vs widespread disruption of communications networks using sophisticated computer viruses use of conventional explosives vs dirty bombs moralemomentum ordinary recruitment of small number of disenchanted fanatics vs the cr itical mass of group dynamics needed to foment and propagate terrorism as selfsustaining process on the other hand antiterror efforts wh ich dilute the process below critical threshold may result in the eventual dissolution of the processhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33160crs9 19 renamed in 2004 country reports on terrorism for the 2004 version see httpusinfostategovisimgassets4475country_report_terrorism_31727pdfmeasuring progress progress may be defined differently by the terrorists and those who oppose them hence both can claim progress and bot h can be correct in their assessments how can this be reconciled how can m easurements of progress be established which are not politicized or biased in this regard one must be cautious that success is not defined retrospectively with goal s reformulated after the fact to correspond with the known outcomes arguably measur ements of progress have greater validity if strategies are established befo re and not after taking action in search for meaningful measurement criteria the academic engineering scientific and actuarial communities may have much to offer government policymakers extensive mathematical tools exist to help define and validate proposed measurement systems and indeed one might employ variety of such systems used by different groups as long as measurements ar clearly defined and linked to goals and objectives these differences need not be divisive the conduct of survey of data on terrori sm is an option that is survey of what data on terrorism especially data bases currently exist what categories and details are found within that data and what the data can reasonably inform policymakers about existing methodologie s for measuring progress in combating complex social phenomena such as drug trafficking and crime could contribute valuable insights models for measurement example framework for measurement in designing metrics for measuring effectiveness of antiterror efforts one option might begin with three major categories incidents attitudes and trends this is one of many possible models analysis of the resulting data could address how well the process of terrorism is bein g disrupted on both continuous and quantum scales incidents in the past the number of terrorist attacks or incidents were prominently displayed in publications such as the department of states annual patterns of global terrorism reports19 the reports also indicated how widespread the incidents were geographically and how deadly they were in terms of persons killed or injured but arguably neglected was the impact of such incidents especially their effect on the macroeconomy also not fully clear is wh ich attacks are important or meaningful enough from the standpoint of measurem ent to be considered incidentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33160crs10 20 see generally crs report rl32417 the

define success in familiar ways body counts and numbers in western scienceand technologyoriented society many feel th at if problem can be quantified it can be solved however common pitfall is overreliance on quantitative data at the expense of its qualitative significance in previous years patterns of global terrorism reports incidents were counted equa lly without regard to their broader impact20 to the degree that terrorist constituencies are not from western cultures their mindsets may not necessarily place premium on quantification metrics but rather on other values such as re ligious precepts or honor or revenge western policymakers often tend to defi ne success by the absence of attacks when the shooting or bombing stops for exam ple that is viewed as success yet terrorists sometimes define success in terms of making governments expend limited resources trying to defend an enormous num ber of potential targets for terrorists the absence of violent conflict may simply mean that they are focusing attention on economic political or social spheres or just that they are in waiting peri od western policymakers often define succe ss in terms of the amount of money confiscated from terrorist networks terrori sts may define success in terms of the amount of money they force an opponent to squander to seize potentially insignificant amounts attitudes attitudes drive both terrorism and the wo rlds response to terrorism how do attitudes affect political decisions and sen timents in countries to contain and defeat terrorism or to support it how long can democratic govern ments pursue policies that pressure terrorists if such policies are seen as bringing on terrorist retaliation similarly how much increase in economic costs and reduction in civil liberties will public opinion tolerate shaping attitudes to break or weaken the politic will to combat terrorism is central terrorist go and an important indicator of success or failure21 with regard to attitudes terrorists of ten see success as breaking their opponents will they want to push the conflict into the political arena on the streets of washington london paris karachi mosc ow and madrid they want the public to tire of the casualties caused by terror in places such as baghdad chechnya and wherever else they can strike blow they want the public to push governments to adopt policies of appeasement22 or alternately to force governments to spend beyond their means and to become increasingly oppr essive and draconian towards their ownhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33160crs11 23 see what

antiwestern sentiments and 5 the level of religious bigo try in countries which are breeding grounds for terrorists moreover cultural differences may often so lead to different views concerning

scripture attitudes are central to shaping of consensus or lack thereof to the extent that nations can reach multilateral consensus c oncerning shared antiterror strategies goals and measurement criteria the united states may be more successful in obtaining the support and assistance of other nations in antiterror efforts trends trends are changes of incidents attitudes and other factors over time measurement of trends is particularly rele vant with regard to trends in terrorist infrastructure is their leadership being weakened is their recruitment base network or target list growing

number of governments that do not embrace appeasement policies 2 the number of defectors from the terrorist ranks 3 the terrorists levels of internet activity 4 the amount of media coverage they receive and 5 the number of supporters and recruits they gain related issue here is how us polic ies affect terrorists popular support and recruiting also included here is the degree to which government bureaucratic institutions can work smoothly together collectively adapting their strategies and tactics to keep up with and stay ahead of the methods utilized by individual terrorists and

important in measuring progress against rrorism past threats have generally united america with its allies today the threat of terrorism appears to be dividing america and some traditional allies

degree be individually config ured to respond to the evolving goals strategies tactics and operating envir onment of different terrori st groups better understanding of the dynamics of terrorism allows for more complete picture of the complexities involved in measuring success or failure and can assist the 110th congress as it coordinates funds and ove rsees antiterrorism policy and programs

formulation of practical useful measurement criteria appears both tractable and read to be addressed
