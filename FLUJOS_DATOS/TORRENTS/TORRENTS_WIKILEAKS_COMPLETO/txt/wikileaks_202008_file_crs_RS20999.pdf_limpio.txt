trade agreement analysis of environmental provisions mary tiemann specialist in environmental policy resources science and industry division summary the usjordan free trade agreement fta was signed on october 24 2000 and submitted to congress on january 6 2001 the ftas entry into force required the completion of necessary domestic legal procedures by each party and the jordanian parliament approved the agreement in may this trade agreement generally was greeted with broad bipartisan support however it generated controversy because the text includes potentially precedentsetting provisions on environment and labor and the provisions are subject to the agreements dispute settlement process the environmental provisions parallel those included in the north american free trade agreement nafta environmental side agreement some interests view the inclusion of these provisions to be model for addressing environmental issues in future trade negotiations but others object to making the environmental provisions subject to dispute settlement and possibly sanctions the administration did not seek to alter the usjordan fta to address concerns with its labor or environment provisions but the two governments exchanged letters stating their intent to try to resolve differences without recourse to formal dispute settlement procedures on july 31 the house passed implementing legislation hr 2603 by voice vote the senate passed hr 2603 by voice vote on september 24 the bill was signed into law pl 10743 on september 28 for more details see crs report rl30652 usjordan free trade agreement this report examines environmental provisions in the us jordan fta and compares them with related provisions in nafta and its environmental side accord during the past decade environmental issues have gained an increasing level of attention in trade liberalization deliberations although their inclusion in trade agreements remains controversial consensus has emerged on how whether or to what degree such issues might be addressed in trade agreements or in fast track legislation authorizing expedited congressional consideration of these agreements consequently the usjordan free trade agreement fta is of interest as it expands the consideration of environmental matters in trade agreement by including environmental provisions within the body of the agreement and making these provisions subject to the ftas dispute settlement process httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20999crs2 1 the usjordan fta and the nafta side agreement define environmental laws similarly for purposes of the enforcement provisions they generally include broad range of environmental protection laws including pollution laws and laws to protect endangered species the nafta side accord explicitly excludes laws for managing the commercial or subsistence harvesting of natural resources both definitions explicitly exclude worker safety or health lawsviews on the specific environmental provisions have been quite divergent some policymakers and environmental groups see the inclusion of these provisions to be either model or starting point for future us trade negotiating strategy on environmental issues others view such provisions to be potentially protectionist by making enforcement of environmental laws subject to dispute settlement and possibly sanctions opponents also have expressed concern that such provisions could threaten us sovereignty on domestic environmental matters thus while an fta with jordan was widely supported in congress its environmental and labor provisions caused controversy on june 21 us trade representative robert zoellick stated that the bush administration would not seek to alter the fta to address concerns regarding these provisions however the two governments exchanged letters stating their intent to resolve any implementation issues without recourse to formal dispute settlement procedures overview of environmental provisions briefly in the fta the united states and jordan recognize that it is inappropriate to encourage trade by relaxing domestic environmental laws this provision which parallels nafta language further states that each party agrees to strive to ensure that it does not waive or otherwise derogate from such laws to encourage trade with the other party while calling for high levels of environmental protection the fta explicitly recognizes the right of each country to establish its own levels of domestic environmental protection policies and priorities perhaps most significantly the fta sets precedent in stating that party shall not fail to effectively enforce its environmental laws through sustained or recurring course of action or inaction in manner affecting trade between the parties while similar language appears in the nafta environmental side agreement which has its own dispute settlement process here this obligation is placed within the text of the trade agreement and is subject to the ftas dispute settlement procedures see table 1 below for comparison of environmental provisions in the usjordan fta with similar provisions contained in the nafta and its environmental side agreement1 an unprecedented provision in nafta that is not included in the usjordan fta concerns the relationship of the fta to multilateral environmental agreements meas nafta article 103 lists three traderelated meas eg the montreal protocol on ozone depleting substances that may take precedence over nafta if implementation conflicts arise provided that the mea is implemented in the least naftainconsistent manner parties may add other meas to this list this issue defining the relationship of meas to trade rules has been on the agenda of the world trade organizations committee on trade and environment for several years and its resolution remains elusive enforcement obligation and dispute settlement procedures the strength of the obligation to effectively enforce domestic environmental laws is directly related to the dispute settlement process the usjordan fta sets out ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20999crs3 2 amicus curiae submissions are briefs submitted by interested individuals or nongovernmental groups that are not party to the disputemultistep procedure for dispute settlement first the united states and jordan shall make every attempt to arrive at mutually agreeable resolution through consultations if dispute arises if the parties do not resolve the dispute within 60 days through consultations either party has the right to refer the dispute to the joint committee the joint committee is continuing body established to supervise the implementation of the agreement and is composed of representatives of the parties if the joint committee does not resolve the dispute generally within 90 days the dispute may be referred to specially appointed threeperson dispute settlement panel the dispute settlement panel is authorized to make nonbinding recommendations to resolve the dispute after the panel issues its findings and recommendations within 90 days the joint committee shall endeavor to resolve the dispute taking the panel report into account if the joint committee does not resolve the dispute within 30 days then the affected party shall be entitled to take any appropriate and commensurate measure proposals to make the enforcement of environmental and labor laws subject to dispute settlement provisions and potentially sanctions under trade agreements have been controversial thus the inclusion of this approach in the usjordan fta intensified the debate over this economically modest trade agreement however some supporters of the enforcement obligation were concerned that it also gives parties such degree of discretion in implementing it that in their view it is unlikely that any circumstance would be considered violation in contrast others objected to this provision and the possibility that an international tribunal would have authority to judge the adequacy of us environmental laws and policy further concern was that the language entitling party to take any appropriate or commensurate measure would allow party to impose trade sanctions in response to environmental disputes to address these objections the two governments exchanged letters on july 23 stating their intent that each party would not expect or intend to apply the agreements dispute settlement enforcement procedures to secure its rights under the agreement in manner that results in blocking trade each government also considers that appropriate measures for resolving any differences that may arise regarding the agreement would be bilateral consultations and other procedures particularly alternative mechanisms that will help to secure compliance without recourse to traditional trade sanctions the letters satisfied opponents sufficiently to clear the way for the advancement of implementing legislation but supporters in the house objected to what they consider secondtier treatment of environmental and labor matters transparency when signing the fta the united states and jordan also signed memora ndum of understanding on transparency in dispute settlement mou the mou provides for public participation and transparency in the dispute resolution process and obligates the parties to solicit and consider the views of members of their respective publics after receiving request for consultations under the agreement if dispute panel is established parties must make their submissions to the panel publicly available and oral presentations before the panel must be open to the public the panel is directed to accept and consider amicu s curiae submissions2 and must release its report to the public the united states has long supported greater transparency in trade disputes and nongovernmental stakeholders have sought the opportunity to provide input into the process consequently many view this mou to be significant complement to the ftahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20999crs4 3 although this was the first environmental review prepared for trade agreement under the executive order it was not the first time such review was undertaken in 1992 environmental groups called for the us government to prepare an environmental impact assessment under the national environmental policy act nepa for the proposed trade agreement between the united states and mexico and subsequently canada while federal court ruled that the government was not required to prepare such an assessment the office of the ustr did prepare an extensive review of
