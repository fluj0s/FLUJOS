detainees the need for stronger legal framework us handling of detainees captured in the war on t error should be durable politically legally and among our key allies we do not adopt legal standards in our behavior as favor to terrorists we do it for ourselves and to be able to exemplify th values that distinguish us from the terrorists in practice we are already adopting facto stand ards of conduct that are good and defensible in some of the most challengi ng operations we now conduct by special operations forces against the zar qawi network in iraq our forces have found for example that they do t need physical coercion in their interrogations but these practices are n ot yet reflected in legal framework to underpin them some problems clear and consistent standard it would be useful to have clear standard we could publicly explain and train all t roops to employ however we apply one set of standards in iraq which is the central front in the war on terror we apply another set of standards i n afghanistan we apply third set of standards in guantanamo we pply fourth for individuals held at undisclosed locations by other government agencies and there is of course yet another set of standards for individuals held in the normal legal system since we have not adopted clear framework and since our current approach relies on norms asserted by the us presi dent under his war powers the world has difficulty understanding whet her or how our practices are governed by the rule of law underlying definition of humane treatment the president has said the united states will treat any detainees humanel the usg has not yet defined what humane treatment means in the war on terror its position with respect to the universally accepted internatio nal legal definitions is unclear 2 humane treatment is defined as minimum standar d in three different treaties article 3 of the geneva convent ions article 75 of additional protocol i and article 16 of the convention against torture the definitions given in one or more of those treat ies have been accepted at least as customary law of war by all of our allies in the war on terror eg britain in 1978 israel in 199 9 the united states having led the world in fostering such norm s beginning with the lieber code promulgated by president lincoln in 1863 had also accepted these definitions whatever the combatant s status in all of its prior practice eg in korea vietnam an d panama the reagan administration in 1986 stated that the relevant rticle of additional protocol i was customary norm accepted by the uni ted states but the united states has not yet accepted any of t hese definitions in its current operation s in the war on terror attorney general gonzales said six months ago in his confirmation hearings that the usg accepts the standards in the convention against tor ture but is still reviewing whether its practices comply with article 16 of that conventi on various international bodies including the red cro ss and the committee on torture body created by the convent ion against torture to monitor implementation of the treaty ar attempting to review us practices as well the us also s domestic legal standard in the constitutions 8th amendment that states that cruel and unusual punis hment shall not be inflicted by the united states the administrat ion has not taken clear position on whether this prohibition applies to us beh avior outside of the united states adoption of standards below or inconsistent with th ose used by key coalition partners we need partners who can also detain terrorists w ith practices analogous to ours so they can hold them if they catch them so they can more readily accept transfers from us and so we have common foundation for our work 3 our established allies who have been fighting despe rate battles against terrorism for decades like britain and israel hav painfully accepted internati onally accepted definitions of humane treatment israel did so in 1999 and has been able to sustain its difficult balance throughout the current intifada israel accepts t argeted killings of enemies in war but not cruel inhuman or degradin g treatmen t of captives we are now in the position of arguing to new partne rs like the new iraqi and afghan governments that they must change their laws lowering their standards so they can hold detainee s the way we can it will be easier for us to recommend such frameworks to them if the frameworks are ones they can defend at home and abr oad alternatives there are two basic alternatives to the current app roach one we can design our own definition of humane tre atment different from that in existing legal frameworks and seek domesti c or international acceptance for it as necessary adaptation to the war on terror two we can align the us as matter of policy with existing principles in the customary international law of war the department of state prefers the second option specifically accept as matter of policy and customary law not formally binding treaty obligation the minimum definitions of humane treatment in common article 3 of the geneva convent ions and article 75 of additional protocol i deny pow status to captured terrorist suspects accept as matter of policy and customary law not formally binding treaty obligation that once captives are t ransferred to regular dod detention facilities that they will be detaine d as civilian detainees under the law of war ie the fourth ge neva convention and allow relevant international observers access to these regular detention facilities 4 after certain allowable period of undisclosed det ention acknowledge whether an individual is in us custody we believe that with minor adjustments adoption f this framework will not have any substantial detrimental effect on dod detention operations as they have evolved to date adoption of this framework also would not contradict positions taken to date in domestic litigation and would not be inconsisten t with the presidents decisions described in his memorandum of february 7 2002 the department has prepared analytical papers on bo th of these points which we are prepared to circulate to other agencie s concern about the intelligence system one reason to avoid any clear legal framework or finition of humane treatment is to allow maximum flexibility for inter rogations and detention in the activities of other government agencies indee d it is feared that adoption of such framework anywhere in the detent ion system is dangerous since the example of such standard cou ld eventually spill over into the activities of other government agencies these concerns can be addressed at least in part by apply geneva standards for civilian detainees der the law of war only to detainees held in dod facilities set an appropriate time period during which deta inees can be held without disclosing that they are in us custody ask the dni whether based on years of experienc now accumulated worldwide and in iraq the us can achieve its int elligence objectives while treating detainees humanely as that term is defined under minimum international standards or alternatively ask whether experience shows it is necessary in order to achie ve intelligence objectives to have the right to use practices rega rded as cruel inhuman and degrading if such practices are rega rded as necessary the tradeoffs should be clarified for an informed p residential decision 5 these are difficult issues in considering them we recalled how the supreme court of israel unanimously wrestled with such qu estions dealing in 1999 with the legality of certain interroga tion practices used by the shin bet deciding these applications weighed heavy on this court true from the legal perspective the road before us is smooth w are however part of israeli society its problems are known to us and we live its hist ory we are not isolated in an ivory tower we live the life f this country but they agreed with an earlier commission that had rejecte d an approach suggesting that the actions of security services in the context of fighting terrorism shall take pl ace in the recesses of the law instead that commission and the israeli supreme co urt chose what it called the way of truth and the rule of law the court observed although democracy must often fight with one hand tied behin d its back it none theless has the upper hand
