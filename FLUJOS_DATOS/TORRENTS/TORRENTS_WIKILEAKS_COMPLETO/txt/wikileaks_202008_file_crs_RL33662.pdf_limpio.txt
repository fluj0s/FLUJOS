criminal offense to commit certain violations of the laws of war when such offenses are committed by or against us nationals or armed service members among other things th act prohibits certain violations of common article 3 of the 1949 geneva conventions which sets out minimum standards for the treatment of detainees in armed conflicts of noninternational character common article 3 prohibits protected persons from being subjected to violence outrages upon personal dignity torture and cruel humiliating or degrading treatment in the 2006 case of hamdan v rumsfeld the supreme court rejected the bush administrations longstanding position that common article 3 was inapplicable to the present armed conflict with qaeda as result questions have arisen regarding the scope of the war crimes act as it relates to violations of common article 3 and the possibility that us personnel may be prosecuted for the pre hamdan treatment of qaeda detainees as amended by the military commissions act of 2006 mca pl 109366 the war crimes act now criminalizes only specified common article 3 violations labeled as grave breaches previously any violation of common article 3 constituted

penalties against persons who commit certain offenses under the laws of war when those offenses are either committed by or against us national or member of the us armed forces the act applies regardless of whether the offense occurs inside or outside the united states offenders are subject to imprisonment for life or any term of years and may receive the death penalty if their offense results in death to the victim at the time of enactment the war crimes act only covered grave breaches of the 1949 geneva conventions during congressional deliberations the departments of state and defense suggested the act be crafted to cover additional war crimes but these recommendations were not immediately followed 4 however congress amended the war crimes act the following year to cover additional war crimes that had been suggested by the state and defense departments including violations under article 3 of any of the 1949 geneva conventions common article 3 common article 3 is applicable to armed conflicts not of an international character and covers persons taking active part in hostilities includ ing those who have laid down their arms or been incapacitated by capture or injury such persons are to be treated humanely and protected from certain treatment including violence to life and person cruel treatment and torture and outrages upon personal dignity in particular

controversy concerning whether activities by military and intelligence personnel relating to captured qaeda suspects might give rise to prosecution under the war crimes act particularly in light of the supreme courts ruling in the 2006 case of hamdan v rumsfeld 5 the 1 geneva convention for the amelioration of the condition of the wounded and sick in armed forces in the field 6 ust 3114 geneva

conventions grave breach provisions were met by existing federal law and further legislation was required hrept 104698 at 34 1996 quoting sen exec rep 9 at 27 1955 however in 1996 the house committee on the judiciary found that in some cases the united states was legally unable to prosecute persons for the commission of grave breaches of the conventions including when members of the armed forces

possible implications that the courts ruling may have on issues relating to the war crimes act

lasting until the courts ruling in hamdan the bush administration had taken the position that the geneva conven tions did not apply to members of qaeda captured in the global war on terror specifically the administration argued that the conventions were applicable to international ar med conflicts between high contracting parties and states that complied with convention provisions and therefore do not cover nonstate actors such as qaeda the administration further claimed that the conflict with qaeda is international in scope and common article 3 accordingly was inapplicable to the conflict because it only covers armed conflicts not of an international nature6 the issue in hamdan primarily concerned military tribunals convened by presidential order to try detainees for violations of the laws of war the co urt held that such tribunals did not comply with the uniform code of military justice or the laws of war including the geneva conventions however the courts interpretation of common article 3 had broader implications for us policy towards captured qaeda suspects the court rejected the administrations interpretation of common article 3 as not covering qaeda mbers concluding that the provision affords some minimal protection falling short of full protection under the conventions to any individuals who are involved in conflict in the territory of signatory7 in the aftermath of the courts ruling the department of defense issued new treatment guidelines concerning military detainees including qaeda members that required at minimum application of the standards articulated by common article 38 subsequently fourteen highlevel qaeda operatives who had been held abroad by the cia and subjected to aggressive interrogation techniques were transferred to dod custody in guantanamo bay cuba9 6 see white house memorandum humane treatment of taliban and qaeda detainees february 7 2002 available at httpwwwpegcusarchivewhite_housebush_memo_20020207_edpdf 7 hamdan 126 sct at 2796 internal quotations omitted in interpreting common article 3 as ensuring minimis protections of qaeda members captured by the united states in afghanistan the court noted that the official commentaries accompanying common article 3 made clear that the scope of the article must be as wide as possible id quoting commentary geneva convention relative to the treatment of prisoners of war 36 1960 in dissent justice thomas joined by justice scalia disputed this reading arguing that the relevant commentary indicated that the purpose of common article 3 was principally to furnish protections to persons involved in civil war rather than entities of international scope such as qaeda id at 2846 thomas j dissenting however the court appeared to leave unresolved whether the geneva conventions apply with respect to qaeda suspects captured in places where armed conflict is occurring for background on the

question concerning the acts scope in the aftermath of the courts ruling in hamdan some suggested that the war crimes act be amended to specify whether certain forms of treatment or interrogation constitute punishable offense they argued that the scope of the war crimes act was ambiguous particularly as it related to offenses concerning violations of common article 3 in septembe r 2006 address president bush suggested that some provisions of common article 3 provided us personnel with inadequate notice as to what interrogation methods could permissibly be used against detained qaeda suspects and requested legislation listing specific recognizable offenses that would be considered crimes under the war crimes act 11 on the other hand some argued that amending the war crimes act to cover specific acts would overly restrict the acts scope making certain unspecified conduct legally permissible even though it was as severe as conduct that was expressly prohibited although some types of conduct prohibited by common article 3 are easily recognizable eg murder mutilation the taking of hostages it might not always be obvious whether conduct constitutes impermissible torture cruel treatment or outrages upon personal dignity in particular humiliating and degrading treatment for discussion of us and international jurisprudence and agency interpretations concerning the scope

in some cases such persons were allegedly subject to harsh treatment especially in the context of interrogation that might not have complied with common article 3 requirements as result some have raised questions as to whether us personnel might be criminally liable under the war crimes act for the pre hamdan treatment of some qaeda detainees although not immune from prosecution us pers onnel who could be charged with violating the war crimes act would have several possible defenses to criminal liability so long as their activities were conducted with the authorization of the administration and under the reasonable though mistaken belief that their actions were lawful section 1004a of the detainee treatment act of 2005 dta pl 109148 enacted several months prior to the

the armed forces or other agents engaging in specific operational practices that involve detention and interrogation of aliens who the president or his designees have determined are believed to be

that they were conducted it shall be defense that the agent did not know that the practices were unlawful and person of ordinary sense and understanding would not know the practices were unlawful good

nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or extinguish any defe nse or protection otherwise available or to provide immunity from prosecution for any criminal offense by the proper authorities 12 in addition to this statutory defense number of other legal defenses could be raised by us personnel charged with war crimes act offenses based on conduct that had been authorized assuming the defendants acted with government sanction andor had been erroneously informed by responsible authorities that their conduct was legal 13 similar defenses may exist for military personnel in courts martial proceedings14

the courts ruling in hamdan congress passed the military commissions act of 2006 pl 109366 which was enacted into law on october 17 2006 among other things the military commissions act mca made several amendments to the war crimes act15 12 prior to the enactment of the military commissions act of 2006 pl 109366 it was arguably unclear whether reviewing court would have interpreted this defense to apply retroactively to conduct occurring before the dtas enactment in december 2005 the military commissions act specified that this defense was available to us persons charged with an offense under the war crimes act on account of conduct committed between september 11 2001 and the enactment of the dta pl 109366 8b 2006 13 although mistake of law defenses are generally rejected such defenses have been recognized by courts in certain cases where defendants have acted with government sanction or after being erroneously informed by responsible authorities that their conduct was legal these defenses can be divided into three overlapping categories 1 defense of entrapment by estoppel available when defendant is informed by government official that certain conduct is legal and thereafter commits what would otherwise constitute crimin offense in reasonable reliance of this representation 2 defense of public authority available when defendant reasonably relies on the authority of government official to authorize otherwise illegal conduct and the official has actual authority to sanction the defendant to perform such conduct and 3 defense of apparent public authority which is recognized by some but not all federal circuits and is similar to the defense of public authority except that the official only needs to have apparent authority to sanction the defendants conduct united states v baptistarodriguez 17 f3d 1354 1368 n 18 11 th cir 1994 unlike the other defenses the defense of entrapment by estoppel stems from the due process notions of fairness rather than from common law concerning contract equity or agency united states v austin 915 f2d 363 366 8 th cir 1990 14 while ignorance or mistake of law including general orders or regulations is not generally available as defense mistake of law may be defense when the mistake results from reliance on the decision or pronouncement of an authorized public official or agency manual for courts ma rtial rules for courtsmartial rule 916l discussion in the case of war crimes defense based on superior orders is available only with respect to direct and specific orders to commit an act constituting war crime and the defendant must demonstrate both the exis tence of the order and his sincere and reasonable belief that the order was lawful see d avid schleuter military criminal justice 2 4f 5th ed

3 so that only specified violations would be punishable as opposed to any common article 3 violation as was previously the case including committing or attempting or conspiring to commit torture defined in manner similar to that used by the federal torture statute 18 usc 23402340a in criminalizing torture cruel treatment the performing of biological experiments murder mutilation or maiming intentionally causing serious bodily injury rape sexual assault or abuse and the taking of hostages prior to the enactment of the mca there was some debate concerning the scope of cruel treatment that should be subject to criminal penalty under the war crimes act16 the mca defined cruel treatment prohibited by the war crimes act in similar manner to the definition of torture contained in the federal torture statute however whereas person is criminally liable for torture only if he specifically intends to cause severe mental or physical pain and continued these bills contained provisions

commissions act of 2006 introduced by representative duncan hunter s 3861 s 3886 and hr 6054 were largely identical to the draft legislation proposed by the bush administration while s 3901 somewhat differe d soon thereafter three other bills were introduced s 3929 and s 3930 which were both entitled the military commissions act of 2006 and were introduced by senator mitch mcconnell and hr 6166 also entitled the military commissions act of 2006 which was introduced by representative duncan hunter reportedly s 3929s 3930 and hr 6166 reflected an agreement reached by the bush administration and certain lawmakers to resolve differences in the approach taken by s 3901 and that taken by s 3861 s 3886 and hr 6054 kate zernike sheryl gay stolberg differences settled in deal over detainee treatment ny times september 23 2006 at a9 hr 6166 was passed by the house on september 27 2006 s 3930 was passed by the senate on september 28 2006 and by the house on september 29 2006 although the provisions of s 3929 s 3930 and hr 6166 were largely similar ther were initially some differences between the bills however the version of s 3930 that was passed by the senate samdt 5085 and house was amended so that it contained the same provisions as housepassed hr 6166 16 several of the bills considered by the 109th congress would have amended the war crimes act to criminalize only some types of cruel treatment for example s 3861 s 3886 and hr 6054 would only have criminalized cruel treatment rising to the level of torture while s 3901 would have more broadly criminalized cruel treatment that violated the standards of the mccain amendment ie cruel inhuman or degrading treatment of the kind prohibited under the fifth eighth and fourteenth amendments the scope of conduct criminalized by the mca appears to fall somewhere between these two standards httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33662g22g145g142g561g25g138g155g561g5g155g146g150g142g156g561g3g140g157g497g561g5g158g155g155

the amendments made the mc person is criminally liable for inflictions of cruel treatment if he generally intended17 to cause serious mental or physical pain and suffering to person protected under common article 3 the mca further defined serious mental pain and suffering and serious physical pain and suffering rising to the level of cruel treatment punishable under the war crimes act serious mental pain and suffering is defined by reference to the federal torture statutes definition of severe mental pain and suffering rising to the level of torture serious mental pain and suffering constituting cruel treatment refers to pain and suffering arising from the intentional infliction or threatened infliction of severe physical pain or suffering the administration application or threatened administration or application of mind altering substances or other procedures calcul ated to disrupt profoundly the senses or the personality the threat of imminent death or the threat that another person will imminently be subjected to death severe physical pain or suffering or the administration or application of mindaltering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or personality the type of mental pain and suffering constituting cruel treatment generally differs from the type rising to the level of torture in that it only needs to be of serious and nontransitory nature which need not be prolonged as opposed to being of severe and prolonged nature however the war crimes act as amended provides that with respect to conduct occurring before enactment of the mca such pain and suffering must be of prolonged nature as amended by the mca the war crimes act defines serious physical pain or suffering constituting cruel treatment as actual bodily injury involving substantial risk of death extreme physical pain burn or physical disfigurement of serious nature other than cuts abrasions or bruises or significant loss or impairment of the f unction of bodily member organ or mental faculty under us jurisprudence most or all of these activities are likely considered to be of such severity as to constitute torture 18 at least in

offender specifically intended to cause such injury however such persons may now also be prosecuted under the war crimes act for such conduct presuming it was directed against persons protected under common article 3 when they caused such injury through reckless or criminally negligent action19 the amendments made by the mca to the war crimes act applied retroactively possibly precluding prosecution of personnel for some but not all conduct falling under the more general scope of the earlier version of the war crimes act 20 the mca also provided that the statutory defense contained in dta 1004 covers any criminal prosecution under the war crimes act against us personnel relating to the sanctioned treatment of detainees if such conduct occurred between september 11 2001 and december 30 2005 ie the date the dta was enacted21 it also amended the dta to require the federal government to provide or employ counsel and pay fees related to any prosecution or civil action against us personnel for authorized detention or interrogation activities 22 the mca also specified that certain provisions of the war crimes act as amended are inapplicable with respect to collateral damage or lawful attack23 in addition the provision of the war crimes act as amended relating to hostage taking does not apply to prisoner exchange during wartime the mca also pr ohibited us courts from using foreign or international sources to serve as the basis for interpreting the provisions of the war crimes act as amended defining grave breaches of common article 324 additionally the mca prevents

the mca authorizes the president acting pursu ant to an executive order published in the federal register to more restrictively interpret the meaning and application of common article 3 of the geneva convention and promulgate administrative regulations implementing this interpretation26 so long as these rules do not authorize conduct subject to criminal penalty under the war crimes act on july 20 2007 president bush signed an executive order interpreting common article 3 as applied to the detention and interrogation of certain alien detainees by the cia when those aliens 1 are determined to be members or supporters of qaeda the taliban or associated organizations and 2 likely possess information that could assist in detecting or deterring terrorist attack against the united states and its allies or could provide help in locating senior leadership within qaeda or the taliban 27 the executive order does not specifically authorize the use of any particular interrogation techniques with respect to detainees but instead bars any cia detention and interrogation program from employing certain practices specifically the order prohibits the use of torture as defined under the federal torture statute 18 usc 2340 cruel inhuman and degrading treatment as defined under the mccain amendment and the mca any activities subject to criminal penalties under the war crimes act eg murder rape mutilation other acts of violence serious enough to be considered comparable to the kind expressly prohibited under the war crimes act willful and outrageous acts of personal abuse done for the purpose of humiliating or degrading the individual in manner so serious that any reasonable person considering the circumstances would deem the acts to be beyond the bounds of human decency such as sexual or sexually indecent acts undertaken for the purpose of humiliation forcing the individual to perform sexual acts or to pose sexually threatening the individual with sexual mutilation or using the individual as human shield or acts intended to denigrate the religion religious practices or religious objects of the individual the scope of activity prohibited by the order is not immediately apparent although some types of conduct barred by the order are easily recognizable eg murder rape the performance of sexual acts it is not readily apparent as to what interrogation techniques would fall under the orders prohibition against acts deemed to be cruel inhuman and degrading or beyond the bounds of human decency certain interrogation techniques that have been the subject of controversy and are expressly prohibited from being used by the military under the most recent version of the army field manualwaterboard ing hooding sleep deprivation or forced standing for prolonged periods for exampleare not specifically addressed by the order whether or not such conduct is deemed by the executive to be barred under the more general 26 pl 109366 6a3 27 the executive order may be viewed at

of the order such as the restriction on treatment comparable to the kind expressly prohibited by the war crimes act remains unclear in public address on september 7 2007 cia director michael hayden stated that one ever claimed that the army field manual exhausted all the lawful tools that america could have to protect itself and suggested that additional interrogation techniques may be employed

introduced in the first session of the 110th congress to amend the scope of the war crimes act s 576 introduced by senator dodd on february 13 2007 and companion bill hr 1415 introduced by representative nadler on march 8 2007 would modify mca and the war crimes act provisions concerning the interrogation of detainees among other things both bills would amend the war crimes act to criminalize treatment of protected persons which violated mccain amendment standards or which denied such persons the right to be tried for war crimes before regularly constituted court the bills would also amend the war crimes act to make it an offense for any person not subject to the uniform code of military justice usmj to commit any offense of common article 3 if such an offense is listed under the usmj as punishable by death or at least one years confinement the two bills would also amend the mca by requiring the president to notify geneva convention parties that the united states expects us persons detained in conflict not of an international character to be treated in manner consistent with us interpretation and application of common article 3
