industryrelate d issues that have arisen in the 108th congress1 introduction renderers convert dead animals and an imal parts that otherwise would require disposal into variety of materials including edible and inedible tallow and lard and proteins such as meat and bone meal mbm2 these materials in turn are exported or sold to domestic manufacturers of wide ra nge of industr ial and consumer goods such as livestock feed and pet food soaps pharm aceuticals lubricants plastics personal care products and even crayons also see table 1 on page 6 although rendering provides an essential service to the increasingly intensive and costcompetitive us animal and meat industr ies and is subject to certain government food safety and envir onmental regulations the industr has largely operated outside of public view however renderi ng has attracted greater public attention since the discoveryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21771crs2 3 yield estimates vary however for exampl the world health organization

have announced or are considering new regulatory actions intended to reassure foreign and domestic customers that bse will not threaten food safety or us cattle herds these actions are likely to cause changes in renderers business practices costs and product values any changes in the economics of rendering likely will affect the economics of animal and meat producers too industry overview renderers annually c onvert 47 billion pounds or more of raw animal materials into approximately 18 billion pounds of products sources for th materials include meat slaughtering and processing plants the pr imary one dead animals from farms ranches feedlots marketing barns animal shelters and other facilities and fats grease and other food waste from restaurants and stores in meat animal slaughtering and processi ng plants the amount of usable material from each animal depends largely upon the speci for example at slaughter 1200 pound steer can yield anywhere from 55 to 60 of human edible product including meat for retail sale edible fat and variety meats organs tongue tail etc according to various estimates subtracting another 58 for the weight of the hide which goes into leather leaves 3240 of mate rial for rendering if this range were app lied consistently to all 355 million us cattle sl aughtered in 2003 the equivalent would represent the weight of approximately 11 million to 14 million live cattle3 elsewhere independent rende rers collect and process about half of all livestock and poultry that die from diseases or accidents before reaching sl aughter plants sparks 2002 us farm animal mortalities in 2000 include d approximately 41 milli on cattle and calves totaling 19 billion pounds 18 million hogs 1 billion pounds 833000 sheep lambs and goats 64 million pounds and 82 million chickens and turkeys 347 million pounds according to sparks which examined usda data disposing of these mortalities is complicated because of the need to minimize adverse environmental conseque nces such as the spread of human and animal disease or the pollution of ground or surface water spar ks 2002 observed for many producers paying modest fee to have renderer re move dead carcasses is likely preferred to finding alternative onfarm di sposal methods ie burial incineration or composting number and types of rendering plants one study estimated that 137 firms operated 240 plants in 1997 with to tal payroll of nearly 10000 employees4 more recently the national renderers association nra estimated that canada and the united states have combined 250260 re ndering plants rendering faci lities may be either integrated or inde pendent operationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21771crs3 5 more detailed description and flowchart is on the nra website httpwwwrenderersorg 6 sparks 2001 however mbm as proportion of total animal feed consumed is relatively low at less than 1 each for ruminants and swine about 2 for poultry and 7 for pet food sparks said seventy percent of all blood meal has gone for ruminants mainly dairy otherwise federal rules prohibit the feeding of most mammalian proteins back to ruminantsintegrated plants operate in conjuncti on with animal slaughter and meat processing plants and handle 6570 of all rendered material the estimated 95 us and canadian facilities nra render most edible animal byproducts ie fatty animal tissue mainly into edible fats tallow and lard for human consumption edible rendering is subject to the inspection and safety sta ndards of usdas food safety and inspection service fsis or its state counterparts wh ich by law already are present in the meat slaughter and processing plants these plan ts also render inedible byproducts including slaughter floor waste into fats and protei ns for animal feeds and for other ingredients because meat plant typically processes onl one animal species such as cattle hogs or poultry its associated rendering operations likewise handle only the byproducts of that species the inedible and edible rendering processes are segregated independent operations handle the other 3035 of rendered material these plants estimated by nra at 165 in the united states and canada us ually collect material from other sites using specially designed tr ucks they pick up and process fat and bone trimmings inedible meat scraps blood feathe rs and dead animals from meat and poultry slaughterhouses and processors usually smaller ones without their own rendering operations farms ranches f eedlots animal shelters restaurants butchers and markets as result the majority of independents are likely to be handling mixed species almost all of the resulting ingredients ar destined for nonhuman consumption eg animal feeds industrial products the us food and drug administration fda regulates animal feed ingredients but its c ontinuous presence in rendering plants or in feed mills that buy rendered ingredients is not legal requirement the rendering process in most systems raw materials are ground to uniform size and placed in continuous cookers or in batch cookers which ev aporate moisture and free fat from protein and bone series of conveyers presses nd centrifuge continue the process of separating fat from solids the finished fat eg tallow lard yellow grease goes into separate tanks and the solid protein eg mbm bone meal poultry meal is pressed into cake for processing into feed5 other rendering systems are used including those that recover protein solids from slaughterhouse blood or that process used restaurant grease this restaurant grease ge nerally is recovered ften in 55gallon drums for use as yellow grease in nonhuman food products like animal feeds value and use of rendered products the 18 billion pounds of ingredients that renderers produce each year have been valued at more than 3 billion of which 870 million is exported of the 18 billion pound tota l 10 billion pounds were feed ingredients with value of approxima tely 1 billion

deaths herd culls and slaughter byproducts regardless of quantity byproducts nd rendered products from the slaughter process must be sold at whatever price w ill clear the market or the industry and the environment incurs cost for disposal7 as government rules and industry practices evolve to address food safety and animal disease concerns like bse options for using these byproducts may become more limited if animal byproducts have fewer market outlets new questions may aris about how to dispose of th em safely and who should pay feed ban impacts scientists currently maintain that infected animal feed is the primary source of bse transmission althoug h research continues into other potential sources therefore us officials believe that regulation of feed ingredients is the single most effective method for controlling bse following the widespread outbreaks of bse in great britain and europe the fda in august 1997 imposed ban on feeding most mammalian proteins to cattle and other ruminants prohibited proteins still can be fed to other animals such as pigs poultry and pets fda in late january 2004 announced plans to expand the list of prohibited proteins estimates vary on the economic impact of th feed ban according to 1997 report prepared for the fda on compliance costs and market impacts the fda feed ban could reduce mbm values by between 63 milli on and 252 million or 25 to 100 per ton8 sparks june 2001 estimated that the aver age mbm value loss since the 1997 rule was 18 per ton for total of 288 million during the period 1996 to 2000 sparks added that these losses likely were highly concentrated among renderers that produce mbm exclusively and among those handling mix ed species the fdacommissioned report predicted that renderers would pass much of the lost value to packers by paying less for raw materials packers in turn were expected to reduce their payments for cattle the 2001 sparks study examined potential co st impacts of several options for more extensive feed restrictions it estimated that total animal protein feed ban to ruminants would cost 100 million yearly total ban on ll ruminant proteins to all farm animals 636 million yearly and total animal protein ba n to all farm animals 15 billion yearly downers and dead animals another recent regulatory action with an impact on the rendering industry was usda s december 30 2003 ban on all downer nonambulatory cattle from the human food suppl us officials consider downers or animals unable to rise or walk to be one of the higherrisk ca ttle gr oups for bse although industry officials note that most animals become nonambulatory from injuries or nonbse diseases before th ban usda estimated that 150000200000 downers were entering slaughter plants one issu is whether the downer ban has removed an economic incentive to market downers and thus made it more difficult for usda to obtain such animals for bse and other disease surveillancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21771crs5 9 about 7585 rendering plants currently ac cept nonambulatory livestock tom cook nra president said in early 2004 about 8590 plants could handle dead animals he also has said information on the bse

notable exception to renderings ability to kill most infectious agents 12 secretarys advisory committee on foreign animal and poultry diseases measures relating to bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the united states february 13 2004on march 15 2004 usda announced major expansion of its bse surveillance program that will sample many more downers and dead anima ls adding that it is looking to renderers among other sites to make these animals available numerous practical problems such as how to recover and store carcasses who will sample the costs etc now confront both governme nt and industry officials9 disposal questions if renderers earn less mone from rendered byproducts and dead animals they will pay less for such materials in the past renderers paid for dead animals now most charge fee to pick them up10 in its 2002 study on the cost of livestock mortalities sparks assumed that so long as mbm could be sold for feed the average perhead cost of dis posing of dead cattle and cal ves might be 825 per head if mbm is banned from animal feed the cost could rise to 2411 per head sparks estimated the perhead costs for other dis posal methods at 933 for incineration 1063 for burial and 3034 for composting the 2002 world health organization w ho report observed that rendering because it sanitizes animal wastes perfo rms an essential public service the environmental cleanup of wast too hazardous for disposal in conventional ways for example animal wastes provide ideal conditions for the growth of pathogens that infect humans as well as animals incineration w ould cause major air pollution landfill could lead to disease transmission11 usda advisory committee in february 2004 said that along with an enhanced bse surveillance program comprehensive system must be implemented to facilitate adequate pathways for dead and nonambulator cattle to allow for collection of samples and for proper safe disposal of carcasses this must be done to ensure protection of public health animal health and the environment such system will require expending federal resources to assist with costs for sa mpling transport and safe disposal12 others temper this view of rendering by observing that the nations clean air and water laws are in place to address possible adverse environmental impacts these responsibilities are enforced under the purview of the us environmental protection agency epa and generally through states and localities which often impose their own environmental and health standa rds as well while rendering which also must abide by such standards certainly is one option fo r handling dead stock and animal byproducts it has been argued this option does not relieve the animal nd meat industries of their environmental responsibilities because these i ndustries created this material they should bear the costs not the public particularly at time when budget deficits are forcing difficult spending choices the argument goeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21771crs6 table 1 us production consumption and export of rendered products 19992003p 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 p production in thousand metric tons inedible tallow greases
