exchange whether to continue needle exchange program funded with federal or district funds was one of several key policy issues that congress considered in reviewing the districts appropriations for fy2005 the controversy surrounding funding needle exchange program touches on issues of home rule public health policy and government sanctioning and facilitating the use of illegal drugs proponents of needle exchange program contend that such programs reduce the spread of hiv among illegal drug users by reducing the incidence of shared needles opponents of these efforts contend that such programs amount to the government sanctioning illegal drugs by supplying drugaddicted persons with the tools to use them in addition they contend that public health concerns raised about the spread of aids and hiv through shared contaminated needles should be addressed through drug treatment and rehabilitation programs another view in the debate focuses on the issue of home rule and the citys ability to use local funds to institute such programs free from congressional actions the prohibition on the use of federal and district funds for needle exchange program was first approved by congress as section 170 of the district of columbia appropriations act for fy1999 pl 105277 the 1999 act did allow private funding of needle exchange programs the district of columbia appropriations act crs19 for fy2001 pl 106522 continued the prohibition on the use of federal and district funds for needle exchange program it also restricted the location of privately funded needle exchange activities section 150 of the district of columbia appropriations act for fy2001 made it unlawful to distribute any needle or syringe for the hypodermic injection of any illegal drug in any area in the city that is within 1000 feet of public elementary or secondary school including any public charter school the provision was deleted during congressional consideration and passage of the district of columbia appropriations act of fy2002 pl 10796 the act also included provision that allows the use of private funds for needle exchange program but it prohibits the use of both district and federal funds for such activities at present one entity prevention works private nonprofit aids awareness and education program operates privately funded needle exchange program the fy2002 district of columbia appropriations act requires such entities to track and account for the use of public and private funds during consideration of the fy2004 district of columbia appropriations act district officials unsuccessfully sought to lift the prohibition on the use of district funds for needle exchange programs senate provision which was not adopted proposed prohibiting only the use of federal funds for needle exchange program and allowing the use of district funds the house and final conference versions of the fy2004 allowed the use of private funds for needle exchange programs and required private and public entities that receive federal or district funds in support of other activities or programs to account for the needle exchange funds separately the presidents budget proposal for fy2005 included provision that would continue to prohibit the use of district and federal funds in support of needle exchange program the house version of the district of columbia appropriations act for fy2005 hr 4850 included provision that would retain the current law prohibiting the use of federal and district funds for needle exchange program the senate version of the bill would have allowed district but not federal funds to be used for such program the conference version of the act prohibits the use of district and federal funds for needle exchange program medical marijuana the citys medical marijuana initiative is another issue that engenders controversy the district of columbia appropriations act for fy1999 pl 105 277 included provision that prohibited the city from counting ballots of voter approved initiative that would have allowed the medical use of marijuana to assist persons suffering debilitating health conditions and diseases including cancer and hiv infection congresss power to prohibit the counting of medical marijuana ballot initiative was challenged in suit filed by the dc chapter of the american civil liberties union aclu on september 17 1999 district court judge richard roberts ruled that congress despite its legislative responsibility for the district under article i section 8 of the constitution did not possess the power to stifle or crs20 prevent political speech which included the ballot initiative7 this ruling allowed the city to tally the votes on the november 1998 ballot initiative to prevent the implementation of the initiative congress had 30 days to pass resolution of disapproval from the date the medical marijuana ballot initiative initiative 59 was certified by the board of elections and ethics language prohibiting the implementation of the initiative was included in pl 106113 the district of columbia appropriations act for fy2000 opponents of the provision contend that such congressional actions undercut the concept of home rule the district of columbia appropriations act for fy2002 pl 10796 included provision that continued to prohibit the district government from implementing the initiative congresss power to block the implementation of the initiative was again challenged in the courts on december 18 2001 two groups the marijuana policy project and medical marijuana initiative committee filed suit in us district court seeking injunctive relief in an effort to put another medical marijuana initiative on the november 2002 ballot the districts board of elections and ethics ruled that congressional rider that has been included in the general provisions of each district appropriations act since 1998 prohibits it from using public funds to do preliminary work that would put the initiative on the ballot on march 28 2002 us district court judge ruled that the congressional ban on the use of public funds to put such ballot initiative before the voters was unconstitutional8 the judge stated that the effect of the amendment was to restrict the plaintiffs first amendment rights to engage in political speech the decision was appealed by the justice department and on september 19 2002 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit reversed the ruling of the lower court without comment the appeals court issued its ruling on september 19 2002 which was the deadline for printing ballots of the november 2002 general election the presidents budget proposal for fy2005 would have continued to prohibit the implementation of the medical marijuana ballot initiative while the district budget for fy2005 does not include language related to the implementation of the initiative the house senate and conference versions of the district of columbia appropriations act for fy2005 hr 4850 included provision that continues to prohibit the implementation of the medical marijuana ballot initiative and the decriminalization of marijuana possession for medical use 7 turner v district of columbia board of elections and ethics 982634 civ ddc sept 17 1999 memorandum opinion 8 marijuana policy project v district of columbia board of elections and ethics

of columbia appropriations district officials cite the prohibition on the use of district funds as another example of congressional intrusion into local matters the district of columbia appropriations act for fy2002 pl 10796 included provision prohibiting the use of federal or district funds for abortion services except in cases where the life of the mother is endangered or the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest this prohibition has been in place since 1995 when congress approved the district of columbia appropriations act for fy1996 pl 104134 since 1979 with the passage of the district of columbia appropriations act of 1980 pl 9693 congress has placed some limitation or prohibition on the use of public funds for abortion services for district residents from 1979 to 1988 congress restricted the use of federal funds for abortion services to cases where the mothers life would be endangered or the pregnancy resulted from rape and incest the district was free to use district funds for abortion services when congress passed the district of columbia appropriations act for fy1989 pl 100462 it restricted the use of district and federal funds for abortion services to cases where the mothers life would be endangered if the pregnancy were taken to term the inclusion of district funds and the elimination of rape or incest as qualifying conditions for public funding of abortion services was endorsed by president reagan who threatened to veto the districts appropriations act if the abortion provision was not modified9 in 1989 president bush twice vetoed the districts fy1990 appropriations act over the abortion issue he signed pl 101168 after insisting that congress include language prohibiting the use of district revenues to pay for abortion services except in cases where the mothers life was endangered10 the district successfully sought the removal of the provision limiting district funding of abortion services when congress considered and passed the district of columbia appropriations act for fy1994 pl 103127 the fy1994 act also reinstated rape and incest as qualifying circumstances allowing for the public funding of abortion services the districts success was shortlived however the district of columbia appropriations act for fy1996 pl 104134 and subsequent district of columbia appropriations acts limited the use of district and federal funds for abortion services to cases where the mothers life is endangered or cases where the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest the final version of the fy2004 appropriations for the district of columbia included provision that continued to restrict the use of district and federal funds for abortion services except in cases of rape or incest or when the life of the mother is

expansion act domestic partners program pl 10796 includes provision lifting the congressional prohibition on the use of district funds to implement its health care benefits expansion act11 the provision permits unmarried heterosexual and homosexual couples to register as domestic partners under the health care benefits expansion act which was approved by the citys elected leadership in 1992 an unmarried person who registers as domestic partner of district employee hired after 1987 may be added to the district employees health care policy for an additional charge the act had not been implemented until 2002 because of congressional prohibition first included in the general provisions of district of columbia appropriations act for fy1994 the citys health care benefits expansion act allows two cohabiting unmarried and unrelated individuals to register as domestic partners with the district for the purpose of securing certain health and family related benefits including hospital visiting rights under the law district government employees enrolled in the district of columbia employees health benefits program are allowed to purchase family health insurance coverage that would cover the employees family members including domestic partners in addition district employee registered as domestic partner may assume the additional cost of the family health insurance coverage for family members which would include the employees domestic partner opponents of the act maintain that it devalues the institution of marriage and that the act grants unmarried gay and heterosexual couples the same standing as married couples congressional proponents of lifting the ban on the use of district funds argue that the implementation of the act is question of home rule and local autonomy supporters of health care benefits for domestic partners note that as of 11 on september 20 2001 the house appropriations committee approved by vote of 28 to 21 an amendment introduced by reps kolbe and moran that removed the congressional prohibition on the use of district funds for the implementation of the citys health care benefits expansion act the act which was approved by the

september 25 2001 during house consideration of hr 2944 the house version of the district of columbia appropriations act for fy2002 rep weldon offered an amendment hamdt 310 that would have reaffirmed

the district to use city but not federal funds to implement the district of columbia employees health benefits program it had not been implemented because of congressional prohibition first included
