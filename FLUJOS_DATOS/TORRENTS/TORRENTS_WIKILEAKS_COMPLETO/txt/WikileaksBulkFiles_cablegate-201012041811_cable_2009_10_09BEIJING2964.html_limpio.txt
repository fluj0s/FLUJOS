partners in pursuit of bilateral contact with the dprk the deputy secretary noted that the us was not willing make concessions to entice north korea to abide by its previous commitments ambassador detrani assessed that the dprk was ready to return to multilateral talks on its nuclear program but that it had not made strategic decision to abandon nuclear weapons xxxxxxxxxxxx encouraged the us to engage in direct contact with the dprk which he felt could spur the dprk to return to the sixparty talks xxxxx speculated that dprk leader kim jongils deteriorating health and his desire to cement legacy provided an opportunity for the resolution of the nuclear issue in order to protect the gains that had been made and also to advance the sixparty talks xxxxxxxxxxxx asserted all parties had to remain committed to the september 2005 joint statement on denuclearization xxxxxxxxxxxx reiterated chinas commitment to implementation of unsc resolution 1874 and offered readout following premier wen jiabaos october 46 visit to pyongyang end summary positive uschina relations 4 s deputy secretary steinberg met with xxxxxxxxxxxx for fiftyminute discussion on north korea xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that the deputy secretary would have an opportunity to meet with number of chinese leaders during his visit which spoke of the importance that china attached to its relationship with the us as well as the respect that chinese leaders held for the deputy secretary xxxxxxxxxxxx commented that the deputy secretarys visit occurred on the heels of president obama and president hus september 22 meeting in new york the two presidents had reached consensus on key issues in the bilateral relationship and now it was each sides responsibility to work together to implement that consensus xxxxxxxxxxxx described himself as an outsider to uschina relations and even as an outsider he had met the deputy secretary three times over the past year fact that xxxxxxxxxxxx said spoke volumes about the positive development of uschina relations us is the missing element 5 sxxxxxxxxxxxx raised the red cliff john woodirected beijing 00002964 002 of 005 movie about the battle of red cliffs 1801 years ago along the banks of the yangtze river as metaphor for the current diplomatic situation with north korea at that time in china three states were in conflict two overmatched southern states had joined forces to fight the numericallysuperior northern state the two southern states planned to use fire as weapon to defeat the northern state but in order to do so the southern states required an easterly wind the battle ensued in november when the prevailing winds normally came from the west during the battle an easterly wind arrived which enabled the southern forces to use fire as weapon to defeat the superior northern forces this story was an aphorism xxxxxxxxxxxx suggested in the story the southern forces had all of the elements in place except for the crucial one the east wind dong feng the same was true with the sixparty talks there have been positive interactions among the parties to the talks and the us and china saw eyetoeye on issues there was only one missing element only the us could bring the east wind xxxxxxxxxxxx declared xxxxxxxxxxxx rationale behind highlevel visits to dprk 6 sxxxxxxxxxxxx explained that xxxxxxxxxxxx president hus special envoy and premier wen jiabao would pay visit october 46 the purpose of these visits was to persuade north korea to return to the sixparty talks north koreas supreme leader called all of the shots china sometimes had sharp debates with north korea at the workinglevel but when big matters were raised to the supreme leader for decision they were often easier to resolve that was why china had sent xxxxxxxxxxxx and would send premier wen to pyongyang in rapid succession according to xxxxxxxxxxxx 7 s xxxxxxxxxxxx explained that his visits to pyongyang had left him with clear impression that bilateral contact with the us was the issue most on the minds of north korean leaders it was possible to revive the sixparty talks but only if the us would engage north korea xxxxxxxxxxxx observed that the us was at times capable of taking diplomatic initiative and at other times was cautious in its diplomatic approach in this instance the us had been overly cautious china hoped the us would initiate contact with north korea which xxxxxxxxxxxx stressed was crucial to reconvening the sixparty talks and to the larger goal of denuclearization of the korean peninsula chinese assessment of kim jongil 8 s xxxxxxxxxxxx allowed that dprk leader kim jongil might have some realistic ideas and stated that kim jongil wanted to engage the us soon kim had been impressed by president clintons visit and had come away from his meeting with president clinton with an understanding that there were areas for discussion with the united states xxxxxxxxxxxx stressed his personal feeling that if the us made substantive contact with north korea then positive progress on the nuclear issue was within reach the us and china should not put off resolution of north koreas nuclear issue indefinitely xxxxxxxxxxxx stressed 9 sxxxxxxxxxxxx stated that he had read statement after president clintons visit that suggested that kim jongil was in good health and speculated that the medical experts that accompanied president clinton to pyongyang might have arrived at different conclusion xxxxxxxxxxxx suggested that kim jongil would like to resolve outstanding issues in the near future because his health might not permit him to put off decisions for too long this dynamic created favorable moment for resolving the nuclear issue it was important for the us and china to seize this moment and bring north korea back to the path of consultations and negotiations xxxxxxxxxxxx stressed usprc shared assessment on north korea 10 s the deputy secretary expressed appreciation for xxxxxxxxxxxx insights on north korea and for chinas decision to send senior representatives to north korea to press for the early resumption of the sixparty talks the us and china shared beijing 00002964 003 of 005 common goals and common assessment of the path forward on north korea both countries had the confidence to send parallel messages to north korea and when we were able to engage north korea at high levels it reinforced shared uschinese objectives regarding usdprk contacts the deputy secretary suggested china already understood from ambassador bosworths september 3 visit and our ongoing bilateral contacts that the us was prepared to have direct contact with north korea as way to bring north korea back to the sixparty talks learning the right historical lessons 11 s the deputy secretary noted that some people carried history forward through their own experiences it was important that the us and china drew from their shared history of dealing with north korea to determine the best way forward the deputy secretary noted that the chief obstacle to progress at the end of the bush administration had not been lack of usdprk contact in fact the frequency of direct contact became source of criticism with some observers suggesting that the us had too much direct contact with north korea and not enough coordination with sixparty partners 12 s the deputy secretary observed that north korea had established pattern of provocation followed by conciliation to ameliorate pressure from the international community resulting from its actions it was imperative to break this pattern which was counterproductive to shared uschinese goals on north korea key elements to current approach 13 s the deputy secretary asked xxxxxxxxxxxx what missing element or easterly wind would lead to change in north koreas behavior and produce different outcome than during the 1980s and 1990s the deputy secretary offered three elements that could affect north koreas decisionmaking 14 s the first element was the unified position on north korea among the sixparty talks partners the us wanted to ensure that if it proceeded to bilateral contact with north korea such contact would not undermine in any way the strong unity of approach among sixparty talks partners 15 s the second key element was the strong unity of action among sixparty talks partners particularly in implementation of security council resolution 1874 it would be important for sixparty talks participants to continue full implementation of this resolution the deputy secretary stressed 16 s the third key element would be to articulate clearly to north korea precisely what steps the sixparty talks partners expected the dprk to take to irreversibly denuclearize while also making clear exactly what benefits the dprk would derive from such actions the deputy secretary acknowledged that significant work had already been undertaken in this regard but much more work was needed to establish specific common understanding among sixparty talks participants 17 s the deputy secretary acknowledged that although he was not certain whether these three elements would be enough to convince north korea at strategic level to decide it was better off without nuclear weapons the us was willing to test the proposition the us was prepared to have bilateral contact with north korea to determine whether different outcome was possible now that the sixparty talks participants held clear unified position us caution on bilateral usdprk contacts 18 s the us caution in reengaging with north korea stemmed from its interest in ensuring that any contact would be done on the clear basis that bilateral contact was not about managing north koreas nuclear program but rather about taking concrete measures to dismantle it the deputy secretary stated north korea had recently sent several positive signals including through xxxxx and state beijing 00002964 004 of 005 xxxxxxxxxxxx meetings north korean public comments that walked back its previous rejection of the sixparty talks hints that there could be new formation for international talks on denuclearization and statements that north korea understood the goal was denuclearization premier wen jiabaos october visit would present another opportunity to convey to north korea that the sixparty talks partners shared common position 19 s on the current status of usdprk bilateral talks the deputy secretary explained that there had been exchanges in recent days through the new york channel on modalities for bilateral contacts the us wanted to ensure that if direct engagement occurred the dprk would participate at high level this would be the only way to determine whether north korea was serious about engagement while the us was prepared to have bilateral contact with north korea it was not willing to engage in extended bilateral negotiations in which an agreement would be reached outside of the sixparty talks framework the only way to ensure an effective solution was to guarantee that all of the sixparty talks partners interests were brought into play the deputy secretary said while also noting that sixparty talks partners interests were similar but not identical key question kim jongils calculus 20 s the deputy secretary suggested that the key questions concerned kim jongils motivations specifically how he viewed his interests and how much emphasis he placed on reaching solution to the nuclear issue and normalization of relations with the us as part of his legacy the deputy secretary emphasized the need for continued close dialogue with china dprk not clearly committed to denuclearization 21 s ambassador detrani said that the us assessed largely as result of xxxxxxxxxxxx seemingly successful efforts that the dprk was ready to return to multilateral talks on its nuclear program the us further assessed that north korea at strategic level had not committed to the goal of complete verifiable irreversible denuclearization north korea wanted to be accepted as nuclear state with icbm capabilities the dprks september 3 letter to the was indicative of this point in the letter the dprk acknowledged that it had reprocessed spent fuel rods and extracted plutonium that was being weaponized and after six years of denial admitted to possessing uranium enrichment program key question would be whether north korea would negotiate while unsc resolution 1874 sanctions were still in place ambassador detrani noted 22 s ambassador detrani observed that north korea had established pattern of walking away from negotiations as sign of displeasure such as its 13month hiatus from the sixparty talks after the us had suggested it possessed an heu program and its similarly long absence in protest of reports of money laundering through macau bank bda in both of these instances the sixparty talks partners had conceded something after which the dprk returned to the talks the us intelligence community assessed that if the sixparty talks partners did not concede something the dprk would be reluctant to move the sixparty process forward ambassador detrani emphasized the shared uschina objective in achieving progress in the sixparty talks building upon the september 2005 joint statement that xxxxxxxxxxxx was so instrumental in crafting china committed to 6party talks denuclearization 23 s the sixparty talks on the whole have been positive xxxxxxxxxxxx declared xxxxxxxxxxxx recounted that he had told north korean counterparts on numerous occasions that the sixparty talks enabled the us and north korea to feel comfortable with bilateral engagement china supported usdprk bilateral engagement and such contact would not affect uschina relations xxxxxxxxxxxx assured allowing that other sixparty talks partners might not share the same view beijing 00002964 005 of 005 24 s xxxxxxxxxxxx affirmed that china was committed to getting north korea back to the negotiating table in order to protect the gains that had been made and to advance the sixparty talks all parties had to remain committed to the september 2005 joint statement on north koreas denuclearization xxxxxxxxxxxx allowed that in light of the current situation it might be necessary to refine the statement but nonetheless the september 2005 statement had to serve as the starting point 25 s on north korean denuclearization xxxxxxxxxxxx agreed with the us assessment that it would be difficult to obtain north koreas commitment the us should inform north korea that improved usdprk relations depended upon verifiable steps toward denuclearization xxxxxxxxxxxx agreed with the us assessment that north korea had not made strategic decision to forego its nuclear weapons program north korea was looking in particular at its relations with the us and was not moved by chinese representations of what steps the us would be willing to take north korea often insisted that it was an independent country and did not like having china as gobetween with the us according to xxxxxxxxxxxx china urges bilateral multilateral combination 26 s xxxxxxxxxxxx proposed that sixparty talks partners consider using bilateral mechanisms within the sixparty talks framework to improve relations with north korea through combination of bilateral and multilateral channels it might be possible to persuade north korea to abandon its nuclear program because the opportunity to persuade north korea still existed china would continue making vigorous efforts in this pursuit xxxxxxxxxxxx stressed that the chinese government was serious about unsc resolution 1874 implementation adding that there had not been any change in chinas policy 27 s the deputy secretary agreed with xxxxxxxxxxxx basic conclusions expressed appreciation for xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx leadership on the north korea issue and reiterated the us interest in continued close contact with china xxxxx offered to provide briefing for the us immediately following premier wen jiabaos october 46 visit to pyongyang 28 u the deputy secretary cleared this message huntsman huntsman
