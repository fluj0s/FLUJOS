development jsf talk3 talking points pratt whitney february 23 2006become known as the great engine war that ran from 1984 to 1994 the great engine war describes the competition between pratt whitney pw and general electric ge to produce engines the f100 and f110 respectively to power the air forces f16 falcon fighter aircraft11 this competition wa s held annually between 1984 and 1994 to produce and maintain these engines for the air force after 1994 pw and ge continued to compete for engi ne business among foreign air forces that operated the f16 and f15 at the time th is acquisition strategy was unprecedented and controversial many extolled the advantages of competition and the benefits it conferred to dod and the taxpayer ot hers however believed that the engine competition unjustifiably jeopardized combat effectiveness and pilot survivability12 the great engine wars roots extend we ll before 1984 in the development of the f100 engine for the f15 in the 1970s hi storians note air force frustrations with pratt whitneys management along w ith concerns about solesource engine powering their fighter fleet as the impetus for an alternate engine while the f100 was the most advanced engine ever developed at that time its rushed development to meet f15 initial fielding deadline prevented problems from being properly addressed in addition one re port notes that the f100 engine was so powerful and the f15 so maneuverable that pilots began pushing the aircraft to the edge of the performance envelope in ways that stressed the engine far more than had been anticipated13 mounting frustrations over pratt whitneys reluctance to fully address the f100s shortcomings without dditional funding resulted in the air force navy and congress working in concert to fund work on an alternate engine14 after number of contentious hearings in 1979 congress provided funding through the engine model derivative pr ogram emdp congressiona lly directed program of the 1960s for ge to devel op its f101 alternat engine to become the f110 ultimately dod spent over 376 million to deve lop the f110 to compete with the f100 and 600 million to improve the f100s durability and reliab ility to make it stronger compe titor proponent s believe that the annual competition during the great engine war produced better engines on be tter terms for less money than would purchasing from single company facing competition r ecently contrary opinions have emerged and pr att and whitney notes that there is evidence that the f16 engine competition saved money15 however preponderance of

improvement group the govern ment accountab ility office and the institute for defense analyses had all completed their reports on the merits of the alternate engine program results summarized in the next section it appears that the administrations decision in fy2009 budget to terminate f136 is again influenced more by nearterm budgetary pressures than by the potential gains in the future the alternate engine program appears to be affected in budget considerations by the fact that its benefits wont be realized for decade while its costs are noteworthy and immediate congressionally mandated

unlike the f100f 110 competiti on the competition for the fa18 the f404 engine differs from the great engine war in that bot h ge and pw competed only in cost since they were both building identical gedesigned f404 engines analysts note that the f404 competition removed key component engine design since both companies built their engines to the same blueprints therefore analysts note that the f404 competition did not achieve the same results as the previous f100f110 competition for independentlydesigned engines 20 osd cost analysis improvement group report v6 f35jsf alternate engine acquisition and independent cost analyses march 15 2007 slide 31 21 in discussion with the caig learning curve rotation was defined as the effect competition has on the learning curve in this case competition would result in both competitors streamlining their processes in order to comp ete more effectively maximize efficiency hence lower cost to the air force 22 net present value is the discounted present va lue of the return on investment when taking risk and other potential investme nt opportunities into considerati on it is considered the standard method for financial ppraisal of longterm projects 23 osd caig report slide 37great engine wars the engine competition for the fa18 aircraft19 and the sole source pratt and whitney f119 engine for the f22 given their analysis of past cost performance stemming from competition th caig report noted their baseline assumptions were generally favorable to dual source case20 the caig assumed that the follower in this case the ger olls royce fighter engine team f136 would meet leader pratt whitney f135 pricing in 2014 first year of competition the caig also assumed that there would be both an immediate 5 price decrease and 5 increase in the rate for cost improvement what the caig calls learning curve rotation21 over the lifetime of the program overall the caig estimated that the competition would require 211 reduction in costs in constant fy2002 dolla rs over the lifetime of the program in order to break even the breakeven cost reduction require ment climbs to 256 when converted to net present value22 the caig estimated that dod would be unable to recoup its initial i nvestment in the alternate engine development program through procurement savings alone th caig report noted dod would have to effectively compete operations and support ie maintenance contracts and attain 256 savings which the report seems skepti cal of attaining in order to eventually reach break even point by 204023 while the caig report highlights from fi nancial standpoint th at the alternate engine program might eventually break even over time the caig goes on to note number of nonmonetary benefits that could be gained through having an alternate engine program for the f35 one of the most notable appears to be the issue of growth potential in the joint strike fighter engine as shown in the figure below thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33390crs6 24 the caigs analysis of expected future we ight growth is not in line with the joint program offices estimate that weight will unchanged after initial operational capability ioc the caig slide shows historical data showing expect ed weight growth of 28 to 115 following ioc from other 4th and 5th generation fighter aircraft additionally the caigs estimated preioc weight growth of 6 is in stark contrast to the jpos estimate of 3 25 ibid slides 25 and 26 note since the f136 is earlier in its development cycle analysts comment that its design is not as set as th f135 and could better incorporate engine growth requirements without major modificationscaig estimates that the average aircraft weight growth of 4th5th generation fighter from critical design review to initial op erational capability is 72 with 03 weight growth thereafter24 basically the initial planned empty weight of an aircraft could grow over time beyond the thrust marg ins of safety provided by the engine eventually the engine would have to be upgraded for additional thrust to overcome the additional aircraft weight the caig report notes that pratt whitneys f135 engine is already close to exceeding the signed engine temperature specifications therefore the f135 engine would require dditional modifications beyond that of the gerolls royce f136 engine to allow for thrust growth25 source osd caig f35jsf alternate engine acquisition and independent cost analyses report march 15 2007 institute for defense analyses the institute for defense analyses ida was

an estimated gross savings due to competition ranging from 11 to 1826 when examining past studies of various procurement competitions ida determined that these studies showed an average weighted savings of 14627 examining the breakeven point for the case of the f136 ida determined the overall increase in cost of having an lternate engine program both direct and indirect costs to be 88 billion fy2006 dollars28 as was the case with the caigs findings ida concluded that it would not be feasible to recoup dods investment in an alternate engine if procurement costs alone were competed ida determined for the alternate engine program to break even on net present value basis the savings required would fall from an unrealistic 40 to 18 net present value when operations and support contracts are also competed29 this is somewhat in line with the caig nd shows potential for dod to recoup its investment throughout the life of the alternate engine program however ida noted that dod has not typically linked procurement and costs in single competition and therefore d limited historical data in which to estimate plausible savings raising doubts as to how ccessful this will be in the future30 ida like the caig also noted number of other benefits stemming from competition improved fleet readiness redu ced risk and industrial base sustainment are common benefits cited by both reports however ida notes that contractor responsiveness was the primary motiv ation for the great engine war31 ida goes on to note that by 2035 that the f35 would co mprise 95 of the uss fighter attack force thus with an alternate engine program any future groundings will only affect portion of the fleet in addition enha nced industry responsiveness to engine upgrades and fixes resulting from

gaos acquisition and sourcing management noted that he belie ved the alternate engine program would reach its breakeven point by the late 2020s34 similarities and differe nces between the studies what

testified that he speculated the other two studies may have included portion of costs sunk into the alternate engine program35 however in response james woolsey from ida not ed that ida did not include sunk costs and also commented that he thought the major difference between gao and the other studies had to do with costs associat ed with operations and support os36 he contended that ida included sustainment gineering costs costs to improve the engine and additional costs tied to two supply chains that might not have been included in the gaos analysis gao analysts however noted that under competitive environment the need for an f35 engine component improvement program cip would be reduced and therefore potential funding required for ci p was not included in their analysis37

suggest the us cannot be relied on and that britain should look instead to fran ce and european institutions on defense54 however other european countries such as the netherlands have firms making inroads into both the f135 and f136 programs the dutch currently have 74 companies and research labs involved in the jsf program55 as european companies secure more and more contracts the deba within each of the partner nations over the need for the second engine might become more complicated operational risk dod officials argue that terminating th f136 poses little operational risk the decision to pursue an alternate engine fo r f14s f15s and f16s they say came at time when the services were dissatisfied with the performance of existing engines tf30 and f100 during the great engine war dod was more motivated to improve engine performance reliability and to reduce operational risk than by potential cost savings dod argues that these same conditions do not exist today in briefing provided to cong ress in 2006 the dod office of program analysis and evaluation pae stated the f135 engine produced by pratt whitney pw for the f35 was performing well56 further pae stated that the f119 engine that pw produced for the f22a raptor which served as the basis of the f135 is also performing well pae notes that the f119 has performed well after roughly 18000 flight hours and will achieve 100000 flight hours by 2009 this briefing also notes that the f22 raptor and the fa18ef super hornet rely on sole source engine supplier the pw f 119 and ge f414 respectively implying that the f35 can likewise rely on single engine manufacturer however by the time the decision was made to divide engine pr oduction contracts between ge and pw in 1984 the pw f100 engine had accu mulated 2000000 hours of operational service by comparison the 18000 hours of testing might be considered modest foundation to make proj ections of the f119s future performance dod also argues that industry advan ces in engine design tools such as computational fluid design for airflow prediction and advanced software for prognostic health monitoring further redu ce the risk of powering the f35 with single type of engine57 presumably using these tools will result in engines that are capable of selfdiagnosis and notification to the pilot of impending failure vicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33390crs13 58 loren

only allow the pilot time to land prior to failure it will allow more efficient and costeffective maintenance procedures and quicker diagnosis of required repair parts others who support dods decision to terminate the f136 argue that an alternate engine will not help mitigate risk one defense analyst postulates that the alternate engine could actually increase operational risk this analyst notes that engines undergoing maturation first in tw inengine aircraft such as the f15 f22 or the fa18 prior to use in singleengine aircraft allow more time for detecting and fixing engine deficiencies58 another analyst however notes that the f135 is quite different than the f119 it was derived from59 therefore while being derivative of an engine first introduced on the twin engine f22 it is still expected to undergo developmental grow ing pains with the f35 in the same vein the f136 is three to four years behind the f135 in its development and should undergo its own set of developmental growing pains and potential for cost growth recent events with the f135 engine devel opment have increased attention to the issue of risk once on august 30 2007 and again on february 4 2008 the f135 engine experienced testing failures while on the test stand the jsf joint program office noted the engine failures in both cases were due to highcycle fatigue resulting in the failure of thirdstage turbine blade60 william balderson from the department of the navy noted during cong ressional testimony that the second engine failure was as result of ongoing testing to determine the causes of the first failure on august 3061 mr balderson goes on to note that pratt whitney appears confident that it understands the root causes of the malfunctions and that design fix is in the works and will be implemented once testing is complete62 program and service officials note that these engine malfunctions have pushed back the expected first flight of the f35b aircraft month or two those supporting an alternate engine point to the potential risk of future fleet wide grounding and note that the f35 w ill make up preponde rance of the air forces fighter fleet currently the ai r force has 183 f22s with potential for maybe an additional 24 aircraft the air for ce is also currently expected to procure 1763 f35s over the next 20 plus years future fleetwide grounding of the f35s they maintain would potentially have debilitating effect on the air force similar issue though unrelated to the aircra ft engines was recently experienced when the air force twice grounded its fleet of f15s because of

its sizeable fleet of f16s to take up the slack the navys operational risk should be reduced because its fleet will be more ba lanced with fa18s using the ge404 or 414 on the ef engines along with their f35s while fleetwide groundings for enginerelated malfunctions are rare they do happen the marine corps for example grounded 106 av8b harriers in ju ly 2000 after faulty engine bearing was cited as the cause of crash63 since 1997 66 of the navys grounding bulletins were for airframe related issues whereas 18 were related to engine issues64 the air force has experienced only two systemwide fleet standdowns due to engine issues since 199065 some have responded that the air force could find itself in the same grounding predicament with the f35 based on nonengine issues regardless of whether there is an alternate engine because of reduced diversity of its future fighter fleet one issue that pertains to operational ri sk that has not been discussed by dod is that of reduced fleet readiness due to for example lack of spare parts two manufacturers would maintain two supply chains and perhaps additional suppliers for critical parts eliminating one manufactur er could lead to fewer suppliers and potentially leave the remaining supply chai n more vulnerable to disruptions caused by labor disagreements foreig n takeovers or natural disa sters on the other hand splitting the engine buy will reduce the workload for the supply vendors and increase the level of uncertainty as to the amount of business they will receive in addition one defense consulting firm notes that appr oximately 50 of each engine is procured in competition environment today leading one to conclude there are multiple vendors available that could creat parts for each of the engines66 during march 1 2006 hearing secret ary of the air force michael wynne discussed the potential cost and risk of having one engine supplier versus two secretary wynne said that the decision to terminate the f136 was very tough call because it involves industria l base and involves longter m reliability statistics and involves economics in the context of reliability and risk secretary wynne continued with the

limits the buy to 680 and fully supports the marine corps requirementscost and savings68 over the past three years dod has main ly explained its decision to terminate the f136 on its financial return on its investment congre ssional testimony by osdatl the air force and the navy all note that the business case does not sufficiently support the large upfront inves tment in an alternate engine for the f35 as was previously noted by the three congressionally directed studies and associated testimony back in 2007 while there are num ber of nonfinancial benefits to having an alternate engine the ability for dod to r ecoup its financial inve stment is matter of great debate it is not surprising that there is lot of debate on the merits of the f136 especially given the complexity of the i ssue and the amount of resources required to fund second engine there is inevitably lot of subjectivity when analyzing business cases in the case of the f136 one will need to assess how likely it is for the program to achieve the estimated savings the likely number of engines that will be acquired the potential for the fleet to suffer debilitating issue related to the engine how much better the engine designs will improve and how much more responsive the manufacturers will be under competitive environment not only will one have to assess the ability to achieve financial nd nonfinancial improvements but one will have to assess the qualitative worth of such savings when compared to the opportunity costs of the investment both within dod and outside analysts note that the f136 program requires large upfront investment for bene fits that wont be realized for decades these factors aris in an environment where dod is facing tough financial choices while on warfooting and the potential for budget reductions as administrations change two of the key variables in analyzing the business case for the f136 is the development cost of the alternate engine and the number of engines that those costs will be amortized over beginning with expected procurement numbers dod is currently planning on buying 2443 f35s exc luding test articles the air force current engine production profile for the f35 is for total of 3649 engines 3173 primary engines and 476 spares69 this current engine production profile is about 100 engines more than the three congressi onally directed studies used for their analysis back in 2007 however th overall planned dod procurement of 2443 operational f35s is over 500 aircraft less than the 1996 preliminary planning estimate of 2978 aircraft it should be emphasized that dods planned buy of 2443 aircraft has remained stead since 2003 when the department of the navy under the tactical aircraft integration plan reduced its buy from 1083 to 680 aircraft70 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33390crs16 71 while procurement numbers have remained steady the length of the acquisition program has been extended due to issues with aircraft weight growth resulting in

international orders as previously mentioned are expected to exceed the minimum anticipated orders of 646 aircra ft and could reach over 2500 aircraft71 in addition the f35 is designed to take the pl ace of the f16 an aircraft with an initial planned run of 1388 aircraft th at eventually exceeded 4000 built72 dod has been focused on keeping the f35 program on tr ack and procurement numbers sufficient to prevent undo cost growth deputy secr etary of defense england in letter to congress noted the departme nts desires to procure mo re f35s than additional f 22s73 given the disparity between the af requirement for 381 f22s and the current program of record of 183 aircraft there ppears to be strong potential for the air force requirement of f35s to grow bey ond 1763 aircraft if the f35 program goes beyond current procurement expectations both for domestic and international orders the business case for keeping the f136 program alive might be significantly strengthened however current service and allies budget pressures along with aircraft cost and development issues may drive lower pr ocurement numbers one defense analyst notes the air forces procurement num bers are likely to fall to around 12001400 aircraft74 another analytical assessment notes the air forces strategy to replace legacy aircraft on oneforone basis is excessive and that one might contemplate 8001000 f35as as being sufficient75 the department of the navy on the other hand is facing tactical ai rcraft shortfall of around 125 aircraft in 2017 while the marine corps appears focused on acquiring the stovl variant for its modernization efforts the navy could potentially acquire additional fa18efs to help reduce its fighter shortfall with the navy bein g the only customer for the f35c reductions in their numbers could put the viability of the cvariant into question in addition there could be fallout over the kcx competition in which northrop grummaneads kc30 tanker won over boei ngs kc767 potential fallout could affect the f35s international orders if the competition results are overturned and european nations backlash against the pr icy us fighter finally any program setbacks that result in excessive cost growth beyond what has already been encountered to date could have profound effect on airc raft orders on both sides of the atlantic therefore there is potential that dods business case planning factors for the f136 alternate engine might not reach the levels assumed in the current studies and therefore become very expensive nice to

stated gao did not incorporate cip in its 2007 analysis because of its position that competition would reduce its need79 the gao analysts felt that competition woul d drive the manufacturers to make the improvements in their engines on their own to help them attain larger share of the engine contracts ida however did include cip after its analysis of the results of the great engine war ida notes that wh ile cip funding did not exceed 4 of the estimated life cycle costs in any of their analysis it is still cost that must be approximately doubled to ensure two equally supported engine designs80 procurement and spares costs will be required whether there is single or dual supplier of engines while the numbers could result in greater number of spare engines required under dual supply envir onment the overall number should remain close however there will be additional costs in maintaining two separate production and supply lines along with th additional manageme nt required by the services industrial base as noted earlier dod officials have expressed concern over the potential impact of this proposed termination on the industrial base further dod analyses acknowledge that the f136 alternate engine provides significan t industrial base benefits81 therefore it is reasonable to assume that the decision to terminate the f136 may have negative consequences on the industrial base th debate focuses on how significant these negative consequences may behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33390crs18 82 however as previously noted rolls royce will be opening up new plant in virginia in

reduced ges commercial cfm56 numbers by half this methodology was us ed with other joint engine ventures the future engine for the 737 and a320x is still undecided between ge pw and rolls royce however the teal group accounted for the kc45 competition by awarding its engines to ge the industrial base issues discussed nd debated in hearings and other public fora have focused on whether single

engines if the f136 engine was terminated ida provided more indepth analysis on the effects to the industrial base in their final report while they concluded that the us industrial base may not be irreparably harmed if the f136 engine is terminated they ex pressed reservations in dod placing all of its fighter engine production with firm that has weak position in the commercial marketplace86 ida felt that firm with weak commercial marketplace presence would have fewer resources that could be leveraged for use on dod products ida also examined the top suppliers of components for the f136 and determined that it is unlikely that any supplier would exit the domestic industrial base because of f136 termination87 overall ida concluded that the us indus trial base would be stronger as

these cost projections for six years the air force let six years of firmfixed price or nottoexceed contracts from the first production lot prio r to the great engine war government had succeeded in negotiating firmfixed price contracts only after the engine had been operating in the field for several years never before had contractors agreed to provide cost projections into the future and contracts were ty pically for production only not work by requiring ge and pw to compet for annual production and work dod may have reaped number of benefits such as better contract terms and conditions better warranties to assure engine quality consistency and long term stability of support97 further after competition was introduced the incumbent pw offered engine improvements to the air force earlier than the air force had been led to expect without the competition98 to avoid potential disruptions in production and to protect itself agains t price gouging dod required each contractor
