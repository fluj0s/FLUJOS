bridge publications inc newsletter date making man free were doing it the honest way in scientology because with very simple contraption with the greatest of ease we could go around and anybody who was opposing scientology would all of sudden start being madly insanely in favor of it but thats the easy way to do it and thats whats wrong with the race is everybody has tried it the easy waycontrol restraint more engrams more punishment lets make man free and when we make man free we find out what he consists of and we find out that he is cooperative that he will compute automatically for the greatest good of the greatest number l ron hubbard excerpted from the scientology milestone one lectures selfdeterminism and postulates an article by l ron hubbard from the scientology milestone one lectures person is as healthy and sane as he is selfdetermined selfdeterminism should be very free the environment should not affect an individual unless he expressly desires it to affect him stimulusresponse is very low on the tone scaleits around 11very low the idea that because you see something in the environment its going to affect you gives you some sort of an idea of the tone scale of the people i was working with in the first book the first book is to large degree stimulusresponse dissertation and if you want to know how stimulusresponse works you can study it in the first book thats stimulusresponse and its very very sharp the way this works now working with processes which pick one up out of that level faster you dont have to work with this lowlevel process stimulusresponse is an unhealthy circumstance whereby the individual is affected willynilly and without choice by his environment selfdeterminism and sanity selfdeterminism goes up to enormous heights and it doesnt mean that person becomes completely indifferent and detached he can become very very intimate with existence because he dares to be at high level of selfdeterminism person is as sane as he is selfdetermined now that should be fairly simple it comes to this degree do you know that nobody can be sick unless he has desired to be sick at some time or other thats very fascinating you say to somebody why you say nobody can do this i never wished i was sicknot in my whole life and you can always throw him this little curve and it usually throws him if you get that reaction you say did you ever try to keep from going to school and he says oh that well yes i pretended i was sick few times then well lets remember one of those times and we find out that hes using this same mechanism to keep from going to work years later only by this time its developed into what they call chronic whateveritis such thing as an allergy can develop in this fashion the little boy is forced to eat something and he says i dont like it still they insist he eats it so he says it makes sick and he says this very emphatically and he argues with it and he loses the argument twenty years later you pick him up and you find out very mysteriously that corn makes him sick now why should corn make him sick well he said so hes boss so he said so so now its got to make him sick because if person doesnt obey his own postulates he is wrong the second he doesnt do what his postulate said then he proves that he is wrong and its an odd thing about rightness and wrongness but theas wrong as you can get of course is dead and if you get completely wrong youre dead so wrongness is measure of level on the tone scale again and when person gets down around 25 20 15 10 believe he cant afford to be wrong being wrong just once will finish himboom and yet hes at level where hes forcing himself to be wrong and hes in terrible chaotic state below 20 person is more mest universe than he ishes more controlled by the mest universe than he is by himself people who worry about postulates and so you find that at very low levels on the tone scale people worry madly about their own postulatesthe second they begin to know about postulates then theyll start worrying about postulates and theyll go back and theyll pick up their own postulates and then they get afraid to make postulates and so on because they cant afford to be wrong that is why invalidation of lowlevel preclear can be almost fatalbecause you tell him hes wrong invalidate him you say something is wrong about what you remembered and he just cant stand that strain now you can take somebody way up the tone scale and you can say youre wrong and you can bring out mathematics you can bring out bowditch you can bring out anything you want to bring out and demonstrate to him conclusively and utterly and forcefully and with harsh words that he is awful wrong and he will look at it and hell say yep i guess i was what did we have to eat tonight for dinner he says lets have some of that i mean thats about as much effect as it is he can afford to be wrong l ron hubbard from the lecture thought emotion and effort excerpted from
