reasons 14 b and d 1 s in response to media reports surrounding the visit of iranian defense minister najar to moscow february 1618 that russia would move ahead with the delivery of the s300 air defense missile system to iran ambassador expressed strong concern to dfm ryabkov february 17 ref ryabkov replied that moscow had gotten the message this followed ambassadors demarches on the issue the previous week to presidential foreign policy advisor prikhodko and pm fp advisor ushakov as well as us burns and nsc senior director mcfauls expressions of strong concern regarding the possible completion of the delivery with fm lavrov ref b prikhodko and ushakov 2 sbu late february 17 news daily kommersant reported that rosoboronexport spokesman vyacheslav davidenko said that russia and iran were unlikely to agree on deliveries of the s300 air defense missile system during najars visit davidenko reportedly said that nothing has changed as to the deliveries of s300 to tehran and that things were unlikely to change after naijars visit press reports february 18 followed up saying that russia had deferred its plan to sell s300s to iran in an effort to improve moscows relations with the new obama administration they cited rosoboronexport general director isaikins comment that if the president and government of the russian federation make decision rosoboronexport must implement it isaikin said russia had not delivered the system to iran but was ready to do so if ordered daily izvestiya also reported that dfm ryabkov said that russia saw to it that its military cooperation is transparent and in keeping with international law 3 c israeli dcm yuval fuchs told us february 17 that fm lavrov was in israel over the weekend and assured the goi that russia was not supplying any s300 missiles to any countries in the middle east according to fuchs lavrov failed to give any heads up to the goi about najars visit this week fuchs added that rosatom head sergey kiriyenko and deputy fm aleksey borodavkin will make separate trips to iran later this month kiriyenko will travel to discuss irans nuclear facility at bushehr while borodavkin is going for consultations 4 c comment russian officials appear to have stepped back at least temporarily from announcing delivery of the s300s but pressure will remain within the military and security services to move forward as much for financial reasons as for political or foreign policy considerations the prospect of more constructive usrussian relations may have tempered the gor response but we will continue to be told that russia retains its right to proceed with an arms sale that does not violate national or international regimes for better or for worse the delivery of s300s have become barometer of our bilateral relations beyrle
