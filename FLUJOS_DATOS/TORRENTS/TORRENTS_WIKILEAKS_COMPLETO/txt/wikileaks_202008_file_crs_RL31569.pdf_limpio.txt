drafting are clear if congress wishes to create rights in private individuals and make those ri ghts enforceable it should do so explicitly background 42 usc 1983 during the 1960s and 1970s citizens increasin gly resorted to federal courts for redress of grievances important legislation had been enacted eg the civil rights act of 1964 and the voting rights act of 1968 the warren court had recognized number of individual and civil rights nd the court was also generally receptive to judicial review several means were available to bring suit and these included the doctrine of implied private rights of acti on as well as 42 usc 1983 for while the court was receptive to implied private rights of action but when the court tightened the rules during the 1970s litigants increasingly looked elsewhere section 1983 was available for suits against state and local officials and the courts decision in maine v thiboutot 448 us 1 1980 greatly broa dened its possible applicability 42 usc 1983 enacted as part of the civil rights act of 1871 and as revised in 1874 provides every person who under color of any stat ute ordinance regulation custom or usage of any state or territory subjects any citizen of the united states or other person within the jurisdiction ther eof to the deprivation of any rights privileges or immunities secured by the constitution and laws shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law suit in equity or other proper proceeding for redress emphasis addedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31569crs2 1 given that congress attached modifiers to the phrase and laws the plain language of the statute undoubtedly embrace s respondents claim that pe titioners violated the social security act 448 us at 4 dissenting ju stice powell offered plainmeaning rebuttal the majority read the phrase as if it said constitution or laws rather than constitution and laws attaching significance to the choice of and narrows section 1983s scope to those laws that protect constitutional as well as statutory rights 2 principal reliance was placed on rosado v wyman 397 us 397 1970 which had involved pendent section 1983 claim but other decisions were also cited

not limited to civil rights and equal protection laws or to any other subset of federal laws but by its terms applies to all federal laws thus the plaintiffs in that case could sue state official s under section 1983 for denial of welfare benefits that they allegedly were entitled to under the soci security act the case was decided by 63 vote justice brennans concluso ry opinion of the court relied on the plain meaning of the statutory language1 and on history of recent litigation in which some courts including the supreme cour t had seemingly recognized section 1983 actions to enforce rights derived from the social security act2 justice brennans opinion did not address the source of c ongressional power to enact the social security act the spending power justice powells dissent in thiboutot joined by thenjustice rehnquist as well as by chief justice burger looked to th origins of secti on 1983 to c ounter the majoritys assertions sec tion 1 of the civil rights act of 1871 from which section 1983 is derived did not contain the phr ase and laws but instead provided jurisdiction and remedy for deprivations of rights secured by the constitution of the united states the phrase and laws was added by the revised statutes of 1874 and was not brought to congresss attention as substantive change moreover the revised statutes had divide d section 1 into different sections by separating the remedy from the jurisdicti onconferring statute now 28 usc 13433 jurisdiction was extended only for claims secured by the constitution or by any act of congress providing for equal rights of citizens or of all persons within the jurisdiction of the united states justice powell argued that congress could not have intended to extend section 1983 b eyond the reach of its jurisdictional counterpart3 because of their common origin and purpose the two provisions 1983 and 13433 were meant to be nd are complementary the court had held prior to thiboutot 4 justice powell also voiced concerns over the federalism implications of the courts holding corresponding action is possible against federal officials implementin g cooperative federalstate programs yet the courts interpretation conferred on courts unprecedented author ity to oversee state actionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31569crs3 5 448 us at 25 to illustrate the nature of the civil rights created by the courts decision justice powell included an appendi x listing sample of federal statutes including grant programs that could give ri to section 1983 action the justice grouped statutes into three broad categories joint regulatory endeavors resource management programs that may be administered by coopera tive agreements and grant programs id at 34 6 justice rehnquists opinion was joined by chie f justice burger and by justices stewart powell and stevens justice blackmun concurred separately justice white dissented joined by justices brennan and marshallthat have little or nothing to do with the individual rights defined and enforced by the civil rights legislation of the reconstruction era5 exceptions year later the sweep of thiboutot was limited somewhat by the courts decisions in pennhurst state school and hospital v halderman 451 us 1 1981 and middlesex county sewerage authority v national sea clammers association 453 us 1 1981 two categories of excepti ons were created one for statutes with language too vague or amorphous to create rights and the other for statutes with comprehensive remedial m echanisms leaving room for supplementation by way of section 1983 actions pennhurst right created the court in pennhurst held that despite its name the developmentally disabled assistance and bill of rights act does not create rights in individuals that are enforceable in section 1983 action justice re hnquist wrote the courts opinion6 the act which provided federal gran ts to states to develop programs to care for and treat mentally retarded pe rsons also contained section captioned rights of the developmentally disabled this bill of rights consisted of congressional findings that disabled persons have right to appropriate treatment services and habilitati on and that states and the federal government have an obligation to provide serv ices that are appropriate to the needs of such persons there were two aspects to the decision on its facts the case was distinguishable and fairly narrow read as whole the act was mere federalstate funding statute the bill of rights section was merely general statement of congressional findings in sense freefloating and not specifically tied to states acceptance of federal funding thus the act as whole arguably did not purport to create j udicially enforceable rights and section 1983 was therefore inapplicable justice rehnquist also included genera l language about congresss spending power language recently relied on by the court in gonzaga university v doe legislation enacted pursuant to the spending power is much in the nature of contract the legitimacy of congre ss power to legislate under the spending power thus rests on whether the state voluntarily and knowingl accepts the terms of the contract

opinion of the court was joined by chief justice burger and by justices brennan stewart white marshall and rehnquist justice st evens joined by justice blackm dissented in part arguing that private damages remedy was pr ecluded not by the comprehensiveness of the remedial schemes both laws had savings clau ses but rather because neither statute was enacted for the special benefit of particular class of which the plaintiff is member 453 us at 32 10 468 us 992 100912 1994 11 wright v city of roanoke redevel opment and housing authority 479 us 418 423 1987 this was 54 decision justice white

moneys it must do so unambiguously7 the issue was not therefore whether the act purported to cr eate rights in individuals but whether congress in 6010 imposed an obligation on th states to spend state money to fund those rights as condition of receiving federal moneys or whether it spoke merely in precatory terms8 sea clammers statute precludes section 1983 remedy in sea clammers the court held that the clean water act and the marine protection research and sa nctuaries act both containe d comprehensive remedial scheme including specific authorization fo r citizen suits that left room for additional private actions under section 1983 when the remedial devices provided in particular act are sufficiently comprehensive they may suffice to demonstrate congressional intent to precl ude the remedy of suits under 1983 it is hard to believe that congress intende d to preserve the 1983 right of action when it created so many specific statutory remedies including the two citizensuit provisions9 similarly in smith v robinson 10 the court held that the education of the handicapped acts carefully tailored administrative and judicial mechanism created exclusive remedies that left room for supplementation through section 1983 actions that section 1983s applicability wa s the general rule and that pennhurst and sea clammers were viewed as the exceptions to the rule was evident in the courts approach in cases involving th housing and medicaid programs if there is state deprivation of ri ght secured by federal statute 1983 provides remedial cause of action unless the state actor demonstrates by express provision or other specific evid ence from the statute itself that congress intended to foreclose such private enforcement11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31569crs5 12 479 us

and kennedy 14 496 us at 523application of general rule in wright v city of roanoke re development and housing authority the court held that public housing tenant could bring section 1983 action to compel the local housing authority to comply with the brooke amendment to the housing act of 1937 the brooke amendment imposed rent ceiling on lowincome housing units funded by the act and hud regulations specified that ren ts subject to the ceiling include reasonable allowance for utilities the court majority brushed aside the issue of whether the statute and regulation conferred enforceable rights on tenants asserting that the existence of ch rights was undeniable the court also rejected the lower courts conclusion that hud had the exclusive authority to enforce the tenants rights the remedial devices were not sufficiently comprehensive the court explained and moreover there were other indications that congress had not intended to preclude private actions congress had explicitly precluded judicial review of one relatively narrow issue huds implementation of phasein of rent increases based on huds assurances that the limitation would not otherwise affect tenants ability to enforce their rights in federal court the court concluded that nothing in the housing act or the br ooke amendment evidences that congress intended to preclude pe titioners 1983 claim12 similar approach was taken in wilder v virginia hospital association 13 in which the court held that health care pr oviders could bring section 1983 action to enforce reimbursement provision contai ned in the boren amendment to the medicaid act the context was federal grant to states the boren amendment required that states plan for medical assistance provide for reimbursement of services with assurances satisfactory to the secretary that the reimbursements would be reasonable and adequate for efficiently run facilities the court determined that this language granted health care providers substantive and enforceable right to reasonable and ad equate compensation distinguishing pennhurst the court ruled that the language was not so vague and amorphous as to be unenforceable even though the secret ary was authorized to withhold funds for states noncompliance the court thought th at private actions we re not foreclosed federal court suits by pr oviders had been commonplace before enactment of the boren amendment and the amendment did not eliminate the basis for these actions the burden was on the state to show that congress had intended to foreclose private actions and the remedial scheme was not so comprehensive as to merit such an inference also the availability of ad ministrative procedures ordinarily does not foreclose resort to

then restated in wilder16 the first part of the test whether the statute created an enforceable right broke down into three subissues 1 is the provision in question designed to benefit the putative plaintiff 2 does the provision create obligations binding on the g overnment or is it rely an expression of congressional preference and 3 is th interest too vague and amorphous to be enforceable by the judiciary the tests second part was whether congress had specifically foreclosed remedy under sec tion 1983 here the burden is on the state to show by express provision or other specific evidence from the statute itself that congress intended to foreclose such private enforcement17 effective overruling although the law seemed relatively settle d on the proper approach to section 1983 actions seeking to enforce rights derived from spending statutes both wright and wilder had been decided by 5to4 votes and changed membership on the court resulted in quick aboutface between wilder in 1990 and suter v artist m in 1992 justice brennan had been replaced by justice souter and justice marshall had been replaced by justice thomas both ne w justices sided with the chief justice in suter and rehnquist had obtaine d majority to support his position by 2002 the chief justice was able to say that our more recent decisions have rejected attempts to infer enforceable rights from spending clause statutes18 rather pennhurst has become the general rule and wright and wilder had come to be viewed as the exceptions since pennhurst only twice have we found spending legislation to give rise to enforceable rights19 from wilder to gonzaga the path from wilder to gonzaga began and almost ended with suter v artist m20 gonzaga followed directly from suter in between however the court had applied the wrightwilder framework of analysis rather than the pennhurst framework in case in which the court he ld unanimously that the statute did not create right enforceable under section 198321

and thomas justice breyer joined by justice souter concurred justice stevens joined by justice ginsburg dissented 26 122 s ct at 2279 in suter v artist m 22 the court held that right enforceable under section 1983 was conferred by the adoption assi stance and child welfare act of 1980 which required states receiving funding to have plan to make reasonable efforts to keep children out of foster homes rejecting an action alleging that such reasonable efforts had been made the cour t concluded that careful examination of the statutory language does not unambiguous ly confer an enforceable right upon the acts beneficiaries23 moreover the implementing regulations were not specific and did not provide notice to the states that failure to do anything other than submit plan with the requisite features to be approved by the secretary is condition on the receipt of f unds from the federal government while the court could have followed pennhurst on the facts finding that the statutory language was too vague and amorphous to create enforceable rights it also seemed to rej ect the approach of wright and wilder altogether rather than empha sizing the states burden to show that congress had intended to preclude re view the court instead emphasized the plaintiffs burden to establish that congress had unambiguously authorized review muddying the waters bit was the courts 1997 decision in blessing v freestone 24 the courts unanimous holding was not surprising right enforceable under section 1983 was conferred by title ivd of the social security act which requires states receiving child welfare funding to substantially comply with requirements designed to ensu re timely payment of child support far from creating an individual entitlement to services the court concluded the standard is simply yardstick for the secretary to measure the systemwide performance of states title ivd program what was bit surprising is that the court relied on the wright framework rather than the pennhurstsuter approach gonzaga in 2002 the court reverted to the pennhurstsuter approach to hold that the family educational rights and privacy act of 1974 ferpa creates individual rights that are enforceable under section 1983 gonzaga university v doe was decided by 7to2 vote but there was only 5to4 majority supporting the pennhurstsuter rationale25 justice breyer joined by justice souter concurred on the facts but objected to use of pres umption to in effect predetermine an outcome26httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31569crs8 27 20 usc 1232gb1 funding restric tion 20 usc 1234ca

wilder 496 usat 508 n9ferpa is typical federal spending statute that places authority to allocate grants as well as primary enforcement authority in federal official it provides in part that funds shall not be provided to any educati onal institution which has policy or practice of permitting the releas of education records of students without the written consent of their pa rents to any individual agency or organization funding may be terminated if the secretary of education finds that recipient institution is failing to comply substantially with any requirement of the act27 applying pennhurst the court majority determined that congress had not spoken with clear voice in creating rights in students and their parents the court also moved to eliminate confusion attributed to blessings reliance on the wilder framework in doing so the court adde d new twist declaring that the same standard less and more used to determine whether statute creates private right of action determines whether statut confers rights enforceable under section 198328 the issue in both inquiries is wheth er congress intended to create federal right the answer was clear to the cour t there is question that ferpas nondisclosure provisions fail to confer enfor ceable rights ferpas provisions speak only to the secretary of educati on and speak only of institutional policy and practice not of individual instances of disclosure ferpas focus therefore is two steps removed from the interest s of individual stude nts and parents29 justice stevens dissent criticized the c ourts approach for seeming to conflate the two separate inquiries of whether there is right and whether there is remedy while the language from the majority opi nion quoted above is focused on the issue of whether there is right justice st evens pointed to other language of the majority it is implausible to presume that congress intended private suits to be brought before thousands of fe deral and statecourt judges30 that is directed instead at the remedy this definition of right in terms of enforcement justice stevens asserted has eroded if not eviscerated the longestablished principle of presumptive enforceability of rights under 198331 justice stevens also objected to the courts merging of section 1983 anal ysis and implied private right of action analysis heretofore the court had treated the two categories separately because congress expressly authorized private suits in 1983 itself consequently justice stevens asserted the sepa rationofpowers concern underlying the approach to implied actions that congress rather than the courts should control the availability of remedies is not rele vant to section 1983 actions32httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31569crs9 33 note that wright and wilder had the same 5to4 alignment of justices except that justice kennedy had replaced justice powell on the disse nting side as indicated above n22 the replacement of two justices as well as jus tice whites unexplained change of positions accounted for the different alignments in wilder and suterimplications for drafting for now it appears that chief justice rehnqui st has carried the day and that the contractual theory of the spendi ng power that he set forth in pennhurst and applied in gonzaga now governs determination of whet her laws enacted under the spending power create private rights that are enforceable through section 1983 actions as justice breyer suggested in his gonzaga concurrence this test is strongly result determinative and the same could be said for the wilder approach the court has seemingly veered from one extreme to the other ie from presumption that section 1983 remedy is available whenev er congress has used rightsconferring language without also including strong ev idence that it intended to foreclose section 1983 action to presumption that enfor ceable rights have been created unless congress has said so in unmistakably clear terms results are usually determined by which test is applied and not by real di fferences among the spending statutes at issue compare for example the holdings in wright and wilder with that in suter statutes requiring reasonable rent allowance for utilities and reasonable and adequate reimbursement of health care providers were held to create enforceable rights while statute requiring reasonable efforts in each case to avoid placing children in foster care was held not to create enforceable rights33 the implications for drafting are clear as long as the presumption against enforceable section 1983 rights governs c ongress will need to spell out any intent it may have to create such rights and given the majoritys language in gonzaga explicit reference to section 1983 would be advisable anything less may be ineffective pennhurst and gonzaga both demonstrate that including the term right or rights in the statute does not necessarily suffice to create rights enforceable under section 1983 moreover theres probl em with statutory context rights not connected to terms and conditions of states spending program may be viewed as freefloating and merely precatory as in pennhurst on the other hand if protecting right is included as requireme nt of state plan that must be approved by federal official in order for the state to qualify for funding and the federal official is given the responsibility for m onitoring state compliance and withholding funds in cases of substantial noncomp liance then the court may employ its contractual theory of conditional grants to rule that additional remedies are inappropriate prospective action may not be all that is required congress ma have to revisit spending statutes if it wants to authorize private actions that at the time of enactment it may have assumed were ava ilable in none of these sp ending cases did the court focus extensively on what the enacting c ongress intended instead the principal focus has been on the actual statutory nguage and structure the court has demonstrated willingness to impose clear statement rules retroactively on statuteshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31569crs10 34 see eg atascadero state hosp v scanlon 473 us 234 1985
