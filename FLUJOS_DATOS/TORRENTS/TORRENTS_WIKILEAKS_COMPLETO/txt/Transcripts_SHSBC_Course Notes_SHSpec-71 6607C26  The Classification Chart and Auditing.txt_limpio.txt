6607c26 shspec71 the classification chart and auditing auditing means to listen and compute and to get result on pc who is person with aberrations and difficulties auditing has to be done in professional standard manner since the beginning of wogdom there has been offbeat activity going on that is reason to perpetuate it the psychiatrist exists for the good of the society and to hell with the patient our situation does not compare with earlier mental therapies we are not even trying for the same result we are clearing people by erasing reactive minds unlike psychotherapies auditing is not social criticism we know the answer to why the pc behaves the way he does we also know why the wog behaves the way he does scientology is road out that increases the persons abilities taking him out of his identification of aaa the road has milestones which we call grades there are also levels on grades there are certain abilities gained but these grades are not composed of single points despite the names given on the gradation chart that is the rough public rendition it is really not possible to enter the upper grades without having attained the lower grades trying to do so results in disasters the whole track falls between grade v which enables the pc to confront whole track and grade vi but it doesnt necessarily appear in either though it may besides the disasters that occur from an out gradient other disasters come from not following standard tech standard tech is contained only in hcobs not in any books if i havent signed it it isnt true some day we will publish then all in consecutive order all corrected the main bugbear of someone studying scientology is that he conceives that every time he reads something new it wipes out the old this concept is based on the fact that he didnt understand the old material that he had read in the first place so he doesnt realize that it can be integrated with the new material that has just been issued something developed later doesnt replace something developed earlier the new does not wipe out the old the old generally correlates well with the new there are very few corrections one significant correction is contained in the newlyfound fact that you can overrun things lot of old processes failed because they worked so fast that the auditor didnt spot the release point when it occurred this accounts for the poor results of r212 when it went wrong it works very fast we didnt know about overrun in those days with dianetics you can have one release per chain so dont try to escape from confronting engrams by going release pcs are entitled to make rapid gains and soar on up the line that doesnt apply to students like great singer student has to suffer to be great he learns what errors can be made by being pc who gets messed up someone who has never been overrun doesnt appreciate why it is undesirable getting bad auditing isnt necessarily disastrous it teaches the student not to give bad auditing i have been audited by dianetic auditors who were trained in an academy that taught only the bubble theory nothing will help an aberrated being short of processing standard tech is very very narrow path and its very easy to stray off of its edges it is bounded on all sides by wrong things to do in auditing one wrong thing is to fail to handle pcs while auditing them you must keep the pc handled in order to audit him one way to suppose that you couldnt handle pcs while auditing them is to think that you cant do anything about something which is above pcs grade you can always run an advanced process on pc as rudiment as something to straighten the case out in hurry for instance even though problems grade 1 you can always run level 1 as rudiment for level 0 in fact if the pc has ptp you had damn well better it is not im sorry we cant talk about your problems because thats grade 1 and you are only working on grade 0 and at the problems level you may run into service facs eg the pcs lumbosis these can give you hard time in making problems release after all the reason why the chart is the way it is is that the gradation chart is made up only at the level of the grades of those things which you cant audit in the face of and that is the genus of the chart the real reason why i found the grades and why there are certain things that if you dont pay attention to them prevent all progress in auditing and in life so therefore they must be the keys to aberration and thats where we got the chart only these factors have appeared as barriers to case gain when not handled these are the super barriers to the track 1 ptps give rise to ta asising inability to concentrate inability to answer auditing commands and perhaps some degree of rising ta 2 missed withholds and overts cause nattery choppy and mean pc 3 arc breaks give the pc sad effect 4 communication problems lead to communication unconsciousness is communication problem the cdei scale can be applied to communication for instance ow must be higher grade than problems because person could confront having problems when he couldnt confront an overt dont think that because someone is grade iv release he will never again have outruds of any sort the product you have is gross product the release can last quite awhile or not it is not gold it is gilt and it can tarnish sometimes it turns green it is the temporariness of this state which is after all state of keyedout clear that boobytrapped the whole research line in the field of the mind there are lowerscale harmonics of everything the thetan can do or be the state of thetan exterior is what the buddhists called bodhi it is not permanent state however even though it is not permanent release should not be underrated it is accompanied by the experience of overcoming that which the person has been released on and that improves his ability to confront also bit of erasure has occurred which desensitizes the whole thing so the releases made nowadays are more stable than the releases that were made in 1950 now we are approaching release on gradient and we know what grade of release we are making always be willing to give the pc win the clear cog is im mocking it up clears follow the rules of life until they themselves have changed their minds about the rules and when they do that of course they are ots oddly enough ot processes are upper harmonics of the same things that prevent auditing only they arent processes if you want to audit you must handle whatever rud is out when its out if the pc at grade iv isnt talking he may be communications release but you will get nowhere until you get him in comm communication is the carrier wave of all processing someone whos release is less likely to have outruds but these things can still occur having the grades doesnt mean that you wont get arc broken with yourself and with the auditor if you want good auditor at grades vi and vii become one there are interim release points on the chart that you are probably neglecting someone could get an fn on communications process without being released on every aspect of communication so he isnt necessarily communications release lot of processes were dropped out of the lineup that shouldnt have been dropped you will have to use tech from another grade in running grade at level 0 you have valence processes as well as the usual comm processes you have some more complicated comm processes at grade 1 all along the line there are lots of processes that someone could be released on r4h r2h recall an arc break date it assess indicate bpc cchs were on grade ii also arc processes plus case remedies at level iii you get auditing by lists and overt justifications there are also physical processes meter dating and cause and effect processes dont ignore grades processes as rudiments pcs dont ever object to auditors unless theyve got overts on them matter how lousy their auditing is pull the withhold pc audited over an arc break protests then screams then fusses then gets tired and then gets sad and sadder neglecting rudiments will ruin case you will have to use them on all pcs at one time or another dont ever fail to notice outruds or fail to put them in when they are out that and going nonstandard is the only thing that could bar person from going clear
