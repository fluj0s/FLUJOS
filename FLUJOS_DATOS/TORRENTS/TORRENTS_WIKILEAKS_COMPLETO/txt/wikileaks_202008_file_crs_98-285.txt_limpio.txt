brokers march 24 1998 bruce foote analyst in housing economics division congressional research service the library of congress abstract this report provides an overview of one of the issues involving the real estate settlement procedures act of 1974 respa which was enacted to prevent abuses in the settlement process for residential real estate current issue is whether certain compensation to mortgage brokers violates the anti kickback provisions of respa the present respa regulation is discussed as well as the unsuccessful attempt to address the issues through negotiated rulemaking summary and analysis of huds subsequent proposed rule is provided several classaction lawsuits have been filed that allege violations of the antikickback and antireferral provisions of respa and bill hr 1283 has been introduced in the house that would place moratorium on certain respa class action suits this report will be updated as regulatory or legislative action occurs the real estate settlement procedures act disclosure of fees to mortgage brokers summary the real estate settlement procedures act of 1974 respa was enacted to effect certain changes in the settlement process for residential real estate these changes were expected to result in 1 more advance disclosure of settlement costs to home buyers and sellers 2 the elimination of kickbacks or referral fees that tended to cause unnecessary increases in the costs of certain settlement services 3 reduction in the amounts that buyers are required to place in escrow accounts for the payment of property taxes and hazard insurance and 4 reform and modernization of local recordkeeping of land title information the department of housing and urban development hud was given the authority to prescribe the rules and regulations necessary to achieve the purposes of respa the hud regulations on respa are referred to as regulation x hud amended regulation x in 1992 and one of the amendments provided that lenders are required to disclose to consumers all indirect fees that are received indirect fees are fees that are paid to the lender that originates loan from the lender that purchases the loan at issue is whether certain indirect compensation violates the antikickback provisions of respa and whether respa should be interpreted to require that the amount and nature of indirect compensation be disclosed to consumers hud issued proposed amendment to regulation x in 1995 negotiated rulemaking process was convened under which affected parties tried to reach consensus on the substance of new rule to be promulgated by hud the negotiated rulemaking committee was unable to reach consensus so the task of providing new rule remains with hud hud published proposed rule on october 16 1997 and the comment period ended on december 16 1997 in the meantime several classaction lawsuits have been filed that allege violations of the antikickback and antireferral provisions of respa broad class action ruling against mortgage bankers could be costly the critical issue in the proposed regulation is the yettobe revealed test that will determine the reasonableness of mortgage broker fees congressional options

section 8 of respa addresses the prohibition against kickbacks and unearned fees section 8a provides that person shall give and person shall accept any fee kickback or thing of value pursuant to any agreement or understanding oral or otherwise that business incident to or part of real estate settlement service involving federally related mortgage loan shall be referred to any person section 8b of respa provides that person shall give and person shall accept any portion split or percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of real estate settlement service in connection with transaction involving federally related mortgage loan other than for services actually performed section 8 c2 permits the payment of fees if such fees are reasonably related to the goods facilities and services provided section 8d provides that violation of section 8 of respa may result in fines of up to 10000 imprisonment for up to one year or both in addition affected consumers may be awarded damages of three times the amount paid for settlement services plus the court costs and reasonable attorneys fees section 17 of respa gives the department of housing and urban development hud the authority to prescribe the rules and regulations necessary to achieve the purposes of respa hud also has the authority to grant reasonable exemptions from respa for classes of transactions if hud finds such exemptions are necessary to achieve the purposes of respa the hud regulation covering respa was issued on june 4 1976 the regulation is referred to as regulation x and is found in the code of federal regulations at 24 cfr part 3500 on november 2 1992 hud published final rule that revised regulation x1 this was the first amendment to the regulation since minor revision in 1977 and 1 57 fr 49600 crs2 the new rule contained several controversial requirements one of those involved the disclosure of fees to mortgage brokers2 when respa was enacted in 1974 the mortgage lending process was fairly straightforward generally the lender managed the loan process from start to finish the lenders employees took the loan application processed the loan and made the underwriting decisions the loan was funded by the lender and closed in the lenders name the loan was held in the lenders portfolio of loans and the loan was serviced receiving and crediting mortgage payments handling the escrow accounts etc by the lender in todays mortgage lending industry new and different kinds of business entities have entered the field and new business relationships have emerged between the entities massive secondary market has evolved under which mortgages are purchased from the original lenders repackaged and sold as mortgagebacked securities new intermediaries such as mortgage brokers find people who want to borrow for home purchases and lenders with money to lend for home purchases the lender that takes the application may not process the loan the lender that closes the loan may not hold or service the loan lenders that originate the mortgages are referred to as retail lenders the lenders that purchase the mortgages are referred to as wholesale lenders thus lenders who act as intermediaries may receive both direct and indirect compensation direct compensation encompasses the fees paid directly by the consumer indirect compensation consists of fees paid to retail lenders by wholesale lenders as compensation for the intermediary services performed as mentioned above since 1992 regulation x has required that lenders disclose to consumers all indirect fees that are received at issue is whether certain indirect compensation may violate the antikickback provisions of respa and whether respa should be interpreted to require that the amount and nature of indirect compensation be disclosed to consumers current regulations the current regulation defines what constitutes secondary market transaction these transactions are exempt from respa including its disclosure requirements its prohibitions against kickbacks and referral fees and its requirement that all compensation be reasonably related to the goods or services provided thus depending upon how the loans are funded at settlement the current regulations lead to somewhat different treatment of compensation to retail lenders under three settlement situations 2 discussion of the other issues is found in crs report 97241 crs3 loan closing and subsequent assignment of the loan the retail lender processes the loan from start to finish funds the loan and closes the loan in its own name at later time the lender sells the loan to wholesale lender currently regulation x does not require that the lender disclose to the consumer the terms of the secondary transaction including the compensation paid by the wholesale lender loan closing in the wholesale lenders name the retail lender originates the loan solely as an intermediary the loan funds are provided by the wholesale lender and the loan is closed in the wholesale lenders name the wholesale lender sets the underwriting criteria and makes the underwriting decision regulation x requires that all payments to the retail lender including direct and indirect fees must be disclosed to the consumer table funding the loan is processed by the retail lender and closed in the name of the retail lender at or about the time of settlement there is simultaneous advance of loan funds to the retail lender by the wholesale lender and an assignment of the loan and servicing rights to the wholesale lender regulation x requires that all payments to the retail lender including direct and indirect fees must be disclosed to the consumer alternative disclosure methods on september 13 1995 hud published proposed rule that presented six alternative approaches to the disclosure of indirect fees under regulation x3 hud asked the public to comment on the six alternatives presented to suggest other approaches and to comment on whether disclosure of indirect fees is useful to consumers and should continue to be required hud also announced the commencement of process to determine whether to establish committee for negotiated rulemaking on the proposed rule alternative 1 the first alternative is the status quo regulation x would continue to require the disclosure of all direct and indirect fees loan sale would continue to be classified as secondary market transaction only if it occurs after settlement alternative 2 regulation x would continue to require the disclosure of all direct and indirect fees at settlement any loan sale before contemporaneous with or after settlement 3 60 fr 47649 crs4 would be classified as secondary market transaction more loan sales would be treated as secondary market transactions and exempt from respa coverage than under alternative 1 tablefunded transaction would be treated as secondary market transaction alternative 3 regulation x would continue to require the disclosure of all direct and indirect fees at settlement only loan sales following the first accrual date the date the first payment is due from the borrower would be classified as secondary market transactions under this alternative more transactions would be subject to respa than under the current regulation tablefunded loans and transactions closed in the name of the wholesale lender with subsequent sale would be subject to respa requirements alternative 4 regulation x would require that only direct fees indirect fees be disclosed at settlement loan sale would be classified as secondary market transaction only if it occurs after settlement since disclosure of indirect fees would be required the classification of transaction as secondary transaction would only be determinative of whether respas requirements and prohibitions other than disclosure apply to the transaction tablefunded loans and loans closed in the name of the wholesale lender would be subject to respa alternative 5 regulation x would require that only direct fees be disclosed at settlement loan sale at any time would be classified as secondary market transaction as with alternative 2 more loan sales would be treated as secondary market transactions and exempt from respa coverage than under alternative 1 alternative 6 regulation x would require that only direct fees be disclosed at settlement loan sale would be classified as secondary market transaction only if it occurs after the first accrual period as with alternative 3 more transactions would be subject to respa than under the current regulation crs5 negotiated rulemaking in recent years negotiated rulemaking has emerged as an alternative to having the regulations drafted unilaterally by the respective federal agency agency representatives and representatives of parties affected by the subject matter of the proposed regulation are brought together to negotiate the terms of the proposed rule ideally the parties will examine their priorities and make tradeoffs to reach consensus on the text of the rule if consensus is achieved the resulting rule may be easier to implement and may be less likely to be the subject of subsequent litigation if consensus is not achieved the process would have made the agency better informed of the issues on october 25 1995 hud published notice of intent to establish negotiated rulemaking advisory committee to negotiate rule regarding mortgage broker fees under respa4 establishment of the negotiated rulemaking advisory committee on mortgage broker disclosures the committee was announced on december 8 19955 the committee met for twoday session once each month from december 1995 to may 19966 on july 16 1996 the hud administrative law judge who presided over the committee issued summary of the committees proceedings and highlighted the committees accomplishments and failures7 the following is based on that summary the committee was to advise hud on two rulemaking issues 1 whether the amount and nature of direct andor indirect payments to mortgage brokers and certain other mortgage originators should be disclosed to consumers and 2 whether respa permits volumebased compensation from wholesale lenders to mortgage brokers and if so whether and how the payment should be disclosed hud also sought views on whether other forms of indirect fees should be permissible under respa and what the effect of requiring disclosure of such payments would be in addition because secondary market transaction is exempt from respa and because hud could redefine that term to expand or contract the reach of respas disclosure requirements and its requirement that all compensation be reasonably related to the value of the goods or services provided the committee was directed 4 60 fr 54793 5 60 fr 63008 6 in addition to representative from hud representatives from the following 17 groups participated in the negotiations americas community bankers american association of residential mortgage regulators american bankers association american financial services association citizen action federal national mortgage association federal home loan mortgage corporation independent bankers association of america legal counsel for the elderlyamerican association of retired persons mortgage bankers association of america national association of federal credit unions national association of mortgage brokers national association of consumer advocates national association of realtors office of the attorney general of the state of texas real estate services providers council inc and the mortgage capital group 7 alan w heifetz negotiated rulemaking on mortgage broker disclosures final report memorandum to nicolas p retsinas assistant secretary for housing july 19 1996 7 p crs6 to consider whether to recommend any change in the definition of the secondary market though the committee met for six twoday sessions it was not possible to achieve consensus on rule for hud to publish because of the diverse positions taken by the members of the committee however the committee made progress on reducing the areas of disagreement and it achieved nearly unanimous agreement on number of issues that should aid hud in developing rule for notice and further comment now hud is left with the task of making decisions on several issues 1 whether to establish respa section 8 safe harbor for indirect fees paid by mortgage lenders to mortgage brokers whether these fees should be disclosed and if so how they should be disclosed 2 where to draw the line between respa covered transactions and secondary market transactions that are exempt from respa and 3 whether to permit wholesale lenders to pay volumebased compensation to retail lenders indirect fees as mentioned above currently regulation x requires the disclosure of all fees paid to retail lenders including the payments received from wholesale lenders indirect fees when the retail lender is being paid as part of the settlement process hud assumed that congress intended for respa to cover only costs related to the initial settlement transactions therefore disclosure of fees is not required when wholesale lenders subsequently purchase the loans with the exception of the national association of consumer advocates naca the committee supported the development of safe harbor approach to mortgage broker disclosure requirements8 throughout the negotiations naca consistently opposed any rule that would provide that indirect fees paid to mortgage brokers would be exempt from scrutiny under respa the nearest to consensus any proposal reached with regard to indirect broker fees was proposal that would establish respa section 8 safe harbor upon three conditions 1 that the broker disclose at the time of application the nature of its relationship to the customer the brokers duties and obligations to the consumer 2 that the broker not provide any other settlement services to the customer and not be affiliated with any other provider of settlement services to the customer and 3 that the broker be able to demonstrate in some manner that it is operating within the confines of competitive marketplace there was agreement however as to the treatment of mortgage brokers who did not meet the qualifications of the safe harbor three approaches were suggested 1 consider the payment of any indirect fee to be per violation9 of respa 2 8 safe harbor may be defined as provisions that give protection from penalty as long as efforts were made to comply with the provisions 9 per violation is term that implies that certain types of business agreements are considered inherently anticompetitive and injurious to the public without any need to continued crs7 presume the payment of any indirect fee to be violation of respa or 3 subject to test of reasonableness any indirect fee under number 2 the presumption of violation would arise once hud demonstrated that an indirect fee had been paid the burden would then shift to the broker to rebut the presumption under number 3 hud would be required to show that an indirect fee had been paid and that it was not reasonably related to the value of the goods or services provided the broker would then have to show that the fee was in fact reasonably related to the value of the goods or services provided10 the committee was also divided as to whether for broker to qualify for the safe harbor the broker should always disclose the fees it was paid or whether it should be able to avoid that disclosure where it is able to demonstrate the presence of competitive market consumer groups generally argue that indirect fees are kickbacks that are illegal under respa the broker is paid by the borrower and the wholesale lender but the borrower does not know about the wholesale lenders part secondary market transactions as mentioned above because secondary market transaction is exempt from respa and because hud could attempt to redefine that term to expand or contract the reach of respas disclosure requirements and its requirement that all compensation be reasonably related to the value of the goods or services provided the committee was directed to consider whether to recommend any change in the definition of secondary market transaction in other words where should the line be drawn in distinguishing primary transaction from secondary transaction consensus was reached on this issue mortgage brokers indicated that they would like the line to be drawn in terms of whose name is on the promissory note they would define secondary market transaction as any sale or transfer of mortgage loan by the original lender other participants haggled over whether the line should remain as it is but with some additional clarification or be pushed back to some fixed point after closing such as 24 hours after funding or 72 hours after closing some members expressed an interest in retaining the current definition the mortgage capital group proposed that hud should focus on the definition of primary transaction under this proposal primary transaction would occur when 1 the lenders name is on the loan 2 the lender uses its own funds to make the loan including warehouse line of credit and 3 the lender remains at risk on the loan until it is sold it would follow then that secondary market transaction would occur when the loan is sold as counterproposal the national association of mortgage brokers namb suggested that only the first and third elements need be 9 continued determine if the agreement has actually injured market competition 10 heifetz memorandum p 4 crs8 included in the definition thus the namb definition would include the sale of tablefunded loan as secondary market transaction the national association of realtors suggested that secondary market transaction be deemed to have occurred whenever there has been transfer of closed loan this definition would also include tablefunded loans as secondary market transactions volumebased compensation volumebased compensation is payment of money or thing of value that retail lender receives from wholesale lender based on the number or dollar volume of loans that the retail lender sells to the wholesale lender in given period of time volumebased compensation also includes volume discounts where 1 retail lender is to provide stated volume of loans to wholesale lender 2 the retail lender is given lower start rate11 than the wholesale lenders advertised rate and 3 the retail lender keeps differential between the start rate and the advertised rate as part of its compensation at settlement hud has never issued policy statement on whether volumebased compensation is permissible under respa suppose lender will give the mortgage broker higher fees if the broker completes x volume of loans for the lender within the next 6 months suppose lender b does not provide bonus for generating loans on its behalf but lender b offers better terms for the borrower than lender if the mortgage broker arranges loan with lender b the borrower will save money if the mortgage broker arranges loan with lender the mortgage broker will be one loan closer to earning the bonus and thereby earning more money than if the borrower were sent to lender b several issues are involved 1 whether volumebased compensation should be permitted under respa 2 whether volumebased compensation should be disclosed and 3 whether the broker has fiduciary responsibility to the borrower and therefore must arrange the best terms for the borrower as with indirect fees three approaches were suggested by the committee 1 consider the payment of any volumebased compensation to be per violation of respa 2 presume the payment of any volumebased fee to be violation of respa or 3 subject to test of reasonableness any volumebased compensation under number 2 the presumption of violation would arise once hud demonstrated that volumebased compensation had been paid the burden would then shift to the broker to rebut the presumption under number 3 hud would be 11 assume that wholesale lenders advertised rate is 8 broker receives volumebased compensation and gets start rate of 775 broker b does not receive such compensation and both broker and broker b deliver 8 loans to the lender part of broker as compensation would be based on the difference between the two rates in essence the lender is permitting broker to deliver loan with lower interest rate than broker b may deliver but the lender is rewarding broker for delivering loan at the 8 rate if broker b is to earn bonus it must deliver loan with an interest rate higher than 8 so start rate may be defined as the interest rate above that the broker may earn bonus crs9 required to show that volumebased compensation had been paid and that it was not reasonably related to the value of the goods or services provided the broker would then have to show that the compensation was in fact reasonably related to the value of the goods or services provided agreement was reached on which approach to take with the exception of naca the committee agreed that volumebased payments should be permissible if safe harbor were established for the payment of indirect fees by lender to broker and the broker fulfilled the conditions that would entitle it to take advantage of the safe harbor generally opponents argue that volumebased compensation may lead to steering the consumers interest in being presented range of loan options may be subverted by the brokers interest in receiving greater compensation from particular wholesale lender additionally it is argued that when retail lenders close loans above some threshold number additional service has been provided under this view the extra compensation is tantamount to an unearned fee and that is prohibited under respa the counter argument is that volumebased compensation may be an appropriate payment for services actually performed just as insurance companies offer better rates to large groups wholesale lenders may offer volumebased compensation to retail lenders who demonstrate the ability to deliver given quantity of highquality loans it is argued that assuming the loans are written under consistent standards it may be less costly for wholesale lender evaluate and process 50 million in loans purchased from one retail lender than the cost of evaluating and processing 50 million in loans produced by several lenders in this view the single lender provides an economy of scale and the cost savings are passed to the retail lender it is also argued that wholesale lenders operate in competitive market to obtain more market share the wholesale lenders may lower their prices to the retail lenders with demonstrated and dependable skills in marketing their product lenders argue that these discounts to top producers should not be defined as kickbacks brokers and mortgage companies argue that the payments are not tied to any specific loan but are based on volume over time in this view disclosure would be meaningless and impractical on an individual loan community groups urge stringent and full disclosure of all fees paid to brokers by both consumers and lenders they view volumebased compensation as reward for steering though the retail lender may decrease costs for the wholesale lender to reward the lender is kickback and it compromises the brokers duty to the borrower consumer groups argue that brokers have fiduciary duty to give allegiance to their principal the borrower naca took the position that brokers are always borrowers agents and that payment of any indirect fee would violate state and common law agency principles mortgage brokers have argued however that it is possible for mortgage broker to offer the loan products of other companies without committing itself to finding the best terms for the borrower prior to taking loan application mortgage company could have the customer sign disclosure form that crs10 stated 1 that the mortgage company was not the representative of the borrower 2 that the mortgage company worked on its own behalf 3 that the company offered the loan products of other lenders and 4 that those products may not represent the best terms in the market yield spread premiums retail lenders who provide abovemarket rate loans may receive another type of compensation from wholesale lenders this compensation which has become the most controversial may have variety of names the most common are yield spread premiums yield spread differentials and overage generally these terms refer to any compensation paid to or retained by retail lender based upon the difference in the interest rate on the loan and some other benchmark interest rate it compensates the retail lender for loan priced at rate higher than that at which the wholesale lender would have required otherwise again the concerns regarding this form of compensation are whether it violates respa and constitutes kickbacks or feesplitting for delivery of the loans in shopping for mortgage loan borrower may compare the price the range of interest rates and points of offerings by several lenders alternatively borrower may obtain the services of mortgage broker to find the best deal the presumption is that the mortgage broker has relationships with multitude of lenders and will choose the one offering the best price to the borrower several class action lawsuits suggest however that the some brokers do not always obtain the best prices for the borrowers12 in culpepper et v inland mortgage the complainants argued that the lender violated section 8 of respa by paying yield spread premium to mortgage broker the northern district court of alabama ruled that the lender did not violate respa that decision was reversed on january 91998 by the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit the higher court held that the yield spread premium was for referral and did not qualify for the exemption for the purchase of good because in tablefunded transaction the lender not the broker owns the loan from the outset the appellate court also said that the yield spread premium did not qualify as payment for services the court ruled that under the particular facts here the yield spread premium was prohibited referral fee under respa in edwin and sandra mentecki and floyd and elaine meyers v saxon mortgage and crestar mortgage the complainants charge that instead of finding the best terms the broker sent them to crestar in exchange for yield spread premium judge in the us district court in alexandria has denied motion to dismiss the class action but has entered stay pending an appeal to the 4th district court of appeals other suits suggest that the brokers produced loans with interest rates andor points that were higher than those required by the lenders and the brokers earned extra fees because of the higher prices the suits argue that borrowers who obtain 12 groundbreaking respa case favors mortgage banking industry press release by briggs and morgan pa crs11 loans arranged by mortgage brokers should not have to negotiate the loan terms it is argued that brokers have fiduciary duty to find the best terms for the borrower in addition plaintiffs contend that failure to disclose any extra points amounts to fraud some of the suits have been settled out of court with the lenders agreeing to pay borrowers but with admission of wrongdoing on the part of the lenders other suits however are still active the cost of noncompliance with respa may be high penalties can range up to 1000 per incident with maximum of 500000 or 1 of servicers net worth in class action cases13 the mortgage bankers association estimates that 56 of home loans in 1996 were made by mortgage brokers the implication is that prolonged dampening of this part of the mortgage market would be detrimental to potential homebuyers at national mortgage servicing conference sponsored by the mortgage bankers association of america it was reported that in an effort to limit their exposure to lawsuits some lenders are only buying loans from mortgage brokers that have warehouse lines of credit14 some brokers have responded by seeking warehouse lines of credit if mortgage brokers obtain warehouse lines of credit and close the loans in their own names the subsequent sale of the loans may be regarded as secondary market transactions that are exempt from the disclosure provisions of respa lenders and brokers were urged to ensure that the warehouse lines of credit are legitimate the proposed regulation the proposed rule released by hud on october 16 1997 would amend regulation x part 3500 of title 24 of the code of federal regulations in three places and it would add an appendix f the first two amendments would revise the definition of mortgage broker to include person who is the exclusive agent of lender the third amendment would provide safe harbor under which payments to mortgage broker are presumed to be legal if specific requirements are met one of the requirements would be that the mortgage broker and the prospective borrower complete and execute mortgage broker contract in the form specified by the new appendix f currently regulation x defines mortgage broker to specifically exclude person who is an exclusive agent of lender the regulation also provides that mortgage broker that is the exclusive agent of lender does not have to provide loan applicant with good faith estimate of closing costs the proposed rule would 13 ted cornwell servicers need to watch out for harbingers of respa litigation national mortgage news february 17 1997 p 10 14 ted cornwell warehouse lines protect lenders national mortgage news february 25 1997 p 25 crs12 include such persons in the definition of mortgage broker and require that they provide loan applicants with good faith estimates of closing costs the safe harbor under the safe harbor in the proposed rule the payment to mortgage broker whether from borrower or from lender would be presumed to be legal under section 8 of respa providing that the following four requirements were met 1 prior to loan application or receipt of any payment the mortgage broker and prospective applicant execute mortgage broker contract in the form of appendix f 2 the mortgage broker performs in accordance with the mortgage broker contract and make representations that are inconsistent with the contract mortgage broker who indicates on the mortgage broker contract that i am your agent and i will get you the most favorable mortgage loan that meets your stated objectives would be required to get the borrower the most favorable mortgage loan that meets the borrowers stated objectives from among the sources of funds with which the mortgage broker discloses it will shop 3 in accordance with instructions for the hud1 settlement statement and instructions for the mortgage broker contract the mortgage broker discloses its maximum total compensation along with the amounts of fees from the borrower and the lender 4 the mortgage broker has valid license or registration if the mortgaged property is located in state that licenses or registers mortgage brokers the proposed rule provides that the terms of the mortgage broker contract may only be changed by written mutual agreement between the mortgage broker and the borrower for transactions in which mortgage broker contracts are entered into and adhered to and under which the other requirements of the rule are satisfied all compensation to mortgage broker would be regarded as having been paid within safe harbor and such fees would be presumed to be legal under respa if one or more of the requirements were not met then the compensation would not be presumed permissible or legal even if all the requirements for the safe harbor were met however the presumption of legality may be rebutted if the total compensation received by mortgage broker did not pass test to be established by hud and incorporated into the final rule so the proposal has two key components 1 the mortgage broker contract and 2 the test that would determine the reasonableness of the fees to be paid to the mortgage broker crs13 the mortgage broker contract instead of simple disclosure hud is proposing binding mortgage broker contract hud argues that binding contract creates an enforceable remedy for the borrower and ensures that the terms indicated cannot be changed or superceded unilaterally by the mortgage broker15 onepage honest lending contract is proposed the contract is written in plain english and it is to be signed by mortgage broker before borrower applies for the loan mortgage brokers would check one of three boxes on the disclosure form describing their representation 1 i represent you i am your agent and i will get you the most favorable mortgage loan that meets your stated objectives i will shop for your loan from among number lenders for my services i will charge you fee but i will not receive any fee for your mortgage loan from lender 2 i represent you but i may receive fee from lender i am your agent and i will get you the most favorable mortgage loan that meets your stated objectives i will shop for your loan from among number lenders for my services i may charge you fee and i may also receive an additional fee for your mortgage from lender 3 i do not represent you i am not your agent i arrange loans from lenders and get paid by lenders and borrowers i make mortgage loans available from one lender name of lender or among number lenders if mortgage broker checks the first or second box then that broker is representing the borrower and the mortgage broker becomes obligated to find the most favorable mortgage loan that meets the borrowers stated objectives other entries on the form would require listing of the maximum compensation that the mortgage broker would collect from both borrower and lender one line states my total compensation will be made up of fees you pay and fees lender pays the back of the contract would inform consumers of their rights in the mortgage process the fees earned by mortgage brokers who use the contract would be presumed to be legal under section 8 of respa unless their fees do not pass test to be determined by hud when the rule becomes final the fees earned by mortgage brokers who do not use the contract would be presumed to be in violation of section 8 of respa this presumption may be rebutted if such fees are reasonably related to the value of goods and services provided 15 62 fr 53922 crs14 the test hud asked for public comment on all aspects of the proposal and asked for suggestions on what test or tests may be used to determine if certain fees are permissible under respa the comment period ended on december 16 1997 hud requested that the public suggest quantifiable or otherwise objective test or tests for examining mortgage brokers total compensation because any test established for the final rule must allow mortgage brokers lenders and borrowers to determine with certainty whether the total compensation to mortgage broker is legal16 suggestions could include defining the outer boundaries of permissible or legal total payments in terms of ranges or amounts such as specified dollar amount that could vary based on the size of the loan or as fixed percentage of the loan amount if compensation exceeded specified range or amount the excess could rebut the presumption of legality under section 8 of respa the test could be based on comparing the total compensation received by mortgage broker to the total compensation received for similar loans to borrowers of similar credit quality this could be accomplished by establishing baseline of the average market compensation for comparable loans for an immediately preceding time period any compensation for loan that exceeded the baseline average by more than specific amount could be used to rebut the presumption of legality test could set criteria to establish the parameters of permissible compensation for example test could provide that yield spread premium is impermissible unless it is considered owned by under the control of and for the benefit of the borrower the test could provide that yield spread premium is impermissible based upon other fixed criteria any compensation that did not meet the established criteria would rebut the presumption of legality as mentioned above any compensation to mortgage broker is presumed to violate respa if the mortgage broker does not enter into the mortgage broker contract this presumption may be overcome if the compensation is reasonably related to the value of the goods or services provided hud asked for suggestions on any other formulations that would clearly delineate between compensation that may be presumed legal and compensation that would violate respa analysis of the proposal though the proposal characterizes use of the mortgage broker contract as voluntary use of the contract would appear to be virtually mandatory brokers who did not use the contracts would have to justify their fees in order to prove that the fees did not violate section 8 of respa it is unlikely that informed consumers would want to place loans with mortgage brokers who refused to sign the mortgage broker contracts in addition such brokers could face the prospect of consumer 16 62 fr 53923 crs15 lawsuits and would be in weakened position to rebut claim of misrepresentation therefore it is likely that most brokers would find that it would be in their best interests to use the contracts would consumer be willing to take loan from mortgage broker that checked the third box i do not represent you one of the main reasons for the proposed rule is to provide consumers with some clarity regarding representation in general many consumers think that the mortgage brokers represent them while the brokers feel that they only represent themselves it might even be argued that many consumers want mortgage brokers to represent them if given mortgage broker is unwilling to represent the borrower would the borrower accept that contract or would the borrower seek broker who would agree to representation would competition for borrowers force mortgage brokers to accept unwanted fiduciary relationships effectively would mortgage brokers find that checking the third box would not be an option mortgage brokers argue that competition would force them to check one of the first two boxes it should be noted however that similar situation exists in the real estate brokerage business in the past home buyers thought that the realtors were working for them but the reality was that the agents were legally obligated to the sellers most states now require realtors to disclose their representation and give home buyers the option of choosing buyers brokers who are legally obligated to the home buyers initially the industry was opposed to this approach but now many realtors market themselves as buyers brokers still large number of buyers use the traditional relationship when working with realtors conceivably borrowers might do the same with mortgage brokers currently part 350014g2 of regulation x permits hud to investigate high prices to see if they are the result of referral fee or the split of fee the rule notes that high prices standing alone are not proof of respa violation if the payment bears reasonable relationship to the market value of the goods or services provided then the excess may be used as evidence of violation of section 8 of respa17 therefore it could be argued that since regulation x already contains provision authorizing the investigation of high fees it would be unnecessary to establish safe harbor test that establishes the boundaries of permissible payments similarly it would be unnecessary to establish test that compares particular brokers compensation to that received on loans involving borrowers of similar credit quality the lending community however assumes that hud would establish such tests and accuses the department of proposing price setting or price control these are essentially straw man arguments since the proposed rule does not advocate any particular test the preamble to the proposed rule notes that certain tests would be 17 under the proposed rule this part would not be amended except that it would be designated as 350014g3 crs16 unworkable and inconsistent with respas legislative history against price setting18 at what point must prospective borrowers be provided with the mortgage broker contracts lenders rate borrowers according to their history of handling credit and their employment history borrowers rated at are offered better terms than borrowers rated at b or c if the contract is signed before the borrowers history has been investigated the stated fees may become meaningless given the borrowers particular credit and employment history the contract would have to be nullified if the contract was based upon the assumption that the borrower would have an rating and it was found was that the borrower had c rating if the lender wanted to qualify for the safe harbor new contract would be required that showed the higher fees that the loan demanded given the borrowers credit and employment history in such situations would lenders risk being accused of employing bait and switch tactics the lending community was hoping the proposed hud rule would state that lenderpaid mortgage broker fees are legitimate compensation under respa while consumer groups were hoping the rule would state that such fees are illegal under respa statement in either direction may have obviated the need for further class action suits regarding the issue and it may have contributed to the settlement of several of the existing cases instead the proposed rule restates huds position that the determining factor is whether the total compensation to broker is reasonably related to the value of the goods furnished or the services provided so the proposed rule does not address the questions regarding the legality of lenderpaid fees to mortgage brokers reaction to the proposed rule many lenders in their letters to hud regarding the proposed rule urged that hud refrain from amending regulation x at this time they suggest that hud wait for congress to enact legislation that overhauls respa and the truth in lending act overwhelmingly mortgage brokers are opposed to the proposed rule they argue that since they provide more than 50 percent of the mortgages written in given year they must be doing something right joint task force of the mortgage bankers association mba and the national association of mortgage brokers namb have developed model disclosure agreement they recommend that hud adopt their form in lieu of the proposed mortgage broker contract under the mbanamb proposal an applicant would agree to enter into mortgage loan origination agreement with the broker acting as an independent contractor to apply for residential mortgage loan from participating lender with which the broker from time to time contracts upon such terms and conditions as the applicant requests or lender may require sections 1 and 2 of the mbanambrecommended form is as follows 18 62 fr 53919 crs17 section 1 nature of relationship in connection with this mortgage loan c we are acting as an independent contractor and not as your agent c we will enter into separate independent contractor agreements with various lenders c while we seek to assist you in meeting your financial needs we do not distribute the products of all lenders or investors in the market and cannot guarantee the lowest price or best terms available in the market section 2 our compensation the lenders whose loan products we distribute generally provide their loan products to us at wholesale rate c the retail price we offer you your interest rate total points and fees will include our compensation c in some cases we may be paid all of our compensation by either you or the lender c alternatively we may be paid portion of our compensation by both you and the lender for example in some cases if you would rather pay lower interest rate you may pay higher upfront points and fees c also in some cases if you would rather pay less upfront you may be able to pay some or all of our compensation indirectly through higher interest rate in which case we will be paid directly by the lender we also may be paid by the lender based on i the value of the mortgage loan or related servicing rights in the market place or ii other services goods or facilities performed or provided by us to the lender the mba and namb suggest that hud adopt their onepage form as the standard form disclosing representation and compensation some consumer groups are opposed to the proposed rule but for different reasons than the mortgage brokers such consumer groups consider certain lender payments to mortgage brokers as violations of respa prohibitions against kickbacks regardless of whether such payments are disclosed accordingly the groups view the proposed rule as sanctioning illegal kickbacks hud argues however that disclosure of fees does not make such fees legal an economic analysis of the issues mortgage lenders might argue that they operate in competitive market and that the market works best when government intervention is limited one of the tenets of competitive market however is that consumers have adequate information on the availability of goods and services and the prices of such goods and services to make rational decisions on purchases finding this information is relatively easy for products that are purchased often such as bread eggs and gasoline there is little cost in trying different brands until one is found that satisfies crs18 the objectives of the purchaser the penalty for wrong purchase is relatively small other products such as televisions refrigerators automobiles are not purchased very often and the information problem is more difficult it may not be practical or permissible to try out different brands to find the one that meets the consumers needs another class of goods and services are not purchased very often but pose greater informational problems because even when information is available it may be difficult to understand interpret and evaluate19 the purchase of money to buy improve or refinance home falls into this category obtaining loan to finance home may be regarded as purchasing money information is regarded by economists as public good20 market by itself will not produce an optimal amount of information when markets do not provide the quality of information that consumers need then purchases may be made based on ignorance and misinformation the market outcome of these transactions may not be ones that are regarded as in the best interests of the society at large in the case of mortgage brokers the information is asymmetric the brokers have more complete information than the borrowers the brokers may be able to take advantage of this difference in information by charging the borrowers more than would be charged if the borrowers had complete information the purpose of respa is to ensure that the consumer is provided with information to make an informed choice in transaction that for many will be the only such transaction in their lifetime thus it often falls to government to improve the circumstances under which information is provided in order to help markets function more efficiently in addition every purchase or sales agreement is contract with both explicit and implicit terms often courts have to determine the implied terms of the contract when after the fact the buyer and seller disagree over them court determination of these terms however can impart uncertainty to the market buyer and sellers may find that they legally agreed to terms they were unaware of at the time of sale one remedy is through regulations that clarify the implied terms or that require the terms be specified the provisions of regulation x are designed to address both of the issues described above the provision of sufficient information and the fuller specification of implied terms by requiring the mortgage broker contract hud hopes to remove any ambiguity about the role of the mortgage broker the consumer would know in advance something that the consumer had previously assumed whether the broker is the agent of the consumer the proposed rule is also designed to widen the scope within which consumers receive information the proposed test is intended to provide clear indication of whether respa has been violated the difficulty with regulations however is that they tend to be inflexible and thereby reduce the ability of the market to respond to the needs of individual 19 davis otto davis and martin i kamien externalities information and alternative collective action in haverman robert h and julius margolis eds public expenditure and policy analysis chicago rand mcnally college publishing 1976 p 82 20 public goods may be defined as goods such as television signals whose use by one consumer does not diminish their availability to others crs19 situations while volumebased compensation clearly creates incentives for brokers to steer customers it may be advantageous to costumers if part of the discount is passed to the customers in that case the implicit fee to the broker would not be sign that the customer got less than the best deal basically there are two components to the price of mortgage loans one component is the interest rate charged on the loan and the other component is the points paid point is 1 of the mortgage amount the charging of points enables lender to fine tune the yield on the loan and obtain up front funds for the cost and risk of issuing the loan suppose the market rate of mortgage interest were 8 if borrower obtains 100000 loan at 8 and pays 2 points to the lender the actual yield to the lender would be higher than 8 it would be about 821 this is because in effect the borrower only received 98000 but is making payments as if 100000 were received if the borrower wanted 75 loan and were willing to pay 6 points the yield to the lender would be about 814 if the borrower were short of funds and were willing and able to pay higher interest rate the lender might be willing to pay 4000 of the borrowers closing costs make loan with an interest rate of 85 and obtain yield of about 80821 the problem with yield spread premiums is that to use the example above the borrower may be getting an 85 loan when the market rate is 8 and the 4000 that could be going to the borrower may instead be used to compensate the mortgage broker this is why the most critical part of the proposed rule is the test and that is the very part that is not yet known if the test is numerical range of permissible compensation it may indeed act as brokers claim as something very much like price ceiling the implications of test may be very different however if it identifies impermissible ways the broker may be compensated legislative options hud is examining the comments received regarding the proposed rule and is expected to issue final rule on the subject options for congress include 1 maintaining oversight of the current regulatory process 2 enacting legislation that amends respa and clarifies the issues or 3 enacting moratorium that for specified time period prohibits the courts from certifying any more class action suits involving mortgage broker fees at 1997 conference of the new york association of mortgage brokers representative lazio chairman of the subcommittee on housing and community opportunity of the house banking committee told attendees not to expect much help from congress on respa22 attendees were urged to do more for borrowers and to move the discussion away from the brokers own compensation 21 the actual yield to the lender will be lower to the extent that portion of the points paid by the consumer are used to compensate the loan originators 22 congress wont rescue brokers origination news march 1997 pp 1 28 crs20 some in the mortgage industry have been urging congress to enact moratorium that for specified time period would prohibit the courts from certifying any more class action suits involving mortgage broker fees in response the real estate settlement procedures act class action relief act of 1997 hr 1283 has been introduced in the house the bill would amend respa to place moratorium on any state or federal lawsuit that arises out of the allegation that respa has been violated through payment by lender to another lender or to mortgage broker from the date of enactment of the bill through december 31 1998 1 party would be required to serve or respond to any discovery concerning any class certification issue 2 state or federal court would be permitted to enter an order certifying any class except an order that would terminate the class action by mutual agreement of the parties and state or federal court would be able to impose sanctions on any party for failure to comply with any discovery and 3 state and federal courts would be required to stay further proceedings in any action in which the order certifying the class was entered into on or after january 1 1996 except for proceedings that would terminate the class action by mutual agreement of the parties to date action has been taken on the bill as mentioned above many lenders in their letters to hud regarding the proposed rule urged that hud refrain from amending regulation x at this time they suggest that hud wait for congress to enact legislation that overhauls respa and the truth in lending act respa was enacted to address abuses in the mortgage market as it existed in the 1970s todays mortgage lending industry has new and different kinds of business entities and new business relationships between them these entities and these relationships were not foreseen in 1974 thus hud and the courts have the difficult task of trying to interpret respa for relationships and actions that did not exist and were not foreseen when the legislation was enacted supposedly in spring 1998 hud will be submitting to congress proposals for amending respa in the meantime more than 20 industry agency and consumer groups have formed the mortgage reform working group to develop proposals to overhaul respa crs21 references collins brian
