investment relations key issues coordinated by raymond ahearn what is the eu the eu is treatybased institutional framework that defines and manages economic and political coopera tion among its 27 member st ates austria belgium bulgaria cyprus the czech republic denm ark estonia finland france germany greece hungary ireland italy latvia lit huania luxembourg ma lta the netherlands poland portugal romania slovakia slovenia spain sweden and the united kingdom the union is the latest stage in process of european integration begun after world war ii to promote peace and economic pr osperity in europe its founders hoped that by creating communities of shared sovereignty initially in areas of coal and steel production trade and nuclear energy anot her war in europe would be unthinkable since the 1950s this european integration project has expanded to encompass other economic sectors customs union single market in which goods people and capital move freely common agricultural policy and common currency the euro over the last decade eu member states have taken significant steps toward political integration as well with decisions to develop common foreign policy and closer police and judicial cooperation how does the eu work the eu represents unique form of coope ration among sovereign states it has been built through series of binding treaties eu members work together through common institutions see next question the eu is divided into three pillars subjects and decisionmaking processes differ in each pillar one is the european community which encompasses economic trade and social policies ranging from agriculture to educationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21372crs2 in pillar one areas by far the most devel oped and farreaching members have largely pooled their national sovereignty and work toge ther in eu institutions to set policy and promote their collective interests decisions in pillar one often have supranational character because most are made by ma jority voting system pillar two aims to establish common foreign and security policy cfsp to permit joint action in foreign and security affairs pillar three seeks to create justice and home affairs jha policy to foster common internal security measures and closer police and judicial coordination under pillars two and three members have agreed to coope rate but decisionmaking is intergovernmental and by consensus thus members retain more discretion and the right to veto certain measures how is the eu governed the eu is governed by several instituti ons they do not correspond exactly to the traditional division of power in democratic governments rather they embody the eus dual supranational and inte rgovernmental character the european commission is essentially the eus executive and has the sole right of legislative initiative it upholds the interests of the union as whole and ensures that the provisions of the eu treaties are carried out properly the 27 commissioners are ppointed by the member states for fiveyear terms each commissioner holds distinct portfolio eg agriculture the commission represents the eu internationally and negotiates with third c ountries primarily in areas falling under pillar one however the commission is primarily an administrative entity that serves the council of ministers the council of the european union council of ministers is comprised of ministers from the national governments as the main decision making body the council enacts legislation based on proposals put forward by the commission different ministers participate depending on the subject under consideration eg economics ministers could convene to discuss unemployment polic most decisions are made by majority vote but some areas such as cfsp and taxation require unanimity the presidency of the council rotates among the member states for period of six months the european council brings together the heads of state or government of the member states and the commission president at least twice year it acts principally as strategic guide and driving force for eu policy the european parliament consists of 785 members since 1979 they have been directly elected in each member state for fiveyear terms under system of proportional repres entation based on population the parliament cannot initiate legislation like na tional parliame nts but it shares codecision power with the council of ministers in number of areas and can amend or reject the eus budgethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21372crs3 the court of justice interprets eu law and its rulings are binding court of auditors monitors the eus financ ial management number of advisory bodies represent economic social and regional interests why and how is the eu enlarging the eu sees enlargement as crucial to promoting stability and prosperity in europe and furthering the peaceful integration of the continent the eu began as the european coal and steel community in 1952 with six members belgium france germany italy luxembourg and the netherlands denmar k ireland and the uk joined in 1973 greece in 1981 spain and portugal in 1986 and austria finland and sweden in 1995 with the end of the cold war the eu saw an hist oric opportunity to extend the political and economic benefits of membership to central and easte rn europe on may 1 2004 the eu welcomed 10 states cyprus the czech repub lic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia as new members bulgaria and romania completed accession talks in december 2004 and acceded to the union on january 1 2007 accession negotiations establish the rms under which applicants will meet and enforce eu rules and regulations turkey wa s recognized as an eu candidate in 1999 but remained in separate category for several years as it sought to comply with the eus political and economic criteria for member ship in october 2005 the eu opened accession talks with turkey but these are expect ed to take at least decade to complete and have already encountered some diffi culties the eu has cautioned that the negotiations with turkey are an openende d process the outcome of which cannot be guaranteed the eu also began accession talks with croatia in october 2005 macedonia was named as an eu candidate in december 2005 but date has yet been set for the start of its membership talks what was the eu constitution and why new reform treaty in june 2004 the eu concluded work on constitutional treaty that contained changes to the eus governing institutions and decisionmaking processes commonly referred to as the constitution this new treaty grew out of previous eu efforts to institute internal reforms to enable an enlarged eu to function more effectively the constitution also sought to boost the eus visi bility on the world stage in order to come into effect the constitution had to be ratified by all member states through either parliamentary appr oval or public referendum the cons titutions future was thrown into doubt following its rejection by french and dutch voters in separa referendums in the spring of 2005 reasons for its rejection va ried ranging from public unease with further eu enlargement to fears that it could lead to the creation of european superstate in december 2007 eu leaders approved new reform treaty the lisbon treaty to essentially replace the proposed constitu tion although the term constitution was dropped experts say that the lisbon treaty pr eserves over 90 of the substance of the original constitution major innovations include appointing single individual to serve as president of the european council cr eating new chief eu diplomat position and simplifying eu voting procedures eu officials presented the lisbon treaty as document that could be ratifie d by parliaments thereby voiding risky public referendums in most eu states except ireland which wa s required by law to hold public vote in june 2008 irish voters rejected the lisbon tr eaty irish opponents argued that it wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21372crs4 reduce irelands influence in the eu undermine irelands neutrality and eliminate its ability to set its own tax rates eu leaders have called on the ratification process to continue in other eu states and have given irish offici als until october 2008 to propose way forward eu officials hope that the lisbon treaty will still be able to enter into force before the next european parlia ment elections in the spring of 2009 does the eu have foreign policy the eu is seeking to build common foreign and security policy cfsp past attempts to further eu political integra tion foundered on national sovereignty concerns and different foreign policy pr erogatives but in 1993 eu members concluded that the union must increase its weight in world ffairs to match its growing economic clout cfsp decisionmaking is dominated by member states they develop common policies in areas in which they can reach consensus and ensure that national policies are in line with agreed eu strategies and positions g imposing sanctions on serbia in 1997 eu leaders proposed creating high representa tive for cfsp in 1999 they appointed javier solana natos former secretar general to the position wh ich is often referred to as mr cfsp many analysts credit solana with boosting the eus visibility on the world stage and with forging eu consensus on issues such as the balkans and the middle east peace process skeptics argue however that the eu is still far from speaking with one voice on other key foreign policy challenges the european commission also plays role internationally but should not be confused with cfsp or its high representative benita ferrerowaldner the external relations commissioner coordina tes the commissions diplomatic activities nd manages its aid to nonmember states the lisbon treaty if approved would combine the ferrerowaldner and solana posts into single position does the eu have defense policy the eu is also attempting to forge european security and defense policy esdp to give cfsp military backbone momentum for this project picked up speed in 1998 when former uk prime minister tony blai r reversed britains traditional opposition to european defense identity outside nato it intensified after natos 1999 kosovo air campaign exposed serious european military deficiencies in december 1999 the eu decided to establish an institutional deci sionmaking framework for esdp and 60000 strong rapid reaction force by 2003 able to ploy within 60 days for at least year to undertake the petersberg tasks human itarian assistance search and rescue peacekeeping and peace enforcement in june 2004 the eu agreed to enhance esdp through the creation of seve ral battlegroups of 1500 troops each that will be able to reach trouble spots especially in africa within 15 days eu forces will not form standing eu army troops and assets at ppropriate readiness leve ls will be drawn from existing national forces in the event of an eu operation the eu has created three defense decisionmaking bodies but impr oving military capabilities has been difficult especially given flat or declining european defense budgets serious capability gaps exist in strategic airlift command and control systems intelligence and other force multipliers what is the relationship between nato and the eu the eu asserts that esdp is intended to allow the eu to make decisions and conduct military operations where nato as whole is not engaged esdp is not aimedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21372crs5 at usurping natos collective defense role most eu nato members led by the uk insist that eu efforts to fo rge defense arm be tied to nato as do us policymakers advocates argue that building more robus t european military capabilities for esdp will also benefit the alliance the natoeu relationship was formalized in december 2002 which paved the way for the implementa tion in march 2003 of berlin plus an arrangement permitting the eu assure d access to nato operational planning capabilities and presumed access to nato comm on assets berlin plus was designed to help ensure close natoeu links and pr event wasteful duplication of resources since then the eu has launched several crisis management missions in the balkans africa and elsewhere with varying degr ees of nato support nevertheless natoeu relations remain somewhat strained this is due in part to the differences in membership in both organizations and disputes between turkey nato member and the eu us officials have also been wary that some eu member states traditionally led by france would like to build more independent eu fense arm new french president nicolas sarkozy however has taken more pragmatic approach he backs strong esdp but has downplayed it as an alternative to nato and supports closer natoeu cooperation does the eu have trade policy yes eu member states have common external trade policy in which the european commission negotiates trade deals with other c ountries and trading bl ocs on behalf of the union as whole the eus trade policy is one of its most wellde veloped and integrated policies it evolved along with the common market which provides for the free movement of goods within the eu to prev ent one member state from importing foreign goods at cheaper prices due to lower tariffs and then ree xporting the items to another member with higher tariffs the scope of the common trade policy has been extended to include negotiations on services and intellectual property in some cases the council of ministers has the power to establish objectiv for trade negotiations and can approve or reject agreements r eached by the commission eu rules allow the council to make trade decisions with weighted voting system but in practice the council tends to employ consensus the commission and the council work together to set the common customs tariff guide export policy and decide on tr ade protection or retaliation measures where necessary the eu also plays leading role in the world trade organization wto how are useu trade relations doing the united states and the eu share the largest trade and investment relationship in the world the value of twoway flows of goods services and income receipts from investment totaled 13 trillion in 2006 us and european companies are also the biggest investors in each others markets total stock of twoway direct investment reached 22 trillion in 2006 most of this ec onomic relationship is harmonious but trade tensions persist one key dispute relates to government subsidies that the united states and eu allegedly provide to their respective civil aircraft manufacturers boeing and airbus in 2005 useu talks to diffuse c onfrontation over this issue failed and both sides have revived their comp laints in the world trade organization wto useu conflicts over hormonetreated beef and bioengineered food products also remain many analysts note that resolving useu trade disputes has become increasingly difficult perhaps partly because both sides are of roug hly equal economic stre ngth and neither hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21372crs6 the ability to impose concessions on the other another factor may be that many disputes involve clashes in different domestic values political prior ities and regulatory systems does the united states have for mal relationship with the eu yes for decades the united states and the eu and its progenitors have maintained diplomatic and economic ties washington s strongly supported european integration and useu trade and investment relations are extensive the 1990 useu transatlantic declaration set out principles for greater consultation and established regular summit and ministerial meetings in 1995 the new transatlantic agenda nta and the euus joint action plan provided framework for promoting stability and democracy together responding to global chan ges and expanding world trade the nta also sought to strengthen individual ties across the atlantic nd launched number of dialogues including ones for bus iness leaders and legislators who are us officials counterparts in the eu at least once year the us president meets with the president of the european commission and the eus rotating presidency represented by the head of government whose country holds it at the time of the mee ting for example at the last useu summit in june 2008 president bush met with commission president josé manuel barroso and prime minister janez jansa of slovenia the presidency country during the first half of 2008 the us secretary of st ates most frequent inte rlocutors are the high representative for cfsp the external relations commissioner and the foreign minister of the eu presidency country the us tr ade representatives key interlocutor is the european commissioner for trade who directs the eus common external trade policy other us cabinetlevel offi cials interact with commission counterparts or member state ministers in council formation as issues ar ise numerous workinglevel relationships between us and eu officials also exist delegation in washington dc represents the european commission in its dealings with the us government while the us mission to the european union represents washingtons interests in brussels how do european countries view the eu all eu member states believe that the union magnifies their political and economic clout ie the sum is greater than the parts nevertheless the eu has always been divided between those members that seek an ever closer union through greater integration and those that prefer to keep th union on an intergovernmental footing for example the uk has more frequently sought to guard its national sovereignty and along with denmark and sweden doe s not participate in the single european currency the euro another classic divide in the eu falls along big versus small state lines small states are often cautious of initiatives that they fear could allow eu heavyweights to dominate the union another key difference rela tes to security postures austria finland ireland and sweden practice nonaligned fore ign and defense polic ies which sometimes complicates the formulation of common europ ean positions in these areas in addition the recent rounds of eu enlargement to the east have brought in many new members with histories of soviet dominati on which often color their views on issues ranging from eu reform to relations with russia at times such differences have caused frictions with older eu member states and have slowed eu decision making
