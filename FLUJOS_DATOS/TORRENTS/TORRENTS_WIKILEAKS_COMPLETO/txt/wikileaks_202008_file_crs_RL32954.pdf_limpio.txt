american law divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32954527 political organizations legislation in the 109th congress summary the 109th congress examined the role of groups organized under section 527 of the internal revenue code irc that are involved in federal elections but are not operating under the requirements and restrictions of federa l election law although such groups only recently emerged into pub lic awareness in 2004 they were widely seen as major players in the presidential election with some 435 million spent seeking to influence the outcome strictly speaking the term 527 refers to section of the internal revenue code which was added in 1975 to provide taxexempt status to federal state and local political organizations as defined in that statute although most 527s operating today are also political committees operating under fe deral and state election law certain groups with 527 status are arguably not being so regulated because their public communications do not contain express advocacy language which had generally been held to be the standard for election law regulation the controversy over these 527 groups arises fro m two factors the different definitions used in federal election law and tax law as to what constitutes electionrelated activity and further the lack of certainty as to what election law itself regulates or may permissibly regulate ten

6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32954527 political organizations legislation in the 109th congress the 109th congress examined the role of groups organized under section 527 of the internal revenue code irc that ar involved in federal elections but are not operating under the requirements and restrictions of federa l election law while such groups only recently emerged into public aw areness by 2004 they were widely seen as major players in the presidential ection with some 435 million spent seeking to influence the outcome strictly speaking the term 527 refers to section of the internal revenue code which was added in 1975 to provide taxexempt status to federal state and local political organizations as defined in that statute until the 1990s it was generally thought that such status corre lated directly with those groups labeled political committees operating under federal and state election law indeed political committees whether political parties political action committees pacs or candidate committees have or are eligible for 527 status under the irc what has made 527 groups the subject of controvers arises from two factors the different definitions used in federal election law and tax law as to what constitutes election related activity and further the lack of uniform opinion as to what election law itself regulates or may permissibly regulate in 2000 it came to light that some groups engaged in federal electionrelated issue advocacy were operating under sec tion 527 of the irc while not being regulated under the federal ection campaign act feca ostensibly because their communications with the public did not c ontain language expressly advocating the election or defeat of clearly identified candidates prevailing judicial interpretation of supreme court precedent prior to and arguably since enactment of the bipartisan campaign reform act of 2002 or bcra has created conundrum by permitting regulation of only those communications containing express advocacy that is communications containing explicit terms ur ging the election or defeat of clearly identified federal candi dates because disclosure was required under either the tax or election laws before 2000 these groups were shrouded in mystery congress addressed the 527 issue that year by requi ring disclosure to the internal revenue service irs and amended the new require ments in 2002 primarily to exempt state and local political organizations under thes disclosure rules 527 organizations are required to report to the irs information that is similar to what political committees report to the federal election commission fec but the continued activities of certain 527 organizations heightened concerns about circumvention of federa l election law and the conti nued role of soft money in federal elections even after bcras enactment title ii of bcra addressed the express advocacy issue but only with regard to broadcast advertisements in the period just prior to federal elections ca lled electioneering communications bcrahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32954crs2 was silent regarding interest groups invol vement in such other electionrelated activities as nonbroadcast pub lic communications broadcasts prior to the last 30 days before primary or 60 days before general election voter identification and getoutthevote and registration drives these activities loom particularly large in the wake of bcras prohibition on national political party use of nonfederally permissible funds ie soft money to pay for voter mobilization activities in 2004 527 groups extended their activ ities bey ond the br oadcast messages containing electionrelated issue advocacy for which they had become known in 2000 into grassroots voter mobilization ef forts as well since the 2004 elections public attention has shifted to these new patterns of electioneering raising questions as to whether requiring disclo sure to the irs is sufficient 109th congress activity ten bills were proposed in the 109th congress to address the 527 issue hr 471 hr 513 hr 914 hr 1316 hr 1942 hr 2204 hr 4696 hr 4975 s 271 and s 1053 in 2005 the hous and senate committees which oversee federal election law held hearings and reported three bills with vastly different approaches to the issue these bills and hr 4975 represented two distinctive schools of thought that have long frame d the debate on laws governing campaign finance one approach fully favored the regulation of money and politics with the imposition of restrictions and prohibitions justified as being conducive to less corrupt electoral system or at least one that can promote greater confidence by the electorate the opposing view took generally deregulato ry approach based on the belief that money will always find its way into politics and that the more one seeks to regulate the more one contributes to such unintended consequences as money flowing through less visible less account able channels these two schools of thought were reflected in th three principal measures reported by house and senate committees regulatory approach the initial response to the perceive d 527 problems came from the sponsors of the bipartisan campaign reform act of 2002 bcra senators mccain and feingold and representatives shays and meehan who offered identical bills in september 2004 at the end of the 108th congress hr 5127 and s 2828 to require that 527s involved in federal elections co mply fully with federal election law by adding 527 organizations to the feca finition of political committee revised versions of these bills were ffered on february 2 2005 in the 109th congress as the 527 reform act of 2005 hr 513 and s 271 senate sponsors were bolstered by the addition of rules and administration committee chairman trent lott who had opposed bcra but whose sponsorship of s 271 appeared to signal broadening of support for this aspect of fe deral election law regulation on march 8 2005 the senate rules and administration committee held hearing on s 271 mccainfeingoldlott and on april 27 proceeded to markup of the bill however while the primary thrust of s 271 was to apply the full scopehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32954crs3 1 us congress house committee on house administrati on 527 reform act of 2005 report to accompany hr 513 109th cong 1st sess hrept 109181 washington gpo 2005of

may 17 2005 an original bill was reported from the committee as s 1053 thus supplanting s 271 and placed on the senates legislative calendar on june 29 2005 the house administra tion committee held markup of hr 513 shaysmeehan and ordere d it reported as amended to reflect the sponsors changes without recommendation1 this set the stage for house floor debate on the two contrasting measures hr 1316 reported favorably by the committee few weeks earlier see below and hr 513 on march 16 2006 the house republican l eaderships lobby and ethics reform bill hr 4975 was introduced by represen tative david dreier the bill the 527 reform act of 2006 incorporated the nguage of hr 513 shaysmeehan as reported by the house administration committee to subject 527 political organizations involved in fe deral elections to feca regulation the bill also included one provision unrelated to 527s to remove the political party coordinated expenditure limits in 2 usc 441ad one additional bill offered in the s econd session reflected limited regulatory approach hr 4696 rogers would prohibit 527 organizations that are not also political committees under the feca from ma king electioneering

2006 would subject 527 political organizations involved in fe deral elections to regulati on under the federal election campaign act feca the one amendm ent added on the house floor to remove political party coordinated expenditure limits mirrored the provision included in hr 4975 and hr 1316 the text of hr 513 as passed was also added to hr 4975 the lobbying accountability and transparency act of 2006 which passed the house on may 3 2006 it also included an amendment added by the house rules committee to prohibit leadership pac funds from being converted to personal use but to allow them to be transferred without limit to na tional party committees as is the case with funds in principal campaign committees after passing hr 4975 the house substituted it for the text of s

hr 1316 the 527 fairness act of 2005 esse ntially this bill adopted the converse approach to the perceived 527 problem as was taken by sponsors of the 527 reform act of 2005 ie to loosen restrictions on ot her players in the political process so that they could assume greater role and hen ce offset the perceived undue role played by the 527s by so doing proponents expected that there would be less of an incentive for political money to flow to 527 groups operating outside the framework of the feca the house administration committee held hearing april 20 2005 on hr 1316 pencewynn and hr 513

reform act s 1053 hr 513 hr 4975 s 271 and restor ing trust in government act hr 4696 soft money non federal funds the key provision of the 527 reform act of 20052006 would add 527 organizations to the feca definition of political committee thus subjecting them to the full scope of federal election law regulation source limits and prohibitions and disclosure requirements the bills enumerated activities which would exempt 527s from feca regulation generally those that seek to affect state and local but not federal elections as well as activities that would negate such exemptions generally ones th at could be construed as having some potential substantive impact on federal elections additionally the bills would codify fec regulations which took effect in janua ry 2005 to require that at least 50 of pac spending for activities that benefit federal as well as state and local elections be from hard money and that donations to pacs nonfederal account be limited to 25000 year from individuals only these provisions were the heart of all four bills or bill sections entitled 527 reform act although the repor ted senate bill reflected mo re finetuning to allow greater range of activities to avoid trigge ring regulation under feca most notable of these was reflected in the schumer amendment to s 1053 adopted despite the opposition of bill sponsors to allow 527 gr oup solely engaged in voter mobilization efforts but broadcast cable or satellite activities to escape from feca regulation the bills thus sought to address the issues raised during the 2004 elections by highly visible 527 groups which raised money in amounts and from sources which would have been prohibited were they regu lated under the feca in larger sense s 1053 s 271 hr 513 and hr 4975 ttempted to reconcile the different regulatory approaches of federal elec tion and tax codes as well as different interpretations of what c onstitutes electionrela ted activity much like the sponsors of bcra proponents of the 527 reform act were faced w ith the basic challenge of trying to regulate in the area of protected free speech rights requiring that provisions be narrowly drawn so as to be easily unde rstood by the regulated community and not be overly broad and thus impinge on free sp eech they also had to contend with the prospect that by imposing greater regu lation directly on 527s they could provide incentives for groups to reorganize as other taxexempt entities to avoid onerous regulation as 527s supporte rs and opponents of these bills reached very different conclusions as to the bills success in meeting those goals one additional bill offered in the second session reflected limited regulatory approach among its other pr ovisions hr 4696 rogers the restoring trust in government act would prohibit 527 organizations that are not also political committees under the feca from making ectioneering communications these communications broadcast during the final 30 or 60 days of an election are the most visible but hardly the only form of electionrelated issue advocacy hard money federal funds the bill emerging from the senate rules and administration committee contained two amendments unrelated to the 527 issue the bennett amendment added severa l provisions to loosen some feca hardhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32954crs21 3 hr 1605 and hr 1606 hensarling s 678 reidmoney restrictions partic ularly affecting pacs while bcra had raised contribution limits on individuals and parties and provided for indexing for inflation money given to and by pacs was not aff ected under the bennett amendment such limits would be raised and amounts indexed for future inflation corporations unions and trade associations would be gi ven freer authority to solicit restricted classes for funds for their pacs measur long favored by the business pac community leadership pacs would be given the right to transfer unlimited amounts of money to national political party just as is the case for candidates principal campaign committee often applicable to leftover funds of retiring federal officeholders also the bennett amendment added langua ge identical to several bills in congress seeking to exclude communications over the internet from regulation under the feca3 the durbin amendment added provi sion to lower broadcast costs for political candidates by changing the way the lowest unit rate lur is calculated making time purchased under lur nonpreem ptible and extending the rate to national political parties buying time on behalf of their candidates this measure had been included in the senate passed version of bcra in 2001 but was deleted by the house before enactment in 2002 prior to house passage of hr 4975 an amendment was included by the house rules committee to prohibit leadersh ip pac funds from being converted to personal use but to allow them to be tran sferred without limit to national state or local party committees as is the case with funds in candidate committees hr 4975 dreier and hr 513 included one provision aimed at deregulating an aspect of campaign finance practice the removal of political party coordinated expenditure limits this provision was added to hr 513 before it was passed by the house it will be discu ssed below under the hard money section of hr 1316 which also contained it deregulatory bill 527 fairness act of 2005 hr 1316 both as introduced and in the version reported from the house administration committee hr 1316 was overwhelmingly aime d at deregulating both the hard and soft money aspects of federal election law soft money non federal funds irc 501c4 organizations are generally referred to as s ocial welfare organizations irc 501c5 organizations include labor unions 501c6 organizations include trade associations and irc 527 organizations are political organiza tions under bcra irc 501c4 and 527 organizations are exempted from the prohibition against corporations paying for electioneering communica tions unless per the so called wellstone amendment they are for targeted communications hr 1316 would repeal the targeted communications exception thus generally allowing incorporated 501c4 and 527 organizations to engage in election eering communications the bill would also expand the exemption to include irc 501c5 and 501c6 organizations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32954crs22 there is requirement in the tax laws that irc 501c4 501c5 501c6 and 527 organizations be inco rporated thus for any of these organizations that are not incorporated the current law that relates to electioneering communications is inapplicable and such or ganizations would not be affected by the amendments made by hr 1316 to t hose provisions most irc 501c4 501c5 and 501c6 organizations are incorporated but it is rare for irc 527 organizations to be incorporated current law specifies that the provi sions on electioneering communications do not authorize any irc 501c organizati on to take actions that are prohibited under the tax laws hr 1316 would so specify that the electioneering communications provisions do not affect th tax treatment of expenditures for such communications by irc 501c organizati ons under the tax laws if these organizations make certain political expenditures then they are subject to tax on the lesser of their net investment income or the amount of the expenditure taxable political expenditures could include expenditures for electioneering communications while this tax may provide disincentiv for organizations with substantial investment income from making such expe nditures it may not affect organizations with little or investment income or those that make lowcost expenditures hr 1316 would clarify that while the bill w ould allow incorporated irc 501c4 501c5 and 501c6 organizations to make expenditures for electioneering communications the organizations coul d still be taxed on the amount of the expenditures under the tax laws two provisions added to hr 1316 in committee would impose further regulation of 527 groups one would pr ohibit foreign nationals from donating to 527s the other would require 527s currently reporting only to the irs to report to the fec as well as though they we re federallyregistered pacs hr 1316 also addressed some of the soft money restrictions imposed under bcra whereas bcra prohibits state and local parties from spending soft money for voter registration activities in the last 120 days of federal election hr 1316 would remove that prohibition and allow st ate and local parties to spend nonfederal funds subject to allocation requirements for any voter registration activity as well as for sample ballots the bill would also allow federal candidates and officeholders to endorse and appear in advertisements for state and local candidates without constituting coordinated disbursement by the federal candidate or officeholder it would also codify an existing fec regula tion that allows federal candidates and officeholders to speak without restriction or regulation at state and local party fundraisers hard money federal funds in the hard money arena hr 1316 would provide greater freedom for individuals political parties and pacs to influence the electoral process within the context of the federal election laws regulatory system as such it would provide the sources of funds with greater leverage in the hard money arena in order to make the less re gulated soft money arena less appealing perhaps provision signals move toward deregulation more than the proposed removal of the aggregate limit on i ndividual contributions as originally imposed in the 1974 amendments to fe ca individuals we re limited to 25000 perhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32954crs23 year on all contributions to federal candidates parties and pacs bcra raised the limit to 95000 per twoyear election cycle with specified sublimits and indexed it for inflation in 2005 that limit is 101400 by removing the aggregate limit the bill would allow individual citizens to give substantially more money in twoyear period than they can now while still subjecting them to the per entity limitations in other words while an individuals opport unity for influence with particular candidate pac or party committee would be constrained as it is now the opportunity for an individual to gain greater stature in the political community would be allowed to rise considerably while proponents favorably contrast the prospect of wealthy individuals giving considerable sum of regulated hard money with the many millions of dollars given by some donors to 527 groups in 2004 opponents assert that the move toward individuals giving much larger sums unde r federal law sends the wrong message to the electorate these opponent s note that because bcra prohibits federal candidates and officeholders and national party officials from raising so ft money there is far less chance for corruption when an individual dona tes large sums to an independent group than when policymaker raises large sums from contributor hence any move toward substantial increases in hard mone limits is particularly troubling to these opponents supporters insist that the pe r entity limitations would remain in place thus mitigating concerns bout potential for corruption the second most notable hard money provision is the removal of party coordinated expenditure limits provision also included in hr 4975 dreier and hr 513 shaysmeehan as passed bills wh ich would otherwise be classified as reflecting regulatory approach this pr ovision may have less of practical effect than first appears to be the case this form of spending whereby party makes expenditures in coordination with candidates campaign has been subject to limits since the 1974 feca amendments the limits are relatively high compared with the limits on contributions with typical house candidates eligible for 74620 in 2004 and senate candidate as much as 38 million in california that year ever since the supreme court ruling in colorado republican federal campaign committee v fec 518 us 604 1996 whic h permitted par ties to make independent expenditures on behalf of their candi dates the importance of coordinated expenditures has been diminished the prospect of unlimited independent expenditures has been increasingly appealing to the parties and it has become common for parties to make both independent expenditu res and coordinated expenditures for the same candidates albeit from at least nominally different departments of party committee in 2004 democratic part committees federal state and local made 331 million in coordinated expend itures and 1765 million in independent expenditures to promote th eir federal candidate s republican party committees made 291 million in coordi nated expenditures and 880 million in independent expenditures hence while abolishing the limit on coordinated expenditures would appear to allow the parties to spend unlimited am ounts on behalf of th eir candidates they already have that right albeit through ex penditures that are t echnically made without any coordination with the favored candidate in sense the removal of these limits could be seen as acceptance of the current reality bcra had contained provision to require party to choose making either independent or coor dinated expenditureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32954crs24 4 for further discussion of th supreme courts ruling in mcconnell see crs report rl32245 campaign finance law

mcconnell v fec 549 us 9320034 opponents assert that like removi ng the aggregate individual limit this provision sends the wrong message to an ectorate cynical about the role of money in politics they further insist that the national parties are now playing significant role especially in light of increased hard money limits under bcra with combined fundraising record of nearly 15 billion in the 2004 election cycle all hard money more than ever had been raised in combined hard and soft money by the national parties many other hard money provisions in hr 1316 either in the introduced version or as added in committee corres ponded with provisions added to s 1053 in committee provisions included in both hr 1316 and s 1053 included the higher pac limits the indexing of all limits for inflation the greater freedom given to unions corporations and trad associations to solicit restricted classes for pac donations the unlimited authority given to leadership pacs to transfer funds to political parties the increase in the do llar threshold for tr iggering political committee status and the removal of in ternet communications from regulation under feca bills to regulate 527s through disclosure requirements four bills in the 109th congress sought more limited approach to the 527 issue than reflected in the bills discusse d above to the extent that what has concerned many observers about 527 groups activity is their lack of accountability relative to organizations re gulated under federal election law these proposals sought to bolster the disclosure requirements in the irc and thus offer voters greater opportunity to know about these groups and who finances them table 2 offers comparison of these four bills hr 471 larson hr 914 english hr 1942 shaw and hr 2204 shaw with

gift tax an indivi dual is taxed on the amount of gifts made over his or her lifetime not all gifts are subject to tax first some transfers are excluded from the gift tax eg contributions to irc 527 organizations are not subject to the tax9 second an individual is able to give annually certain amount that is free from tax the annual exclusion amount is 10000 per donee and it is adjusted for inflation10 for 2006 the exclusion amount is 12000 therefore an individual who gives three donees each gi fts of 12001 in 2006 will have made only 3 in taxable gifts third an individual is able to give 1 million in taxable gifts during his or her life time without being subject to tax it is not until that threshold is passed that the individual is taxed11 thus the individual who made 3 in taxable gifts would only be currently taxed on that amount if he or she had already given more than 1 million in taxable gifts over his or her lifetime regardless of whether he or she owes tax the individual would be required to file gift tax return reporting the taxable gifts under hr 1942 and hr 2204 contributions to an irc 527 organization would be taxable gifts if the organization failed to
