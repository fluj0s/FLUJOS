congressional research service the library of congress senate committee activity action on measures referred 19732000 summary the use of committees as crucial centers of policymaking oversight of federal agencies and public education is an organizing principle of the contemporary congress committees are presumed to be the primary locus through which the work of congress is organized and where public policy proposals first receive substantive consideration by using committees the senate enables itself to manage large volume of legislative investigative and oversight activity and support the representational duties of and senators the focus of the workload and activity indicators presented in this report is action on legislative measures referred to committees these indicators illuminate certain kinds of congressional workload and activity generally the numbers of measures referred vary considerably from committee to committee this variation is mainly function of the committees jurisdiction the wider the jurisdiction the more measures will likely be referred to it the forms of measures referred also vary with committee jurisdiction the rates of reporting bills also vary significantly from committee to committee as with figures for referrals to committees these variations probably reflect different jurisdictionalcharacteristics as well as intensified activity in different jurisdictions over time also some committees percentage of the total reported is much lower than their percentage of the total referred as with measures reported the data on measures enacted into law reveal consistent pattern variable committee workloads along with the impact of social economic and political changes or demands all appear to contribute to committee activity levels what can be said is that measures enacted are consistently small percentage of measures referred for example in the 106th congress 744 bills and joint resolutions or 1043 of the 7132 measures referred to senate committees were enacted into law committee indicators illuminate only certain kinds of congressional workload and activity by themselves none of the indicators presented may be regarded as

referred 19732000 introduction in an often repeated summary of the work of congress political scientist and future president woodrow wilson observed that congress in its committeerooms is congress at work1 the use of committees as crucial centers of policy making oversight of federal agencies and public education continues to be an organizing principle of the contemporary congress committees are presumed to be the primary locus through which the work of congress is organized and where public policy proposals first receive substantive consideration from the introduction of legislative initiative committees and their members are involved in deciding which initiatives will go forward and which will receive further consideration managing the progress of an initiative through floor consideration resolving differences in initiatives passed by both chambers and overseeing the implementation of public policies the committee work of the senate is dispersed among standing and select or special committees standing committees are permanent committees established by senate rule xxv that handle the majority of the work select committees are usually established by separate resolutions of the senate often select committee is established because the existing standing committee system does not provide for an issue to be addressed comprehensively by single committee or because particular event sparks interest in an investigation select committee may be permanent or temporary2 1 woodrow wilson congressional government study in american politics baltimore the johns hopkins university press 1981 originally published 1885 p 69 2 instead of select the senate sometimes uses the term special committee there is substantive difference between select and special committee the designation depends merely on what the resolution creating the committee calls it crs2 committees enable the senate to manage large volume of legislative investigative and oversight activity and support the representational duties of senators3 in the senate the committee system handles several thousand legislative measures and nearly 100000 nominations submitted during each 2year congress senate rule xxv defines the jurisdiction of each standing committee and details the topic areas in which committee may consider legislation and conduct oversight when legislative measure is introduced in the senate it is typically referred to one or more standing committees according to their jurisdictions4 referrals are made by matching the subject matter of the measure to the committee with jurisdiction over that subject most standing committees authorize and recommend funding levels for government operations and for new and existing programs5 the resolutions which create select and special committees typically assign specific areas of investigation or study legislative activity in the senate usually begins with the introduction of measure bill or resolution and its referral to committee all data on bills and resolutions in this report take account only of measures that receive referral to senate committee committees typically act on measures referred to them by determining which to report to the senate for further action committees are also principally responsible for coordinating both the consideration by the full senate of measures within their respective jurisdictions and the subsequent progress of those measures to enactment or final approval the referral reporting and enactment of measures represent key dimensions of senate committees workload and activity data on these subjects shed light on overall patterns highlight significant trends and suggest the effects of institutional changes over time such as rules changes and shifts in committee jurisdictions data in this report on both measures referred and action taken thereon are presented in two distinct ways 1 by congress and 2 by committee each of these presentations permits considering the work of senate committees in different context where the data are organized by congress each table covers single congress and gives data for all committees in that congress where they are organized by committee each table covers single committee and gives data for the entire period covered examining committee activity by congress offers committeeoriented perspective on the legislative activity of the entire body and reveals detailed patterns for the entire committee system across time data presented by committee demonstrate the ebb and flow of activity by individual 3 for discussion of the roles of committees in congress see roger h davidson and walter j oleszek congress and its members 7th ed washington cq press 2000 pp 197226 4 see crs report 98242 committee jurisdiction and referral in the senate 5 few senate committees have other functions for example the senate budget committee establishes aggregate levels for total spending and revenue and within functional budget categories new budget authority and outlays these aggregates serve as guidelines for the work of the authorizing and appropriating panels crs3 committees permit the work of specific committees to be tracked and illuminate differences among committees in how they carry out their work data are also broken down by the chamber senate or house in which the measures originated they cover the 93rd through 106th congress 19732000 and include all senate standing select and special committees that received referrals6 information regarding measures was collected through searching the bill summary and status sections of the legislative information system lis7 table 1 summarizes these distinctions and provides guide to the presentation of data by identifying which tables below display figures in each of the various forms described table 1 presentations of data chamber of indicator presentation origin of tables measures measures referred to senate senate 316 committees house

7596 referred to senate committees house 97114 6 most select and special committees are not authorized to consider and report legislative measures to the senate however the senate has given legislative reporting authority to the ethics and intelligence committees 7 the lis is an internetbased database of congressional activity maintained by congress and the congressional research service crs congressional users can access the data base at httpwwwcongressgov public users can access the database through thomas service of the library of congress at httpthomaslocgov data from lis were collected from the earliest available records through the end of the 106th congress 19992000 information for senateoriginated measures is available on lis from the 93rd congress 19731974 information on house measures adopted by the house and subsequently referred to senate committees is available from the 96th congress 19791980 crs4 all data presented cover only measures that were referred to senate committee8 as detailed in the appendix however measures not referred may under variety of circumstances still be reported from senate committees considered on the senate floor or enacted even in the absence of referral these forms of senate action normally still entail activity by the committees under whose jurisdiction the measures fall the data presented do not reflect this activity and to that extent tend to understate the level of work senate committees may perform generally these omissions arise from obstacles in the data compilation process as currently deployed lis offers the ability to track measures originated by senate committees only since the 104th congress the disposition of measures passed by the house and held at the desk in the senate or senate measures sent directly to the floor cannot be identified through available electronic search strategies with combination of manual search and changes in lis search strategies it may be possible to develop indicators which account for these data the eventual development of additional measures of committee activity would help to paint more complete nuanced picture of senate committees and congress in general measures referred forms of measure data on measures referred are broken down according to the types of measure congress considers bills joint resolutions concurrent resolutions and simple resolutions9 of these only bills and joint resolutions are lawmaking vehicles these measures are introduced10 when the intent is to enact law because both bills and joint resolutions are 8 all data on bills and resolutions exclude private measures which are those that propose to confer specified benefits on named individuals for further information on private legislation see richard s beth private bill in the encyclopedia of the united states congress donald c bacon roger h davidson and morton keller eds new york simon and schuster 1995 pp 16261627 and congressional quarterly congressional quarterlys guide to congress 5th ed washington cq press 2000 pp 526527 the data on matters referred to and receiving action by senate committees exclude information on the executive business of the senate nominations and treaties see crs report 98709 senate executive business and the executive calendar and crs report 98384 senate consideration of treaties 9 see crs report 98706 bills and resolutions examples of how each kind is used and crs report 98728 bills resolutions nominations and treaties origins deadlines requirements and uses 10 formally bills are introduced while any kind of resolution is submitted in contexts referring to both bills and resolutions and where the distinction is not material the following pages sometimes use the term introduced to encompass also the submission of resolutions crs5 lawmaking vehicles the data presentations in this report combine measures of both kinds into one class11 measures originating in the house of representatives reach the senate only if the house passes them12 accordingly the present data take account only of house bills joint resolutions and concurrent resolutions that pass the house due to the fact simple resolutions of the house are never transmitted to the senate for action they are never referred to senate committees and the tables on house measures referred to senate committees do not include figures on simple resolutions in the tables on measures referred that are organized by congress the number of measures of each type referred to each senate committee is also presented as percentage of the total number of measures of that type that were referred to all senate committees in each congress these percentages read vertically reveal the distribution of legislative measures by committee in each congress referral trends generally the numbers of measures referred vary considerably from committee to committee tables 327 this variation is mainly function of the committees jurisdiction the wider the jurisdiction the more measures will likely be referred to it for example the committee on finance receives many bills because tax policy attracts so many legislative proposals the forms of measures referred also vary with committee jurisdiction due to the fact the management and rule setting of the senate falls within its jurisdiction the committee on rules and administration receives disproportionate share of the simple resolutions referred to committees similarly greater percentage of concurrent resolutions are referred to the committee on foreign relations than to other committees because these measures often express the nonbinding sense of congress in matters of international relations table 2 shows the aggregate number of senate and house measures referred to senate committees in each congress in general senateoriginated bills and joint resolutions reveal consistent pattern across the period observed at the beginning of the period there is pattern of irregular growth between the 93rd and 101st congresses 11 joint resolutions also are used to propose constitutional amendments these are not lawmaking measures in the strict sense of the term if passed they are not presented to the president for action but rather transmitted to the states for ratification the data in this report include joint resolutions referred to committees and reported to the senate for purposes of amending the constitution but not their ratification this affects chiefly the committee on the judiciary which has jurisdiction over proposed constitutional amendments constitutional amendments were adopted by congress between 1973 and 2000 the 27th amendment regulating congressional salaries was ratified on may 7 1992 it was adopted by the first congress 17891790 on september 25 1789 12 as with the introduction of measures bills are passed while resolutions are adopted in contexts referring to both bills and resolutions and where the distinction is not material the report sometimes uses passed to encompass agreement to resolutions as well crs6 19791990 before brief leveling in the 102nd congress 19911992 sharp decreases followed in the 103rd and 104th congresses 19931996 at the end of the period an upturn occurs in the 106th congress 19992000 the data reveal relatively irregular pattern in the numbers of senate concurrent resolutions referred as well unlike the pattern for bills and joint resolutions it includes sharp drop of nearly 50 between the 102nd and 103rd congresses 19911994 this was followed by more gradual but significant decline in the 103rd through 105th congresses 19931998 in the 106th congress the number of referrals returned to levels seen before the decline after period of steady growth through the 1970s the number of simple resolutions handled by senate committees peaked at 540 in the 96th congress 19791980 they fell steadily throughout the 1980s through the 1990s the number of senate simple resolutions was relatively flat the senate referred between one half and one quarter as many house concurrent resolutions joint resolutions and bills as senate measures to its committees among house measures referred to senate committees house concurrent resolution referrals peaked in the 100th congress 19871988 after several years of growth there followed period of declining referrals of this type of measure until the 104th congress 19951996 and increases during the 105th and 106th congresses 19972000 referral of house joint resolutions and bills generally rose peaking at 450 during the 102nd congress 1991 1992 before declining sharply during the 103rd through 105th congresses 19931998 in the 106th congress 19992000 the trend reversed with the number of referrals of house bills and joint resolutions higher than in the previous three congresses in the aggregate the referral activity indicators do not reveal consistent patterns this irregularity may reflect the limited scope of the indicators themselves rather than being an explicit statement of actual committee workload nevertheless some preliminary conclusions may be drawn for example the downward trend in public bills and joint resolutions referred during the middle and late 1990s appears connected at least in part with the adoption by the house of ban on consideration of legislation designating special days weeks or months for commemoration over the years the senate has revised its procedures for introducing commemorative legislation as well13 in the period after the house decision senateoriginated action on commemorative legislation declined significantly presumably because the chamber recognized that the house would not consider those measures the change was demonstrated in the workload of the senate committee on judiciary which has jurisdiction over commemorative legislation the judiciary committee saw 605 decrease in bills and joint resolutions referred to it in the 104th congress the lack of consistent pattern is also demonstrated by the number of referrals to the committee on judiciary following the commemorative ban and decline in referrals during the 104th congress the number of measures referred to the committee in the 105th and 106th congresses returned to levels seen prior to the commemorative ban 13 see crs report 98662 commemorative legislation evolution and procedures

system lis database at httpwwwcongressgov in the 93rd95th congresses information on referral to senate committees of house passed measures is unavailable through lis na indicates information not available all private measures are excluded crs8 action on bills and joint resolutions referred data presented here about action that occurred on the measures referred to senate committees relate only to bills and joint resolutions these are the only measures that can become law and for most committees represent the great preponderance of measures referred specifically the pertinent tables report the numbers of bills and joint resolutions that were 1 referred to committee 2 reported from committee and 3 enacted into law14 the first group of data on bills and joint resolutions referred repeats the corresponding figures from the tables on referrals the remaining data reflect only actions that occurred on these referred measures excluded accordingly are any bills and joint resolutions originated by senate committees because these are reported without having been referred also excluded are any measures that were enacted into law without having been referred to senate committee for this reason total legislative activity for all committees as presented here falls short in general of the aggregate legislative activity of the senate as whole15 14 joint resolutions introduced to amend the constitution are included in referral columns and if they are reported to the senate the reported column those passed by both houses and sent to the states for ratification however are not included in the enacted columns 15 generally measures are referred to committee for consideration in at least three circumstances however measure may receive consideration by the senate without being referred first bills and joint resolutions may avoid senate committee referral by being placed directly on the senate calendar when introduced under rule xiv similarly simple and concurrent resolutions may when submitted be laid over under the rule rather than referred also measures of any form may by unanimous consent receive immediate floor consideration when introduced even if the data took account of these measures none would appear as measure referred also even though these measures become available for floor consideration committee reports them as result even if the data took account of these measures they would still not appear as measures reported on the other hand those enacted into law would appear as additional to the ones counted in the tables second senate rules permit committees to report original measures by this means committees may in effect introduce new bills and resolutions through the act of reporting them these measures are accordingly reported without being referred even if the data took account of them they would not appear as measures referred they would however appear as measures reported in addition to those reflected in the present data similarly those enacted would appear as additional to the ones counted in the present tables finally when the senate receives measure passed by the house it often holds the continued crs9 in the tables on action on measures referred that are organized by congress the number of measures of each type referred to each senate committee is also presented as percentage of the total number of measures of that type that were referred to all senate committees in the given congress these percentages reveal the distribution of legislative measures reported and enacted by committees in that congress in the tables on actions that are organized by committee the number of measures at each stage after referral to each senate committee is also presented as percentage of the total number of measures that were referred to that committee in that congress these percentages reveal that the process of selection among measures referred results in low number of measures reported and still lower number of measures enacted into law measures reported once measure is referred to committee it normally can reach the senate floor only if the committee reports it back to the senate committees however have general obligation to report any measure referred also because any senator may introduce measure on any subject at any time committee may have before it numerous alternative proposals dealing with any given issue committees are usually unlikely to report more than one of the proposals accordingly the summary tables for the house and senate in each congress tables 2852 show large number of bills that received further action in the 106th congress approximately one in five measures was reported back to the senate for further consideration the rates of reporting bills also vary significantly from committee to committee like figures for referrals to committees these variations probably reflect different jurisdictional characteristics as well as intensified activity in different jurisdictions over time also some committees percentage of the total reported is much lower than their percentage of the total referred for instance in the 106th congress the finance committee received more than one quarter of all measures referred to senate committees but reported less than 3 of all senate measures reported by senate committees this pattern mainly reflects the committees role of screening large numbers of discrete revenue and tariff measures conversely in the 102nd congress the judiciary committee received 1867 of all bills and joint resolutions passed by the house and referred to the senate and 1468 of similar senateoriginated measures referred to senate committees but reported 631 of 15 continued measure at the desk rather than referring it this action facilitates the subsequent process of resolving differences between the house measure and senate companion measure when the two houses initially act on separate measures in this way further action normally occurs on only one of them whichever measure proceeds to enactment the present data count the referral and reporting of the senate measure the house measure does not appear as referred or reported and would not so appear even if the data did take account of these house measures finally however in cases when the senate measure is enacted the present data record this outcome but when the house measure is enacted they do not record the enactment at all if the data reflected these house measures those enacted would appear as additional to the ones counted in the present tables crs10 house measures and 3352 of senate measures to the senate large reason for these levels was the committees jurisdiction over commemorative legislation many of these reported measures were joint resolutions commemorating certain days or occasions after the curtailment of commemorative legislation in both chambers the judiciary committee in the 104th congress 19951996 considered 951 of housepassed measures referred to the senate and reported 3704 of all house measures reported to the senate during the same period the committee considered 955 of senate measures referred to committees and reported 2143 of all senate measures reported measures enacted as with measures reported the data on measures enacted into law reveal consistent pattern variable committee workloads along with the impact of social economic and political changes or demands all appear to contribute to committee activity levels further the procedural practice of referring reporting and passing legislation on the same subject matter in both chambers but using one chambers bill number for final enactment has the effect of depressing the percentage enacted of the other chamber16 what can be said is that measures enacted are consistently small percentage of measures referred for example in the 106th congress 744 bills and joint resolutions or 1043 of the 7132 measures referred to senate committees were enacted into law 17 figure 1 displays the numerical relationship among measures referred reported and enacted in the 93rd106th congresses figure 2 displays the same data as percentages of measures referred over the same period 16 ibid 17 the total number of public laws enacted during the 106th congress was 580 in some cases several of the measures passed by congress were enacted as components larger

reported in senate and enacted into law 93rd106th congresses measures referred and committee workloads each of the indicators for which this report provides data reflects an aspect of the workload of senate committees broadly understood by themselves none may be crs12 regarded as sufficient indicator of the intensity or quality of overall senate committee activity each has its own limitations focusing on one or two indicators could lead to faulty or incomplete conclusions any meaningful assessment of workload must take into account several indicators and must reflect clear understanding of what each is describing generalizing about specific aspects of activity or workload may better rest on combined use of all appropriate indicators rather than on any one what the indicators tell us data on measures referred to committee may only with caution be interpreted as providing information about actual workloads sizable shifts in numbers may reflect changes in senate practice rather than in political conditions or emergent policy issues increase or decrease in the number of bills or joint resolutions referred reported or enacted need not mean that policy demands have abated or multiplied perhaps issues that were previously subject to legislative activity have merely been transferred to administrative fora perhaps the senate is packaging its legislation differently incorporating several measures which in the past might have been enacted individually into longer and more complex omnibus forms in some cases an upturn in the activity of committee in one congress may be an artifact of the routine reconsideration of significant legislationin the committees jurisdiction in the 107th congress for example the committee on agriculture nutrition and forestry is considering the farm bill an omnibus measure which reexamines basket of agricultural and food programs that are reauthorized every 5 to 7 years one can track the figures for given committee over time to determine the effects of bursts of activity in its jurisdiction on its workload but it is difficult to explain the patterns clearly because many factors influence committee workloads it may be the case that when particularly momentous technical or detailed legislation works its way through committee numerical measures of activity decline because committee energy and resources are concentrated instead of dispersed over several initiatives within the committees jurisdiction in this case decline in overall numbers would be an indication of more intensive committee activity committee activity not fully captured the data presented do not fully capture all the work of committees to take an important example committees activity on legislative measures fail to capture the level or intensity of oversight and investigative activity even in relation to legislative activity committees sometimes originate measures that are reported directly to the senate floor calendars additionally there is little systematic understanding of the work of committee members assigned to conference committee activity of these kinds fails to be reflected in data on measures referred aspects of workload not considered even to the extent that statistics on committee activity demonstrate productivity in one arena of congressional service they may still afford an incomplete picture of the overall work of congress and its members for example data on the number of bills or resolutions referred to committees from 1973 to 2000 could be taken to imply that productivity has declined yet trends in senate floor votes and pages per statute which are not considered in this report point to rise in legislative activity similarly the data presented here do not fully capture all aspects of the work of senator because they do not account for representational duties carried out in washington dc and home states or constituent services carried out through senators crs13 offices18 yet this representational activity is related to and may often be carried out simultaneously with investigations and lawmaking activities occurring in committee in conclusion while data about measures referred and actions thereon illuminate certain aspects of committee workload and activity other quantitative indicators would be needed for more rounded picture also lacking are more illuminating qualitative indicators both at the committee level and beyond additional collection of these kinds of data could yield further insight into the legislative environment although the full intensity and quality of senate work will likely remain elusive 18 for discussion of the roles of members of congress see davidson and oleszek congress and its members pp 1339 127140 and 160194 crs14 senate committee
