bridge publications inc newsletter date one should keep going despite heavy weather so my own philosophy is that one should share what wisdom he has one should help others to help themselves and one should keep going despite heavy weather for there is always calm ahead one should also ignore the catcalls from the selfish intellectual who cries dont expose the mystery keep it all for ourselves the people cannot understand but as i have never seen wisdom do any good kept to oneself and as i like to see others happy and as i find the vast majority of the people can and do understand i will keep on writing and working and teaching so long as i exist for i know man who has any monopoly upon the wisdom of this universe it belongs to those who can use it to help themselves and others if things were little better known and understood we would all lead happier lives l ron hubbard this excerpt was taken from the book what is scientology by l ron hubbard handling life with scientology the real work is to put individuals into mental condition where he can confront his own problems and solve them to put him in position where he can confront life better where his reaction time is better where he can identify the factors in his life more easily and so he looks around starts solving his own problems and betters his own life that is an essential difference between scientology and other efforts to help man there are two distinct divisions in scientology the first is philosophic the second is technical under the philosophic heading one discovers the ways and means of forming new ways of life and evaluating or creating standards of livingness and beingness scientology concludes and demonstrates certain truths these truths might be considered to be the highest common denominators of existence itself they have the aspect of precision observation rather than philosophic hazardings when treated as precision observations many results occur when regarded as philosophic opinions only more philosophy results by this knowingness alone and without processing individual technical application it should be understood clearly that new way of life could be created or an old way of life could be understood and better endured or altered under the technical division we have long series of developed processes which applied immediately and directly to life or an organism thereof produce desirable changes in the conditions of life this division comprises applied scientology or scientology applied philosophy and contains standard technology i looked early and long at man to find out what methods he used to survive how he adapted himself to environments in his attempt at survival and what i found was that man advanced to the degree that he preserved his spiritual integrity that he preserved his values that he remained honest that he remained decent and i found that he disintegrated or deteriorated to the degree that he abandoned these things the average man is up against problems he is asking himself how can i make more money how can i make my wife faithful to how can i help my children grow up these questions absorb tremendous quantity of his energy but he cant do anything about it because he is so immersed in it so in scientology processing he resolves these questions he understands what hes doing and he turns from man who is simply puzzled static being into somebody who is more than that we see governments and societies desperately trying to help man they are trying however to solve his problems for him and their efforts to do this have not resulted in any great advance for man the real work is to put individuals into mental condition where he can confront his own problems and solve them to put him in position where he can confront life better where his reaction time is better where he can identify the factors in his life more easily and so he looks around starts solving his own problems and betters his own life that is an essential difference between scientology and other efforts to help man l ron hubbard this excerpt was taken from the book scientology 08 the book of basics scientology results speak for themselves i became more able to make clear precise decision about something sometimes in life achieving goal large or small can seem very complex and possibly there are barriers to accomplishment after having studied the entire book scientology fundamentals of thought i found i was able to simply play the game of life knowing with certainty that things would turn out right and thats exactly what happened i became more able to make clear precise decision about something i wanted to do and this certainly made the greatest difference in getting it done i was able to improve my relationship with my husband my parents and my through understanding them better my work became not just easier but more enjoyable i was able to enjoy being with people so much more and better deal with even difficult circumstances best of all i am in much better position to help others so many times ive had friend or acquaintance who i could have helped before i would have been sad for them because there was nothing i could have done but now i have solutions that work tl in scientology i learned what was behind my failures before i discovered the technology of l ron hubbard i had been married three times with all my marriages ending in divorce i was desperate to find out what it would take to make one work in scientology i learned what was behind my failures and how i had erred in choosing mate i learned about the basic principles of life and discovered i was able to repair the damage i had done soon afterwards i met and married wonderful man we recently celebrated our 16th wedding anniversary and together are very involved in the lives of our ten grandchildren had it not been for achieving whole new level of spiritual awareness through scientology i am certain i would have either continued my hopeless pattern of marriage and divorce or chosen to live alone and be deprived of the companionship and love of very special man instead i have very fulfilling marriage and have been able to build lasting family relationships this is truly wonderful dc it gave the tools and then i applied them to my life to change conditions i have been involved in the scientology religion for 25 years and it has helped tremendously in understanding my own true nature and thereby improving my life what i learned in scientology has helped in every area of living i have had wonderful 22year relationship with my husband and we work as team i have two great kids of whom i am very proud they are happy responsible and able to grow up drugfree as result of their own moral code they respect others and communicate well all of these things i have in my life as result of scientology it gave the tools and then i applied them to my life to change conditions now when i meet new people each day i see how rough life can be for them and
