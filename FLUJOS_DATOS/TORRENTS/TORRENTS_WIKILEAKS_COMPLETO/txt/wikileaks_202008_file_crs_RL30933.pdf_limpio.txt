taylor administration persisted as did criticism of it intern ational concern par ticularly in 1999 and subsequently increasingly centered on the taylor governments ongoing military assistance to the revolutionary united front ruf rebels fighting neighboring sierra leones government this aid which taylor denied providing notably involved the exchange of military aid for diamonds from sierra leone

taylor gove rnment the united states also pursued unilateral sanctioning th taylor government eventually poor political and human ri ghts conditions and residual civil war resentments and rivalries

territory an independent free republic the first on the african continent the legislature named the new country liberia and elected as its first president joseph jenkins roberts until 1980 liberia which modeled its constitution after that of the united states remained independent and stable but conflict over political power and economic resources between descendants of settlers and indigenous groups was present from the birth of the republic liberian state and society reflect blending of the cultural and political influences of both p opulations the i ndigenous population is comprised of 16 main ethnic groups who speak 27 languages or distinct dialects americoliberians who include the descendants of africanamerican settlers from the united states and congos those descended from

the urban modern economy while about 80 of the latter group engaged primarily in subsistence agriculture and petty trade and generally experienced lower standards of living such unequal social re lations were an effect both of liberias american settlement history and of africas colonial era more generally in the late 19th century european colonial powers increased the political and territorial extent of their rule across africa commonly moving gradually inland from coastal commercial settlements or military bases this pattern of occupation was increasingly formalized after 1885 when european gove rnments met and mutually agreed that any colonizing state would have to eff ectively occupy and map out african regions over which it cla imed sovereignty1 in accordance with this model of rule and during the same period the americo liberian elite began to im pose system of centralized administrative rule taxation and codifi ed law over the small decentralized indigenous confederations and independent clan or villagebased societies of liberias interior often employing military force covered further below doe regime americoliberian rule came to an abrupt end in 1980

and construction and communications industries taylor reportedly held dir ect personal shares in num ber of private firms but he was also said to have received ffthebooks payments from private firms in exchange for business licenses and concession rights as well as earnings cuts7 in particular numerous reports suggest that members of the taylor administration controlled and diverted for their own uses significant amounts of revenue from the export of timber which many observers alleged was routinely harvested in an environmentally destructiv and unsustainable manner state revenues earned from the flags of convenience merchant marine fleet fees and other operations of the usbased liberian international ship corporate registry comprised second key source of revenues subject to alleged dive

inefficiencies related to lack of resources the legislature under taylor was dominat ed by his national patriotic party which held 49 of the 64 seats in the house of representatives and 21 of the 26 senate seats the legislature exercised little practical independence from the executive although legislators were gene rally free to voice their sometimes strongly expressed views in part some

networks of supporters includi ng civil servants joined or were coopted by the taylor administration in exchange for civil servi ce jobs salaries the use of vehicles and other state resources and the expenditure of state resources in their constituencies similarly businessmen relied on connections to key government figures to ensure their freedom to run commercial operations and obtain natural resource extraction concessions tax breaks nd related advantages the taylor administration exercised political authority through its control of public policy formation and implementation while legal processe s were nominally practiced they were often subject to irre gularities legislative and budget proposals were regularly promulgated for instance but often remained unra tified or subject to other legal ambiguities and ad hoc presidential actions the strategic commodities act of 2001 for instance was reportedl passed in 2001 and later ratified but liberian officials stated in late 2001 that it had not been signed into law despite uncertainties over the legal status of the act which granted the executive sole power and negotiation rights over all commercial contracts or agreements related to the extraction of liberias na tural resources observers say that taylors backing of the act had the facto effect of putting it into practice political conditions under taylor taylor was widely reported to have harbored deep suspicions and fears of diverse plots against him by foreign governments and liberian political oppone nts and rivals he periodically voiced public statements warning of and against such alleged machinations which in some cases gave birth to sometimes extended political contretemps taylor also exhibited autocratic sometimes seemingly arbitrary behavior that some observers saw as verging on megalomaniacal particularly given taylors penchant for speaking of himself in the third person9 many observers however also described taylor as well read articulate and persuasive and possessed of charismatic personality httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30933crs14 10 in august 2000 protaylor newspaper re ported that the liberian government had become aware of an american

were jailed for various plots or other alleged offenses against taylor 11 see annual us state department human righ ts reports on liberia and various reports by the international crisis group and by

political progress the security situation remained troubled both with respect to institutional developments and with respect to public security and human rights postwar national reconciliation was hampered by the new governments failure according to its critics to create an ethnica lly broad politically in clusive and smaller liberian military as required under the abuj accords this failure was source of considerable friction between the taylor government and ecomog which had been mandated with helping liberia to undertake such postconflict m ilitary reforms while taylor engaged ecomog on this i ssue he apparently viewed ecomog primarily as source of training expertise rather than of or ganizational and policy reform advice and did not see the objectives associated with liberias peace process as paramount taylor citing sovereign selfdefense cerns and lack of funds delayed such restructuring instead ta ylor replaced personnel who left the army through attrition and mandated retirements with former npfl fighters and other loyalists following persistent criticism in late 2000 commission with mandate to downsize and restructure the army wa s reportedly created and allocated
