applicability this instruction applies to the joint staff and combatant commands 4 policy overview the purpose of the cbt rif is to fund emergency and emergent highpriority combating terrorism requirements in the year of execution the fund provides means for combatant commanders cocoms to react to unforeseen requirements from changes in terrorist threat threat levels force protection doctrinestandards as well as unanticipated requirements identified as result of vulnerability assessments tactical operations and exercising antiterrorism at plans cbt rif can be used to fund maintenance costs for cbtriffunded items during the year of purchase and the subsequent year as stopgap measure to permit services adequate time to program lifecycle costs if maintenance funds are not programmed and provided from parent service the fund is not intended to subsidize ongoing cjcsi 526101c 1 july 2003 2 projects supplement budget shortfalls or support routine activities which are service responsibilities b considerationslimitations 1 cbt rif requests can only be submitted by cocoms for their geographic area area of responsibility aor or for assigned forces when the requests improves the security posture for combatant command assigned forces cocoms may submit requests for assigned forces bases stations posts agencies and guard units stationed in the continental united states if in title 10 status as designated by the secretary of defense or if in support of cocom the cocom must validate and forward cbt rif requests to the joint staff j3 deputy director of global operations j3 antiterrorismforce protection division ddgo atfp in accordance with cbt rif submission approval and reporting procedures enclosure the requests must provide justification information follow the specific format identified in enclosure b and be approved at the cocom or deputy cocom level and coordinated through the cocom comptroller and legal counsel for submission to the joint staff the cocom must also forward requests in prioritized spreadsheet enclosure c and report status of obligations and disbursements enclosure d the same criteria apply for security assistance teams whose at requirements fall under the cocom per agreement with the department of state 2 for emergent requirements the requestor must have an approved executable and exercised at plan as prescribed in reference prior to submitting cbt rif request unless the plan is not executable because of the requested item the at plan is the foundation for determining at requirements and therefore prerequisite for an emergent cbt rif request operational units must be in support of cocomapproved at program emergency cbt rif requests are exempt from this requirement 3 commanders should focus on preventing mass casualties using an outsidetoinside approach emphasizing deterrence detection and defending against terrorist attacks the purpose is to prevent terrorists from accessing dod installations or facilities inhabited by dod personnel or their families 4 cbt rif requirements are only funded with operations and maintenance om or procurement funds as defined and governed by the dod financial management regulation fmr submissions may include requirements for physical security equipment and physical security site improvements under extraordinary circumstances eg uss cole commission recommendations emergent or emergency cbt rif requests may be submitted for management and planning security forcestechnicians and security and investigative matters examples of these include contract cjcsi 526101c 1 july 2003 3 manpower vulnerability assessments tdy and equipment associated costs and training cbt rif will not be used to fund civilian or military personnel positions 5 use of cbt rif funds must meet the fmr guidelines generally the following thresholds apply for items that are not centrally managed if an item is not centrally managed and has unit cost of less than or equal to 100000 it should be classified as an expense om item if it exceeds 100000 then it is an investment item procurement if an item is centrally managed refer to the fmr volume 2a chapter 1 for additional guidelines b iaw title 10 section 2805 om can be used to carry out an unspecified minor military construction project costing not more than 750000 and 1500000 for minor military construction projects projects exceeding these thresholds require military construction funding for life threatening military construction projects the threshold is 3000000 refer to section 2805 for other limitations on the use of om for unspecified minor construction projects c prior to submitting request for cbt rif other sources of funding need to be considered either through the cocom eg contingency operations funding or service process it is common for dod organizations to charge passthrough administrative fees to requesting organizations passthrough costs should be avoided or when not avoidable these costs should be minimized 6 requestors should use service andor dod sources technical support working group and physical security equipment action group to determine optimum technology available to meet requirements do not rely solely upon contractor provided information c submission and approval process 1 cocoms prioritize and submit emergent cbt rif requests to j3 ddgo atfp not later than nlt 1 october and 1 february in fiscal year while following the procedures and timeline in enclosure the requesting organizations must concurrently provide copies of their submissions to the parent service however cocoms may forward emergency requests at any time during the fiscal year for consideration j3 ddgo atfp will staff emergency requests immediately upon receipt 2 j3 ddgo atfp will coordinate cbt rif approved recommendations to include maintenance costs if applicable with cjcsi 526101c 1 july 2003 4 asdsolic parent services office of the legal counsel cjcs jro cbrn j8 and joint staff comptroller the cjcs or his designated representative is the final approval authority for cbt rif requests each request for funds will be evaluated on its individual merits the cjcs will approve requirements nlt 15 november and 15 march of each fiscal year for previously approved and funded projects the j3 ddgo atfp in coordination with the joint staff can internally realign any unobligated balances to assist the cocoms in executing their programs 3 funding provided for approved projects should be obligated within 90 days of receipt and nlt the end of the fiscal year and expended within 1 year of obligation failure to obligate funds within 90 days could result in retrieval and redistribution of funds for other emergent requests if funds cannot be obligated within 90 days memorandum requesting an extension must be submitted from the cocom at point of contact to j3 ddgo atfp explaining the problem and rationale for the delay with an anticipated obligation date 4 using the format at enclosure d cocoms must submit obligation and expenditure reports to the j3 ddgo atfp outlining the status of projects iaw enclosure c obligation and expenditure status must be either certified by

terrorist incident 2 accessibility accessibility is measured in terms of the relative ease or difficulty of movement for terrorist elements and the likelihood of detection 3 recognizability measures the degree to which terrorist can determine the function and importance of an area andor the assets located within it d at plan effectiveness describe the specific at program shortfall to determine how effective the installation performs the at functions related to addressing the terrorist threat using one or more of the following criteria 1 policyproceduresplans measures the presence of
