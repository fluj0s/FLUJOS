situation of afrolatinos in latin america particularly the plight of afrocolombians affected by the armed conflict in colombia in recent years people of african descent in the spanishand portuguesespeaking nations of latin americaalso known as afrolatinoshave been pushing for increased rights and representation afrolatinos comprise some 150 million of the regions 540 million total population and along with women and indigenou s populations are among the poorest most marginalized groups in the region afrolatinos have formed groups that with the help of international organizations are seeking political representation human rights protection land rights and greater social and economic opportunities improvement in the status of afrolatinos could be difficult and contentious however depending on the circumstances of the afrodescendant populations in each country assisting afrolatinos has never been primary us foreign policy objective although number of us aid programs benefit afrolatinos while some foreign aid is specifically targeted towards afrolatinos most is distributed broadly through programs aimed at helping all marginalized populations some members support increasing us assistance to afrolatinos while others resist particularly given the limited amount of development assistance available for latin america there was legislative action on several bills in the 110 th congress with provisions related to afro latinos the consolidated appropriations act fy2008 hr 2764pl 110161 required the state department to certify that the colombian military is not violating the land and property rights of afrocolombians or the indigenous it also prohibited the use of andean counterdrug funds for investment in oil palm development if it causes displacement or environmental damage as it has in many afrocolombian communities in the explanatory statement to the consolidated appropriations act the conferees st ipulated that up to 15 million in alternative development assistance to colombia may be provided to afrocolombian and indigenous communities on july 11 2007 the house passed hres 426 mcgovern recognizing 2007 as the year of the rights of internally displaced persons including afrocolombians in colombia and offering us support to programs that assist and protect them on september 9 2008 the house passed hres 1254 engel supporting the values and goals of the joint action plan between the government of the federative republic of brazil and the government of the united states of america to eliminate racial and et hnic discrimination and promote equality which was signed by secretary of state condoleezza rice and brazilian minister of racial integration edson santos in march 2008 in addition the 110 th congress discussed the situation of afrocolombians during its consideration of the uscolombia trade prom otion agreement as in the past the 111th congress is likely to continue to consider legislative provisions relevant to the circumstances of afrolatinos httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32713g3g143g155g152g556g14g138g157g146g151g152g156g561g146g151g561g14 g138g157g146g151g561g3g150g142g155g146g140g138g561g138g151g141g561g5g152

descent commonly referred to as afrolatinos along with women and indigenous populations are among the poorest and most marginalized groups in latin america the term afrolatinos as used within the in ternational development community and the us government generally refers to afrodescendant populations in the spanishand portuguese speaking nations of latin america following common usage this paper uses the terms afrodescendant afrolatino afrolatin and black interchangeably this paper does not include discussion of haiti or englishspeaking caribbean nations that have governments composed largely of afrodescendants within the past decade afrolatinos have begun to employ different strategies to align national movements with international organizations including multilateral development banks to which the united states contributes in order to improve their social status 1 some countriesmost notably brazil and colombiahave enacted legal reforms and government programs to address racial discrimination land rights and political and social exclusion improvement in the status of afrolatinos could be difficult and internally contentious however depending on the size and circumstances of the afrodescendant populations in each country some us analysts and policymakers argue that the united states has specific interest in assisting afrodescendant peoples in latin america they assert that assisting vulnerable peoples fits into larger us policy goals for the region promoting democracy encouraging economic growth and poverty reduction and protecting human rights those proponents disagree however as to whether us foreign aid should be specifically targeted towards afrolatinos as it has been in the case of some indigenous peoples or whether it should continue to be distributed broadly through programs aimed at helping all marginalized populations other analysts question whether increasing assistance to afrolatinos is feasible at time when limited development assistance is being allocated to latin america they point out that the country with the largest afrodescendant population in the region brazil is relatively developed and does not receive large amounts of us foreign aid they question whether funds directed towards afrolatinos will have to be taken from programs currently serving other needy groups still others caution that because race is sensitive issue for many countries in latin america the united states should be cautious when pursuing policies that affect the issue this report reviews and analyzes the situation concerns and activities of afrodescendants in the spanishand portuguesespeaking nations of latin america it then discusses current us foreign aid programs as well as multilateral initiatives that have directly or indirectly assisted afrolatinos the report concludes with discussion of potential policy options that have been proposed should the united states elect to provide further support for afrolatinos 1 for recent

issues in latin america most of latin americas 540 million residents descend from three major racialethnic groups indian or indigenous peoples of whom there are some 400 distinct groups europeans largely of spanish and portuguese heritage and africans descendants of slaves brought to the region during the colonial era2 mestizo generally refers to people of mixed european and indigenous lineage while mulatto refers to people of mixed african and european background after centuries of racial mixing there are numerous racial variations in latin america and many people of mixed african european and indigenous ancestry since the colonial period racial intermingling also known as mestizaje has been source of national pride for many countries in latin america countries with large afrodescendant populations especially brazil have until recently been heavily influenced by the notion of racial democracy racial democracy attributes the different conditions under which blacks and whites or mestizos live to class differences not racial discrimination adherents of this theory which is also pervasive in ecuador colombia and venezuela argue that being black is transitory state that can be altered by whitening through miscegenation or wealth accumulation 3 the racial democracy theory has been challenged by recent data revealing strong and persistent correlation between race and poverty in latin america4 in both brazil and colombia the countries with the largest afrolatino populations in south america afro descendants are and have always been among the poorest least educated lowest paid citizens despite the complexities surrounding racial identity in latin america and the limited data available on this topic this section outlines the characteristics history and current status of afro descendant people in latin america

afrodescendants in latin america have not been historically identified as they have in the united states as any individual with traceable african ancestry people in latin america have several different ways of classifying themselves lighter skinned mulattoes may identify themselves as white while some blacks may identify themselves as mulattoes or mestizos these classifications are influenced by class position geographic location societal associations of blackness the existence or lack of collective identities among people of color and state policies there is range of state policies towards race in latin america from tacitly condoning racism against minority groups to promoting diversity the dominican republic provides striking example of how racial identity has been formed by official notions of national identity the dominican government mobilized nationalist movement against an external threat the mostly 2 people of european descent will also be referred to as whites 3 for discussion of racial democracy and the differences between the prevailing conceptions of race in brazil and the united states see sheila walker africanity vs blackness race class and

although the vast majority of the population has african ancestry dominicans in order to distinguish themselves from their poorer haitian neighbors tend to define themselves as mestizos descended from indians and europeans and not as afro dominicans5 2005 study on racial attitudes in the dominican republic finds that 83 of dominicans believe their society is racist against blacks6 for the purposes of this report blacks and mulattoes are grouped together to yield the estimated number of afrodescendants in latin america7 of the 540 million people living in latin america some 150 million were of african descent as of 1997 the latest data available8 afro latinos tend to reside in coastal areas although in many countries they have migrated to large cities in search of employment afrolatinos constitute majority of the population in cuba and the dominican republic in brazil colombia panama venezuela ecuador and nicaragua they form significant minority in terms of absolute numbers brazil has the largest afrodescendant population outside of africa in 2000 45 of braz ilians identified themselves as black or mulatto as compared to 13 of us citizens who identified themselves as africanamerican 9 g10g146g156g157g152g155g162g561 the vast majority of afrolatinos descend from the millions of slaves brought by european traders from the west african coast who survived the middle passage to the americas some historians have stated that the first slaves in the hemisphere arrived in virginia in 1619 and that the majority of african slaves ended up in the southern united states however historians now maintain that the first slaves arrived in hispaniola an island now divided between haiti and the dominican republic in the early 16 th century some 12 million or so africans arrived in the americas over the 400year history of the slave trade10 some scholars estimate that more than 50 of those african slaves ended up in brazil while only 5 went to the united states11 although many africans perished due to harsh working conditions and disease new slaves from west africa continued to replace them until abolition slavery was abolished in most latin american countries at or soon after their independence from spain in the1820s but continued in brazil until1888 5 behind closed doors the dominican republics color complex npr tell more july 16 2007 6 racism rampant in the dominican republic study finds efe news service may 3 2005 7 estimates vary as to the actual number of afrodescendants in each of the countries in question for example the cia world fact book estimates that while 38 of brazils population is mixed white and black only 6 is black some argue that racial discrimination and social exclusion affect blacks in brazil far more than they affect the countrys larger mulatto population 8 estimates vary as to the actual number of afrodescendants in latin america in order to arrive at the figure of 150 million blacks and mulattoes people of mixed

afrolatinos so too has the long but littleknown legacy of black rebellion and selfliberation marronage the first slave rebellions occurred in puerto rico 1514 and hispaniola 1522 by the 17th century maroons escaped slaves in latin america have been estimated to have numbered between 11000 and 3000012 maroons formed communities with sovereign territoriality in remote terrains with low population densities that now constitute the promin ent afrolatino areas of eastern and northern south america central america and the caribbean13 according to the brazilian ministry of culture there are at least 1098 quilombola escaped slaves communities in brazil today afro descendant communities in honduras and nicaragua are generally rural communities descended from escaped slaves who immigrated to central america from the caribbean in the 17th and 18th centuries many of those communities particularly the garifuna in honduras have developed distinct racial cultural and political identities based on communal land ties in areas that are geographically isolated from the rest of their countrys populations g5g158g155g155g142g151g157g561g21g157g138g157g158g156g561 although some countries with large afrolatino populations such as brazil and colombia disaggregate socioeconomic data by race most countries do not making it extremely difficult to find good quantitative data on afrolatinos despite these data limitations household surveys and anecdotal evidence from across the region point to correlation between african descent and political economic and social marginalization disparities between afrolatinos and the general population in latin america have persisted despit rising income and growth levels throughout the region 14 statistics from brazil colombia ecuador honduras and nicaragua generally support that finding15 g4g155g138g163g146g149g561 afrolatinos represent 45 of the population of brazil but constitute 64 of the poor and 69 of the extremely poor with respect to education 18 of afrobrazilians have completed secondary school as compared to 38 of those who selfidentify as white afrobrazilians have on average roughly five years of schooling whereas whites have completed nine years of school they earn on average some 44 less than nonblacks some 41 of afrobrazilians live in houses without adequate sanitation and 21 lack running water versus 18 and 7 of white households the maternal mortality rate of afrobrazilian women is three times that of their white counterparts afrobrazilians have lower life expectancies than whites 66 years as compared to 715 years and nearly twice the homicide rate of whites one study found that violence is becoming the leading cause of death for afrobrazilian men 16 12 ibid mayell 13 for comprehensive history of the african

some of the major issues affecting afrodescendant communities in latin america these issues include legal protection political representation land rights human rights and access to quality healthcare when applicable the section compares and contrasts the situation of afrodescendants to that of indigenous peoples indigenous peoples are generally descendants of the amerindian ethnic groups that lived in the hemisphere prior to the european conquest who retain distinct communal cultural linguistic or geographic identification with that heritage indigenous peoples have perhaps as result of their distinct heritage and shared history generally exhibited stronger sense of group identity and higher level of political mobilization than afrodescendants for example while the fi rst interamerican indian congress was held in mexico in 1940 the first largescale hemispheric meeting of afrodescendant leaders was held in 1977 and the first meeting of afrolatino legislators was held in brazil in 2003 some have argued that afrodescendant communities that have been able to prove their indigenouslike status have achieved more rights and recognition from their governments than other blacks in the region 22 others assert that it has been easier for the indigenous to achieve collective rights than afrodescendants as political elites in latin america have tended to award those rights on the basis of perceived possession of distinct cultural group identity not history of political exclusion or racial discrimination23 20 mary lisbeth gonzález allá promedios afrodescendientes

used international forums multilateral donors and diplomatic channels to garner support for increased rights and representation for their communities since 1990 these efforts have resulted in significant improvements in the formal rights accorded to their communities in relatively short period of time they have also been relatively successful in garnering international support for their movement including support from some administration officials and members of congress afrolatino mobilization efforts have been less successful in galvanizing grassroots support for racebased public policies or in ensuring that public policies are implemented or that laws are followed once they are created 24 the most salient challenges for the afrodescendant movement in latin america include increasing public awareness and group identification among afrolatinos while also ensuring that formal rights granted by governments result in meaningful improvements in the standards of living of their communities g18g152g149g146g157g146g140g138g149g561g138g151g141g561g14g142g144g138g149g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 g16g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g5g142g151g156g158g156g561 government may define race and delimit countrys concept of otherness by the categories it chooses to include in its national census in 1991 census brazilians used 100 different words to define their racial categories 25 in the early 1990s some analysts criticized the brazilian governments historic tendency not to encourage citizens to define their racial identity in strict categories they argued that ambiguous census categories inhibited the formation of advocacy groups and political movements to improve the status of afrobrazilians26 in 1995 fernando henrique cardoso assumed the presidency in brazil and under his leadership the brazilian government began to use fewer racial categories in the countrys national census the government sought to collect official statistics on afrobrazilians in order to assess whether specific public policies were needed to improve their socioeconomic status some observers have attributed brazils subsequent adoption of some affirmative action policies as positive byproduct of this census reform in 2000 encouraged by the brazilian example the world bank sponsored the first of two conferences on census reform for officials from national statistics bureaus across the region as result of these conferences and ongoing census reform all countries in latin america now include some sort of racial indicator in their national censuses many countries are also including racial modules in household surveys which will enable them to track the socioeconomic status of afrodescendants as compared to the general population

inequalities by developing affirmative action programs coordinating with other ministers and government entities and cooperating with the private sector and international institutions despite the

paulo brazil the use of quotas in university admissions nd government hiring programs has opened up vigorous debate on affirmative action in brazil that may spread to other countries in latin america although most brazilians favor governme nt programs to combat social exclusion and inequality they disagree as to whether the beneficiaries of those programs should be selected on the basis of race or income 35 several court cases in brazil have challenged the fairness of using racial quotas for university admissions some observers have stated that state governments throughout brazil have not budgeted the funds necessary to provide financial assistance and supplementary services for minority students admitted under the quota program 36 critics of affirmative action programs fear that they

the importance of land reform one type of land reform that has benefited indigenous and some afrodescendant groups has been ethnicspecific starting with brazil in 1988 and colombia in 1991 latin american governments began to recognize the historically derived land rights of some black communities notably maroon communities of escaped slaves descendants43 afrodescendant groups have in general been much less successful than indigenous groups in gaining collective land rights in central america only afrolatinos in honduras and nicaragua have gained the same collective land rights as indigenous communities for example the garifuna community descendants of escaped slaves from st vincent that inhabit the caribbean coast of central america won communal land rights in honduras and nicaragua by proving that their language religious beliefs and traditional agriculture techniques are inextricably linked to their notion of land and territory 44 in contrast afrolatinos w hose ancestors were brought as slaves have been integrated into the mestizo culture of central america and do not therefore possess the racialcultural group identity or specific relationship to the land that the garifuna possess even afrodescendant groups that have communal titles such as the garifuna are facing increasing challenges to their land titles especially in coastal areas as real estate developers seek to capitalize on the recent boom in tourism development some garifuna have also expressed concerns that 2004 honduran law granting land titles for individual and private capital

communities while some 61 million hectares of land have been granted titles under law 70 large percentages of afrocolombian communities have been forced off their ancestral lands because of the ongoing internal conflict some afrocolombian lands are being used by private companies in violation of law 70 to develop african palm oil 46 this practice has reportedly been accelerated by laws passed by the colombian congress to encourage commercial development of the countrys forests water and other natural resources in addition illegally armed groups have increasingly engaged in both

aid has not addressed afrolatinos as unique and specific category of beneficiaries aside from the unique case of afroc olombians afrolatinos are not treated in the aid program the way women in development arethat is as group requiring special attention including the need to enumerate those served in order to demonstrate and encourage progress rather insofar as afrolatinos comprise large pr oportion of the poor in latin america they are helped by the general assistance programs that serve the poor additionally some us agencies have to the extent possible developed interventions specific to the needs of certain afro descendant communities some assert that the united states has an interest in increasing assistance to afrolatinos and delineating clearer policy to address their needs these analysts argue that afrolatinos have set of problems specific to their situation that economic assistance is not yet adequately addressing three examples they point to include the dearth of data on the socioeconomic situation of afrodescendants the limited support given to afrolatino community organizations and the precarious nature of the land titles held and still being sought by afrodescendant communities proponents of expanded assistance to afrolatinos emphasize the need for the united states to support or encourage latin american governments efforts to collect better data on raceethnicity and socioeconomic status these proponents also are likely to support legislative initiatives targeting aid to afrolatinos and their commun ities especially capacitybuilding programs for afrolatino community organizations they believe that it is important to encourage usaid and other development institutions to include afrolatinos in the process of designing and implementing local programs finally advocates of increased support for afrolatinos assert that 56 according to news reports the election of barack obama as the first africanamerican president of the united states has raised hopes among some afrolatinos that us foreign policy and perhaps domestic policy in their own countries might become more responsive to their concerns see bradley brooks obama win resonates

organizers and elected officials and interested groups in the united states in addition to increasing bilateral aid programs ta rgeting afrolatinos some argue that the united states could take more active role in multilateral initiatives on behalf of afrolatinos for example the united states government could contribute as norway and great britain have to the idbs social inclusion fund for the americas or the us government might decide to support the interamerican convention for the prevention of racism and all forms of discrimination and intolerance currently being drafted by the oas others question whether increasing assistance to af rolatinos is feasible at time when limited development assistance is being allocated to latin america they point out that afrolatinos are already benefiting from development assistance programs targeting further assistance to afrolatinos through earmarks or other means might force usaid and other agencies to cut funding for other needy groups it may also increase the regulatory burden on development agencies by forcing them to gather statistics on new subgroup that is for reasons outlined in the section on identity in latin america sometimes difficult to delineate finally they argue that mandating the inclusion of afrolatinos in peace corps iaf or millennium challenge account mca portfolios for country may go against the priorities outlined by the agency or the country in question still others caution that race is sensitive issue for many countries in latin america and that the united states should proceed with caution when approaching this issue notions of race and national identity vary widely between the united states and latin america and within the countries of the region some maintain that it would be inappropriate for the united states to attempt to impose its views and policies with respect to race on other sovereign nations
