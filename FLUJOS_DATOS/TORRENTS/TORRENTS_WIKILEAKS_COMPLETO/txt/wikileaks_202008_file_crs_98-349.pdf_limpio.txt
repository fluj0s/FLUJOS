ackerman american law division updated october 1 2002 abstract on november 12 1998 the united states signed the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change this report addresses several legal questions about the protocol and its possible implementation namely whether the united states is now legally bound by the protocol the legal implications of signing it whether it could be implemented as an executive agreement without submission to the sen ate and whether the protocol could be used as the legal basis for regulation of emissions even prior to ratiÔ¨Åcationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs983491 tias ____ 1994 2 138 cong rec 3352127 oct 7 1992 congressional research service the library of congresscrs report for congress received through the crs

1998 the united states sign ed the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate chan ge the protocol had been concluded year earlier on december 10 1997 by legates from 161 nations and sets binding targets for reduction of emissions of gree nhouse gases by developed nations it cannot be legally binding on the us until it enters into effect internationally and the senate gives its advice and consent nonetheless signature of treaty does impose an obligation under international law to refrain from actions that would undermine the protocols object and purpose that obligation continues to apply until such time as the signatory ratifies the protocol or makes clear its intent not to do so signature alone does not implement the protoc ol nor does it provide lega l basis for the provisional implementation of the protocol by the us congress can however pursuant to its own constitutional authority adopt m easures which parallel or s upport the obligations of the protocol this report addre sses each of these legal issues and will be updated as events warrant 1 is the united states now gally bound by the kyoto protocol the kyoto protocol was negotiated as means of implementing the united nations framework convention on climate change1 to which the senate gave its advice and consent on october 7 19922 and by which the us is legally bound the framework convention set general objective of stabiliz ing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at levels that would prevent global warming and anticipated that the parties would adopt protocols to the convention in order to achieve that objective but such protocols must themselves be ratified by the participating states and meet their own standards for going into effect internationally before they can become legally binding in this instance the kyoto protocol has been negotiated and the clinton administration signed it on october 12 1998 and indicated its in tent eventually to seek its ratificationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98349crs2 3 kyoto protocol art 24 as of september 27 2002 the protoc ol had been signed by 84 states and ratified by 95 including japan france germany china india and the united kingdom the ratifying states produced only 371 percen t of the carbon dioxide emitted in 1990 however for list of the signatures and ratifications see the official website for the

third of the foreign relations law of the united states vol 1 1987 312 comment d at 173 hereinafter restatement 7 id 3123but the protocol has not been submitted to the senate for its advice and consent nor will it enter into force internationally until it has been ratified by at least 55 states that accounted for at least 55 of the total carbon dioxide emissions in 19903 moreover the bush administration has indicated that it does not intend to pursue ratification of the protocol both steps ratification by the us and entry into force internationally are necessary for the protocol to be legally binding on the us 2 what is the legal effect of the united states signing the kyoto protocol the kyoto protocol provided that it was open for signature from march 16 1998 to march 15 1999 and states that it is subject to ratification acceptance or approval4 the united states initially delayed signing as means of encouraging fuller participation in emissions reductions by developing st ates but on november 12 1998 it became the 58th nation and the last major i ndustrialized nation to sign signature in itself does not make the prot ocol legally binding on the united states but it does have at least three consequences first signature authenticates the text of an agreement ie it represents the assent of the negotiating states that given text expresses the agreement they have reached5 secondly it initiates the process by which the us could become legally bound that is signature of treaty is essentially political statement of approval and represents at least moral obligation to seek its ratification6 signature of the protocol thus is public declaration of the intent of the us to make it legally binding that is only the first step in the process however as noted above the protocol cannot become legally binding on the us until it is submitted to the senate the senate gives its advice and consent the president signs and deposits the appropriate instruments of ratification with the united nations and the protocol gains sufficient ratifications to enter into force internationally finally signature of treaty or protocol obligates state to refrain from acts that would defeat the object and purpose of the agreement7 article 18 of the vienna convention on the law of treaties states the matter more completely as follows state is obliged to refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purpose of treaty whenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98349crs3 8 vienna convention on the law of treaties exec l 92d cong 1st sess 1971 art xv iii 9 restatement supra comment i at 174 10

clear not to become party to the treaty or b it has expressed its consent to be bound by the treaty pending the entry into force of the treaty and provided that ch entry into force is not unduly delayed8 the united states has not ratified the vienna convention but recognizes most of the convention as representing customary internati onal law as practical matter however it is often difficult to determine what this obligation entails ie it is often unclear what actions would have the effect of defeating treatys object and purpose9 the restatement suggests that one criterion may be whet her particular action has negative and irreversible effect on what would be states obligations under treaty10 3 can the united states remove its signature from the kyoto protocol international law does not provide any procedure for nation to remove its signature from treaty however signatory state can eliminate the legal consequences of signature by making clear its intent not to ratify the treaty article 18 of the vienna convention quoted above states that the obligation to refrain from acts that would defeat the object and purpose of treaty applies only until such time as signatory shall have made its in tention clear not to become part to the treaty the convention does not prescribe any particular means by wh ich such an intention must be expressed however letter from the secretary of state to the treaty depositary in this case the united nations likely would suffice to do so the united states used that method on may 6 2002 to state that it did not intend to b ecome party to the rome statute of the international criminal court and therefore has legal obligations arising from its signature on december 31 2000 4 can the kyoto protocol be treated as an executive agreement for which senate or congressiona l consent is not required executive agreements are not mentioned as such in the constitution but their existence has been validated by historical pr actice and judicial decision11 while the full scope of the presidents authority to conclude and implement executive agreements remains subject of scholarly and political debate the senate appears to have anticipated the question when it gave its advice and consent to the fram ework convention on climate change in 1992 during the hearing on th conventi on the sena foreign relations committee propounded to the administration the genera l question of whether protocols and amendments to the convention and to the conventions annexes would be submitted to the senate for its advice and consent the first bush administration responded as followshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98349crs4 12 hearing before the senate committee on fo reign relations on the framework convention on climate change 102d cong 2d sess 1992 at

with respect to protocols gi ven that protocol c ould be adopted on any number of subjects treatment of any gi ven protocol would depend on its subject matter however we would expect that any protocol would be submitted to the senate for its advice and consent12 the committee also asked more specifically whether protocol containing targets and timetables for emissions reduc tions would be submitted the administration responded if such protocol were negotiated and adopted and the united states wished to become party we would expect such protocol to be submitted to the senate13 the senate did not attach any formal conditi ons to its resolution of ratification for the convention but the report of the senate fore ign relations committee on the resolution stated as follows the committee notes that decision by the c onference of the parties to adopt targets and timetables would have to be submitted to the senate for its advice and consent before the united states could deposit its instruments of ratification for such an agreement the committee notes further th at decision by the executive branch to reinterpret the convention to apply legally binding targets and timetables for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases to the united states would alter the shared understanding of the convention between th senate and the executive branch and would therefore require the senates advice and consent14 the committee made clear in other words its view that the final framework convention contains legally binding co mmitments to reduce gree nhouse gas emissions and its intent that any future agreement containing legally binding targets and timetables for reducing such emissions would have to be submitted to the senate the first bush administration concurred with that view and agreed to submit any such agreement that commitment was cited during senate debate on the resolution of ratification as an important element of the senates consent15 while these statements may not be as legally binding as formal condition to the sena tes resolution of ratification for the 1992 convention it is doubtful that any administration could ignore them 5 can the kyoto protocol prior to ratification be used as basis for regulations imposing emissions restrictions on industry as noted treaties generally are not legally effective until they have been ratified and have gone into effect internationally but on rare occasion in th past treaties have been given provisional application prior to their ratification ie measures have been taken to carry them

treaty in october 1997 and final ratification occurred in november see 143 cong rec s 11165 daily ed oct 23 1997 19 id ratification of the treaty was forestalled by the soviet invasion of afghanistan but both parties stated independently that they would obser ve the restraints of the treaty so long as the other party did so 20 the convention was put forward by th united nations general assembly as multilateral treaty in 1982 the us supported much of the convention but chose not to sign it or to pursue ratification because of objections to th deep seabed regime set forth in part xi to accommodate the us part xi was renegotiated in the early 1990s in order to allow the participation of industrial nations such as the us which had not yet ratified the convention in the policy making

application of revised deep seabed regime under the law of the sea convention20 nonetheless the provisional application of treaty prior to ratificati on remains an unusual occurrence for the us the provisional application of treaty is in essence an executive agreement to undertake temporarily what the treaty may call for permanently21 according to the restatement such an executive agreement

24 s res 98 105th cong 1st sess adopted at 143 cong rec s 8138 daily ed july 25 1997 the resolution further stated the view that any agreement which would require senate advice and consent should be accompanied by detailed analysis of its ec onomic impact and of any legislation and regulations necessary to implement the agreement 25 see eg 517 of the treasury department appropria tions act for

independent constitutional author ity to take control of and operate the nations steel mills to ensure continued production during the korean war was rejected by the supreme court the president claimed his action to be legally justified not only on the basis of an inherent power to protect the wellbeing and safe ty of the nation but also on the basis of the commanderinchief and executive power clauses of article ii of the constitution but the court rejected his claims individually and in the aggregat finding his actions to be usurpation of the lawmaking power of congresspresidents own constitutional authority22 but it also appears possible that authority can be buttressed by cong ressional or senate au thorization or approva l express or implied23 however there does not appear to be any clear legal authority that could be invoked to sustain the provisional application of the kyoto protocol the protocol itself does not so provide and the parties that negotiated the protocol did not otherwise agree to do so nor has congress assented t or otherwise authorized the provisional implementation of the protocol either expre ssly or by implication indeed the actions of the senate and congress have been decidedly to the ry on july 25 1997 for instance the senate unanimously adopted 950 resolution expre ssing the view that the us should not sign any agreement at kyoto that would commit developed nations but not developing ones to reduce or limit greenhouse emissions by certa in date or that would do serious harm to the us economy24 congress moreover has rep eatedly barred any expenditure of appropriations to imple ment the protocol25 finally it appears doubtful that the president could implement the protocol on the basis of his independent constitutional authority26 6 can congress enact m easures concerning global climate change absent ratification of the kyoto protocol nothing inhibits congress from enacting laws with provisions that might llel or support those in the kyoto protocol but the legal authority for those initiatives is congress constitu tional authority under article i 8 of the constitution such initi atives do not require th ratification of the protocol
