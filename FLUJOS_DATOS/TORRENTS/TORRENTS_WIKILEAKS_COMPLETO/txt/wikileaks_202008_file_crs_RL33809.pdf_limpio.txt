prospec tive immigrant had to be submitted as necessary by one or more re sidents of the united states in order to provide assurance that the applicant for entry would be supported in this country starting in the 1930s and continuing til the 1980s affidavits of support were administratively required by what was then the immigration and naturalization service ins but had speci fic basis in

the adoption of legislation in th late 1970s and early 1980s intended to make them more effective see the discussion of deeming of income and financial resources below 1996 immigration law reforms the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 iirira division c of pl 104208 coupled with the 1996 welfare reform law altered the obligations of persons who sponsor immigrants

in response to concerns about the unenforceability of affidavits of support and the perceived abuse of the welf are system by some newly arrived immigrants legislation was enacted in the late 1970s and early 1980s limiting the availability of ssi food stamps and aid to families with dependent children afdc to sponsored immigrants the enab ling legislation for these programs was amended to provide that for the purpose of determining financial eligibility immigrants who had used an affidavit of support to meet the public charge requirement would be deemed to have portion of their immigration sponsors income and resources available to them post1996 requirements the 1996 welfare reform law and the illegal immigration reform and immigrant re sponsibility act of 1996 significantly expanded the use of sponsortoalien d eeming as means of restricting the participation of new immigrants in federal meanstested programs15 both deeming and the affidavits of support upon which d eeming is based are intended to implement the provision of the ina that excludes aliens who appear likely at any time to become public charge the new deeming rules primarily set out in the 1996 welfare reform act are designed to make it more difficult for spons ored aliens to meet financial tests for benefits even if they pass the categorical eligibility test by being in an eligible class of noncitizen they apply to aliens who ente r after december 19 1997 the effective date of the new affidavit of support and w ho apply for tanf medicaid ssi or food stamps under these rules all of the income and resources of sponsor and sponsors spouse may be deemed av ailable to the sponsored applicant for assistance until the noncitizen becomes na turalized or meets work test16 previous law contained specific deeming requireme nts only for ssi food stamps and afdc tanfs predecessor only portion of sponsors income and resources was deemed to the sponsored applicant and d eeming lasted for

the immigration reform and control act of 1986 irca irca mandated immigrant status verification of applicants for afdc medicaid unemployment compensation and food stamps and required an individual who

irca specified that the federal government would reimburse the states and any other entity charged with immigrant status verification 100 of the cost incurred by implementing and operating the status

continuedaffidavits of support legally binding some policy makers use 213a as shorthand to identify who is covered by the deeming rules when iirira made an affidavits of support legally binding contract as discussed above it also directed the ttorney general to include appropriate information regarding affidavits of suppor t in the systematic alien verification for entitlements save system while congress did not specify exactly what information was to be included in the save system it did require the attorney general to establish an auto mated record of the sponsors social security numbers18 the save system enables federal state and local governmental agencies to obtain immigration status information to determine eligibility for public benefits the goal of the system is to aid eligibility workers in determining an applicants immigration status to ensure that only entitled applicants receive public benefits19 trends in noncitizen poverty and benefit use the eligibility rules for meanstested benefits are by design linked to income and poverty among other criteria eg citizen ship status and family structure this portion of the report analyzes poverty among the foreign born and follows with comparative analysis of benefit use for the four major federal meanstested benefit programs food stamps supplemental secur ity income ssi temporary assistance for needy families tanf cash assistance and medicaid noncitizen poverty levels one of the most comprehensive source of information on the foreign born is the us census bureaus march current p opulation survey cps the census bureau conducts the cps each month to collect labor force data about the civilian noninstitutionalized population the marc h supplement of the cps gathers additional data about inco education household char acteristics and geographic mobility because the cps is sample of the us population the results are estimates additionally while the data distinguish between the foreign born who have naturalized and those who have not they do not distinguish between types of noncitizens eg permanent temporary illegal20httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33809crs9 20 continued sample and by overreporting of naturalization by the foreign born most of these problems appear to have been resolved by 1996 21 for an explanation of how poverty vels are calculated see crs report 951024 trends in poverty in the united states by thomas gabe 22 for more background and analysis of legal permanent immigration see crs report rl32235 us immigration policy on permanent admissions by ruth ellen wasemgeneral trends the number of noncitizens who are poor has remained rather steady despite substantial increas in the number of foreign born over the past decade as figure 1 illustrates the total number of foreign born residents of the united states went from an estimated 245 million in 1995 to 356 million in 2005 and the number of those who were not citizens went from an estimated 166 million in 1995 to 217 million in 2005 during this same decade the estimated number of noncitizens in poverty defined as below 100 of the poverty level dropped slightly from 46 million in 1995 to 44 million in 200521 more significant to the eligibility for federal assistance programs the estimated number of naturalized citizens in poverty rose from 08 million in 1995 to 14 million in 2005 this shift among the foreignborn citizens nd noncitizens may be due to vari ety of factors including the aging of the naturalized population and resulting diminished earnings increased naturalization rates and the earning potential of newer higherskilled immigrants22 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 20050510152025millions source crs analysis of the cp s march supplements 19952006all noncitizen

despite being an increasing share of the total population noncitizens have diminished as portion of those below 100 of poverty from 1995 to 2005 yet nonc itizens remain poorer in comparison to their share of the total population there are variety of fact ors that contribute to this variation over time not the least of which are education and skill levels naturalization rates nd length of

that the foreign born were significantly more likely to use ssi but were not significantly mo re likely to use afdc or food stamps in afdc food stamps and medicaid noncitizens had higher partic ipation rates than the native born but naturalized citizens had lower participation rates than the native born however in the ssi program both noncitizens and naturalized citizens had higher participation rates than nativeborn citizens this finding was especially true among the aged population24 in addition to the elderly the other major subgroup of the foreign born using welfare appeared to be noncitizens from refugeesending countries while the 1995 crs study did not disaggregate refugees urban institute analysts did try to do so in senate testimony based also on the march 1994 cps

and citizens use of public benefits following welfare reform 199497 washington dc the urban institutethe urban institute continued to analyz the cps for noncitizen use of welfare and found changes in usage from 1994 to 1997 noteworthy among the principal findings of the later urban institute study were the following use of public benefits among noncitizen households fell more sharply than among citizen households betw een 1994 and 1997 34 and 14 respectively those noncitizens imputed to be refugees experienced declines 33 that were at l east as steep as other noncitizens despite the fact that most refugees continued to be eligible for benefits in 1997 noncitizen households accounted fo r disproportionately large share of the overall decline in welfare caseloads that occurred between 1994 and 1997 welfare usage among elderly immigrants and naturalized citizensdid not appear to change between 1994 and 1997 neither naturalization nor rising incomes accounted for significant share of noncitizens exits from public benefit use the urban institute analysis grouped use of ssi and general assistance in with afdctanf usage to measure overall welfare receipt26 latest findings more recently crs analysis of the march 2006 cps indicated public assistance usage was dow n generally from 1995 to 2005 for all four programs figure 3 cps data are selfreported nd generally understate the

these general declines in program beneficiaries are not evidenced c onsistently across the programs or among the three citizenship groupings as in th 1995 crs study this crs analysis focused on three categories of citizenship status nativeborn citizens naturalized citizens and noncitizens the benefit us patterns for naturalized pe rsons in the cps samples offer exceptions to the general trends as figure 4 presents while benefit receipt decreased in estimated total numbers for natives in all four selected programs the estimated participation of noncitizens rose in food stamps and medicaid and the estimated particip ation of naturalized citizens rose in ssi food stamps and medicaid the substantial increase in immig ration throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s is one of many factors that may be affecting these trends as are general economic and labor force factors and family structures27 as figure 4 illustrates the estimated percentage of the welfare recipients defined here as
