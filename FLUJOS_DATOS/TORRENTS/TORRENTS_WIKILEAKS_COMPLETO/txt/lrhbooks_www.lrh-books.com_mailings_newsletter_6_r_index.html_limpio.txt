machine thus it is of enormous importance that we understand something about the mind that we understand we are minds that we are not machines and it is of enormous importance that man attain at once to some higher level of freedom where the machine reaction of destruction may be controlled and where man himself can enjoy some of the happiness to which he is entitled l ron hubbard after the initial release of dianetics thousands came to see the author himself demonstrating dianetics techniques why should you know something about your mind question of similar magnitude would be why should you live science fiction writer once conceived world composed entirely of machines composed to point where the machines were repaired by other machines which in turn were repaired by yet other machines and so the circle went round and the machines survived he wrote this story from the fondest belief of nuclear physicists that there is only machine that man derived from some spontaneous combustion of mud that the soul does not exist that freedom is impossible that all behavior is stimulusresponse that causative thought cannot exist what world this would be and yet this world this pattern is the goal of the slave makers if every man could be depressed from his freedom to point where he believed himself but cog in an enormous machine then all things would be enslaved but who would there be to enjoy them not the slave maker for he is the first to succumb he succumbs to his own mechanisms he receives the full jolt of his own endeavors to entrap what would be the purpose of this world of machines there can be purpose worth contemplating which does not include happiness and experience when man is longer able to envision happiness as part of his future the man is dead he has become nothing but an animated robot without understanding without humanity perfectly willing then to compose missiles of such detonative quality that an entire civilization could perish and that the happiness of all could be destroyed in the experience of radiation an experience which might be considered digestible by an atomic pile but not by human being thus as we depart from the concepts of freedom we depart into darkness where the will the fear and the brutality of one or few matter how well educated may yet obliterate everything for which we have worked everything for which we have hoped this is what happens when the machine runs wild and when man becoming machine runs wild man can only become machine when he is longer capable of understanding his own beingness and has lost his contact with it thus it is of enormous importance that we understand something about the mind that we understand we are minds that we are not machines and it is of enormous importance that man attain at once some higher level of freedom where the machine reaction of destruction may be controlled and where man himself can enjoy some of the happiness to which he is entitled l ron hubbard this
