6108c23 shspec44 basics of auditing the constants of an auditing session are there you must start the session get all the rudiments in at sensitivity 16 we dont use the third of dial drop rule anymore now flatten the process you start and end the session to do this you need to have trs metering etc for pc to be in comm with the auditor it is necessary for the auditor to be in comm with the pc an auditor who would make invalidative comments or not get command across is not there giving session and isnt someone the pc can be in comm with so add to the in session definition that the auditor has to be giving session ie actually running session the way to run session is to run session the limitation on telling someone how to run session involves the amount of disagreement the auditor has with the forms and actions hes using to run the session ones disagreement with handling rudiments could be because of the relative ineffectiveness of the processes but one could also have far more fundamental disagreements eg that the pc shouldnt need auditing it works this way you using the elements of auditing could make anybody an arc breaky pc by running him with ruds out you could get lower scale pc and have propitiative pc if you have difficulty or disagreement with ruds you could produce considerable randomity the key rudiment is the ptp its sneaky because it doesnt necessarily fall at first the pc may have reality on something being ptp to him there is an interesting limiting factor on cases as result of auditing the pc goes into action in his life he then accumulates problems and now is being audited with ptps one of the primary characteristics of case gain is the pc going into action he may lose interest in auditing as result you could expect him to get more problems not less this is the same as with getting more withholds that is another indicator of case advance so dont be lulled by the quiet pc as auditing progresses he may well start having more problems which the auditor must not neglect the mitigating factor here is that as the pc increases his ability he blows these things faster if that isnt happening it must be because ruds are out an auditor who expects the pc to be doing something besides being pc is in trouble you must grant the pc his pc beingness its ok for him to have his case in session all pc is supposed to do is follow the session as given by the auditor this is what the auditor expects of him thats all if you grant the pc this beingness youll find auditing simplified because you wont expect him to report on how things are going or whatever its necessary for you to find out whats going on scientologists are understandably prone to run big oughttobe this is fine anywhere but in session the oughttobe gets joined up with probably is supposition which interferes with seeing where the pc really is at the pc could be in sweet old lady mockup but in the valence of space commander if the mockup is factual and the case isnt advancing the factual presentation must have some unknowns in it which must be in wild disagreement cases resolve on the isness of the case not on the oughttobes the isness of the case must be totally unknown if the case isnt resolving and its not what the pc is telling you that is causing his noprogress if you just keep auditing that you are in q and and you wont get result you should question the pc on the basis of what exactly are you complaining about what is the isness of it if something isnt resolving you havent gotten the isness of it the first isnesses you have are 1 session 2 ruds 3 what you are addressing on the case if youve got the isness of the session and the isness of the rudiments and the person continues to complain and you try to help them with certain isness its just probably and isnt the isness if it doesnt help rapidly the most trouble youll have is with ptp ld it can be tricky to get the isness of it we now have test to tell us if process is working anything except 2wc which is just to find out where the pc is at not the 2wc process but just staying in 2wc with the pc is process and you are committed to flattening what you started whether it was in model session or not whether its rudiment or anything else so youd better have good grip on what you start before you start it otherwise youll get unfinished cycles on the pc if you see this you could run prehav 13 on auditors but theres the liability of livening up levels which means youre running terminal which is in wild disagreement with the pcs case and livening up the whole prehav scale details on setting the pc up for goals running the second rudiment is the auditor ninety percent of the charge will be blown on routine 1a but to get the rest you could take up the subject of the auditor if these things are that important to case theyre all worth handling theyre preliminary to clearing as well as to the individual session
