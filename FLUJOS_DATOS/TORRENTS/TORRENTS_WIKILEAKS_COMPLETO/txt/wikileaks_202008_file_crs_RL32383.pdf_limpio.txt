10771 108 115 stat 611 permits each airport where federal screeners are currently deployed to request private scr eeners instead of federal screeners starting in november 2004 pilot program created by the act was established at five airports to examine the advantages and di sadvantages of private airport screening concerns have been raised however that the pilot program may provide too small sample and as currently implemented is too similar in design to the federal screening function to make valid comparis on of federal and private screening and that the pilot program airports may not serve as ideal models for future private screening systems also regulatory framework or guidelines currently exist for evaluating private screening proposals and ove rseeing private screening firms the transportation security administration tsa is currently working on these and expects to have preliminary information for airports on the programs implementation by midmay 2004 many airports have expre ssed interest in pursuing pr ivate screening options but believe that legal protections program flexibility to adapt to local needs and stable funding mechanisms are needed for successf ul implementation other issues to be addressed regarding private screening are related to how private screening entities will interface with federal av iation security functions such as intelligence gathering and data sharing and depl oyment of new screening t echnologies the effect of private screening on the security screening workforce is also critical issue since high turnover rates among screeners be fore september 11 2001 were key factor in the decision to create federa l screening workforce under atsa implementation of the security screenin g optout provision is likely to be an

statement of gerald l dillingham director physical infrastructure issues testimony before the subcommittees on transportation senate and house committees on appropr iations september 20 2001a return to private airport security screening background and issues regarding the optout provision of the aviation and transportation security act background particularly interesting facet of the aviation and transportation security act atsa pl 10771 is the security sc reening optout provision sec 108 that allows airports with the approval of th transportation security administration tsa to implement system using private screeners in lieu of federal screeners to inspect airline passengers and baggage be ginning in november 2004 specifically atsa required the tsa to fully deploy federal screening workforce within one year after enactment and permits airports to opt out of the federal screening program two years thereafter therefore airports w ill officially be eligible to opt out of the federal screening program on or after november 19 2004 what distinguishes the optout program is that it delegates the authority of deciding whether to pursue private screening to airport operators but leaves the actual oversight and contract monitoring responsibilities in the hands of the tsa the optout provision proposes shared responsibility between the federal government airport operators and private screening firms with specific roles and responsibilities for each to be formally defi ned in the tsas implementation of this program private screening systems have been in place at many european airports for some time and are generally regarded as being efficient and effective for example the us general accounting ffice gao reported that airport operators are responsible for screening operations at airports in belgium france and the united kingdom1 at many of these locations ai rports contract with screening companies to conduct screen ing operations while some airports in the united kingdom directly manage and conduct screening operati ons however successful implementation of the optout program in the united states is likely to be highly dependent on the specific policies and guidelines established by tsa to implement and manage the program c onsequently the implementati on of the optout provision of atsa is likely to be of considerable interest to congress as it engages in oversight to assess whether the program achieves its intended objectives or whether the program or its implementa tion should be modified through recommended policy changes or legislative actionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32383crs2 2 us department of transporta tion federal aviation administration study and report to congress on civil aviation security responsibilities and f unding december 1998 paul stephen dempsey aviation security the role of law in the war against terrorism us department of transportation research nd special programs administration 2003 screening contracts awarded under the optout provision w ould be determined by the tsa and federally managed by the ts therefore the optout program as defined in atsa does not eliminate the fede ral responsibility for security screening at airports or place airport operators or airlines directly in charge of security screening contract oversight thus the s ecurity screening optout program is not return to the operational structure for aviation security that existed before the passage of atsa where airlines were directly re sponsible for screening operations nor is it program that would place the responsibility for direct oversight of screening contracts in the hands of individual airpor t operators rather the optout program establishes federally f unded and managed contracto roperated framework for security screening at airports nonethele ss the optout provision affords each airport operator the opportunity to assume an ac tive role in deciding whether private screening operations are suitable for gi ven airport and provi ding recommendations for private screening operations in some cases airports may elect to take an active role in private screening operations by directly employing sc reeners and managing screening activities the optout provision as defined in statute offers such flexibility in the implementation of private screening operations at each airport leaving it up to tsa to decide if an airports proposal for private screening will meet the desired objectives without compromising security on the other hand while airlines are clearly major stakeholders in aviation security their input or involvement in implementing private screening operations role is not specifically addressed in the provision leaving it largely up to tsa to termine how airline input or involvement in the planning decisionmaking and impl ementation of private screening operations will be handled historical overvi ew of the role of airports airlines and the federal government in passenger screening the faa first implemented domestic passenger security screening at airports in the united states in 1973 requiring that airlines conduct preboard screening of passengers and their carryon items the air transportation security act of 1974 pl 93366 88 stat 409 specifically require d the screening of all passengers and their carryon baggage and required th faa to submit semiannual reports to congress detailing the effectiveness of screening procedures this policy of screening domestic passengers as well as passengers on international flights was implemented in response to the large numbe r of hijackings on domestic flights in the united states during the 1960s and early 1970s between 1961 and 1972 134 domestic flights had been hijacked in th united states most destined for cuba2 by the 1990s incidents of air piracy were vi rtually nonexistent in the united states nonetheless deficiencies in passenger preboard screening practices had been identified in several department

aviation security investigations and gao examina tions of airport security3 however based on the precipitous decline in domestic acts of air piracy after the implementation of passenger screening the faa and the ai rline industry generally viewed preboard screening as an effective deterrent against hijackings while the existing policy and airlineoperated system for screening passengers and their carryon items was generally viewed favorably by both the f aa and industry stakeholders the growing threat of aircraft bombing s spurred significant policy debate over aviation security practices in the 1990s following the 1988 bombing of pan am flight 103 over lockerbie scotland and other highprofile bombings of civilian airliners overseas the threat of aircraft bombi ngs was perceived to be the most significant and growing threat to aviation security and was the primary impetus behind efforts to revise aviation security policy in the united states in response to increasing threat of terro rist acts against airc raft congress passed the aviation security improvement act of 1990 pl 101604 this comprehensive measure responded to the national security risk of threats to aviation by increasing the faas role in aviation security intelligence and requiring the deployment of federal security managers to oversee airport security at all category x airports4 and other airports where the faa determined ployment of federa l security manager was needed to meet aviation security needs the statutory duties of federal security managers included the oversight and enfor cement of federal s ecurity requirements implemented by air carriers and airport operators including screening operations however the legislation did not addr ess or alter the existing system of airlinemanaged scr eening operations the federal aviation authorizati on act of 1996 pl 104264 110 stat 3213 required the faa to study and assess whet her and if so how to transfer certain responsibilities such as passe nger screening from air ca rriers to either airport operators or the federal g overnment or to provide fo r shared responsibilities between air carriers on the one hand and airport opera tors or the federal government on the other during the ensuing debate proposal s to either federaliz security screening operations or make airport operators responsible for s ecurity screening were both evaluated but were ultimately dismissed for variety of reasons5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32383crs4 6 as quoted in us department of tran sportation federal aviation administration study and report to congress on civil aviation security from the perspective of airport operators at the time placing airports in charge of screening operations introduced logistic complexities and diffusion of responsibility that they believe d would erode security and increase the risk of terrorist infiltration of the aviation system in 1996 richard marchi senior vice president for technical and environmental affairs for the airports c ouncil international north america acina speaking for his organization and the american association of airport executives aaae the two prima ry trade organizations representing airports in the united states summarized the airports collective position on airport involvement in passenger screen ing at the time stating that by interposing another controlling entity an airport or federal employee into the midst of the checkin process c ontinuity is lost and the suspect person andor their baggage would have the opport unity to evade security measures such as positive passengerbaggage match airlinemanaged screening works because single entity in this case th airline is responsible for controlling all aspects of that passengers screening process if airport or federal government employees were to become responsible for effective screening of suspect passengers andor baggage they would multiply the number of points in the system where there must be handoff of responsibility and in turn multiply the number of opportunities for miscue6 ultimately the faa elected to retain the system of airlinecontrolled screening operations while proposing increased federa l involvement in re search and acquis ition of screening technologies such as explos ive detection systems eds and regulatory oversight of screening companies both the airlines and the airports supported this evolutionary approach that maintained the status quo with regard to airline responsibility for conducting screening operations while increasing federal involvement in the deployment of screening technologies and oversight of screening operations under the federal aviation administra tion reauthorization act of 1996 pl 104264 the faa was directed to certify screening companies and develop uniform performance standards for screening operations to increase federal oversight of these activities however the faa was still engaged in the rulemaking process to implement these certification standards when the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 occurred thus up until the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and for about six months thereafter when the tsa assumed contro l over screening contracts the airlines were responsible for the pr eboard screening of passengers and their property however screening operations were typically carried out by private security firms under contracts with the air lines under this system there was lack of uniform standards for screening operati ons there were frequent incidents of poor job performance and high turnover ra tes were commonplace among lowpaying screener positions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32383crs5 7 federal aviation administration office of aviation policy and plans operations regulatory analysis branch apo310

screening companies providing screening at security checkpoints in different parts of the passenger terminal in 2000 the faa reported that the average hourly wage fo r airport screeners was 575 and not all screeners received additional benefits the faa further noted that average annual turnover rates for screeners ex ceeded 100 in many locations also at that time there were uniform standards for th selection training performance and certification of private screening companies and their employees8 s u c h standardization had been recommende d by the white house commission on aviation safety and security9 and requirement to certify screening companies and develop uniform performance standards was included in the federal aviation authorization act of 1996 pl 104848 five years later when the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 occurred the faa was moving forward10 many argue much too slowly with plans to establish the required regulatory regime for certification and oversight of screening companies however the terrorist att acks prompted the introduction and enactment of atsa which established federal airport security screening force within the newly established transportation security administration tsa during the 107th congress debate over the blishment of the tsa focused in part on the extent of federal involvement in screening operations whereas the houseproposed legislation hr 3150 s 1447 engrossed amendment as agreed to by house 107th congress would have only requi red those supervising screening operations to be federal employees the senate bill s 1447 107th congress proposed to establish federal screening wo rkforce within the department of justice the conference substitute that became the cornerstone of atsa consisted of the establishment of the tsa and the requirement for the tsa to assume existing screening contracts and convert to secu rity screening workforce composed entirely of federal workers within one year during

generally viewed their role in aviation security as significantly incr easing following september 11 2001 airports also recognized that this increasing responsibility and accountability for implementation of airport security progra ms would require close coordination and integration with the newly formed tsa who would serve in dual capacity as both the overseer of airport security programs nd the direct provider of security screening operations within the airport airport operators recognized the importance of shared responsibility for airport security between themselves and the tsa as articulated in the following statement by charles barclay president of the american association of airport executives aaae as we move forward it is clear that the tsa can and should do even more to turn to airports as partner in the st to develop and implement costeffective solutions to security issues airports are at their very core public institutions and therefore much different from the rest of the aviation industry which is to large extent driven by the need to show pr ofits the primary mission of an airport is not to make money but rather to serve the community and the national aviation system by encouraging competitive air service and ensuring safe and secure environment for the public as local governments airports have always been responsible for the safety and security of their facilities and the people who use them this will continue to be so rega rdless of the roles assumed by the tsa since we share the same mission as the ts with regard to security it is only appropriate that we develop cooperative and coordinated approach to solving problems12 while the airports advocated stronger partnership between themselves and tsa the airports never formally indicated that they wanted to take on more active role in managing or defining the na ture of passenger screening operations nonetheless atsa as enacted provided fo r future airport involvement in security screening in limited capacity i nvolving shar ed responsib ilities between the tsa and airport operators under the optout provision atsa also established pilot program to assess private

contracts where they are deemed appropriate airports perspective on the optout provision because airport operators have the option to pursue private screening under the optout program they have significant vested interest in determining the potential costs and benefits of doing so on the w hole airport operators are approaching the prospect of private screening under th optout provision with cautious optimism while the prospect of private screening appears to offer some foreseeable benefits the potential costs and implications of pur suing private screening operations are not yet fully understood since specific details of the programs implementation have been provided by tsa to date the acina has indicated that more than 50 airports are participating in its initiative to gather information and form ulate input for the development of the optout program it expects that 20 to 30 of these airports about 4 to 7 of all commercial airports with federal screen ers will pursue private screening options under the optout program as currently defined in law15 if airport concerns are addressed in tsas imp lementation plan or through legislation acina thinks that the number of airports looking to opt out could grow to 50 to 100 roughly between 11 and 22 of airports w ith federal screeners research by the reason public policy institute suggests that interest among airports in private screening under the optout provision may be even higher16 in interviews with 19 airport directors they found that nine 47 expressed interest in pursuing private screening and another fi ve 26 indicated that they may pursue privatizing screening depe nding on the specific details of the optout program developed by tsa of the five airport di rectors who did not express an interest in the optout provision three indicated that they believed the optout provision in atsa was too restrictive because it did not relinquish control of the security screening contracts from the tsa to the airport authority these directors indicated that they might be interested in an optout program that gave them more direct control over security screening contracts the rationale for considering opting out of the federal screening program from the perspective of some airport operators largely reflects their concern over the impact of federal screening operations on airport facilities and services as well as their perception of tsas effectiveness in ddressing local airpor t factors relevant to passenger and baggage scr eening operations security performance and

committee on transportation and infrastructure house of representatives april 22 2004 gao04505tservice at the airport this sentiment was reflected in the concerns of george doughty executive director of the lehigh valley international airport in allentown pennsylvania who was quoted as stating that the problem inhe rent in the federally controlled screening process is that you end up having federal agency sitting in the middle of your terminal esse ntially answerable to nobody17 in the current environment of heightened terrorist threat s and enhanced security measures airports view themselves as major stakeholders in aviation security policies because these policies and the manner in which they are implemented have the potential to significantly impact airport operations and passenger safety and service these impacts in turn reflect upon the perception of the airport by air travelers airport operators indicating an interest in opting out of the tsa federal screening program and implementing private screening contracts at their airports indicate four main objectives for doing so 1 increasing the quality of airport screening 2 increasing flexibility to handle local factors affecting security requirements 3 increasing the uniformity and consistency of security operations at the airport level and 4 improving customer service airports hope that the optout program as implemented will address these goals and the extent to which airports pursue private screening under the optout provision will likely be i ndicative of how favorably they perceive the tsas implementation plan for the opt out program with regard to these objectives in general most airports are curren tly taking wait and see position not committing to any particular course of action until more details of the implementation of the optout provision are provided by the tsa currently the details of the implementation plan are be ing developed but have not been released by the tsa the implementation plan is expected to be released by may 19 2004 six months prior to the effective date of the optout provision tsasponsored assessment of the ongoi ng private contractor pilot program in

cathleen berrick director homeland security and justice testimony before the subcommittee on aviation committee on transportation and infrastructure house of representatives february 12 2004suggested that the performance of both gr oups was below expectations while the gao concluded that the pilot program was not established in manner that permits meaningful assessment of any differences in performance between federal and private screening and the underlying reasons for these differences these findings are likely to be somewhat of disappointment to airports that were hoping to obtain meaningful data from the pilot study to assist them in determining whether private screening operations may be of benefit to them officially the acina has indicated that it supports an expanded optout provision20 the acina along with the aaae has identified four key issues to be addressed in implementing or potentially modifying the optout provision21 these include allowing for more direct cont rol over screening operations increasing flexibility in scheduling and deployment of screening personne l resolving airport liability issues and addressing funding for private screening first airports want sufficient flexibility in the implementation of the optout program so that they may choose to manage and conduct screening operations themselves rather than through contracts with thirdparty private screening firms the prospect of such an arrangement is particularly appealing to smaller airports which can increase staff flexibility if they have direct control over screening operations for example airports may be able to assign screeners to other duties such as airport perimeter patrols during lu lls in passenger traffic another option that airports would like to be able to consider is hybrid model where tsa screeners could be supplemented by private screeners during peak periods to meet needs for more flexible workforce it is unclear whether such an arrangement would be permissible under the existing optout prog ram however it is not explicitly excluded in statute along these same lines the airports also want sufficient flexibility in scheduling and deploying private screeners flexib scheduling could for example allow airports to adjust for local factors aff ecting passenger volume at checkpoints many believe that current scheduling of tsa screeners is far from optimal and screener deployment strategies are inefficient this may largely be due to tsas difficulties in hiring and retaining parttime screeners and establishing the right balance of fulltime and parttime screeners to staff screening positions22 third airports have expressed significant concerns over the potential liability exposure of an airport if it submits pr oposal for private screening under the optout provision their concern is that in the even t of security incident the airport could be exposed to significant liability because of its decision to pursue private screeninghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32383crs10 operations while the direct oversight of private screening would be handled by the tsa airports may have lia bility exposure because of their involvement in actively pursuing private screening opera tion and to some degree making recommendations regarding how that private screening operation is to be organized and implemented while formal pr oposal has been made airports may recommend amending the optout provisi on or adopting some other statutory protection that would indemnify or limit th liability of airports whose private screening proposals are adopted and implemented by the tsa some airport officials have suggested that such protection is cr itical for their consideration of the optout program finally airports have expressed continui ng concern over funding allocations for airport screening this issue extends beyond the optout provision to screening operations in general however exactly how private screening operations will be calculated into the allocation of security screening appropriations among airports remains to be deter mined airports are seeking an agreed upon index to determine funding allocations based on data such as numbers of origin and destination passengers numbers of checked bags processe d and local factors such as an airports physical layout and the number of checkpoint s and screening lanes the index will also likely need to consider projected growth in passenger demand at each airport and any specific airport projects that will sign ificantly impact screening operations over the course of fiscal year some possible options for congress besides addressing the concerns of air port operators through oversight of tsas implementation of the optout program nd possible legislative action to further define the program and addr ess the above mentioned issu raised by airports congress may engage in furthe r debate over the merits of the optout provision the fundamental issue regarding the degree of federal involvement in screening operations may reemerge during this bate consequently congress may debate options to repeal the optout provision or to amend the provision in manner that would limit its applicability on the othe r hand congress may consider options to expand or encourage participation in th optout program if it is believed that increased screening efficiency could be realized through private screening contracts without compromising the level of security provided by federal screening operations options for maintaining federal screener workforce principal consideration in the deba over the optout provision and more generally the debate over the appropriate federal role in aviation security is the extent to which screening activities should be considered inhere ntly governmental functions to be carried out by federal employees while this issue was an implicit central theme in much of the debate over aviation security following the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 it may be revisited by c ongress in evaluating the merits of the optout provision httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32383crs11 23 see for example congressional record senate november 17 2003 pp s14940s14952 24 zogby international results from october zogby america poll october 21 2003 washington dc the issue is related to ongoing debate over the appropriate federal role in critical aviation functions that affect safety as well as the security of the traveling public some members of congress advocated the need for direct government involvement in providing critical safetyrelated av iation functions durin g the debate over protecting air traffic controlle rs and other air traffic re lated functions from possible outsourcing to private entities23 in that case the argument for federalized air traffic operations focused on the fact that air traffi c controllers and othe r air traffic related functions provide safety cr itical services that in the opinion of some are so intimately related to the pub lic interest as to mandate performance by government personnel however the opposing viewpoint c ontends that the provision of air traffic services is commercial enterprise and has been privatized in other countries including canada australia and several european count ries as well as on limited basis in the united states under the federal contract tower progra m and at nonfederal air traffic control towers other safety critical workers in aviation such as pilots flight attendants aircraft dispatchers and aircraft maintenance workers are also the employees of private entities whose safetyrelated activities are regulated by the faa at armslength thus numerous functions di rectly affecting the safety and wellbeing of passengers are carried out by private entities making it possible to conclude that such activities may not nece ssarily be inherently g overnmental in nature in the current environment of height ened concern over threats to homeland security airport screening operations ar considered by many to have unique importance that is fundamenta lly linked to national secur ity objectives in fact one key argument for the federalization of ai rport screening functions following the attacks of septembe r 11 2001 focused on the recognition by some that screening activities had been elevated to level of strategic importance for homeland security that is screening operations were seen as critical front line measures to prevent further terrorist attacks against aviation assets and the traveling public as well as to protect citizens and property from additional suicide hijackings using aircraft as weapons of mass destruction from the vi ewpoint of those advo cating federalization of airport screening operations screener positions are seen as having critical role in homeland security that has been compared to the functions of customs and immigration officers particularly at larger airports among many there is an expectation that screening activities shoul d be performed by government personnel this sentiment appears to be reflected in public opinion for example one year after tsa assumed responsibility for screening pollsters from zogby international found that 69 of likely voters felt safer knowing th at the federal govern ment has trained professional screening workforce and only 5 indicated that they now felt less safe of those polled 47 indicated they would feel less safe if private screening companies like those who conducted air port screening prior to september 11 2001 were

security screening may seemingly be eligible to be classified as inherently governmental activities based on consideration of the critical role they play in the safety and security of the air traffic

administrations agenda to encourage competitive sourcing when appropriate stringent inte rpretation of what functions are considered inherently governmental has been adopted26 supporters of this viewpoint argue that this is also consistent with the fact that airport screening operations had been conducted by private entities in the past nd are conducted by private firms at many foreign airports from the administrations standpoint th determination that aviation security screening functions are not inherently g overnmental has already been made and is consistent with the current use

modification of existing statutes through legi slation either repealing or modifying the optout provision would be required if congress determines that maintaining federal force of airport secu rity

general found tsas financial oversight of private screening operations during the transition from airlinemanaged screening to federal screening operations to be significantly lacking leading to significant overcharges for screening functions and improper billing and time accounting by screening companies and their employees34 during this period tsa was under pressure to meet large num ber of

management agency and the defense cont ract audit agency for contract support and oversight of private screening contract s prior to the full deployment of federal screeners while similar problems have not been observed with tsas oversight of the pilot program contract operations currently in place at 5 airports the adequacy of tsas capabilities to monitor and audit contractor operations under the optout program may be an issue for congressional scrutiny this past experience indicates that developing comprehensive plan for the oversight of private screening contracts under the optout provi sion will be important if private screening options are to be ffective in addition to overseeing the development of tsas oversight plan for monitoring contract screening operations congress may also debate whether or not screening performance can be assured under system of federallymanaged contract screening operations if congress determines that it is in the best interest to retain federal force

congress may also consider proposals to establish stringent criteria for airports in order to be eligible for optingout of the federal security screening program options for increasing privatizat ion of screen ing operations on the other hand if congre ss determines that it is in the best interest for aviation security to expand private screening options it may do so in variety of ways one technique may be to offer specific incentives for airports to elect private screening options in lieu of federal screeners another option that may be considered is increasing the statutory flexibility of the optout program through measures that would provide airports with more direct control over the mana gement and oversight of security operations either of these options may work to increase the attractiveness of the optout program to airports more aggr essive options may include abandoning the optout provision which currently requires each airport to submit pr oposal to tsa for establishing nonfederal screening system at their airport and instead establishing compre hensive systemwide privatization program for airport screening at ll commercial passenger airports while formal proposals to expand the federal screenin g optout provision of atsa have be offered to date such options may be considered once fu rther details of the optout program implementation are made available one group of airports that may be able to utilize private screeners to implement passenger screening where there currently is none are those airports with infrequent commercial flights using small aircraft with 60 or fewer passenger seats while atsa specifically requires preboard screening of all passengers on air carrier flights tsas interpretation of this requirement has exempted certain airports that have limited number of daily flights using these small commuter aircraft consequently some of these airports do not currently have federal screeners35 at some of these airports passengers and thei r property are not screened at all prior to boarding and in other cases airline empl oyees may inspect carryon items by hand while these airports would seemingly be nefit from private screening operations as means to put in place costeffective physical screening of passengers and their property it is unclear if these airports would be eligible to apply for private screening under the optout program ce tsa has exempted them from federal screening requirements also since funding for screening operations at these airports is currently not budgeted additional budget resources would be required to implement private screening or for that ma tter federal screening at these airports congress may debate whether to explicitly include these airports without current federal screening operations among airports eligible for the private screening program and examine the costs needed to conduct private screening operations at these airports where federal screening is currently not budgeted for or implemented another potential benefit of private screening operations is that increased flexibility in staffing may make it possible to screen some or all airport workers

screening of employees with access to secured areas is currently not conducted while the specific security pr ocedures for airport workers vary from airport to airport and are detailed in each airports security program atsa did not address the screening of airport workers and existing federal statutes do not require the screening of these individuals even if they work in secured airport areas or have access to aircraft atsa only require s that these individuals undergo fingerprintbased criminal history records check some members of congress have raised concerns over the practice at some airports of allowing workers to bypass screening checkpoints and enter secured areas through employee access points where they only have to show their airport worker identification36 since there is statutory requirement for scr eening of airport workers airports could propose to use private contractors to screen airport workers as part of their security program and could implement such procedur if approved to do so by the tsa this could be done independent of the scr eening of passengers by private screening firms under the optout provision however the cost of implementing such program which is likely to come directly out of an air ports operating budget w ould likely make this option unattractive to many airpor ts if airports are able to leverage funds for private screening under the optout program thr ough savings obtained from more flexible staffing of checkpoints redu ced overhead costs and so on then airports may be able to carry out full or random screening of airport workers with access to secured areas of the airport while minimizing the cost ssociated with screening airport workers another proposal that has been suggested by airport trade organizations is the use of combined screening force consis ting of both federal sc reeners and private screeners37 under such model airports may elect to augment or supplement core federal screening force with private screeners additional flexibility in scheduling private screeners may allow airports c hoosing such an option to address unique demand characteristics such as high volumes of seasonal traffic with parttime or seasonal screeners while the optout pr ovision does not appear to preclude such an arrangement the tsa and airports may seek clarification from congress whether mixedmodel of private screeners working alongside federal screeners is in keeping with the intent of the optout provision additional considerations for congress airport liability risk one issue raised by airports is their potential liability under the optout program the question of liability remains unclear and may need further clarification through gislation in essence an airport that requests private screening would have an indirect role in implementation of private screening the level of direct involvement of the air port authority would largely depend on the specific manner in which the optout program is implemented and the details of any specific proposal offered by airport au thority under the imple mentation framework established by the tsa some airpor ts may seek minimal involvement whereas other airports may want to direc tly manage screening operations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32383crs17 38 as move sparks hill debate over federalizing security congress daily august 8 2003 39 robert w poole jr improving airport passenger screeningwhile the degree of liability for screening failures may reflect the degree of direct involvement that an airport s in screening operations this may not necessarily be the case also it is unclear whether simply requesting private screening under the optout program would introduce liability risk for an airport this may depend in part on the level of specificity re garding private screening operations that will be required from airports by the tsa greater level of specificity may expose airports to greater liability risk if details of the proposed program are implemented an can be shown to have resulted in screening deficiencies the extent of liability exposure of an ai rport operator under th optout program is somewhat speculative since few details of the program are available however airport operators are likely to weigh liability risk as well as the availability and cost of insurance to guard against such risk heavily in their decision whether to pursue private screening under the optout provisi on airports may seek specific liability protections from congress although fo rmal proposals to amend the private screening optout provision to address liability protection have been offered to date exclusion of foreignow ned security firms one concern over the optout program is the statut ory requirement that secur ity screening providers under the provision be us owne d and operated firms at sa requires that private screening firms be owned and controlled by citizen of the united states so long as tsa is able to identify us firms with the capability to carry out screening operations at those airports seeking private screening this measure was presumably included in response to perceived inadequaci of airport screening firms identified in the aftermath of the ptember 11 2001 attacks several of the largest airport security firms in operation at the time were foreign controlled38 consequently these firms would not be permitted to resume private screening operations under the optout provision the reason foundation concluded that the current array of usowned security firms which includes three relatively large corporations and several smaller firms that once operated at five or more large to medium sized airports has the potential to provide screening at up to 10 of co mmercial passenger airports where federal screeners are deployed39 this capacity is likely to keep up with demand for private screening at least over the short term as it will take some time for tsa to review each optout proposal and implement transiti on plan at each airport as the optout program evolves it is likely that these existing usowned security firms would be able to grow their capacity to meet demand or new usowned entities could emerge however there may be other reasons why congress may reconsider the prohibition on foreign ownership of secu rity screening entities under the optout provision some priva tization

benefits offered to private screeners to ensure that statutory obligations are being met and if not to correct any deficiencies another issue that may be debated in congress is the potential impact of organized labor and collective bargaining activities on private screening operations while collective bargaining rights are given to most federal employees tsa screeners may not join labor organizati ons or engage in collective bargaining activities title 5 us code 7102 gives federal employees the right to represent an organized labor group be fore entities of the us government and engage in collective bargaining with regard to em ployment conditions the homeland security act of 2002 in establishing the department of homeland security established new human resources management system for

unions and engage in collective bargaining is presently matter under review by the federal courts the role of organized labor in private screening operations under the optout program may be an i ssue of particular interest to congress the tsa does not have any apparent statutory authority to prohibit private screeners under the optout program from unionizing and engaging in collective bargaining practices with their contract screening firm employers rather the specific tsa authority to develop standards for hiring and retaining security screeners appears to apply only to federal screening operations the tsas conclusion that the presence of organized labor and the need for collective bargaining actions are incompatible with the need for flexible screening workforce may conflict with the possibility that private screeners could be unionized under the optout provision the tsa may seek legislative action from congress to broaden its authority to include setting employment standards for private screeners as well as for federal screeners on the other hand congress may debate whether federa l screeners as well as private screeners should be allowed to join unions and engage in collective bargaining as their private screening count erparts will presumably be able to do under current statute this issue may rise to significance as the optout program evolves particularly if morale and esprit corp s among federal screeners declines because of perceived imbalance in their employment rights compared to private screeners the potential for such an effect may be heig htened if

who voluntarily elected to apply for private screening under the pilot program theref ore there was process to select representative sample of airports for participation in the pilot program because of the limited scope of the pilo t program observations and statistical conclusions regarding the program are open to criticism regardless of what they indicate as advocates for expanding the pilot program have pointed out findings from the current pilot program may be sk ewed by confounding local factors for given airport or given security contractor and may not be repr esentative of private screening operations in general for this reason an expanded pilot program consisting of 510 percent of commercial passenger airports was originally advocated as means for pr oviding more meaningful basis for evaluating private screening programs48 however as mandated the p ilot program consists of only 5 airports this is not to say that assessments of the pilot program airports cannot reveal valuable insights and data to assist airpor ts in identifying many of the pros and cons of private screening operations and perhaps identify certain elements of private screening operations that may be useful in developing proposals for participation in the optout program the pilot program ai rports may serve as insightful case studies for assessing private screening operations and comparing them

screening process thus eliminating the need for screeners to handle the baggage thereby improving efficiency and throughput despite these efforts the gao concl uded that the tsa provided private screening contractors in the pilot program with only limited operational flexibility51 in those limited instances where private screening firms were given some latitude inoperational aspects practices adopted by private screening companies sometimes enabled them to achieve additional efficiency besides the aforementioned use of baggage handlers to improve the efficien cy of baggage screening the gao also noted the use of assessment centers to pr escreen screener applicants and the selection of screening supervisors from within the screener workforce rather than from tsa hiring assessments as additi onal examples of flexible operational practices nonetheless gao concluded that the tsa provided the screening contractors with little opportun ity to demonstrate innovati ons achieve efficiencies and implement initiatives that go bey ond the minimum requirement of atsa 52 in general the tsasponsored compar ative evaluation of the pp5 program found few notable differences between privat screening and federal screening the evaluation compared private screening opera tions to federal screening operations in terms of effectiveness cost and custom er and stakeholder impact in terms of screening effectiveness private sc reening was found to be essentially indistinguishable from federal screening private screening costs were found to be on par with what federal screening would have been expected to cost had it been implemented instead at the five pilot program airports there was slight trend indicating the private screening may be more cost advantageous at larger airports like sfo and mci and less cost effective at sma ller airports like tup however these results were within the margin of error and therefore were inconclusive also it is important to reiterate that only one airport per risk category was examined in the pilot program so airport unique characteristics affecting cost limit the ability to generalize these findings for example the higher costs of private screening at tup were largely attributable to the contractor operating with screening staff that was larger than predicted for federal operation us ing information about staffing patterns at other category iv airports finally in rms of customer satisf action and stakeholder impact there were mixed results for the larger airports sfo and mci both of these airports had significantly shorter wait times than comparable airports with federal screening howeve r while overall customer satisfaction at sfo was better than at comparable airports with federal screeners customer satisfaction at mci was lower than at comparable airports with federal screeners satisfaction data were nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32383crs24 available for the category ii iii and iv airports there were significant differences in the number of complaints between pilot program airports and the comparison airports with federal screeners therefore in general the pilot program evaluation found little to distinguish pr ivate screening contacts from federal screening operations the failure of the evaluation to identify significant differences between the contract screening operations and federal screening operations significantly limits the usefulness of the pilot progra m to draw conclusions regarding the effectiveness cost and impact of private screening operations the failure to identify differences could be attributable to lack of sensitivity to detect differences in the methods used to evaluate the program furthermore in light of the aforementioned limitations of the pilot program namely its limited scope and the signifi cant constraints imposed upon pilot program contractors that limited program flexibility few if any conclusions can be drawn from these results furthe rmore the ambiguous nature of these findings may result in inappropriate conclusions by either advocates for privatizing screening operations or advocates for maintaining federal screening workforce on the one hand advocates for privatiz ing screening operations may highlight the lack of demonstrated differences in performance between federal and private screeners as an indicator that security effectiveness will be maintained under private screening contracts privatization advocates may also point to selected customer and stakeholder impact metrics such as decreased passenger wait times to emphasize potential efficiency improvements at privat screening airports on the other hand advocates for retaining federal screening workforce may emphasize the lack of differentiation between federal and private screening to argue that privatization is not necessary that is they may argue that given foreseeable benefits in terms of performance efficiency or cost privatizing screening operations is unnecessary and could cause unwanted interruptions and secu rity lapses during the transition phase neither position is supported by the results of the pilot study because the pilot study was largely inconclusive even in instan ces were conclusions could be drawn from the pilot study these results are confounde d by the limited scope and flexibility of the pilot program the failure of the pilot program to develop adequate metrics and methodologies for comparing federal and private screening poses significant challenge to the tsa to develop the framework for assessing screening operations under the optout program to meet the requi rements of atsa in manner that will be acceptable to congress and legally defensible comparing federal and private screening operations the optout provision of atsa requires the tsa to determine and certify that the level of screening services and prot ection provided by private screening entities meets or exceeds that provided by federal screeners this

considering private screening under the optout program is to establish security screening program that has greater flexibility to address local airport fact ors to better accommoda passenger demand characteristics throughput metrics at screening checkpoints while primarily concern for meeting passenger expectation and minimizing the socalled hassle factor associated with airport security screening also has direct implications for airport security long queues at screening checkpoi nts may pose security risks long waits may increase the pressure and demand on screeners thereby

the tsa to keep average passenger wait times at security checkpoints to under 10 minutes according to an august 2003 survey by the bureau of transportation statistics bts the systemwide average wait time was 14 minutes see table 3 however at indi vidual airports managers may place greater emphasis on other indi cators of the ability to meet passenger demand at security checkpoints for ex ample some airport managers may be particularly interested in keeping virtually all wait times below certain threshold such as 30 minutes that may correlate highly with missed flights passenger complaints or high levels of dissatisfac tion among passengers therefore airport managers may wish to examine data on 90th or 95th percentile wait times for example the bts data suggests that at least systemwide the 95th percentile wait times are about 30 minutes however these waits may be considerably longer at certain airports also some airport operators may wish to keep wait times relatively constant that is without much variation throughout the day and relatively constant across days to maximize the likelihood that passenger ex pectations will be t consequently some airport managers may be interested in looking at the variation in wait times as function of time of day or day of the week thus various criteria for passenger throughput which may vary from airport to airport based on local factors and

transportation bureau of transportation statistics another factor that airports will likely consider significant in evaluating the potential benefits of the optout program is the ability of the security screening program at the airport to meet growth in passenger demand over the past three years demand for air travel has declined however recent projections suggest that systemwide demand for air travel will surpass preseptem ber 11 2001 levels by 2005 and has already done so at some airports54 the ability to meet both current and future throughput demand at checkpoint s will be an importa nt consideration in implementing the pilot program while airport operators may look to the optout program as means to increase screener staffing flexibility to better match the daily weekly and seasonal flux in passenger vol ume at screening checkpoints they have expressed concerns over the possibility that the tsa may apply different methods for assessing screener staffing requirements at airports with private screeners screening performance one of the main criteria to be used by tsa in determining whether private screening program may be implemented at an airport is whether that program can assure adequa performance atsa specifies that the tsa must determine and certify to congress that the level of screening and protection provided under contract will be equal to or greater than the level that would be provided at the airport by fede ral screeners however gauging the effectiveness of screening ope rations at airports requires robust validated metrics to assess comparative performance among airports httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32383crs27 55 department of homeland security tr ansportation security administration air travelers security enhanced as tsa interc epts over 48 million prohibited items in first year including 1101 firearms press release march 10 2003in order to successfully implement the optout program tsa will likely have to develop system for evaluating private screening firms that is legally defensible in essence the tsa will have to demonstrate that they have the capability to measure and assess screening performance in manner that will certify to congress that screening operations at an airport with private screeners provide at least equivalent security as federal screening operations and if tsa takes adverse action such as termination of contract against private screening firm for failure to provide screening at level equivalent to federal screening operations be able to provide legally defensible data of sc reening performance to justify such an action to accomplish this tsa will likely have to develop means of evaluating screening performance at the airport level that has the sensitivity and validity to meet these requirements variety of screening performance metrics are available some of these metrics are discussed briefly be low and include data on confiscation of prohibited items at checkpoints results of covert testing at checkpoints and the use of computer projected images of threat objects to test screener performance using xray equipment while several metric s for evaluating screening operations are available none of the metric s alone are likely to be capable of providing complete and thorough comparative asse ssment of private screening operations therefore it is likely that composite assessment of screening operations using some or all of the metrics described below and perhaps others will be needed to meet the requirements of atsa to demonstrate that private sc reening operations are on par with federal screening operations and provi legally defensible justification for any adverse actions against private screening entities confiscation of threat objects while the absolute number of threat objects confiscated at security screenin g checkpoints has been touted by tsa55 these statistics do not reflect the effectiveness of security measures in place these metrics on the other hand illustrate the ex tent of the challenge faced by screeners and define the operational nvironment these metrics are limited because they do not and cannot provide any indication rega rding the relative rate of detection of threat objects at screening checkpoints si nce it is impossible to know how many of these objects may have passed through s ecurity checkpoints undetected also because the number and type of prohibite d items has changed significantly over time it may not be possible to establish meaningful comparisons for all types of threat objects while evidence that hard to detect wellconcealed objects are being identified and confiscated doe s provide some indication of screening effectiveness using this data to make meaningful comparisons over time or at different airports is likely to be extremely difficulthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32383crs28 56 us general accounting office aviation security efforts to measure effectiveness and strengthen security programs

tests to penetrate airport checkpoints with threat objects have ch anged over time in response to the need to make these tests more realistic and comparable to methods terrori sts may use to infiltrate these checkpoints direct comparisons can be made regarding the performance of private screeners prior to establishing the tsa and existing performance in todays aviation security environment prior to sept ember 11 2001 the faa relied heavily on the use of covert teams that they referred to as red teams to attempt to pass concealed threat objects through airport checkpoints since establishing the tsa covert sting has been conducted by the tsas office of internal affairs and program re view oiapr in november 2003 the gao noted that while over 700 covert test s had been conducte d at 92 commercial passenger airports since tsa assumed responsibility for passenger screening in november 2002 only small percentage of tsa screeners had been subject to covert test56 consequently it is unclear whether the results of these tests are representative of systemwide screener performance it is likely that additional baseline data on the performance of federal screeners subjected to covert testing will be needed before robust comparisons betw een federal and private screeners can be made on the basis of covert testing the gao reported that tsa planned to double its oiapr staff this fiscal year and co rrespondingly plans to conduct twice as many covert tests this year57 more recent analyses of covert testing by the dhs office of inspector general characterized screener performance levels during these tests as poor58 while specific test results are consid ered security sensitive information it has been reported that the current failure rate s are comparable to those observed in 1987 when screeners failed to detect about 20 percent of concealed items during covert testing59 however the tsa noted that the sting methods used at that time was in way comparable to current covert testing methods used by oiapr in fact major challenge in using covert testing to evaluate relative performance of private screening to federal screening operations is that covert testing procedures are likely to evolve over time in response to intelligence information gathered regarding new techniques for c oncealing weapons new weapon types and methods terrorists may employ to distract sc reeners as testin g methods evolve over time they longer permit direct comparison of performance from one test to another that is it would be impossible to conclude whether differences in test performance were attributable to changes in test procedures or actual changes in screening performance this limitation highlights key tradeoff that must be considered in designing covert testing pr ocedures or implemen ting other screening assessment tools this tradeoff is between implementing changes in evaluation procedures so that the opera tional relevance of those pr ocedures can be maintainedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32383crs29 60 ibid 61 transportation security administration aviation security system of system then and now on the one hand and maintainin g

overlay virtual computergenerated threat objects over xray images of passengers screened prope rty during normal screening operations tip was first fielded by the faa in 1999 the faa viewed tip as an important tool for evaluating the performance of private screening companies and it was to be an integral part of the evaluation of pr ivate screening companies under the faas proposal to certify those companies that plan had not yet been widely implemented when the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 occurred tip however was in use at that time on limited basis following the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 tip was discontinued as an operational performance tool over concerns that screener responses to tip images would increase delays in atmosphere of heightened security alert tip has now been reintroduced using greatly expanded database of threat images said to be more representative of concealment tactics that may be used by terrorists60 the tip database which cons isted of about 200 images befo re september 11 2001 now has 2400 images61 like the faa the tsa has ambitious goals for tip and sees it as an integral tool for evaluating screener performance tip is capable of providing valuable data on screener alertness and detection capabilities during onthejob xray monitoring of carryon items however tip is limited in its scope and provides data on only one aspect of screening operations for example tip does not provide data on whether proper procedures were carried out once threat object was suspected and flagged by the xray screener whether explosive trace detection etd systems were properly used to conduct secondary evaluations of suspected explosives and so on also tip does not provide any data on the screening of passengers themselves or their checked baggage it only provides data on th screening of carryon baggage methods for comparative evaluations as mentioned before the tsa is likely to face significant challenges in developing techniques to conduct comparative evaluations of private screenin g operations to ensure they provide the same level of security as federal scr eening operations besides developing composite index that captures all critical aspects of screening operations the tsa faces the additional challenge of establis hing representative baseline of federal screening performance against which privat screening operations can be compared there are essentially two ways that the tsa can compare private screening operations to demonstrate whether they provide security that is equal to or greater than the level of security that would be provided at the airport by federal screenershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32383crs30 62 us government accounting office aviation security challenges exist in stabilizing and enhancing passenger and baggage screening operations statement of cathleen berrickthe first method is to conduct what statis ticians refer to as timeseries analyses in timeseries analysis screening performance at specific airport could be examined and compared for the time pe riod when federal screeners conducted screening and the time period after private screening entity assumes screening responsibilities such an approach howev er can be problema tic because other aspects of screening or techniques for evaluating screening operations are likely to change over time and may confound the comp arison for example covert testing criteria may become more stringent tip imagery may become more complex passenger volume at checkpoints may increas and so on while mitigating factors such as these may be able to be identified the degree to which they impact metrics used to evaluate screening perform ance may be difficult to quantify the alternative approach is to compare screening operations at airports with private screening to operations at comparable airports with federal screeners this approach sometimes referred to as cross sectional comparison also has limitations regardless of how well airports are matc hed based on similarities unique airport characteristics that may impact the evaluation of screener performance may skew the results of such comparison while some unique airport factor s affecting security may be identifiable others may be difficult to identify for those factors that can be identified it will likely be difficult to quantify their impact on the aviation security performance metrics used for comparison because both time series and cross sectional assessments of screener performance may impose certain limitations on the ability to draw inferences regarding the comparative performance of private screeners compared to federal screeners combination of both techni ques may be needed to provide the most robust capability for conducting comparativ assessments of private screening contracts also prior to the implementa tion of private screening operations agreed upon policies and protocols for collecting and comparing screening performance data will likely be needed these protocols w ill likely be needed as soon as possible in order to allow for collection of adequa baseline data of federal screening operations the tsa is progressing toward such capability with the development of screening performance index that will provide systemwide metrics to evaluate and compare screener performance through p and covert testing results unit costs for screening passengers and baggage as well as customer satisfaction through assessments of survey and complaint data62 the adequacy of tsas procedures for comparing performance of private screening contracts to federal screening operations is likely to be an enduring issue for c ongressional oversight during implementation of the optout programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32383crs31 assessing comparative costs and allocating funding one of the main objectives of the secu rity screening optout provision is to provide for increased flexibility in work scheduling practices and deployment of security screening personnel and resources that can more easily adapt to the dynamic nature of airport operations thereby resulting in reduced operating costs the optout provision is constrained by statutory requirements that private screeners be compensated with pay and benefits identical to that received by federal screeners consequently private entities will not be able to redu ce unit labor costs compared to federal screening operations therefore any direct savings that will be realized through the opt out program will be derived from modifications to work scheduling practices reduction of ove rhead costs and so on two areas where private screening entitie s may look to reduce costs are through streamlining the process of hiring screen ers and implementing flexible scheduling practices flexible scheduling practices of private screening entities are likely to rely heavily on the use of parttime screeners however the gao reported that tsa has experienced difficulties in hiring new staff particularly parttime staff these difficulties in recruiting and retaining parttime screeners appears to be most acute in areas with tight labor markets and high costs of living and commuting which is generally characteristic of areas where the larger category x and category i airports are located the gao identified airport cation lack of accessible and affordable parking or public transpor tation and high living costs as the main factors contributing to tsas inability to hire new staff particularly part time staff at large category x airports since the largest direct cost savings that can be achieved by implementing private screening under the opt out program is likely to be though efficient use of parttime staff and increased flexibility in staff scheduling tsas current difficulties in meeting staffing needs suggest that doing so may be significant challenge especially at larger airports however even if private screenin g operations under the optout provision cannot realize meaningful savings in di rect costs for aviation security optout proposals may result in significant indirect sa vings particularly to airports airports are likely to see merit in the optout program if it can result in identifiable cost savings for the airport one factor that airports may consider for example is whether private screening operations can be conducted with reduced space demands reduced demands for physical space in the airport may translate to more space available for retail shops rest aurants and other revenueg enerating activities also airports are likely to consider whether private screening operations can improve passenger and baggage throug hput which could translate to adequately keeping pace with local growth in demand for air travel and improving passenger satisfaction with airport operations increasing the efficiency of screening operations could increase public confidence and consumer satisfaction with airport security thereby increasing the likelihood that they will choose to take flig ht from particular airport or choose air travel over other transportati on alternatives since these indirect cost savings arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32383crs32 63 correlation measures the degree to which two sets of numbers such as originating passenger numbers and screener numbers are related if the two sets of numbers were totally unrelated the correlation would be 0 if the sets of numbers were perfectly related the correlation would be 1 if the sets of numbers were inversely related that is if the values of one set decreased when the values of the other set increased then the correlation would have negative value thus correlation scores can range between 1 and 1

whether to pursue private screening program in 2003 30 million dollars were appropr iated for third party screening contracts these appropriations were made available in addition to an estimated 100 million dollars received in contract rec overies received by tsa that was made available for private screening contract s in fy2003 based on this data private screening contracts accounted for just under 5 of total tsa funding available for systemwide passenger and baggage screening in fy2004 screening pilots at the five airports were appr opriated total of 119 million representing about 381 of total appropriations for pa ssenger and baggage screen ing these appropriations appear to be roughly inline with the proportion of systemwid screening operations they account for originating passenger statistics actually show that appropriations for the pilot program airports may be slightly high er than expected given the proportion of originating passengers at these five air ports compared to the systemwide total however several airport specific factor s may account for this the number of originating passenger is the primary factor for determining screener workforce at an airport based on tsas modeling numbers for allocating federal screeners the number of originating passengers at an airport has correlation63 of about 097 with the number of screeners allocated to that airport indicating that this factor alone accounts for almost all of the difference between airports in terms of screener workforce and in turn operating costs for screening functions64 nonetheless unique factors among the pilot program air ports such as airport layout the number of screening lanes and other unique logistic factors may result in higher comparative costs that should be considered when draw ing conclusions about the relative cost of private screening compared to federal screening it is also important to note that some costs associated with administering and evaluating the pilot program may be included in the costs for private screenin g activities also the above discussion is based only on appropriate d funding levels and does not reflect comparisons of actual outlays for private screening compared to federal screening as part of the tsa contract to evalua the private screening pilot program bearing point and abt associates provided formal assessment of comparative costs by comparing actual costs paid for contract screening operations to estimated costs assuming that the pilot program airports had instead been staffed by federal screeners separate cost comparisons we re developed for each of the five pilot program airports and are presented in table 4 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32383crs33 65 us general accounting office aviation security private screening contractors have little flexibilityin general the cost assessment found that across the five pilot program airports private screening costs were about 35 less than the estimate d cost of federal screening however the difference in cost at each of the airports was within the margin of error so specific conclusions can be made regarding the relative costs of private screening compared to federal screening since there was statutory mandate requiring the private screening companies in the pilot program to provide wages and other compensation nd benefits at level that was at least equivalent to that of federal screeners it would have been unlikely to observe any significant cost savings for private screening especially since significant constraints were imposed on the program that limited flexibility in

identify elements of that process that may effectively be incorporated into the evaluation process being developed for the security screening optout program however the tsa maintains that the security screening optout program is not appropriately suited for exte nsive publicprivate cost comparison studies under the a76 process this is largely due to th constraints of the optout program that require

practices that can be incorporated into the security screening optout program the faas contract tower program may provide some interesting insights for private airport screening operations however the exte nt to which desirable attributes of that program can be incorporated into the secu rity screening opt out program is likely to be significantly constrained the faa c ontract tower program has been able to achieve significant cost savings as comp ared to similar federa lly operated nonradar air traffic control towers specifically the dot office of the inspector general found that contract towers were on average 79 cheaper to operate compared to federal towers66 however these cost savings have mostly been realized through lower per unit labor costs and lower sta ffing levels at contract towers by comparison since the security scr eening optout provision requires that compensation and benefits provi ded to private screeners be at least on par with that provided to federal screeners any cost savings will likely have to be realized through other means such as increased flexibility in work scheduling and extensive use of parttime screeners unlike the faa contract tower program where airports with low levels of activity and radar operations have been specifically targeted for participation in the program the security screening optout program is open to all airports regardless of passenger volume and security risk f actors also unlike the contract tower program where determinations regarding which airports should have contract towers have been made by the fe deral government under the security screening optout program it will be left up to individual airport operators and not the tsa to make the initial decision to pursue private screening as requested by the omb the tsa will not make any specific recommendations re garding what airports or airport characteristics may be best suited for inclus ion in the optout program rather the tsa will only provide information such as results of the pilot program evaluation to airport operators for use in their evalua tion of whether or not to apply for private screening operations unde r the optout provision
