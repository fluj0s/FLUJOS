g343g561g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 morning hour debates have been part of house floor procedure only since the 103rd congress1 they began on february 23 1994 for 90day trial period under procedures outlined in joint leadership unanimous consent agreement formally standing order of the house2 morning hour debates were created in part to offset the new restrictions on special order speeches that took effect the same day these restrictions such as ban on special orders after midnight and fourhour limitation on longer special orders scaled back opportunities for nonlegislative debate available through special orders 3 the 1994 agreement establishing morning hour debates for 90day trial period was later extended to cover the remainder of the 103rd congress morning hour debates continued in the 104th congress under slightly modified unanimous consent agreement the modification concerned the length and starting time of morning hour debates on tuesdays after the first tuesday in may see the days and meeting times section for more information an identical unanimous consent agreement agreed to on january 4 2007 governs morning hour speeches in the 110th congress4 g9g152g159g142g155g151g146g151g144g561g3g158g157g145g152g155g146g157g146g142g156g561 morning hour debates are not provided for in the rules of the house instead they are unanimous consent practice of the chamber the house gives unanimous consent to holding morning hour debates when it agrees to the joint leadership unanimous consent agreement governing these debates in the 110 th congress the chair refers to this agreement at the start of the morning hour debate period when he announces pursuant to the order of the house of january 4 2007 the chair will now recognize the unanimous consent agreement governs recognition for morning hour debates and establishes the days and meeting times for these debates for more information see later sections of this report during morning hour debates members must abide not only by the unanimous consent agreement but also by the rules of the house the chambers precedents and the speakers announced policies relevant house rules include those governing debate decorum and the speakers power of recognition house precedents discuss how the chamber has interpreted and applied its rules 5 there is not an established body of precedents for morning hour debates because these debates are relatively new feature of house floor procedure 1 under house rules xvii clause 1b member shall be confined to the question under debate besides morning hour debates oneminute speeches usually at the start of every day and special orders 5 to 60 minutes in length usually at the end of every day also provide opportunities for nonlegislative debate in the house 2 the house consented to this agreement on feb 11 1994 congressional record daily edition vol 140 feb 11 1994 p h542 3 these new restrictions were announced by the speaker on feb 11 1994 congressional record daily edition vol 140 feb 11 1994 p h542 4 congressional record daily edition jan 4 2007 p h 40 5 these precedents are published in several parliamentary reference publications for more information see crs report rl30787 parliamentary reference sources house of representatives by richard s beth and megan suzanne continued

g344g561the term speakers announced policies refers to the speakers policies on certain aspects of house procedure such as decorum in debate the c onduct of electronic votes and recognition for oneminute and special order speeches while the speakers announced policies do not govern recognition for morning hour debates the unanimous consent agreement governs recognition they do regulate television coverage of morning hour debates the speakers policies prohibit housecontrolled television cameras from panning the chamber during the morning hour debate period instead caption also called crawl appears at the bottom of the television screen indicating that the house is conducting morning hour debates 6

the house is not always in session that day the starting time and length of morning hour debates are established by the joint leadership unanimous consent agreement the house convenes for monday morning hour debates 90 minutes earlier than the time established for that days session for example if the house is scheduled to meet at noon the morning hour debate period begins at 1030 am the monday morning hour debate period can last up to one hour with maximum of 30 minutes of debate on each side the full hour is rarely used tuesday morning hour speeches on or before may 14 2007 take place in the same manner as monday morning hour debates the agreement provides however that tuesday morning hour debates may 14 2007 begin 60 minutes before the chambers meeting hour for maximum duration of 50 minutes with 25 minutes allocated to each side the different procedures for tuesday morning debates after early may were first established in the joint leadership unanimous consent agreement of may 12 19957 these procedures which are included in the agreement for the 110th congress are designed to accommodate the chambers practice of convening earlier for legislative business after early may in the 105th congress the procedures were only on those tuesdays after early may when the house was scheduled to meet at 1000 am8 on tuesdays after early may when the chambers appointed meeting hour was later time eg 1200 noon the tuesday morning debates took place in the same manner as monday morning hour debates when monday and tuesday morning hour debates are completed the house recesses until the meeting hour established for that days session the daily prayer the pledge of allegiance and approval of the previous days journal take place when the house meets after this recess continued lynch 6 the speaker first announced this policy on jan 4 1995 the policy was extended to cover the 110th congress on jan 4 2007 see congressional record daily edition jan 4 2007

speaker list showing how each partys time for morning hour debates will be allocated among its members the chair follows this list in recognizing members for morning hour debates majority party representative appointed as speaker pro tempore often presides in the chair during morning hour debates during each morning hour debate period he alternates recognition between the majority and minority for both the initial morning hour speech ie if majority member is recognized for the first speech on monday minority member is recognized for first speech on tuesday and subsequent ones individual members must limit their morning hour debate speech to five minutes or less only the majority leader minority leader or the minority whip may deliver morning hour debate speech longer than five minutes g20g142g156g142g155g159g138g157g146g152g151g561g20g142g154g158g146g155g142g150g142g151g157g156g561 members reserve time for morning hour debates through their party leadership democratic representatives reserve time through the office of the minority leader and republican members do so through the republican cloakroom or the party leadership desk on the house floor reservations can be made earlier than one week before the speech date while most members reserve five minutes for their morning hour speech some representatives reserve as little as one minute g24g138g155g146g152g158g156g561g23g156g142g156g561g152g143g561g15g152g155g151g146g151g144g561g10g152g158g155g561g6g142g139g138g157g142g156g561 individual members often use the morning hour debate period to deliver speeches on subjects unrelated to legislation before the house they deliver eulogies and tributes to individuals and organizations from their congressional district they also use the period to deliver speeches on broad policy issues and to present their views on local national and international events because morning hour debates take place early in the day they are sometimes used by individual members and the party leadership to share information relevant to that days session for example members deliver morning hour speeches to explain bill they are introducing that day and to invite cosponsors the chairman of the rules committee has spoken during morning hour debates to announce an emergency meeting of the committee 9 this use of morning hour debates to disseminate information among colleagues parallels how members often employ oneminute speeches as visual form of the dear colleague letter on occasion members of the same party use the morning hour debate period to deliver series of speeches about the partys views on particular bill or policy issue for example on february 11 1997 four minority party members delivered morning hour debate speeches on campaign finance reform 10 this coordinated use of morning hour debates by party members is similar to how the parties sometimes use leadership special orders ie the first hour of longer special orders that 9
