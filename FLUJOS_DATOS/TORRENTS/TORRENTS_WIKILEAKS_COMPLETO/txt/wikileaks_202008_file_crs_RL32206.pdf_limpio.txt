this report was originally written by paul s rundquist formerly specialist in american national government at crs dr rundquist has retired but the listed author updated the report and is available to answer questions concerning its contentsparliament and congress brief comparison of the british house of commons and the house of representatives although the us house of representa tives along with many other national and state legislatures developed its initial parliamentary practices based on the model of the british house of commons the hous of representatives and the house of commons have long evolved along qu ite divergent lines this report1 briefly summarizes key features in the legislativ procedures of both chambers although systematic comparison would require substantially longer document the fundamental purposes of the ch ambers are different the house of commons serves as the forum for the formation and maintenance of the government which in turn is comprised primarily of ministers and deputies drawn from the majority party or block in the house of commons the house of representatives exists as legislative and oversight forum whose policy preferences may or may not coincide with those of the separately elected government that is the presidency and the rest of the executive branch in the house of commons the governments legislative agenda is consequently the agenda of the house of commons and few major policy initiatives not formally sanctioned by the govern ment are considered by the house of commons in the us house the signifi cant work of the session is the funding and continued maintenance of government programs but individual members and individual leaders can influence the house s agenda to degree unheard of in the commons terms of office and timing of elections under the parliament act 1911 the dur ation of parliament may not exceed five years from the date on which the curre nt parliament first convened in recent decades general elections have generally been held during the fourth year of parliament the timing of elections is mo st often determined by the government which announces the date on which general election will be held usually within 30 days of the announcement the government must also formally request the crown to dissolve parliament on april 5 2005 the government announced may 5 as the date for the general election the queen formally dissolved pa rliament on april 11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32206crs2 2 during the 2005 general election campaign candidate in one british constituency died the campaign was vitiated in that constituency and byelection will be scheduled to fill the open seatafter the general election on may 5 the ne wly elected parliame nt convened on may 11 to elect speaker and met again on may 17 2005 for the formal state opening of parliament and the queens speech by comparison the congressional elections occur on the tuesday after the first monday in november of each even numbe red year the dates of party primary elections to choose party candidates for the house of representatives are set by state law and generally occur in the firs t six months of the election year american national party organizations now often provide primary campaign assistance for favored candidates for the house of commons constituency committees composed of local party activists select candidates often far in advance of general election nati onal party organizations some times seek to influence the selection of the constituency committee but will generally bow to local preferences except when candidate is thought unlikely to support party policies in both bodies vacancies occurring between general elections are filled by special election the house of commons ty pically orders special or byelection to be held within three months of the date on which vacancy occurs special elections for the house of representatives are regulated by state laws which vary widely in the speed with which special elections are to be held in both chambers vacancies occurring n ear general election are allowe d to remain vacant until filled at the regular election sizes and c onstituencies various statutes have ofte n altered the size of the house of commons in the most recent parliamentary ections 2005 646 seats were contested of that total 645 members of parliament mps were elected each from specific electoral district2 at times parliament has set the number higher or lower as determined by statutory mandate in the parliament elected in 2001 th ere were 659 mps thirteen constituencies in scotland were consolidated to establish relatively similar levels of representation in english and scots parliamentary seats in england as many as 707 mps were elected before the establishment of the irish free state in the early 20th century and as recently as the 1950 par liamentary election the house of commons had only 625 mps the number of mps likel will change before the next general election due to proposed boundary adjus tments recently issued by the boundary commission for england described below the size of the house of representativ has been fixed by law at 435 since 1910 although temporary increase to 437 was permitted to provide seats for representatives from alaska and hawaii from 1959 to 1961 four nonvoting delegates represent us insular possessi ons and the district of columbia resident commissioner is elected for fouryear term from puerto rico these positions are without analog in the house of commonshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32206crs3 3 the number of constituencies and the bounda ries of individual constituencies may be changed on rare occasions separate from the periodic comprehensive review for example in 1990 the constituency of milton keynes about 30 miles northwest of london was divided into two seats because of rapid population growth therewith the population of great britain now slightly more than 60 million the average mp represents constituency of roughly 91000 in the allocation of seats an english constituency has more people closely followed by districts in scotland constituencies in wales and northern ireland are comprised of fewer people the average us house district has about 670000 people under the us constitution representative must be resident of the state in which the district he or she represents is located in the house of commons an mp need only be british subject but it is becoming increasingly rare for mps to have residency connection with their constituencies british mps must be at least 21 years of age while us representatives must be 25 and us senators 30 natura lized british subjects are eligible to seek election to the house of commons immediately while naturalized us citizens are eligible to serve in the house of representatives after seven years of citizenship and in the senate after nine in the house of commons majo r enactment in 2000 established an electoral commission henceforth th commission will be responsible for recommending changes in the number and boundaries of elector constituencies the commission must make recommendations every eight to 12 years concerning boundary adjustments based on reco mmendations from four boundary committees one each for england scotland wales and northern ireland recommendations from each of the committees are sent on to the commission which after reviewing and possibly revising them forwards them to the home secretary who submits them without change to parliament the new boundari go into effect at the next general election for the house of commons3 so long as congress does not change either the legal size of the house of representatives or the redistricting formul the reapportionment of seats allotted to each state on the basis of population is au tomatic following each decennial census with the state legislatures redrawing their house district boundaries in the event that state legislature fails to pass ne w reapportionment act responsibility for redistricting falls to the courts by co mparison the decisions of the british electoral commission when they become law ma not be challenged under any legal proceeding parties and their roles in the chamber in modern practice the prime minister is the head of the government and is always member of the majority party or coalition in the house of commons the cabinet comprises primarily leading hous of commons members of the majority although members of the house of lords have served as cabinet ministers in fact designating someone outside parliament as life peer has been one recent means of bringing someone essentially from priv ate life into the government cabinethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32206crs4 members are expected to support in pub lic the collective judgment of the government and their cabi net colleagues cabine t minister who cannot support major government policy is expect ed to resign from his or her post sitting members of the us congress cannot simultaneously serve in the presidents cabinet because such serv ice is an incompatible office under the constitution many presidents however offer cabinet appoi ntments to senior members of congress who resign in or der to accept such appointments the examples of norman mineta 2003 nd porter goss 2005 resigning from the house of representatives to accept appointme nts as secretary of transportation and director of central intelligence respectively are but two such examples the prime minister although head of th government and an mp is not the leader of the house of commons the l eader of the house of commons member of the government is the chief spokesman for the majority party on matters of the internal operation of the commons the office of the leader issues announcements of the impending house of commons sc hedule and routine inquiry from the oppositions counterpart serves as the ccasion for the leader to announce the business for the next two weeks of session the party whips in the house of co mmons have many more duties and powers than their counterparts in the hous of representatives in both bodies the whips are key communications link betw een other members of the party and governmental leadership and rankandfile members wh ip notices in both are sent to party members informing them of upcoming chamber action and scheduled meetings of party organizations however the british whip notices also inform party members of the relative importance of upcoming votes socalled oneline whip requests the presence of members in the chamber for certain action twoline whip announces the possible occurrence of division vot and threeline whip announces that member attendance is require d for matter of vital business such as vote of confidence or passage of the budg et absence or abstention on vote taken after threeline whip will almost certainly cause th imposition of some disciplinary action against party member this can include written reprimand from the party chief whip also communicated to the members constituency party organization temporary suspension from the party organization in parliament or withdrawal of the whip formal ex pulsion from the party organization whips also serve as sounding boards and recomme nding authorities for the appointment of committees in parliament and for the selection of mps for subcabinet positions or as spokesmen for the opposition in the u s congress disciplinary action for voting against the views of party leaders is rare although senators nd representatives may indirectly be sanctioned by denial of assignment to or leadership positions on important committees in the house of commons party or ganizations akin to the republican conference or democratic caucus meet re gularly to discuss policy and to provide an opportunity for backbench party memb ers to voice their views to ministers or shadow cabinet members in private foru m it is these organizations whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32206crs5 4 the

impartiality member of parliament upon election as speaker ceases his active membership in his political part and henceforth acts in private meetings with mps in manner which will not give the impression of party favoritism if the speaker stands at the next general electi on for reelection to the house of commons traditionally the opposition parties do not fiel d candidates to cont est his reelection the speaker is provided with his own personal residence in the palace of westminster and receives the same salary as cabinet minister when the speaker resigns or retires the crown traditionally elevates the former speaker to the house of lords traditionally one is called to the chair by ones colleagues in the house of commons speakers have had varied backgr ounds of prior service but most in the postworld war ii era have been backbenc h members or junior members of the whips office and not cabinet ministers the most obvious exception to this tradition was selwyn lloyd speaker fro m 1971 to 1976 who previously served in six different government posts including th at of foreign minister and minister of defence rare multiple ballot election was held leading to the choice of speaker michael martin in 2000 typically the f ather of the house longest serving non ministerial mp presides over the election of speaker informal discussions between party leaders backbench mbers and the opposition about suitable candidates have gone on prev iously based on these discussions the father of the house by prearrangement recognizes an mp who nominates candidate and another mp seconds the nomination the minee then announces whether he or she will accept the nomination in most cases the house of commons then votes to elect in 2000 an mp moved that mr chael martin do take the chair of this house as speaker before this moti on could be voted upon another mp moved to amend it by striking martins name and inserting the na of sir david haselhurst instead the house of commons then voted on the amendment and rejected it ten other names were put forth by way of amendment and each was rejected ultimately after more than seven hours of considera tion the house of commons chose martin as speaker by vote of 370 yeas and 8 nays with many abstentions the speaker traditionally has come from the majority party in the house of commons although betty bothroyd the firs t female speaker of the house chosen in 1992 was labor mp chosen in c onservativecontrolled house of commons the speaker is assisted as presiding officer by three deputy speakers and care is exercised to see that the four potential presiding officers come from both sides of the house of commons government and oppos ition the senior deputy speaker is also known as the chairman of ways and means who normally presides over the committee of the whole house for consistency and clarity the us equivalent is referred to in this report as the committee of the whole the speaker and deputies as well as the chairs of standing committees have substantial powers they can determine which portions if any of bill may be amended and have substantial discretion in limiting debate time unlike the house of representatives which tends to operate under the fiveminute rule limiting the time of speeches in committee and in committee of the whole formal time limitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32206crs7 5 in the house of commons the speaker may on rare occasions interrupt more formal vote and require vote in which members sta nd in their places and are counted by the chair the standing vote can be used instead of the house of commons more formal division when small minority has persisted in demandi ng divisions however division vote in the house of commons is certain to occur when demanded by major partyare imposed in the house of commons but the chair in the chamber or in committee in the house of commons can withdraw recognition from member who speaks too long or off the point it is not unusual for house of commons members to be informally sanctioned for speaking too long and it is customary for member to cede the floor after losing the attention of the commons quorums and voting in both chambers of congress quorum is always presumed to be present and few opportunities exist for delay by demanding quorum call in the house of representatives quorum is 218 members in the house assuming that seats are vacant and 100 members in committee of the whole the absence of quorum cannot be called to the chairs attention ex cept on the occasion of vote in the house or in committee of the whole the chair on his own authority can recognize member to move call of the house typically such call occurs before major action on the house floor or in committee of the whole to ensure that most members are present for example to hear closing speeches on major issue however the chairs discretion in these matters is absolute the house of commons has banned count of the house since rules change in 1971 quorum is always presumed present except that vote is official if fewer than 40 members participate if fewer than the requisite number of members vote the pending business stands over to the next sitting day and the next item of business on the daily agenda is imme diately put forward in its place in both the house of commons and th house of representatives voice votes automatically are taken and when the chai r is in doubt or member demands it more formal vote occurs single memb er may demand division standing vote5 in the house of representatives and in committee of the whole recorded teller vote in committee of the whole second of 25 members is requi red and the names and votes are recorded by the electronic voting machine or yeanay vote in the house of representatives second of 44 members is require d and names and votes are also recorded through the electronic voting machine recorded teller vote or yeanay vote is automatic if vote is objected to on the grounds that quorum is absent in the house of commons member who challenges the speakers or chairmans call on voice vote may demand division members vote by going into either the yea or nay lobbies where mbers names are taken down by clerks and the members are counted as they leave by two tellers one teller who has voted yea and one nay in each lobby who record the vote totals the vote totals in eachhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32206crs8 lobby are announced by the speaker or ch airman the names of mps and their votes are published in hansard the british equivalent of the congressional record as noted above if fewer than 40 members ente r the voting lobbies including the four tellers and the speaker or chairman w ho does not vote quorum is present and the question is put over until the next m eeting day whereupon it will be voted on again both the house of commons and the house of representatives attempt to reduce the amount of time consumed by vot normally division vote in the house of commons and recorded or yea nay vote in the house of representatives take 15 minutes in the house of representatives the speaker or the chairman of the committee of the whole may reduce to five minutes the amount of time for subsequent votes when num ber of votes are expected in quick succession the time for the second and subsequent house of commons division votes usually drops to between 10 and 12 minutes both bodies also permit votes to be postponed for the convenience of members in the house of representatives the speaker and the chairman of the committee of the whole have the authority to post pone any yeanay or recorded votes the chairman may postpone vot to more convenient time during the sitting of the committee of the whole and the speaker may postpone yeanay vote in the house of representatives for up to two session days most commonly the postponement authority relate s to votes on motions in order on mondays tuesdays and wednesdays to suspend the rules nd pass relatively non controversial bills which require twothirds vote for suc cess typically the speaker will postpone votes on suspension bills until tuesday evening or wednesday to permit members to remain longer in their districts without missing chamber votes in the house of commons if member presses for vote on business except for votes on bills or on amendments after 10 pm the vote is deferred until 330 pm the following wednesday at that time members may vote via written forms on which all the previously deferred questions are listed the forms must be submitted between 330 and 500 pm at convenient time thereaf ter the speaker announces the result of the votes sessional agendas in neither the united states nor the united kingdom is the precise duration of congressional or parlia mentary annual session known in advance in the house of commons typical annual session now covers about 150 meeting days out of these 150 days the chamber business on 20 session days is controlled by the opposition to debate such issues as the leader of the opposition may propose seventeen days are controlled by the prin cipal opposition party and three days by the nextlargest minority party although rrangements are some times made to provide time for still smaller pa rties the opposition may not bring piece of legislation before the house of commons on those days but can force an intense debate on significant policy matter in recent years the opposition has often chosen to force debate on two topics with time for each debate limited roughl to three hours thirteen fridays during each annual ssion are reserved for private non ministerial members business of several ways in which ordinary mps may presenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32206crs9 bills private members ballot is the pro cess most likely to be successful early in each annual session backbenc h member who is intere sted in introducing bill submits his name for drawing to determine which members will be permitted to bring in their own bill at the drawing supervised by deputy speaker and senior member of the clerks office 20 names are drawn the mps chosen will be able to bring in bill and to pick specific friday during the session for the first reading of the bill private member bills with crossbench bipartisan support obviously stand better chance of success in the legislative process another opportunity for backbench memb ers to propose legislation is so called 10minute rule consideration on tuesdays and wednesdays after early session business is completed members may offer motions for leave to bring in bill on specified subject only one member per day may be recognized for this purpose the member recognized is given roughly ten minutes to explain the purpose of the proposed bill and member ma seek recognition to speak against the motion in r ecent years the house of commons has agreed to allow bills to be brought in about 50 times annually it is extremely rare however for such bills to progress through the entir legislative process similar processes exist in the house of representatives legislative proposals coming from the white house must be introduced by member of the house of representatives often with the notation that the bill is introduced by request there is limitation on the number of bills any house of representatives member may introduce but chamber action typically occurs on these bills except for their automatic referral to committee at the time of their introduction the house of commons determines which bills it wishes actually to consider by comparison the house of representatives typically leaves such matters to its standing committees because the house will rarely consider measure if it has not first been endorsed by the standi ng committee to which it was referred committee systems the house of commons has developed several different types of committees each generally used for specific purposes standing committees the term standing committee could be misleading to american obs ervers because standing committee in the house of commons is not permanent but rather is ppointed for the consid eration of specific bill the term refers to the fact that committee members stand when they speak rather than sit around dais or table an allparty committee of selection recommends appointments to standing committee based on the subject of the bill to be considered and the re levant expertise or interest of particular mps from the different parties the committees debate the bills referred to them and may consider and dispose of amendments offered by committee members select committees parliamentary select committee comprises backbench members who typically serv on the panel for the duration of parliament select committees are typically oversight committees that review executive department operati ons there is generally one select committee for each department review inte rnal operations of the house of commons and reviewhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32206crs10 specified major policy areas for example regulatory reform human rights and public accounts the house of commons ccasionally decides to refer bill to select committee but the primary purpose of select committees is to gather information and issue reports to the house of commons few select committees are joint committees with members from both the house of commons and house of lords grand committees grand committees currently consider legislation dealing with scotland wales and nort hern ireland all house of commons members from the relevant country or province serve on the appropriate grand committee and limited number of additional mps may be named to serve since the passage of devolution legislation aff ecting scotland and wales and because of the 1998 good friday accords in northern ir eland the importance of the three grand committees has declined in recent years committee of the whole house the house of commons developed the concept of the committee of the whole nd its practice spread to the colonial legislatures and from there on to the us congress although the house of representatives routinely uses the committee of the whole to consider measures in detailed fashion and to pe rmit consideration of many amendments under tight time limitations the committee of the whole house in the commons has been less frequently used in recent years than in th past when the government submits the budget it does so when the commons is in committee of the whole house many routine measures are now considered in committee of the whole house rather than in standing committee in the house of representatives service on standing committees is relatively permanent and the chairmanships are always held by majority party members unlike the house of commons where chairs are llocated among all major parties the contemporary house of repres entatives makes relatively less use than it did formerly of temporary select committees created to study and report on specific subjects although select committees were created by the house in the 107th and 108th congresses to consider legislation related to the relatively new issue of homelandsecurity in the 109 th congress the house created the committee on homeland security as permanent standing panel the four joint committees in congress either handle internal administrative matters library and printing or study major policy issues economic and taxation the house of representatives widespread use of subcommittees is not matched in the house of commons typical floor action in the house of commons the major gislation of the session is controlled by the government when the government proposes measure it is introduced in the house of commons by the minister representing the department which will handle the administration of the measure if enacted this socalled first reading of the bill is typically done without debate and date is generally set then for second reading debate on the measure the concept of each bill having three readings which the house of representatives still follows in theory if not exact practice originated in the househttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32206crs11 of commons when it was difficult to provide printed copies of bills to all mps and when universal literacy among mps was not the case second reading debate is concerned with the broad principles of bill amendments are not permitte d and opposition spokesmen generally indicate their views oppose totally support with varyin g degrees of enthusiasm or oppose with intention to offer significant amendments and backbench mps also give evidence of their views on the pending measure division of the house can be had after the second reading debate as test of support for the concept it is extraordinarily rare for measure to fail second reading vote but large number of abstentions from government backbench members or even votes by them against the measure may signal major difficulties with the bill late r after the second reading bills are generally referred to standing committees in about threequarters of the cases or are committed to the committee of the whole hous about quarter of all government bills committee consideration of major bill in the house of commons can be protracted especially when committee members appear eager to recommend large numbers of amendments to it when the committee votes to report the measure back to the house of commons the government and the government majority must determine its strategy the government may decide to accede to all recommended amendments to its bill or may seek to overturn the committees recommendations on some or all amendments once the h ouse of commons has disposed of the committeerecommended amendments the commons agrees to the bill by agreeing to the motion to order third reading on the bill in the united states the first reading technically occurs when the house of representatives takes up the bill and the third reading just prior to vote on final passage formal second reading in the h ouse of representatives is now something of phantom reading the bill for amendment in committee of the whole could be considered second reading but in th at case bills not considered in committee of the whole are read only first and third time the procedural significance of these differences is not great in practical terms although in the house of commons passage of bill occurs on the motion to order the third reading while in the house of representatives ordering the third reading freezes the text of the bill and prohibits the offering of fu rther amendments prior to later vote on final passage the motion to recommit in the house of representatives can be offered after the third reading is ordered and before the vote on final passage the motion is an opportunity for the minority party if it so chooses to move to return bill to committee with instructions that the committee return to the house immediately with bill in the form demanded by the minority party this motion assures that the minority can obtain vote on its preferred ve rsion of major legislation and force the majority to go on record against its alternative there is direct analog to this process in the house of commons amendment rules and practices the amendment rules of the two chambe rs differ significantly both bodies recognize ban on thirddegree amendmen ts but the house of commons inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32206crs12 committee and on the floor bans substitute amendments those which strike an entire text and replace it with an lternative proposal thus an amendment in the house of commons can be subjected to seri of perfecting amendments which do not replace the text of the underlying amendm ent in its entirety in the house of representatives firstdegree amendment can have offered to it seconddegree perfecting amendment in addition s ubstitute amendment can also be offered which in turn can be the subject of conddegree perfecting amendments as well thus only two amendments may be pe nding simultaneously on the house of commons floor or in committees while as many as four amendments can be pending at the same time in the us house committee of the whole or standing committees bill considered only in the house of representatives and not in committee of the whole is considered under the onehour rule the member managing the bill is recognized for one hour and normally yields half of that time f or purposes of debate only to minority party member the manager will usually offer the previous question motion and unless that motion is defeated amendments can ordinarily be offered to the bill the power to select amendments is major power of the speaker and chairs in the house of commons and has precise analog in the us house limitations on the right of members to offer properly drawn amendments occur in the house of representatives and its committees only pursuant to rule from the rules committee under motion to suspend the rules and pass bill under provisions in an expedited procedure statute such as the budget act by unanimous consent or in the case of us house committees by internal committee rule ordinary limitations on debate in the house of representatives but not in committee of the whole the rules permit the offering of motion to order the previous question the motion is not debatable or amendable and if agreed to by the house of representatives by majority vote with majority quorum pr esent precludes any further debate and amendments on the pending issue and brin gs about vote on final passage in the house of commons closure motion can be offered at any time on pending matter but unlike the us congress the speaker of the house of commons can rule such motion out of order on the grounds that sufficient opportunity for debate has not been afforded the speakers d ecision is not subject to appeal the closure motion stops all debate and further amendments if agreed to and can be offered in either the house of commons the committee of the whole house or in standing committee in the house of representatives the comparable previous question motion cannot be offered in committee of the whole there motion to end debate is used and that motion if agreed t ends debate either on the pending section of the bill or on the bill in its entirety but does not preclude the offering of further amendmen ts without debate the moti on may be offered in form ending debate immediately or at specified future time under some circumstances additional limited debate may be permitted on amendments submitted in advance and printed in the congressional record but which had not been called up at the time debate was endedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32206crs13 allocation of time orders and rules from the rules committee in the house of representatives debate time is rigidly controlled members may be recognized to speak for more than one hour and typically this time is divided equally between the parties although th time permitte d normally is controlled in fiveminute the fivemi nute rule used generally for debating amendments blocks in the house of commons general limit on debate time exists although mps must speak without prepared remarks the house of commons speaker can take mps off their f eet if they stray from the subject under debate or lose the ttention of the house in order to manage the time for its deliberations the house of commons occasionally adopts extraordinary limitations on parliamentary practices these supplementary procedures are enforced through the adoption of an allocation of time order known more colloquially as guillotine quite similar in some respects to special rule from the rules committee typically these motions set time limit for debate at particular stage in the process and often also include specifications for completing subsequent legislative stages of bill or provide for the division of consideration time among the relevant parliamentary parties recently the house of commons has been experimenting with socalled programming motions these motions like those just described seek to set limitations and timetables for various stages of the legislative process and are established in response to pressure from backbenchers for more session predictability programming motions come from the committee usually programming subcommittee considering pa rticular bill they generally set date for the completion of committee consider ation of the bill and timetable for action by the commons to consider the committees report and steps to get to the third reading the programming motions are considered on the floor of the house of commons either without bate if the government ag rees to the timetable or if not with up to 45 minutes deba previously adopted progra mming motion may be revised by subsequent prog ramming motion considered under similar time limits in the house of representatives the rules committee performs more continuous role in structuring floor debate and amendments to pending significant bills the rules committee membership currently is set at nine majority and four minority members and its members are elected by the house of representatives upon the recommendation of the speaker and the minority leader
