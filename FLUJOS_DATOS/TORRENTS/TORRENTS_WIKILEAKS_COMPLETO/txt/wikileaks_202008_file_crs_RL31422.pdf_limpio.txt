2001 the term human cloning is defined to mean asexual reproduction accomplished by introducing nuclear material from one or more human somatic cells into fertilized or unfertilized oocyte whose

additional concern2 in july 2001 the us house of repr esentatives passed hr 2505 the human cloning prohibition act of 2001 the act would make it unlawful for any person or entity public or private to knowingly perfo rm or attempt to perform human cloning to knowingly participate in an attempt to perform human cloning or to ship or receive an embryo produced by human cloning or any product derived from such embryo3 the senate is expected to consider similar measure as well as bill that would prohibit reproductive cloning but allo w medical research including stem cell research to continue4

included riders in appropriations measures for th departments of labor health and human services and education that prohibit the use of appropriated funds for the creation of human embryos for research purposes or for research in which human embryos are destroyed5 in general the riders define hum an embryos as any organism derived by fertilization parthenogen esis cloning or any other means from one or more human gametes or human diploid cells6 federal funds for human cloning research have been similarly restricted in 1997 president clinton issued memorandum to the heads of the executive departments and agencies that addr essed the funding of human cloning7 the memorandum stated that fede ral funds would not be used for the cloning of human beings in remarks to the press presiden t

the fifth nd fourteenth amendments provide that person shall be deprived of life liberty or prope rty without due process of law11 the us supreme court has unde rstood due process to protect both procedural and substantive rights under th doctrine of substantive due process the court has held that certain rights while not expressly recognized in the text of the constitution are subsumed within the notion of liberty in the due process clauses one aspect of the liberty interest protected by the due process clauses is right of personal privacy or guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy12 the court has found that certain personal rights that can be deemed funda mental are included in this guarantee of personal privacy13 if the court determines that ri ght is fundamental any government infringement on that right will be subject to strict scrutiny strict scrutiny is the most rigorous form of judicial review applied by reviewin g court government action will survive strict scrutiny only if such action is narrowly tailored to achieving compelling government interest14 where there is fundamental right involved the government must show simply that there is rational basis for its action this level of judicial review referred to as rati onal basis review is characterized by its deference to legislative judgment because of the distinction between strict scrutiny and rational basis review determination on whether ther is fundamental right to clone is critical the courts recent substantive due process jurisprudence illustrates its reluctance to find new fundamental rights15 the court has indicated that it has always been reluctant to expand the doctrine of substantive due process because guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered area are

court noted that the due process clause protects those rights and liberties which are deeply rooted in the nations history and tradition and are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty such that neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed18 second the court maintained that careful scription of the asserted f undamental liberty interest is required in substantive due process cases19 the courts consideration of the nations history and tr adition in its substantive due process analysis could make it difficult to find fundamental right to clone some argue flatly that right to clone does not emerge from our nations tradition20 they maintain that cloning is radical ne w technology that is not deeply rooted in national tradition21 on the other hand proponents of fundamental right to clone have identified examples from the nati ons history that they believe support recognition of such right reproductive cloning in attempting to show that right to clone for reproductive purposes is deeply rooted in the nations history and traditi on proponents have refe renced the nations experience with reproductive technologies th ey have identified re ports of artificial insemination dating back to the 1790s to argue that assisted reproduction has been part of the nations history22 proponents also contend that the absence of state bans on in vitro fertilization ivf illustrate continued unwillingness on the part of state legislatures to prevent infertile couples from exploring new reproductive technologies23 the inactivity of state legislatures could provide support for recognizing historical acceptance of the use of new reproductive technologies in glucksberg the court discussed the existence of state bans on assisted suicide in almost every state before upholding s imilar ban in washington the court noted that the bans represented longstanding expr essions of the states condemnation of suicide the court engaged in similar discussion in bowers v hardwick 24 in that case the court reviewed the historical and tinued existence of criminal sodomy lawshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31422crs5 25bowers 478 us at 192 sodomy was

that the due process cl ause does not confer fundamental right on homosexuals to engage in sodomy25 in contrast the absence of bans on ivf could be offered to show lack of c ondemnation for the use of new reproductive technologies although states have not passed bans on ivf some have passed laws that prohibit reproductive cloning26 court would likely consider the existence of such laws to determine whether they reflect traditional and historical rejection of reproductive cloning however because onl six states appear to have bans on reproductive cloning it is possible that the cloning laws would be given less consideration than the assisted icide and criminal sodomy statutes27 while majority of states adopted assisted icide and criminal sodomy laws it seems that only six have adopted ba ns on reproductive cloning however those who oppose finding fundamental right to clone for reproductive purposes could argue that more states have not adopt ed cloning statutes because reasonable ability to clone was not established until 1997 thus comparison between the number of cloning statutes and the number of assisted suicide and criminal sodomy laws is in appropriate more over opponents would likely contend that the recent adoption of state cloning laws em phasizes that cloning is not deeply rooted in the nations hi story and tradition they would probably distinguish between cloning nd other reproductive technologies even if it could be established that right to clone for reproductive purposes is deeply rooted in the nations history and tradition of allowing the use of reproductive technologies it is not certain that such right is implicit in th concept of ordered liberty the courts past cases invol ving procreation c ontraception and other deeply personal matters suggest that cloning could be similarly included in the constitutional guarantee of personal privacy however some argue that because cloning is replication and not reproducti on the courts decisions on the right of privacy should have little influence28 the courts decisions on procreation nd contraception appear to demonstrate its recognition of such matte rs as fundamental in skinner v oklahoma the court invalidated oklahomas habitual criminal sterilization act which provided for the sterilization of criminals who have been convicted two or more times for crimeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31422crs6 29316

undamental to the very existence and survival of the race30 in griswold v connecticut the court invalidated connecticut law that prohibited the use or the aiding and abetting of the use of contraceptives31 the court maintained that the law offended the tions of privacy surrounding the marital relationship in eisenstadt v baird the court concluded that the right to contraceptives is also maintained by unmarried persons32 the court noted that if the right of privacy means anything it is the right of the individual married or single to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matte rs so fundamentally affecting person as the decision wh ether to bear or beget child33 this concept was explored further in carey v popul ation services international 34 in that case the court discussed griswold in the context of its decisions in eisenstadt and roe v wade griswold may longer be read as holding only that state may not prohibit married couples use of contraceptives r ead in light of its progeny the teaching of griswold is that the constitution protects individual decisions in matters of childbearing from unjustified intrusion by the state35 if cloning for reproductive purposes can be characterized simply as new form of childbearing the courts decisions coul d be instructive some maintain that cloning may be distinguished from trad itional reproduction only insofar as the genetic relationship between the parent and the child is identical rather than derivative and the child is conceived in vitro rather than in utero36 however others contrast traditional reproduc tion and cloning by recognizing that cloning does not involve the mixing of genes to produce unique individual37 instead cloning is characterized as genetic duplication38 despite the scientific di fferences between traditiona l reproduction and cloning it is possible that court would reco gnize cloning for reproductive purposes as implicating the same personal interests that exist with procreation contraception and childbearing in general for individuals that cannot reproduce in the traditional manner the availability of re productive cloning might seem to be instrumental in the decision of whether to bear or beget childhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31422crs7 39see note supra note 22 at 2362 see also sunstein supra note 20 at 9 40id 41note supra note 22 at 2362 42roe 410 us

note 9 at 661 47idrecognition of f undamental righ t to clone for reproductive purposes would require the government to demonstrate compelling interest to justify any infringement on that right scholars have identified at least two interests that are likely to be articulated first governme nt could contend that ban on reproductive cloning is necessary to prevent the concep tion of babies that would be plagued by physical disorders39 second government could argue that ban is necessary because cloned children would suffer social stigma and psychological harm40 concern over the physical health of clone d babies may be complicated by the courts decision in roe41 in that case the court found that the governments interest in protecting potential life becomes compelling only at the point of fetal viability42 thus it is possible that the government c ould not justify restriction on reproductive cloning by asserting the interests of pr eviable human beings however opponents contend that questions about viability nd fetal development should have impact on the governments interest in preventing disease and deformity43 if it is determined that there is not fundamental right to clone for reproductive purposes it is likely that the governments interests in preventing harm to cloned children would adequately justify regulation44 the articulated interests would probably survive rational basis review howe ver if fundamental right is found the outcome would seem to be less certain45 therapeutic cloning proponents of fundamental right to clone for therapeutic purposes have characterized the right as one of scientific inquiry46 they maintain that scientific inquiry has been an enduring american value47 in attempting to establish that therapeutic cloning is deeply rooted in th nations

right to clone for therap eutic purposes would seem unlike other rights recognized by the court in meyer v nebraska the court did conclude that the liberty guaranteed by the due process clause encompasses the right to acquire useful knowledge49 however the facts underlying that case are different from those involved with therapeutic cloning in meyer the court found unconstitutional nebraska statute that prohibited the teaching of any language other than english to students below the eighth grade the ac quisition of information by students may be distinguished from research or experimenta tion conducted by scien tists in fact in two lower court cases involving feta l research the courts found with little discussion that the rights of medical researchers are not fundamental under the constitution50 those who oppose recognition of fundame ntal right to clone for therapeutic purposes would also likely contend that th erapeutic cloning does not involve the kind of personal decisions that would suggest inclusion within the right of personal privacy unlike reproductive cloning which could involve fundamental childbearing issues therapeutic cloning does not implicate similarly personal matters for scientists and other researchers government regulation of therapeutic cl oning would likely respond to the belief that personhood begins at conception and th at the cloning of embryos is morally wrong51 this justification for regulation would appear to be sufficient to withstand rational basis review52 however if fundamental right to clone for therapeutic purposes is found reviewing court would likely undertake more searching inquiry and an outcome woul d be less certain
