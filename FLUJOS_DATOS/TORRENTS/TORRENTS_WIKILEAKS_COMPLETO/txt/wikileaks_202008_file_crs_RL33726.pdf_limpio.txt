of the law of the united st ates us and united kingdom uk relating to the authority to investigate terrorism1 it focuses primarily upon the procedures for conducting searches and seizures including the interception of communications arresting and detaining suspected terrorists and control orders restricting the activities of suspected terrorists2 the most obvious difference between the laws of the two countries is that in the uk approval of extraordinary authority including the issuance of warrants often remains an executive function and in the united states the task more often falls to the courts in addition authority in the united states only roughly approximates at best the power of uk officials to arrest and detain suspected terrorists and to subject them to control orders on the other hand us officials appear to enjoy greater flexibility in the use of intercepted communications for evidentiary purposes many of the differences can be understood in light of the reach of the fourth amendment to the united states constitution the fourth amendment condemns unreasonable governmental searches and seizures it applies where there is justifiable expectation of privacy3 and does not apply there is not4 it does not apply to consensual searches5 nor to the overseas search of the property of foreign nationals with substantial connection to the united states6 the amendment begins with the presumption that search or seizure is unreasonable unless conducted pursuant to warrant issued by neutral magistrate and upon showing of probable cause to believe crime has been committed7 there are many circumstances however in whic h search or seizure will be considered reasonable notwithstanding the absence of warrant or of probable cause or of both thus border inspections require neither warrant nor suspicion8 nor does procedure which allows officers to stop and search parolees9 incident to valid arrest law enforcement officers may search suspect without probable cause to believe the suspect possesses evidence or weapon10 they may arrest suspect without warrant when they have probable cause to believe he has committed felony11 and may conduct brief investigative stop with less than probable cause when given all of the circumstances they have particularized and objective basis for suspectingan individual is engaged in or about to engage in criminal activity12 when

the police and criminal evidence act 1984 16 which provides the police can stop and search and individual if they have reasonable suspicion that crime has been is being or is about to be committed statistics show that under the provisions of this act the police stopped black people six times more frequently than white people and asian people two times more frequently17 the police were provided with broader authority to stop and search people under the terrorism act 2000 that permits officers with authorization from senior officer to stop and search anyone to prevent terrorism 18 statistically asian and black people are respectively four and five times more likely to be stopped than white people under this act19 these statistics combined with the code issued under the police and criminal evidence act and the home office stop and search interim guidelin provide that while the police must not discriminate against members of minority ethnic groups when they exercise these powers there may be circumstances where it is appropriate for officers to take account of persons ethnic background when they decide who to stop in response to specific terrorist threat for example some international terrorist groups are associated with particular ethnic groups such as muslims20 this code of practice has given rise to the claim that the british police use ethnic 13 michigan

government and the police have actively worked to dismiss21 the government has noted that the enactment of the recent antiterrorism laws led to palpable increase in stopping and searching of people of asian origin in particular22 the government expressed concern that tensions with the muslim community in particular are not exacerbated because it is believed that the isolation and the stigmatization perceived or otherwise contributes towards the disenfranchising of muslims providing extremists with the opportunity to recruit these individuals an expert witness in panel reviewing the use of antiterrorism stop and search powers has noted one of the biggest dangers of counterterrorism policing must be that it will grow the very terrorism which it seeks to defeat 23 against this background in the wake of the london bombing in july 2005 the chief constable of british transport police btp publicly stated we should not waste time searching old white ladies searches are going to be disproportionate it is going to be young men not exclusively but it may be disproportionate when it comes to ethnic groups24 the government quickly distanced itself from this remark noting that inte lligenceled stop and searches should be utilized rather than stereotyping ethnic minorities25 because tackling terrorism is absolutely dependent on the confidence of these communities to feel that they can come forward give information and be part of the fight against this threat26 in the united states as noted earlier the fourth amendment permits parolees to be stopped and searched without warrant or suspicion27 and law enforcement officers may conduct brief investigative stop when given the circumstances they have particularized and objective basis for suspecting that criminal activity is afoot28 nevertheless invidious racial ethnic or religious discrimination in law enforcement is unlawful29 and the consideration of such factors standing alone and sometimes even in tandem with other factors does not generate reasonable suspicion for stop30 continued and search action team interim guidelines available at httpwwwprivacyinternational orgissuesterrorismlibrary

for abuse the act permits investigations into the resources of proscribed organizations and the commission preparation or instigation of acts that are offenses under the act police can arrest individuals without warrant based on reasonable suspicion that they have been involved in the preparation instigatio n or commission of acts of terrorism regardless of whether police believe the suspect is committing or has committed crime31 the government justified this preemptive power of arrest by stating that the delay in collecting sufficient information for an arrest warrant would in some ca ses be too late to prevent the terrorist act there are federal statutory provisions in the united states comparable to the british authority to arrest suspected terrorists under the fourth amendment the hallmarks of reasonable arrest are probable cause and warrant issued by neutral magistrate32 the amendment does allow warrantless arrests based on probable cause under some circumstances33 and permits brief investigative stops34 and border inspections35 without warrant and less than probable cause but there is nothing the equivalent of preemptive power of arrest36

the rights of individuals which now have extensive statutory protection under the human rights act 1998 37 with the security of the state the incorporation of the european convention on human rights the echr into the domestic law of the uk by the human rights act 199838 altered the legal climate of the uk and resulted in the specific prohibition of detention for the sole purpose of preventing crime being specifically prohibited save in certain circumstances prescribed by law 39 while the echr is not new doctrine of law but merely sets out the rights that individuals in britain have long

suspected to be terrorists without trial in northern ireland41 under the prevention of terrorism temporary provisions act 1984 pta42 the secretary of state could authorize the detention of person for up to seven days in 1988 the european court of human rights ru led that this was breach of article 53 of the echr unless it was judicially authorized resulting in the government derogating from that article in order to lawfully retain this provision of the pta43 the use of these powers was controversial and in response to increasing violence the result of the internment of almost 2000 predominantly catholic men was greater civil disturbances and diminished respect for the rule of law in northern ireland44 it was widely reported that the use of internment was among the best recruiting tools the ira ever had45 it was against this background and experience that the government had to decide the most effective least controversial and least likely to succumb to legal challenges in which to address individuals whom the government suspects to be international terrorists or threats to national security but whom it cannot deport this issue was tackled during the drafting of the ta when alternative options to derogation from the echr were considered it was finally decided that individuals could be detained for up to fortyeight hours after arrest without charge46 critics of the ta regarded this provision as providing for incommunicado detention and unnecessary because previously individuals detained under similar provisions were rarely charged with terrorist offense 47 despite this criticism the period of detention permitted under the ta has been extended by successive actsfrom fortyeight hours to fourteen days by the criminal justice act 2003 and from fourteen days to twentyeight days by highly contentious provision in the terrorism act 200648 the detention under this provision for an initial period of fortyeight hours is then reviewed by judicial authority and is then renewable for seven day periods up to maximum of twentyeight days with senior judge considering applications for detainment for the final fourteen days49 in order to continue the period of detention the judicial authority must be satisfied that it is necessary either to obtain or preserve relevant evidence or permit completion of an examination or analysis of any relevant matter with view to obtaining evidence the investigation connected with the detention must also be conducted diligently and expeditiously other areas of controversy under the detention powers are that police superintendents can impose delay on the detained person without notifying others of the persons detention or allowing them 41 prevention of terrorism temporary provisions act 1984 c 8

security were investigated after acknowledging the limits of the laws in which it could act64 the government considered various options to replace the preventive detention scheme including permitting the entry in court of intercepted or wiretapped evidence65 or entering into memorandums of understanding between the uk and certain governments to ensure that if the detainees were deported to their home countries they would not be subject to the death penalty or torture upon their arrival66 the government ultimately decided that certain aspects of the preventive detention scheme could be achieved through control orders that would apply to both foreign and british nationals and be supplemented by memoranda of understanding with monitoring bodies ensuri ng these countries compliance with the terms of these agreements in arriving at this decision the secretary of state reasoned that there are cases in which we remain unable to prosecute however that does not mean that we should do nothing to forestall suspected terrorists or to prevent them from planning assisting or otherwise supporting those willing to carry out attacks the government have therefore decided to replace the part 4 powers of the atcsa with new system of control orders we intend that such orders be capab of general application to any suspected terrorist irrespective of nationality or for most controls of the nature of the terrorist activity whether international or domestic and that they should enable us to impose conditions constraining the ability of those subject to the orders to engage in terroristrelated activities control orders would be used only in serious cases the controls imposed would be proportionate to the threat that each individual posed such orders would be preventive and designed to disrupt those seeking to carry out attacks whether here or elsewhere or who are planning or otherwise supporting such activities they would be designed to address directly two of the law lords concerns discrimination and proportionality 67 control orders were implemented through the pr evention of terrorism act 2005 with the aim of protecting the public from the risk of terrorism by preventing individuals named in such orders from becoming involved in or assisting terrorismrelated activity when prosecution of the individual for that activity or criminal offense is not possible68

involved in terrorismrelated activity69 whether domestic or international to restrict or prevent the further involvement by individuals in such activity70 the 2005 act provides for two types of orders those that do not derogate from the uks obligations under the echr hereinafter nonderogating orders and those that do derogate from the echr through imposing obligations that are incompatible with an individuals right to liberty hereinafter derogating orders 71 to create the most restrictive form of order which requires derogation from the uks obligations under the echr the secretary of state must file an application with the high court upon receipt of the application the high court must hold preliminary hearing which may occur without notifying the named individual or allowing him to make representations before the court to determine whether there is prima facie case to grant the order 72 the court has authority to grant an order at this stage if number of criteria are met including that there is material present that can be relied upon to establish the individual is or has been involved in terrorism related activity and it is reasonable to impose obligations on the individual to protect the public from the risk of terrorism73 if the court makes the derogating orde r in preliminary hearing it is then required to hold full inter partes hearing to either confirm revoke or modify the obligations of the order these orders can be made for up to twelve months at time and remade after that time period by the secretary of state provided the derogation from the echr continues the orders are tailored to the particular risk imposed by each individual upon the advice of the security service and can be modified to adjust to the changing risks that the individual might pose and subject suspected terrorists to conditions similar to bail or probation such as electronic tagging curfews restrictions on communications or the use of certain facilities such as the internet and from associating with other individuals 74 the obligations that can be imposed in the orders are not restricted solely to the activities that caused the original suspicion that the person was or had been involved in terrorismrelated activity but can be any obligation aimed to prevent involvement in any terrorismrelated activity75 there are many instances in which the courts hear cases without the presence of the individual named in the order or his legal representative76 if the individual subject to an order contravenes any obligations imposed by the order he can be 69 section 19 of the prevention of terrorism act 2005 c 2 defines terrorismrelated activities as one or more of the following the commission preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism b conduct which facilitates or

imprisoned for period of up to five years andor fined upon conviction on indictment77 the introduction of control orders was inevitably subject to considerable criticism notably that it was the biggest threat to the civil liberty of british citizens and extension of the states executive powers in over 300 years because in certain circumstances citizen may be deprived of their liberty without knowledge of the evidence presented against them78 individuals criticized the structure of the british legal system and questioned why the government did not remove the legal constraints that prevent the prosecution of individuals for existing criminal and terrorist offenses in the courts in the first instance such as restrictions on the use of intercept evidence in the courts the labour government responded to these suggestions by stating that an extensive review had concluded that the use of intercepted evidence would only produce modest increase in the number of prosecutions for serious criminal offenses but none for terrorists and argued that there is widespread misconception that if we could only adduce intercept as evidence we would be able to prosecute those detained however the review of intercept as evidence found evidence to support this the government do not intend to change the existing arrangements intercept provides only part of the intelligence against individuals it does not stand alone some of the material that we have in these cases is inadmissible and other material while technically admissible could not be adduced without compromising national security damaging relationships with foreign powers or intelligence agencies or pu tting the lives of sources at risk 79 due to the highly political and sensitive nature of the subject matter of the 2005 act as well as the circumstances in which the bill was pushed through parliament sunset clause was inserted that the provisions within the 2005 act governing control orders will expire twelve months after the bill was passed the secretary of state may after consulting with the person appointed to review the act the intelligence services commissioner and the directorgeneral or the security service lay an order before parliament that must be approved by resolution of each house of parliament to revive the act for an additional period of 12 months 80 to ensure that the 2005 act is not subject to abuse nor contravenes individual human rights without check the secretary of state is required to prepare report every three months concerning his use of control orders and appoint an individual to review the operation of the act the report is also to cover the implications on the act of any proposals put forth by the secretary of state for any law relating to terrorism as well as the extent of the secretary of states use of nonderogating control orders in urgent cases without the permission of the court 81 the system of control orders has already been bject to an adverse

ruling will not limit the operation of the act and we will not be revoking either the control order which was the subject of this review nor any of the other control orders currently in force on the back of this judgement nor will the judgment prevent the secretary of state from ma king control orders on suspected terrorists where he considers it necessary to do so in the interests of national security in future83 as of may 2006 there have been twenty one control orders issued and twelve remain in force84 the government continues to face the unenviable and difficult task of balancing the rights of individuals and maintaining democracy whilst prot ecting it inevitably any legislation aimed at preventing individuals from engaging in terrorist act rather than punishing individuals for committing such an act will be subject to considerab criticism it is not within the realm of traditional justice to punish an individual for an act not yet committed overtly the government has maintained that the threat it is facing is not traditional threat and its use of preventive measures is necessary to maintain order and national security from an amorphous threat the london times has criticized the uks use of these provisions by drawing parallel with totalitarian states that have traditionally resorted to house detention as way to silence dissent without the bad publicity of criminal proceedings so creating form of extralegal limbo that indicates guilt on the part of suspect without having to go to the trouble of obtaining conviction charles clarke has argued that house arrest is preferable to detention in belmarsh but that is only difference of circumstance not of essence 85 the home secretary has continued to reiterate the paradoxical challenge that the current situation creates and has stated that he is striving to protect national security and ensure the safety and security of this country in doing so i need to consider how we balan ce the rights of individuals against those of society how we ensure safety and security within democracy without undermining the values that are at the very heart of it 86 the united states does not appear to recognize procedure comparable to the uks control orders the procedure is reminiscent of the conditions that may be imposed either under federal bail laws87 or the laws governing federal probation88 control orders however are available when there is insufficient evidence upon which to base prosecution while bail is predicated upon arrest based on determination that there is probable cause to believe that the person has committed crime89 and probation is predicated upon conviction90 83 vikram dodd and carlene bailey terror law an affront to justicejudge control orders breach human rights

enforcement and the security services in the uk have broad variety of methods at their disposal to investigate crimes these methods include the interception of communications electronic data and various forms of surveillance the use of these methods are subject to lengthy and complex legislative regime contained in the regulation of investigatory powers act 2000 ripa91 the police act 199792 and the intelligence services act 199493 and supplemented by the protections in the european convention on human rights additional provisions are supplied in the covert surveillance code of practice and the interception of communications code of practice which the secretary of state is required to publish under the ripa94 the ripa regulates most forms of surveillance and the interception of communications in the uk it was enacted to update the laws on the interception of communications and brings them into line with technological advances the ripa was also enacted in anticipation of the effects of the human rights act 1998 which granted individuals an enforceable right to family life and privacy and in response to number of adverse rulings from the european court of human rights the european court of human rights f ound that the lack of regulation of surveillance activities was in breach of article 8 of the european convention on human rights echr because the interference with the complainants right to private life had not occurred with procedure prescribed by law 95 despite concerns over the lack of judicial involvement during the drafting of these laws the issuance of warrants in the uk remains an executive act with the government previously explicitly rejecting the suggestion that the issue of warrant should be judicial act96 in the united states law enforcement and intelligence agencies enjoy broad authority to investigate individuals and activities that authority however is limited by court rule and by statutory and constitutional safeguards designed to prevent unwarranted intrusions and abuse the authority includes the power to conduct searches and seizures 97 to intercept wire oral and electronic communications98 to demand access to stored

the uks ripa provides system of authorizations for three different types of surveillance directed intrusive and covert human surveillance103 all these forms of surveillance involve an aspect of covertness defined in the ripa as when the surveillance is carried out in manner that is calculated to ensure that persons who are subject to the surveillance are unaware that it is or may be taking place104 intrusive surveillance is defined in the ripa as covert surveillance that is conducted either by device or person in relation to events occurring inside private property or private vehicles and is the type of surveillance subject to the most stringent controls under the ripa 105 covert human intelligence occurs when source establishes or maintains any form of relationship with person to obtain or access information or to disclose such information covertly when the subject of surveillance is unaware it is occurring106 directed surveillance occurs when the surveillance is covert but not intrusive and undertaken for specific investigation or operation to obtain private information about person107 specifically such surveillance involves monitoring persons movements habits or activities by various means in order to obtain specific information about an individual or build profile of their character or lifestyle without entering onto the persons property 108 the ripa does not impose requirement that public authorities obtain an authorization under its provisions when they wishes to conduct surveillance109 however the code of practice on covert surveillance110 points to the obligations that the state has under the european convention on human rights to respect family and private life strongly recommending that an authorization be obtained the code notes that where there is other source of lawful authority the consequence of not obtaining an authorization under the ripa may be that the action is unlawful by virtue of the human rights act111 due to the unique and involved nature of directed and covert human surveillance specific requirements must be met before an authorization will be granted for covert human surveillance the requirements aim to ensure the sources security and welfare as well as to provide independent oversight that proper records are kept on the sources and that the identity of the 102 50 usc 1806k 1825k 1804a7b 1823a7b in re sealed

economic wellbeing of the uk in the interest of public safety for the purpose of protecting public health to collect impositions contributions or charges payable to government department or for any purpose as specified in an order made by the secretary of state laid before parliament and approved by resolution in each house114 warrants for covert human surveillance continue for an initial period of twelve months and three months for authorizations for directed surveillance115 as noted above there is requirement for public authorities to obtain an authorization under the ripa prior to conducting surveillance activities the home office has issued nonstatutory guidelines that provide only chief constables or assistant chief constables are entitled to authorize the use of certain equipment in police surveillance operations 116 the guidelines provide that authorizations should only occur when all of the following criteria are met the investigation concerns serious crime normal methods of investigation must have been tried and failed or must from the nature of things be unlikely to succeed if tried there is good reason to think that the use of the equipment is likely to lead to an arrest and conviction or where appropriate to the prevention of acts of terrorism the use of equipment is operationally feasible and 112 regulation of investigatory powers act 2000 c 23 295 113

the surveillance is commensurate with the seriousness of the offense117 the use of video surveillance by public authorities in public places has been subject to considerable debate amongst privacy scholars who consider that the installation of the extensive closed circuit television cameras cctv in public places across the uk has eroded individual privacy and is leading to big brother state118 there are currently statutory regulations on the use of cctv cameras although the home office has produced code of practice on their operation 119 the use of cctv and the images they record is subject to article 8 of the echr120 the european court of human rights has noted that the recording of the data and the systematic or permanent nature of the record may give rise to privacy considerations and the compilation of data by security services on particular individuals even without the use of covert surveillance methods constitutes an interference with the applicants private lives 121 when determining whether video surveillance has breached article 8 the courts consider whether the complaining individual had reasonable expectation of pr ivacy as an indicating factor whether the surveillance breached their human rights for example did the actions occur in public place or was the information processed at level high enough to constitute interference with the individuals private life or the material published in manner greater than could be reasonably foreseen122 the courts have noted that even though certain acts may occur in public there is zone of interaction in public context which may fall within the scope of private life123 us law treats covert human surveillance fidential informants directed surveillance consensual interception of communications and lawful unplanned surveillance and video surveillance bit differently special authorization is statutorily or constitutionally required under most circumstances the interception of wire oral or electronic communications with the consent of one party to the communication constitutes one of the exceptions to the general statutory and constitutional prohibitions against warrantless interceptions124 there is statutory restriction on government surveillance within public place the limitations of fourth amendments proscription on unreasonable searches and seizures only come into play when there is justifiable expectation of privacy associated with governments surveillance in the form of visual or photographic seizure in public place 125 the first amendments restrictions on governmental actions which have prohibited chilling effect on the exercise of first amendment rights are not offended when the governments information gathering is nothing more than 117 in perry v the uk 2003 crim lr 281

the home office claims that this form of surveillance is only used to catch offenders suspected of serious crimes authorizations for intrusive surveillance can only be granted by the secretary of state or senior officials designated under the ripa127 the list of individuals under this provision is narrower than those designated to authorize covert or directed surveillance and includes chief constables of the police forces designated members of the security service the provost marshall of the royal air force police designated customs officers and more recently officers of the northern ireland prison service128 the circumstances under which this form of surveillance can be authorized are necessarily narrower than the other types of surveillance warrant can be authorized if the authorizing official believes the surveillance is proportionate to what it is seeking to achieve and necessary in the interests of national security and for the purpose of preventing or detecting serious crime or in the interests of the economic well being of the uk and the information cannot reasonably be obtained by other means 129 the secretary of state may also authorize intrusive surveillance upon application from member of any of the security services an official of the ministry of defence member of her majestys forces or an individual holding position within public authority that has been designated under the ripa the secretary of state must believe that the surveillance is necessary in the interests of national security and for the purposes of preventing or detecting serious crime130 the secret intelligence service and gchq can also obtain warrant under these provisions for directed and intrusive surveillance relating to property in the british isles provided that the investigation is carried out in the interests of national security or the economic wellbeing of the uk the security service may act on behalf of secret intelligence service and gchq to obtain an authorization for warrant in connection with function of one of the above services provided that the activity does relate to the support of the prevention or detection of serious crime 131 these authorizations are effective for renewable periods of six months132 as matter of us law intrusive surveillance the surreptitious capture of activities in private place or vehicle by person or device

gets close to this level of interagency cooperation 192 the disclosure of the information is limited to those who have the required security clearance and the need to know principle that requires intercepted material must not be disclosed to any person unless that persons duties which must relate to one of the authorized purposes are such that he needs to know about the material to carry out those duties 193 once the material is longer needed for the authorized purposes it must be securely destroyed194 in the case of title iii interceptions in the united states law enforcement officers

power to put them under house arrest without one240 the former director general of the security service mi5 has publicly announced his reluctant support over the continued prohibition on the use of intercept evidence in court stating i have reluctantly come to the conclusion that due to the changing nature of telephone technology and the importance during period of change of not sensitising terrorists and serious criminals to particular capabilities that will be important for the future there are indeed good reasons not to remove the bar on the use of intercept in our courts 241 the government responded to suggestions that the ban on the use of intercept evidence be removed by stating that the extensive review has concluded the use of intercepted evidence would only produce modest increase in the number of prosecutions for serious criminal offenses but none for terrorists despite the restrictions there are some limited circumstances in which intercept evidence can be used as evidence section 184 of the ripa permits the use of intercepted communication as evidence if one party consented to the intercept the courts have interpreted the prohibition on using intercept evidence narrowly holding that it only applies to communications intercepted in the uk permitting the admittance of intercepted communications obtained legally abroad moreover the evidentiary restrictions do not appear to extend to information obtained through electronic bugging the police have continued to obtain information through electronic surveillance devices without proper authorization in several instances evidence obtained from this police bugging has been permitted as evidence in court despite judges in each cases specifically saying that the evidence was obtained in probable or direct breach of the echr242 in one case evidence from two coaccused obtained through an electronic surveillance device placed in their police holding cell was permitted to be used in court despite the fact that the co accused had exercised their right to silence243 the european court of human rights has provided that intelligence obtained in breach of article 8 of the echr through the unlawful installation of listening device in persons home or covert listening devices in police stations is admissible as evidence as any breach of article 8 is subsumed by the article 6 duty to ensure fair trial244 in contrast to the law in the united kingdom in the united states evidence lawfully secured pursuant to either title iii or fisa interception order does not become inadmissible in judicial proceedings solely by virtue of that fact245 yet as noted earlier lawful interception does not strip privileged communications of any of the privileged status they otherwise enjoy246 240

believe that action has been taken against themselves their property or communications by an organization that has been granted authorization to conduct such activities by the regulation of investigatory powers act in reality this is the only forum in which the activities of the security services can be questioned by members of the public and as such it has broad remit regarding the scope of conduct it can investigate in cases where members of the public suspect that their communications have been intercepted or that they have been subject to surveillance by certain bodies262 the ipt can investigate whether the requirements and conditions for the issuance of warrant to intercept communications have been met and whether that the proper authorization has been sought and approved throughout the interception process263 under the ripa the organizations responsible for issuing authorizations are required to provide the ipt with information relating to the complainant264 additionally the ipt can demand clarification or explanation of any information provided order an individual to give evidence in person inspect an organizations files or take any other action it sees fit265 charge is made to complainants for the investigation of their allegations with the ipts resources being provided for by the government if evidence from the ipts investigation leads to determination based on the principles of judicial review that the ripa has been cont ravened and that the organization has not acted reasonably it can uphold the complaint and has the discretion take remedial measures such as the quashing of any warrants destruction of any records held or financial compensation may be imposed at the tribunals discretion266 if the ipt does not find that the legislation has been contravened or finds that the organization has acted reasonably it will not uphold complaint the ipt states that not upholding complaint may mean that any conduct has been properly authorised and guidelines complied with or that the tribunal are satisfied that the conduct complained of has not taken place 267 262 the bodies which might be believed to have performed activities in relation to the interception of communications are any of the intelligence services the serious organized crime agency soca the tropolitan police the police service for northern ireland

acquisition and disclosure of communications data in specified circumstances the definition of communications data was subject to great deal of parliamentary debate as the requirements to obtain authorization and the list of those who can request an authorization are not as stringent as for surveillance or the interception of communications communications data does not include the content of the communication but the information that relates to the use of communication service such as telephone records including the number called duration of the call internet records including sites visited the sender recipient date and time of email messages and information on the individual using the service held by the operator such as subscriber information 271 an authorization to obtain communications data can only be obtained if it is necessary in the interests of national security or the economic well being of the uk for the purposes of preventing or detecting crime or preventing disorder in the interests of public safety for assessing or collecting of any tax duty levy or other imposition or to protect public health or in an emergency to prevent the death injury or damage to an individuals physical or mental health or mitigate such damage272 the class of officials who can grant authorization to obtain communications data is much broader than in the other areas of surveillance and authorization can be granted internally by an official in the relevant public authority with limitation on those who may apply for authorization273 controversial aspect of the ripa is the requirement that providers of public communications services must maintain the capability to intercept communications and retain communications data 274 communications providers particularly internet service providers considered that maintaining such capability would be costly nd infringe upon the privacy of their customers the ripa does place duty on the secretary of state to make contributions where appropriate to the costs incurred by postal and telecommunications operators when complying with an order to 268 18 usc 25188d 269 18 usc 251810 50 usc 1806g 270 18 usc 2511 2520

expanded these duties requiring communications service providers to retain communications data after the period necessary for business purposes for national security and crime prevention so that it can be accessed under the regulation of investigatory powers act when necessary276 the provision has been criticized as giving police the ability to obtain complete dossier on private life277 these requirements appear to soon become standard and more stringent with the passage of an eu directive spearheaded by the uk which mandates communications providers not just provide the ability to retain but actually retain communications data for up to two years as law enforcement aid 278 the comparable provisions under the laws of the united states permit law enforcement and intelligence access to such communications dataand in some instances to stored communications contentunder several schemes the procedural requirements for law enforcement access to stored wire or electronic communications
