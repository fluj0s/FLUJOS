security grant distribution methods issues for the 109th congress summary homeland security assistance to states and localities is available from three primary sources the state homeland security grant program shsgp the law enforcement terrorism prevention program letpp and the urban area security initiative uasi in fy2006 the department of homeland security dhs intends to allocate grants from these programs as follows from the shsgp and letpp programs each state the district of columbia dc and puerto rico is to receive base amount equal to 075 of the total appropriations each us insular area 025 the balance is to be allocated among the states dc and us insular areas based on dhss determination of risk and need from the uasi program each eligible urban area is to receive grant based on dhss determination of risk and need in august 2004 the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states 911 commission criticized the allocation of federal homeland security assistance and recommended that the distribution not remain program for general revenue sharing the former members of the 911 commission acting as private citizens conducting the 911 discourse project gave congress and dhs in their final report dated december 5 2005 failing grade on the distribution of homeland security funding given this criticism dhss development of risk and needsbased formula for shsgp letpp and uasi and its determination to allocate guaranteed base to states raise some policy questions that congress may wish to address through oversight of dhss administration of fy2006 homeland security grant program hsgp grants some of the questions include the following should states and us insular areas receive guaranteed minimum or guaranteed base of shsgp and letpp funding should homeland security grants be distributed solely according to risk or risk and need does delaying the announcement of state and urbanarea allocations adversely affect their ability to plan and

areas based on dhss determination of risk and need from the uasi program each eligible urban area is to receive grant based on dhss determination of risk and need the allocation method for fy2006 differs from that of earlier years in fy2003 and fy2004 congress required dhs to allocate 0751 of total appropriations for shsgp and letpp2 to each state with remainder of total appropriations to be allocated at the discretion of dhs3 dhs chose to use the states population percentage of the national population as the basis for this secondary distribution and to distribute base amount of 025 to us insular areas congress required dhs to allocate fy2005 shsgp and letpp grants in the same manner as in fy20044 dhs is also changing the distribution method for uasi in fy2006 in fy2003 fy2005 uasi discretionary allocations were distributed using credible threat presence of critical infrastructure vulnerability population population density law enforcement investigative and enforcement activity and the existence of formal mutual aid agreements as funding formula factors5 in fy2006 dhs intends to allocate uasi funding using risk and needsbased formula dhs also intends to group major

urban areas part of 12 billion for uasi and amounts for other state and local homeland security assistance programs7 congress required dhs to allocate 075 of total funds appropriated for shsgp and letpp to each state dc and puerto rico the distribution method for the remainder of appropriations for shsgp and letpp is at the discretion of dhs additionally congress authorized the allocation of uasi funding to be at the discretion of dhs8 on december 2 2005 dhs issued its fiscal year 2006 homeland security grant program program guidance and application kit to provide information and guidance on state and local homeland security grant programs the fy2006 guidance states that dhs elected to provide the 075 of total appropriations as base instead of as minimum to states dc and puerto rico

remainder of total appropriations based on risk and need the guidance also states that uasi funds will be allocated based on risk and need in fy2003 fy2004 and fy2005 uasi funds were allocated based on risk only10 state and local risk will be determined by dhs using risk and needs formula developed by the office of grants and training gt formerly the office for state and local government coordination and preparedness in conjunction with other dhs and federal entities distribution of shsgp letpp and uasi funding will be based on this risk and needs formula the exact formula however is not publicly available at this time and may not be available in the future due to its possible security classification risk as defined by dhs its risk calculations are based upon the consequences of specified attack on particular asset the vulnerability of that asset to that particular threat and the threat to that asset11 the dhs risk formula is to consist of two risk calcualtions assetbased risk which uses threat values derived from us intelligence community assessment of threats to specific critical infrastructure and geographicbased risk which uses values based on inherent risks associated with geographic areas ie states or urban areas taking into account such factors as international borders terrorism reporting and investigations and population density 10 ibid 11 ibid p 53 crs4 need state and urbanarea homeland security needs will be assessed through capability review which is currently underway the review is intended to help states and urban areas determine their own homeland security capabilities as compared against criteria identified and explained in the national preparedness goal12 each state and urban area is to evaluate its homeland security program and its ability to meet its own homeland security needs13 following the review each state and urban area is to submit program and capability enhancement plan and an investment justification with its fy2006 homeland security grant program hsgp application the program and capability enhancement plan is multiyear management plan that identifies state and urbanarea homeland security objectives that are additional to gt homeland security program objectives and funding the investment justification is to identify specific homeland security needs from the enhancement plan that states and urban areas wish to address using fy2006 hsgp funds additionally the investment justification is to outline implementation plans that will assist the states and urban areas in enhancing and developing their homeland security capabilities14 dhs will evaluate and score state and urbanarea applications through peer review process based on the likely effectiveness of each state and urban areas enhancement plan in addressing its needs and the plans reduction of the state and urban areas overall risk dhs will notify states and urban areas of their total risk and needsbased funding allocations at the time of the awards15 issues in august 2004 the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states 911 commission criticized the allocation of federal homeland security assistance and recommended that the distribution not remain program for general revenue sharing16 the former members of the 911 commission acting as private citizens conducting the 911 discourse project gave congress and dhs in their final report dated december 5 2005 failing grade on the distribution of homeland security funding congress has still not changed the underlying statutory authority for homeland security grants or benchmarks to insure that funds are used wisely as result homeland security funds continue to be distributed without regard for risk 12 for information on the national

of an attack diluting the national security benefits of this important program17 given this criticism dhss development of risk and needsbased formula for shsgp letpp and uasi and its determination to allocate guaranteed base to states raise some policy questions that congress may wish to address through oversight of dhss administration of fy2006 hsgp grants some of the questions include should states and us insular areas receive guaranteed minimum or guaranteed base of shsgp and letpp funding should homeland security grants be distributed solely on the basis of risk or risk and need does delaying the announcement of state and urban area allocations adversely affect their ability to plan and execute homeland security activities does dhss intention to group urban areas into regions hamper the development of their homeland security planning minimum versus base18 dhs has decided to provide guaranteed base to every state dc and each us insular area from shsgp and letpp funding congress authorized dhs discretion in determining if the 075 of total appropriations guaranteed to states dc and puerto rico is to be either minimum or base19 if dhs were to use 100 riskbased formula in determining state allocations minimum is the smallest allocation each state would receive were the riskbased calculations to result in any state allocation less than the statutorily defined minimum the allocations for states receiving more than the minimum would be reduced proportionally so that all states would receive at least the minimum base is an amount guaranteed to each state without regard to risk or need after allocation of base amounts states might receive further funding based on risk and need policy options for the method of grant allocation could include guaranteed base guaranteed minimum or neither that is policymakers may choose to decide whether 1 to provide every state with the same amount of base funding and then allocate the remainder of total appropriations based on risk and need 2 to allocate total appropriations based on risk and need and then if state does not receive certain amount or percentage minimum provide additional funding to the state to meet this amount or percentage with proportional reduction of funding to the other 17 911 public discourse project final report on 911 commission recommendations p 1 available at httpwww911pdporg visited jan 4 2006 18 for an indepth discussion on minimum versus base see crs report rl33050 risk based funding in homeland security grant legislation issues for the 109th congress by shawn reese 19 pl 10990 title iii crs6 states or 3 to allocate funding to states based 100 on risk and need congress however would not be addressing the critics eg the 911 commission of its present funding formula by continuing to provide states with guaranteed base or minimum risk versus need dhs has elected not to use 100 riskbased formula for allocating the remainder of total appropriations for shsgp and letpp following the distribution of state base amounts and total appropriations for uasi instead dhs has developed twopart approach to determining state and urbanarea allocations this approach consists of dhs risk assessment and state and urban areas justification of need for funding dhs has not informed states and urban areas through its fy2006 guidance what percentage of funds will be allocated based on risk and what percentage of funds will be allocated based on need one could argue that by not allocating strictly on risk dhs has not addressed the critics such as the 911 commission in its 2004 report who advocate purely riskbased allocation of homeland security funding by coupling need with risk dhs might be providing funding to states and urban areas that do not have high risk of terrorism additionally some might argue that less uasi funding will be distributed based on risk in fy2005 dhs distributed uasi funding based purely on risk using credible threat presence of critical infrastructure vulnerability population population density law enforcement investigative and enforcement activity and the existence of formal mutual aid agreements as funding formula factors in fy2006 dhs has added urban area homeland security needs to the uasi distribution formula conversely by allocating funding based on both risk and need dhs is arguably addressing not only terrorism risk but also state and urban areas capability to address that risk congress may choose to address the issue of risk and needbased funding by reviewing fy2006 state and urbanarea allocations once they have been announced by dhs at later date and determining if the new distribution formula meets the homeland security needs of the nation as whole if congress were to determine that this new distribution method does not address the national needs it might consider imposition of distribution method beyond the present statutory requirement of guaranteed amount of 075 to every state this distribution method might include risk criteria and benchmarks for determining national homeland security needs delayed awarding of state and urban area allocations in fy2003 fy2005 states and urban areas were informed of their homeland security grant allocations early in the fiscal years20 states have been notified of their fy2006 base allocations approximately 713 million each however because of dhss decision to wait until states and urban areas complete their enhancement plans and justifications states and urban areas will not be notified of their total grant allocations until sometime in the late spring of 2006 20 in fy2003 allocations were announced in jan 2003 in fy2004 allocations were announced in dec 2003 and in fy2005 allocations were announced in nov 2004 crs7 it is possible that states and urban areas lacking an indication of how much funding they will receive will not know how to accurately plan or develop homeland security activities for fy2006 it is possible that state or an urban area will develop an enhancement plan and investment justification that relies on certain amount of federal homeland security funding and then be notified following dhss risks and needs assessment that it will not be receiving the desired amount of funding or any funding beyond its base shsgp and letpp allocation this in turn might result in the state having to adjust or rework its homeland security planning and implementation activities additionally if the announcement of state allocations is delayed localities could be further delayed in being informed by states of any fy2006 shsgp and letpp funding they might receive conversely by delaying the announcement of state allocations dhs might be afforded an extended period for more accurately determining state and urbanarea homeland security risks and needs dhss requirement for an enhancement plan and investment justification could also result in states and urban areas more accurately determining their risks capabilities and needs which could facilitate dhss overall national risks and needs assessment congress may choose to address the issue of delayed allocations by reviewing the fy2006 state and urbanarea allocations following their announcement and the effect on state and urbanarea homeland security plans if congress were to determine that this delay in allocations does not suit the states and urban areas needs it might consider requiring dhs to announce allocation amounts early in the fiscal year for future dhs homeland security grant distributions regional urban area security initiative allocations dhs has announced its intention to group individual jurisdictions into super uasi groups and to reduce the number of jurisdictions from 50 urban areas to 35 with an additional 11 urban areas that received funding in fy2005 eligible to apply for sustainment money for ongoing homeland security projects see table 2 acting director of gt mathew mayer stated that it would be the responsibility of the individual jurisdictions within the super uasi regions to determine allocations within the regions the uasi regional jurisdictions are required within 60 days to develop an enhancement plan and investment justification to be eligible to receive funding additionally uasi regions can apply for funding to support some dualuse activities such as evacuations and search and rescue operations which assist with not only terrorist incidents but also natural disasters 21 this grouping of individual jurisdictions into super uasi regions coupled with the new needs portion of the method for distributing uasi funds might result in jurisdictions with higher threat of terrorism receiving less funding additional funding might be directed to the 11 urban areas eligible for sustainment funding which could reduce the amounts for the other 35 super uasi regions also uasi regions that have greater need for dualuse capabilities might receive more funding than those with higher terrorism threat 21 us department of homeland security homeland security secretary michael chertoff press conference jan 3 2006 available at httphomelandcqcom visited jan 4 2006 crs8 on the other hand the identification of uasi regions over individual jurisdictions urban areas comprising numerous jurisdictions could increase the security of individual urban areas by increasing the security of the regions overall arguably terrorists do not recognize political or geographical boundaries when planning attacks within the united states dhss intention to authorize dual use of uasi funding might make urban areas better able to respond to terrorist attacks because whether the crisis is terrorist attack or natural disaster an urban area could still need the ability to evacuate all or portions of its citizens or conduct search and rescue operations the uasi regions however seem not to reflect great change from the fy2005 uasi urban area designations with such exceptions as the combination of jersey city and newark and the inclusion of yonkers with new york city regional uasi allocations for fy2006 may not become point of contention until dhs announces them late in the spring of 2006 at that time congress may choose to review the allocations and their effect on the uasi regions homeland security plans should congress determine that regional allocations do not address individual jurisdictions requirements it might consider directing dhs to allocate uasi funds to individual jurisdictions instead of regions crs9 table 2 fy2006 urban area security initiative
