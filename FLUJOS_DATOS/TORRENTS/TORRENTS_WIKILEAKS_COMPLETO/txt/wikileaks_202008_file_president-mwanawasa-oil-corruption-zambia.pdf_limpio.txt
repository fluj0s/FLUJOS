written memorandum containing my responses to the issues raise d in the auditor generals report on the operations of zambia national oil company limited and later appear before the public accounts committee on tuesday 3 rd and wednesday june 42003 reference is also made to my letter dated 2 rd june 2003 where i advised that there was legal matter pending before the courts of law between mys elf and zambia national oil company limited in liquidation in course number 2002 hp 0419among other matters some of the issues contained in this course ve direct bearing on the auditor general report and that therefore it would be sub judice to respond or discuss as requested the auditor generals report while the case in course number 2002 hp 0419 is still pending determination before the courts of law refe rence is also made to your letter of 2 rd june 2003where you confirmed receipt of my letter da ted 2 rd june 2003for easy of reference these letters are hereby attached in nnexure 34 and 5 since for now there is case in court regarding this matter i therefore deemed it necessary to respond to the auditor general report on the operations of zam bia national oil company limited first and foremost allow to thank god through his my lord jesus christ for his grace in protecting and providing for and my family during the trying period that we have gone through since december 2001 for standing up against the powers that be in zambia and international forces in order to protect zambian resources 1i would like to state that i was the chief executive of zambia national oil company znoc at the time the company was purportedly put in an illegal polit ically motivated receivership by zanaco which was later followed up by an mmd governm ent illegal fraudulently motivated and sponsored liquidation before i address the specific false issues raised in the false audit report of auditor generals report i would like to share with you some pertinent information surrounding the znoc saga i wish to state from the outset that the illegal znoc liquidati on was premeditated conspiracy fraud scheme perpetuated by people in whom state power and uthority had been vested using wide range of institutions and people both in the pri vate and public sectors in the private sector some international oil companies print media banks legal accounting and audit firms were used while in the public sector civil servants zambia revenue authority zanaco and the energy regulation board were used in order t facilitate the conspiracy to carry out massive fraud against our country zambia and its people through the illegal liquidation of znoc what is at stake in this matter is not only fraud but also how the security of zambia has been compromised for polit ical expediency and personal enrichment there is doubt that this fraudulent schem was conceived by some mmd government leaders in the former second president dr fjchiluba administration and ruthlessly and mercilessly executed during pres ident levy patrick mwanawasa sc era and sadly i must say with the full knowledge of president levy patrick mwanawasa sc through this fraudulent scheme there was been 1 direct theft on the zambian government treasury of k838645 billion the znoc factious debt that miss josephine mapoma permanent secretary in the ministry of energy and water development certified which debt the zambian government resolved to take over 2 us 36 million value of znoc crude oil in tazama pipelines has not been accounted for 3 very soon it will be four years since this scheme was executed and by which time us 240 million in form of znoc profits would have been siphoned out of zambia through tst and total outre mer arrangements znoc board and management had dispelled series of mmd government ma chinations to have znoc killed and the last tramp card the new deal mmd fraudulent schemers had to use in order to perpetuate their fraud scheme was to falsel link znoc management to the plunder of zambian resources through president mwanawa sa and his ministers pronouncements in zambian parliament and elsewhere the audi tor general report and other various state sponsored unfounded adverse press report purely on account of the fact that the znoc board chairman mr donald chanda also happened to have been president dr fjchiluba special assistant for economic affairs all the accusations that have been labeled against znoc are false and we re designed so that the 2new deal mmd government could hide the fraud they had perpetuated against t he zambian people and it is for this reason why the mwanawasa government does not want znoc issue to be determined in the courts of law or by an independent tribunal when indeni refinery was reconstructed in december 2000unfavorable tax environment was deliberately created against znoc petroleum products re fined at indeni refinery because ministry of finance and national planning was refusing to reinstate the 25 customs duty on imported finished petroleum products in line with the customs and excise act the law requires that imported finished petrole um products be charged 25 customs duty when indeni was gutted based on znoc recommendation as way of mitigating cost of oil this duty was reduced to 5 however when indeni was recommissioned in december 2000 the ministry of finance under dr katele kalumba the current mmd national secretary and zra under the chairmans hip of mr eg kasonde were resisting reinstating this duty to 25 in line w ith the law coupled with the fact zambia revenue authority under mr kelvin donavan an expat riate commissioner general and mr emmanuel kasonde as board chairman started overcharging znoc refined petroleum products ex indeni refinery by taxing t he products based on the selling price instead of the cost of manufacturing in line with schedule 6 of the customs and excise act while on the other hand i mported finished petroleum products were being taxed on cost up to the boarder point of entry ba sed on schedule 5 of the customs and excise act and the fact that znoc did not have its own retail filling stations outlets made oil marketing companies import and market imported finished petroleum products at the expense of the locally produced indeni pe troleum products making znoc loss 90 of its market share of the national demand with only 10 of the national demand it was impossible to efficiently operate the zambian petroleum sector system of tazma indeni and znoc whose operati onal efficiency depended on volumes resulting in frequent shutdowns in the system operations without znoc taking the dispute it had with zra over the taxation of petroleum products refined at indeni refinery to the revenue appeals tribunal the entire system of refining crude oil at indeni refinery would have collapsed on account of taxation particularly that this same 25 customs duty on imported finished petroleum products was again reduced to 5 by the president mwanawasas government through statutory instrument signed by mr egkasonde then as finance minister as reporte d in the post of 25th november 2002 zra also through letter signed by the current commissioner general mr msika made directive that oil marketing companies should be paying taxes applicable on znoc petroleum products ex indeni refinery directly to zra without the same payments passing through znoc books there by compromising the audit trail in the ac counting of taxes on petroleum products znoc management protested in writing against zra directive to zra itself and also to the ministry of finance and national planning and advised them that the directive was recipe for fraud to take place in the accounting of taxes on petroleum produc ts on two 3occasions i wrote mr kelvin donavan zra expatriate commissioner genera l with copy to the ministry of finance secretary to the treasury requesting the commissioner general to confirm receipt of certain amounts of tax monies that zra should have collected directly from oil marketing companies mr mtonga the minis try of finance secretary to the treasury responded to my letter by directing the com missioner general to respond to my letter and address the concerns i had raised in both instances however the commissioner general could not confirm receipt of the amounts i had indi cated and neither could he address my concerns failure by zra to confirm the tax receipts from oil marketing companies and zra insistence to continue operating syst em that compromised the audit trail did not make sense particularly that this was the first time in the many years that i had worked for znoc that the audit trail in t ax collections was being compromised all efforts to have the znoc dispute with zra regarding the basis of t axation of znoc petroleum products ex indeni refinery resolved amicably were frustrated by the commissioner general who used to refuse to listen from any one indic ating that he only got instructions from dr katele kalumba then minister of finance and national planning znoc management were on the other hand continuously being restrai ned by the board under the chairmanship of mr donald chanda from taking the matter t the revenue appeals tribunal because decision in znoc s favor would compromi zambias chances of meeting the revenue collection bench mark with international monetary fund imf in july 2001 i had sudden attack of meningitis and my life was onl saved after i was evacuated to morning side hospital in south africa where i was hospi talized the evacuation and the morning side hospital bills were paid for by the w orld bank who were my wifes employers at the time when i returned to the office in mid august 2001after sick leave of about six weeks i attended meeting called by dr katele kalumba minister of finance and national planning attended by mrs stella chibanda dr kalyalya from bank of zambi kelvin donavan expatriate commissioner general from zambia revenue authority mr j ohn janes managing director of standard chartered bank and mr timothy mushi bwe partner in deloittes and touche i was surprised to learn at t his meeting that zra had actually been exceeding its revenue collection bench marks mr john janes and mr timothy mushibwe informed the meeting that whil i was sick in hospital in south africa mr john janes together with standard charte red bank board chairman mr george sokota who is also the managing partner of deloitt and touche had meeting in the office of the then vice president mr enoch k avindele attended by mr emmanuel kasonde then zra board chairman and mr donald znoc board chairman it is important to note that while standard chartered bank mana gement attended this meeting zra management represented by mr kelvin donava n and znoc management represented by the acting chief executive mr lutangu inambwa were not 4in attendance mr john janes went on to produce minutes of the meeti ng they had in the vice president office where mr emmanuel kasonde had made commitme nt that since zra had exceeded its collection bench mark target zra was ready to pay standard chartered bank whatever amounts the bank was owned by znoc and mr tim othy mushibwe partner in deloittes and touche went on to circulate d eloittes and touche proposal of mechanism to achieve this objective it is important to note that all the people who were reported to have attended the meeting in vice presi dent kavindeles office later on came to play part in either the illegal rece ivership or liquidation of znoc in one way or another reasons were given as to why mr emmanuel kasonde mr donald chanda znoc board chairman and mr george sokota did not attend the meeting that w as called dr katele kalumba then minister of finance and national planning m rs stella chibanda the technocrat from the ministry of finance who were present however advised dr katele kalumba that there was government financial regulations that could all ow to implement what mr emmanuel kasonde had committed zra to standard chartered bank in the vice president enock kavindeles office and therefore mr emm anuel kasonde deloittes and touché proposal was not implemented since the reason of zra revenue collection bench marks with the imf nd the world bank could longer be used by the znoc board to prevent management from sue ing zra znoc management proceeded to sue zra in august 2001 in the revenue appeals tribunal the revenue appeals tribunal which heard this matter comprised mr micheal mundashi who later on came to be president mwanawasas lawyer in the presidential election petition as chairman sitting with mr timothy mushibwe partner in deloittes and touche this is the same mr timothy mushibwe partner in loittes and touche who presented the deloittes and touche proposal to use zra tax monies to pay standard chartered bank and doctor john mulwila znoc was represented by mr lbert wood the ruling in this matter was supposed to have been delivered in d ecember 2001and the parties had been summoned by the tribunal for delivery of judgment in dece mber 2001 but for unexplained reasons judgment was deferred and only came to be passe d in znocs favor four months later on 26 april 2002 three weeks after illegal znoc liquidation on 4 th april 2002 the over k100 billion tax refund that zra was supposed to pay znoc wa s enough to discharge the entire znoc liabilities with zanaco and standard chartered bank the znoc inability to meet obligations to zanaco and standard chartered bank was therefore artificial created through mmd government sponsored machinations so t hat eventually the scheme to defraud zambia through znocs liquidation could be achieved using the znoc debt with standard chartered bank and zanaco as coverer up reasons further the fact that the oil tax monies that zra is supposed to have collected from the oil marketing companies in the period december 2000 to april 2002 ie the period when 5the tax collection audit trail was compromised by zra through direct ive issued by the expatriate commissioner general mr kelvin donavan but signed for on his behalf by the current commissioner general mr miska was not properly accounted for is evidenced by the following facts 1 the expatriate zra commission general failed on two occasions to confirm in writings tax amounts that i indicated he should have received at certain periods of time 2 zra made false claim on the znoc liquidator that znoc owned it k427148659004 k427 billion this money was supposed to have been collected directly from oil marketing companies in the period december 2000 to april 2002 as per zra directive when the tax collection audit trail was compromised the fact that znoc was being shown as debtor in zra books for zra to lodge in such claim with the znoc liquidator simply means that this money was either not collected from oil marketing companies if it was collected then it was not properly accounted for 3 the k100 billion tax refund that zra was supposed to refund znoc is also part of the tax monies that zra collected directly from oil marketing companies on znocs behalf when the tax collection audit trail was compromised by zra through directive letter signed by the current commissioner general mr miska zra therefore found it difficult to re imburse znoc the k100 billion tax refund as ruled by the revenue appeals tribunal because the original tax receipts might not have gone to zra confers the timing of the revenue appeals tribunal judgement coming three weeks after znoc illegal liquidation among other reasons has something to do with the accountability of oil tax monies collected during this particular time in february 2001zambia national commercial bank zanaco sued znoc and bp zambia limited in course number 2001 hpc 0073 claiming that the bank was entitled to collect znoc receivables from oil marketing companies including bp and appointed mr arthur ndhlovu as collateral manager to monitor and collect znoc receivables from oil marketing companies and deposit the monies into zanaco znoc disputed zanaco claims and made counter claim in court t hat the znoc debt with zanaco be determined by the court bp zambia limited was re presented in this same course by mr levy patrick mwanawasa sc at one time judge chibomba had referred this cause to mediation before mr geoffrey simokoko when the course was in mediation znoc presented all the documentary evidence relating to t he matter and proof that the znoc debt to zanaco was us 103 million while z anaco did not submit anything while the matter was in mediation at one time m rs maureen mwanawasa came in place of mr levy mwanawasa sc to represent bp z limited 6as part of the preparation for the indeni refinery start up arrangements aft er the refinery reconstruction znoc management had issued selective tende r to three to four prospective companies to supply oil to zambia at one time when znoc management were in meeting at citibank boardroom with the bank managing director the secretary to the citibank managing director came and called out of the meeting saying that the minister of finance and nati onal planning dr katele kalumba calling from london had directed that she calls out of the meeting and answer the phone call he had made on citibank managing director li ne when i was on phone dr katele kalumba directed that znoc should cancel the lective tender because znoc was longer going to be involved in the oil supply chain i called for board meeting but the board reaffirmed its resolution for selective tender and proceed to make split award to glencore and total international i later came to establish from total international officials that dr katele kalumba then minister of finance and national planning made the call to while i was at citibank z offices from london hotel when he was in the company of total international officials in february 2001mr david saviye then minister of energy and water deve lopment presently zambias ambassandor to china issued written instruction tha t he had decided to put in place what he referred to as interim agreements to l ast 60 days where the mandate to procure oil was removed from znoc and transferred to indeni re finery and appointed committee to co ordinate the oil importation and supply with mr moses nzama from energy regulations board as chairman and mr malambo from the nistry of finance as secretary however agip the then other shareholder in indeni refinery refused to allow indeni refinery to be used as collateral for oil financing and the imf also refused to allow the zambian government to use tax revenue m onies for oil procurement the interim arrangement committee under mr moses nzama nd mr malambo under instructions from dr katele kalumba then minister of finance and national planning and mr david saviye then minister of energy and water development made arrangements with company called tranfigura backed by china construction bank and national bank of rsa under this arrangement tranfigura wa s supposed to bring in crude oil and immediately get the refined petroleum products from znoc crude oil displaced from the tazama pipeline by tranfigura crudeoil tranfigura was supposed to pay user fees to tazama and indeni addit ionally tranfigura was supposed to pay zanaco us 25 per metric ton as repa yment of znoc debt to zanaco all the parties to this arrangement led by erb zanaco tazama indeni signed to implement this arrangement however for the arrangement to be implemented they needed znocs consent for the following reasons 1 it was znoc crude oil that was going to be displaced from the tazama pipeline but whose proceeds were to immediately go to tranfigura while the new tranfigura crude oil in the tazama pipeline was to become the new znoc crude oil 72 for the tazama indeni system to operate they need to have the znoc terminal storage facilities for refined finished petroleum products miss josephine mapoma permanent secretary in the ministry of energy and water development sent mr moses nzama with instructions that i should s ign the document were all the above mentioned companies had signed when i refused to s ign the document mr moses nzama rang miss josephine mapoma from my office and miss mapoma applied lot of pressure on to sign the document but i sti ll refused to sign it i refused to sign this particular document for the following reasons 1 the tranfigura oil supply agreement and the china construction bank and national bank of rsa financing agreements were not availed to znoc therefore the cost of the oil supply by tranfigura and the financing costs of the participating banks could not be determined and as such there was way to establish the profits that tranfigura was going to make from the deal 2 further it did not make sense for the proceeds realized from znoc crude oil in tazama pipelines to go to tranfigura while znoc creditors remained unpaid in fact the document i was supposed to sign to effect this agreement only came to after the secretary to the treasury mr james mtonga had refused t sign the same documents earlier on saying that he was going to be the last person t sign after every one else had signed since i refused to sign mr james mtonga also did not sign and the tranfigura arrangement therefore fail through the znoc board strongly advised mr david saviye then minister of ene rgy and water development in writing of the dangers of his directive and requested him to reflect and reconsider his directive and the board went on to seek audience with mr david saviye over the same matter the machinations of interim committee under mr moses nzama of energy regulation board erb and mr malambo from the ministry of finance and national pl anning under instructions from then energy minister mr david saviye and then f inance minister dr katele kalumba the current mmd national secretary t remove the oil procurement mandate from znoc were not implemented because znoc managem ent and secretary to the treasury mr james mtonga refused to sign the tra figura deal efforts to transfer the oil procurement to indeni refinery before total took over the agip shares also failed through because agip refused to allow indeni refine ry to be used as collateral for oil financing facility attempts to transfer the oil procurement mandate to tazama pipelines also failed because the imf refused to allow t he mmd government to use tax revenues for oil procurement further when the machinations of dr katele kalumba then minister of finance and national planning the current mm d national secretary and mr david saviye then minister of energy and water development presently zambias ambassandor to china reached president dr fjchiluba he overruled 8minister mr david saviye directive and ordered the mandate of oil proc urement to be returned to znoc the events that later on subsequently transpired have come to reveal the fact that the return of oil procurement mandate to znoc was only temporal because the schemers of fraud in mmd were planning for second assault on znoc which assa ult soon came to manifest itself in the crude illegal methods they used at the nd of october 2001 using zanaco to place znoc in illegal receivership which later on led to president mwanawasa led mmd government illegal liquidation of znoc perpetuate d in order to defraud zambia and its people when the oil procurement mandate was returned to znoc company managemen t under guidance from the board started evaluating various oil financing facilities and among the facilities evaluated was pta bank facility backed by bank of oman before znoc settled for the us 65 million oil financing facility with absa bank of south africa through conversation with total international officials i came to pick up information that some government ministers in the president dr fjchiluba mmd government w ere not happy with the arrangements that znoc was making with absa bank rega rding the us 65 million oil financing facility because it was competing with their plans to transfer znocs role to indeni refinery once total international acquired the agi p shares in indeni refinery and therefore the implementation of the absa oil fina ncing facility by znoc would make the scheme to transfer znocs role to total int ernational at indeni refinery impossible to implement if znoc continued to be viable the us 65 million revolving oil financing facility that znoc ne gotiated with absa was not simple generic financing facility but specific tailor m ade structured facility designed to meet the needs of all the zambian petroleum sector st akeholders namely indeni tazama zanaco znoc and its customers covering various chnical aspects like facility documentation pumping and refining agreements crow accounts oil tender document insurance and stock monitoring generating various related agreements znoc had intellectual property rights to the us 65 llion absa oil financing facility and in addition to this znoc on 27th september 2001 had paid absa bank us 50000 through stanbic bank z in order to secure and dedicate the us 65 million credit lines for znocs use the main agreement the us 65 million revolving oil supply credit was executed by absa and znoc on 14th september 2001the pumping and refining agreements with tazama and indeni were also xecuted the escrow agreement was also executed by absa znoc and zanaco i n mid october 2001zanaco deputy managing director mr george mwambazi and the bank secretary mr amos siwila signed the escrow account on behalf of za naco and myself dennis mumba znoc chief executive and znoc company secretary mrs mw aka samundengu ngoma signed on behalf of znoc this escrow agreement provided for the payment of us 24 million to zanaco from znoc crude oil in taz ama pipelines that was going to be displaced by absa financed crude oil nd zanaco was 9to discharge it security charge over znoc upon payment of this amount zn oc management was mandated to sign the escrow agreement where zanaco was to be paid us 24 million immediately on implementation of the absa financing facility even though what was due to zanaco was only us 103 million because znoc could not wait until the quantum of the debt was settled in court si nce the nature of znoc business was such that without financing facilities it was almost impossible to do business and it was considered that any overpayment to zanaco could be recovered later once the matter involving the disputed znoc debt to zanaco w as resolved and the absa financing facility provided an opportunity to znoc to come out of the zanaco bondage through letter dated 29th october 2001 absa bank informed znoc that the us 65 million oil financing facility had bee n finalized and that absa bank credit committee approval had been obtained and the facility was therefore ready to be implemented the advantages of this facility were as follows all the proceeds to be realized from znoc 90000 metric tons crude oil in the tazama pipeline valued at approximately us 36 million was to go to znoc and was to be used to pay lump sum amounts of us24million to za naco and balance to standard chartered bank and other creditors within one and half months after implementation of the absa financing facility payment to other znoc unsecured creditors were to be paid from future zn oc profits the facility amount of us 65 million guaranteed security of supply i n that it provided for procurement of minimum of three 90000 mt crude oil shipments depending on the world prices the facility provide for robust system of payment to service providers inden i and tazama there was dedicated crude oil supplier supplier or suppliers were goi ng to be chosen through tender process tender documents to be used for selection of supplier had been generated as part of the facility documentation since the financier and the supplier were going to be different that coul d have provided znoc an opportunity to negotiate better terms with the supplier oil marketing companies were to be given seven days credit before paying for their uplifts the cost of borrowing to the oil marketing companies was to be drastically reduced since absa was going to charge international intere st rates based on libor which is cheaper than the kwacha interest rates zambian government or bank of zambia guarantee was required all the documents relating to this us 65 million oil financing facility were forwarded to the relevant ministries ie ministry of energy and water deve lopment ministry of finance and national planning and ministry of legal affairs despite zanaco having been carried along by znoc in the negotiations with absa and the fact that zanaco was to receive us 24 million within lessthan one and half 10months on implementation of the facility zanaco was instructed to sabotage the us 65 million znoc absa oil financing facility by illegally appointing lusaka lawyer mr richard mandona partner in permanent chambers as znoc receiver manager on 31st october 2001 two months before the 2001 presidential and parliamentary general elections it is important to note that permanent chambers are the persona l lawyers of former finance and national planning minister and current mmd national secretary dr katele kalumba mr samuel bwalya musonda the then zanaco managing director told m that he was summoned by zanaco chairman mr simukowa to attend meeting in the office of the then mmd national secretary and minister of information mr v ernon mwanga he said that when he reached mr vernon mwangas office he found mr si mokowa mr eric silwamba the then presidential affairs minister and mr ve rnon mwanga who told him that they had received mmd intelligent information that standard chartered bank paradoxically through its chairman mr george sokota who was later appoint ed znoc liquidator were working in conjunction with opposition political parties and were planning to put znoc in liquidation as way of causing confusion in the country during the election time through disruptions in oil supplies mr musonda told m that he was therefore instructed to place znoc in what he referred to as friendl receivership in order to forestall the standard chartered bank threat which receivership was to be lifted after the elections he further went on to say that the selection of mr richard mandona lusaka lawyer and partner in permanent chambers to be made as zanaco appointed znoc receiver manager was made on zanaco behalf by mr eric silwamba the then presidential affairs minister of course what mr samuel musonda was telling regarding the standa rd bank threat were lies because the znoc financing facility agreements with standard chartered ba nk did not confer any such powers on standard chartered bank that could have enabl ed the bank to put znoc in liquidation the main motive of their action w as to sabotage the znoc absa oil financing facility in order to pave way for the total international total outre mer scheme at indeni refinery it is for this reason why the announcement of the zanaco appointment of mr richard mandona lusaka lawye r and partner in permanent chambers as znoc receiver manager was made by then mmd national secretary mr vernon johnson mwaanga and later on when znoc was put in the illegal mmd government sponsored liquidation on 4th april 2002 total outre mer was the first company to be given the znoc s role and profit potential before trans sahara trading company tst came into the picture mr vernon johnson mwaanga then mmd national secretary appeared on zambia national broa dcasting television with total outré mer chairman west african mr omar gee promoting total outré mer and the new arrangements that the mwanawasa new deal mmd government had put in the oil sector this west african gentleman to date is the chairman of total outré mer 11when celebrating 100 days in office president levy patrick mwanawas sc himself appeared on television zambia and healed the liquidation of znoc s one of the hallmark of his success in 100days in office and yet president mwanaw asa had the full knowledge that what he was holding out as success was in fact gigant ic fraud on zambians on 13th december 2001using cause number 2001 hpc 0073 where zanaco had sued znoc and bp z limited and where mr levy patrick mwanaw asa sc was representing bp z the znoc board of directors challenged the zanaco appointment of mr richard mandona as znoc receiver manager the znoc directors w ere represented by mr mumba malila who later on president levy mwana wasa sc came to appoint as chairman of human rights commission the znoc board challenged zanaco appointment of mr richard mandona as receiver manager for the fol lowing reasons 1 that the appointment of the receiver was not in line with the provisions of the debenture 2 that in order to facilitate the repayment to zanaco znoc and zanaco had entered into an agreement relating to the escrow account and other arrangements with total international limited on 27th april 2001and that this agreement had not been repudiated 3 to further facilitate the repayment by znoc to zanaco of the outstanding amounts if any on the loan facility znoc entered into another revolving oil financing facility agreement with absa bank limited under which absa bank would avail znoc facility of us 65 million 4 that by zanacos very own acts had frustrated all efforts aimed at repaying them through the agreements referred to above 5 that znoc directors were advised by counsel that it was wrong in law for zanaco to appoint receiver under debenture while litigation was still on going there was multiplicity of actions the znoc directors further prayed for the following declaration that the appointment of the receiver manager mr richard mandona under the unlimited debenture was contrary to the provisions of the said unlimited debenture and is therefore wrongful b an order of injunction restraining zanaco by itself servants agents employees or whom from appointing any other receiver in respect of the znoc and an order restraining the receiver already appointed from further acting or performing any duties under the deed of appointment or under the unlimited debenture c an order for reconciliation of znoc account at zanaco d declaration that the interest applicable on the account is simple interest and not compound interest and an order that the compound interest be reversed 12e an order that factious charges that zanaco charged in respect of funding costs penalty charges

hpc 0073 including mr levy mwana wasa sc who was representing bp z every early in the morning around 630 hours on 17th december 2001 the late mr harry mwanawasa phoned at my house he told that his brother mr l evy mwanawasa sc wanted to meet at 20000 hours at his kabulonga house at the greed time i went to mr mwanawasas kabulonga house mrs maureen mwanawasa opened the door for and served coca cola while i waited for mr levy mwanawasa sc when mr levy mwanawasa sc came he told that he had gone through znoc directors challenge of zanaco appointment of mr richard mandona as znoc receiver manager and he wanted to get more details so that he c ould use his influence as mmd presidential candidate and bp lawyer to have the matter settled amic ably i told mr levy patrick mwanawasa sc the following details that when i took over as znoc chief executive from mr everisto kasunga the company had negative net worth of about us 60 million and included i n the znoc liabilities was znoc debt at zanaco which debt was incurred during the time mr everisto kasunga was chief executive with mr ken njeleka as zn oc director of operations when when miss edith nawakwi was minister of energy and water development and mr romance sampa then permanent secretary in minist ry of energy and water affairs was the znoc board chairman and i served under mr mr everisto kasunga firstly as finance manager and later as director of finance four months after i became chief executive on monday 17th may 1999 indeni refinery was gutted the initial indications were that the refinery was going to be reconstructed with in eight months znoc management advised the gove rnment that given znoc negative balance sheet status the company could not engage in the 13importation of finished petroleum products without government assistance it wa s after these representations that bank of zambia was asked to start giving financial guarantees for the imported finished petroleum products during the indeni refinery crisis i advised mr mwanawasa that there was nothing strange about this arrangeme nt because even under zimco bank of zambia guaranteed an oil financing facility w ith burgan bank of kuwait when there was the gulf crisis the zimoil balance on the outstanding amount that was called on bank of zambia through the burgan facility wa s transferred to become as part of znoc liability after the demise of zimco which liability znoc subsequently paid to bank of zambia i advised mr mwanawasa that some of znoc proceeds realized from t he sale of imported finished petroleum products were utilized to settle the following us 12 million to standard chartered bank for the feedstock stuck in the tazama pipeline as the result of the indeni fire us 78 million payments to tazama and indeni during the shut down period for their past services relating to the pumping and process of crude oil before 17 th may 1999 fire at indeni refinery us 352 million payment to zanaco for servicing zanaco old debt accumulated from the letters of credit associated with the importa tion of crude oil by mr everisto kasunga before the indeni fire us 24 million payment to total international payment for buy back of crude oil used for the agitation of tazama pipeline during shut down to avoid sl udge formation in the pipeline i also advised him that the following had negative effects on the cash flow znoc had to incur us 35 million loss in order to claim inc reased cost of working capital on the insurance policy us 13 million excess transit loss during importation of finished petrol eum products claimed on total international us 18 million excess storage loss claimed on indeni refinery us 559 shows cip deliveries claimed on total international i went on to advised mr mwanawasa that for considerable period of time there had been international pressure applied on the zambian government to close in deni refinery and turn the tazama pipeline into finished petroleum products line and that these same international forces had taken the gutting of indeni refinery and the weak znoc financial position at the time as an opportunity to achieve this pa rticular objective and to this effect the following happened during the time indeni refinery was out of service the world bank funded tazama rehabilitation project was cancelled by the bank midway through the project circle due to the non implementation of some of the project co ordinationalities by the zambian government 14the paradox of this matter however is that all the tazama rehabili tation project co ordinationalities which the zambian government could not meet under the t azama rehabilitation project were all incorporated into zambia country conditional ities under hipc in the letter of intent which the international monetary fund the world bank and dr katele kalumba then as minister of finance and national pl anning signed on behalf of zambian government therefore the tazama rehabilitation project co ordinationalities became zambia country conditionalities under hipc every time there was imf and world bank hipc review missions to z ambia these missions always used to have meetings with oil marketing companie s namely total mobil agip and bp at world bank offices in lusaka before any hipc letters of intents were signed with the zambian government consequently the following stri ngent conditions were introduced in the hipc letter of intent signed by the im f and the world bank with then minister of finance dr katele kalumba 1 that indeni refinery was not going to be re constructed 2 znoc will come out of the supply chain and became manager of strategic reserves 3 25 customers duty on imported finished petroleum products that has always applied since tazama and indeni were constructed in 1969 and was part of the tazama and indeni construction agreements between the zambian government and agip was not going to be rein stated i further went on to advise mr levy mwanawasa that the znoc problem s after indeni reconstruction were induced because there was conflict of interest betw een what znoc wanted to do in the interest of zambia and the interest of some leaders in mmd government who were manipulating the imf and world bank by giving them fals data like the fictious znoc debt at zanaco to apply conditionalities on the petroleum sector that could make znoc tazama and indeni fail to operate and use that as an excuse for these companies to be taken over for free by front foreign companies that some mmd leaders had formed with some multinational companies i told him that at the center of this conflict was the fact tha t znoc had expressed an interest to acquire the agip filling stations distribution net work in order to facilitate the znocs ability to have an influence on the petroleum products pump prices i n the country which had been liberalized three man zambian delegation led by mr mwamfuli the then permanent secretary in the ministry of energy and water development with mr fred nzama indeni refinery general manager nd myself dennis mumba znoc chief executive traveled to italy to express the zambian government desire through znoc to acquire the agip filling stations distri bution network and meetings were held with italian government and eni the holding company of agip 15i told mr mwanawasa that on my way from italy after the above eting with agip i passed through london where i was supposed to sign us 35 million il financing facility with standard bank of london the need for this facility wa s created for two reasons the initial projection of the refinery reconstruction moved from the initially anticipated 8 months to 18 months the financing facility structures which were in place in the first 8 months were stand alone facilities which could not be revolved once utilized with the prolonged importation excise therefore there was need to have long term revolving facility the standard bank of london facility was structured in such as way that bank of zambia was going to issue us 10 million guarantee and then subsequent guarantees up to the maximum limit of us 35 million issued as and when the previous guarantees issued by bank of zambia were retired all throughout the negotiat ion the bank of zambia was informed at every stage and there was bank of zam bia undertaking in writing regarding its commitment to this facility however when the tim came for this facility to be signed after i traveled from italy where we expresse d znoc interest to acquire the agip filling stations distribution network miss chilufya mbala sha bank of zambia deputy governor then who had also traveled to london to sign t his facility was suddenly not authorized to sign the facility in the middle of the indeni crisis us 35 million oil financ ing facility between znoc and standard bank of london was therefore aborted because while we w ere in london the then minister of finance dr katele kalumba the current m md national secretary signed further conditionality with the imf and the world bank prohibiting issuance of any guarantees to parastatal companies bank of zambia t herefore backtracked on this us 35 million oil financing facility at the last minute leaving znoc to pay over us 300000 in fees the last minute abortion of this facility caused very serious operational and financial management of the crisis which c ulminated into calls of previously guaranteed facilities to be made on the bank of z ambia which could have been avoided if this facility had been allowed to be implemented i told mr mwanawasa that with hindsight of events the letter of intent with the imf and the world bank was signed so as to not only sabotage the us35 milli on oil financing facility with standard bank of london in the middle of the indeni c risis but also to sabotage znoc strategic plans to acquire the agip filling stations distribution network and to pave way for total international to take over znocs role and profi t potential in the petroleum sector once total international took over the agip shares in indeni refinery i advised mr mwanawasa that there was letter written by t he then minister of finance dr katele kalumba to total international in which letter he d given up the zambian government pre emptive rights to the agip shares in indeni refinery wi thout following the zambia privatization procedures on how pre emptive rights re given up dr katele kalumba had indicated in this letter that the zam bian government was ready to have total international take over the agip shares in indeni refine ry and become strategic equity partner in indeni refinery 16i went on to advised mr mwanawasa that it was in order to avoi d repeat of what happened with the us 35 million oil facility with standard bank of london why znoc management negotiated us 65 million oil financing fac ility with absa bank which did not involve any guarantees being issued by zambian government or bank of zambia and that the illegal zanaco appointment of mr richard mandona lusaka lawyer and partner in permanent chambers as znoc receiver manager was for all purposes and intent intended to sabotage the absa us 65 million oil financing facility like the way the letter of intent with imf and the world bank was used to sabotage the standard bank of london us 35 million oil financing facility i told mr mwanawasa that as part of the scheme to kill znoc there was deliberate attempt to inflate znoc debts i advise him that immediately after mr richard madona was illegally appointed as znoc receiver manager by zanaco tot international lodged in claim for us 116 million through lusaka lawyer miss beatrice mulafwi when what was due to total international was only us 360000 on request for brief by mr richard mandona on the total international claim of us 116 million on behalf of znoc management i detailed reasons to m r richard mandona why the total international claims were false and mr richard mandona appreciated the reasons that znoc management advanced in writing to him and he i n turn sent letter to total international disputing the total international claim of us 116 million i told mr mwanawasa that zambia revenue authority was also being used to create an artificial znoc cash flow constraint by deliberately overcharging zno c petroleum products produced from reconstructed indeni refinery and the persistent refusal by the ministry of finance to reinstate the 25 customs duty on imported finis hed petroleum products imported by oil marketing companies resulting in the znoc faili ng to recapture 90 of the market causing intermittent operations of tazama and indeni it is important to note that almost all institutions that znoc had serious disputes with zra and zanaco were under the control of the ministry of finance and these disputes were not there before and only arose during the tenure of office when dr katele kalumba the current mmd national secretary became minister of finance and national planning and all the imf and world bank letters of intent conditionality with the above stated adverse terms on petroleum sector were signed by dr katele kalumba the current mmd national secretary when he was minister of finance and national planning without consultations with the ministry of energy and water development the report that claimed that i000 fuel tankers were unaccounted for was prepared by miss anna chifungulwa when she was in charge of internal audit of the ministry of fi nance when dr katele kalumba the current mmd national secretary was minist er of finance and national planning the auditor generals office is also under the minist er of finance the auditor general commissioned the znoc audit which resulted in the false audit report on znoc when dr katele kalumba the current mmd national sec retary was minister of finance and national planning 17i told mr mwanawasa sc that the reconstruction of indeni refinery presented an opportunity for znoc to make supernormal profits which came about as result of the following at the end of the importation excise when indeni was reconstructed the rail transportation rate ex rsa was us 21843 per metric ton for gas oil and the pump price prevailing at the time reflected for the recovery of this tra nsport element when indeni was reconstructed the us 21843 per metric ton transport element in the pricing formula was substituted by us 53 per metric ton made up of tazama pumping fee of us 21 per metric ton and us 32 per metric ton indeni processing fee broken down into us 24 processing fee and 65 allowable process lossthere was therefore saving in gas oil transportation of us 16543per metric ton ie the difference between us 21843 and us 54 per metric ton when indeni was reconstructed the situation was the same for other refined petroleum products as well i advised mr mwanawasa that znoc had potential of making us 10 million profit s per every 90000metric tons shipment and since on average 6 shipments were handled every year the company had potential to make profits of about us 60 million per year i cautioned mr mwanawasa that the existence of this profit pote ntial was at the core of transferring znoc role in the oil sector to total internat ional at indeni refinery because the existence of this profit potential was know t the ministry of finance and national planning through financial plans that z noc used to submit to them from time to time so that the same financial plans c ould be submitted to the imf and the worldbank i advised mr mwanawasa that znoc could not reduce the pump price immediately to the level which reflected the reconstructed indeni refinery and tazama pipelines production costs for the following reasons 1 there was need for znoc to recover the replacement cost of the 90000 metric tons of crude oil that was stuck in the pipeline for 18 months during the shut down period this was so because in the 18 months period the world market price of oil had more than doubled 2 it was in the znoc strategic plans that the znoc was going to use the super normal profits to be generated upon indeni reconstruction as result of the above indicated freight differentials to pay all outstanding debts and reduce the pump prices after six months of full operations 3 the actual operational efficiency of the tazama and indeni system had not yet been ascertained for example in the initial periods indeni operational losses were 20 instead of the allowable 65 and the products yields were also not in line with the expectations 4 the zambia revenue authority under the chairmanship of mr emmerneal kasonde was unfairly taxing petroleum products ex indeni at selling price 18while taxing finished imported petroleum products at cost this unfavorable taxation regime had serious consequences on znoc for the following reasons on account of zra adverse taxation of znoc ex indeni petroleum products the znoc tazama indeni system could not recoup 90 of the national petroleum products market coupled with the fact that znoc did not have its own filling stations this market was therefore lost to finished imported petroleum products imported by oil marketing companies resulting in frequent shut downs of tazama and indeni operations b all the super normal profits that znoc generated on reconstruction of indeni as result of the freight differential explained above were held in the form of over taxation by zra consequently hampering znoc strategic plans this situation was further compounded by the fact that zra had issued directive that taxes due on znoc petroleum products sold to oil marketing companies should be paid directly to zra without the money passing through znoc books thereby compromising the audit trail in the accounting of tax revenues i also told mr mwanawasa that the highly publicized claim by z anaco that znoc owned it us 51 million was not true and was also part of the s cheme to kill znoci told him that the correct debt was us 103 million and that zanaco had been practicing false accounting and the differences between znoc and zanaco were m ade up of the following differences 1 us 416504630 overstatement in the values of letters of credits that znoc opened through zanaco 2 us 2636540318 znoc deposits that zanaco deliberately misposted to cover factious entries that zanaco themselves had created 3 k12364142195050 k 123 billion false zanaco created entries posted to unilaterally zanaco created znoc accounts the account numbers of these questionable accounts are 0030240000000681003614000002006100361400000200570030240000000779 0036140000020097 and 0030240000000867 i told mr mwanawasasc that given the false entries and accounti ng that i had seen zanaco practice against znoc i was convinced that there was som ething seriously wrong at zanaco and if the case in which znoc had counter clai med to have the znoc debt at zanaco settled by the courts proceeded to be determi ned by the courts i was certain that zanaco was going to collapse i advised mr mwanawasa sc that in national interests he should do the following 19have the matter involving zanaco znoc and bp settled outside court and use znoc to recapitalise zanaco by the following means the us 65 million absa oil financing facility was structured in such way that absa was only going to have lien on the crude oil in the tazama pipeline that it would finance and 90000 metric tons znocs crude oil in the tazama pipeline would therefore be displaced by the absa financed crude oil and the proceeds realized there from would be approximately us 36 million znoc management and the board would be willingness to pay zanaco more than it was legally entitled to as demonstrated by the fact that in the three party escrow agreement that was signed in october 2001 by zanaco znoc and absa zanaco was going to be paid usd 24 million within one and half months of implementation of the us65 million znocabsa oil financing facility i indicated to mr mwanawasa that in national interests znoc board and management were ready to even let zanaco be paid entire the us 36 million to be realized from the sale of refined petroleum products from the znoc crude oil in tazama pipeline i told him that i was convinced that judgment in the case involving znoc against zra before the revenue appeals tribunal was going to be in favor of znoc because zra had failed to provide any arguments to justify their actions i therefore proposed to mr mwanawasa that further us 10 million would be paid to zanaco from the zra refund to znoc once the judgment was passed while the reminder of the refund of another us 10 million would be used to pay znoc debt to standard chartered bank i went on to proposal that the znoc debt to bank of zambia would then be paid within less than 12 months given the fact that the prevailing selling price of petroleum products at the time was favorable because of the supernormal profits to be made due to the transportation differential explained above which provided znoc with an opportunity to make profits of minimum of us 60 million per year i advised mr mwanawasasc that by allowing znoc implement the us 65 million absa oil financing facility it was not only going to bring about financial stability in the banking sector in zambia but that it would also provide the government with an opportunity to solve the zanaco problem without using public funds to recapitalise it there after then the government could insistitute investigation to determine what could have contributed to the erosion of the capital base at zanaco while both institutions zanaco and znoc would have been preserved i told mr mwanawasasc that the decision by the mmd government to disposal of the 50 shareholding that the zambian government had in bp z limited and agip two biggest oil marketing companies then removed government influence in the distribution and the marketing of petroleum products which gave rise to the cartel machinations which the country has been experiencing regarding petroleum products 20pump price fixing i advised him that it was in an attempt to address the problem of petroleum products pump price setting in liberalized market and the proposed future role of znoc as manager of strategic reserves that the zambian government had committed its self in the hipc programme with the imf and the worldbank that znoc expressed the interest to acquire the agip filling stations distribution network when agip decided to disinvest from zambia i further cautioned mr levy patrick mwanawasasc that transferring znocs role to total international was going to extend the cartel machinations from the downstream petroleum distribution to the upstream petroleum sector as well ie crude oil importation and refining compromising the security of the country in the process i advised mr mwanawasasc that in the letter of intent that the imf the world bank and dr katele kalumba then as minister of finance and national planning signed as part of the hipc conditionality for zambia there was declaration that znoc was going to come out of the oil supply chain and became manager of strategic reserves dr katele kalumba as minister of finance and national planning agreed to this conditionality without stating out the modalities of how the same was to be achieved strategic reserve holder in whatever market be it financial or commodity market has to have sufficient financial muscle to maintain the reserves be able to meet the emergency challenges that would arise from time to time be able to intervene in the market from time to time should the sit uation so dictate i advised mr mwanawasasc that even the imf and world bank conditionalituies of making znoc as manager of strategic reserves would not be attained if the absa us 65 million oil financing facility was not implemented by znoc because such strategic reserve manager role entailed there being common utilization of the tazama pipelines and the indeni refinery by znoc as manager of strategic reserves and the private sector oil companies and without znoc or indeed the government having its own financing capacity the strategic manager role of znoc zambia government would be an illusion because the imf and the world bank would not allow the zambian government to use public funds for oil procurement purposes i advised mr levy mwanawasa sc that this was one of the reasons why znoc management strongly supported the implementation of the absa us 65 million oil financing facility by znoc i went on the tell mr mwanawasasc that the adverse publicity on znoc in both private and government media was based on unfounded allegations and claims and that the same was ostracized by the mmd government as part of the overall strategy to perpetuate the scheme to defraud zambia through the killing of znoc 21i have reason to believe that mr mwanawasasc did not agree with because he asked to recommend to him what he should do immediately to protect the country i told him to write zanaco and standard chartered bank he on his part asked to put in writing all that i had told him but that i should not sign the report he offered that my hand written report could be typed for by his trusted indian secretary whom he claimed kept all his secretes i politely declined this offer by telling him that i would type the report since i was conversant with microsoft word i submitted my typed unsigned report to mr mwanawasa not only once but on two occasions my first report which contained what i have explained above was first given to him on 19th december 2001 and second one on 7th january 2002 after he became president when he phoned and requested to give him another report claiming that he had misplaced the first one when moving into state house below is the exact quotation of mr mwanawasas letter dated 19th december 2001 dear sir rezambia national oil company limited in receivership i have received information that you instructed the person purported to be appointed receiver of this company to proceed with the receivership and dispose of either the entire undertaking or the assets of the company to total international limited i am of the strong view that zambia national oil company limited is very essential and provides strategic service to this nation and it should not be liquidated in light manner and since new administration will come in office in few days time which i am confident i will have the privilege to lead i would be most grateful if you would please let know what you find objectionable to the absa facility which zambia national oil company limited has arranged and under which i understand that payment to your bank and zambia national commercial bank limited could be made within one and half months time i look forward to hearing from you as early as possible yours faithfully signed lpmwanawasa sc mmd presidential candidate copy of this letter to standard chartered bank is attached on annexure1 and 2 similar letter with the same wording was also sent to zanaco on 20th december 2001 i wrote letter to mr richard mandona the zanaco appointed znoc receiver manager informing him that i was proceeding on leave because i was one of the directors who had decided to challenge zanaco the debenture holders who had purportedly appointed him as znoc receiver manager 22on 21st december 2001 mr richard mandona wrote letter advising that he had fired as znoc chief executive on the same day 21st december 2001 i left the country for security reasons only to return around 5th january 2002 when i returned to zambia in january 2002 after the 2001 presidential and parliamentary general elections mr mumba malila told that mr donald chanda znoc board chairman went to his offices on 21st december 2001 and demanded that mr mumba malila withdraw the znoc board action challenging zanaco appointment of mr richard mandona as znoc receiver manager claiming that the action was only taken by without the support of other directors mr mumba malila told that he requested mr donald chanda to put his demands in writing which mr donald chanda did with copy to mr richard mandona zanaco appointed znoc receiver manager mr mumba malila indicated that he could however not effect mr donald chandas directive because the courts were on recess for christmas at the time i was extremely surprised to learn that there was such written instruction from mr donald chanda because immediately after zanaco appointed mr richard mandona as znoc receiver manager on znoc on 30th october 2001 mr donald chanda wrote strongly worded letter of protest to zanaco board chairman mr shimukowa which letter was copied to then energy minister mr david saviye and then finance minister dr katele kalumba mr mumba malila advised that given the letter he received from mr donald chanda he needed to have signed authorization from minimum of three of the five znoc directors in order for him to continue with the case in court and that the pending affidavit to be filed in court be signed by another director other than myself on 9 th january 2002 circular resolution was signed by three znoc directors namely myself dennis mumba dr gchabwera and mr lupunga in which resolution the board resolved to pursue the challenge of the zanaco appointment of mr richard mandona as znoc receiver manager mr lupunga in addition signed the affidavit in reply to zanaco the znoc directors who were not part of this action therefore were mr donald chanda znoc board chairman miss josephine mapoma permanent secretary in the ministry of energy and water development president mwanawasasc rang in january 2002 he told that he had instructed mr kaunda lembalemba his newly appointed minister of energy and water development to reinstate and that mr lembalemba was going to call mr lembalemba called to his office and told that he was going to reinstate if i wrote him letter advising him that i was discontinuing the court action challenging zanaco appointment of mr richard mandona as znoc receiver manager i told mr lembalemba that i was going to respond to him in the afternoon 23after consulting other znoc directors who were part of the court action after consulting mr lupunga i wrote letter to the then minister of energy and water development mr kaunda lembalemba stating that the directors were ready to discontinue the court action as long as an amicable resolution acceptable to both institutions znoc and zanaco was reached i never heard from minister lembalemba again and neither was i reinstated after i gave the above response in the meantime we continued going to court at the first court appearance in january 2002 zanaco lawyers mr mutemwa and mr amos siwila produced mr donald chandas letter in court and wanted to rely on it in order to have the case discontinued by the court stating that the action did not have the board approval our lawyer mr mumba malila countered this by producing the signed circular resolution of the three znoc directors dennis mumba dr george chabwera and mr lupunga it is important to note that all along bpz limited was being represented by mwanawasa and company in the matter and lawyer from mwanawasa and company was in attendance after this judge chibomba directed that there be speedy trial to determine all the three issues at hand namely 1 zanaco claim on the right to znoc receivables from bp 2 quantum of the znoc debt to zanaco 3 legal validity of the zanaco appointment of mr richard mandona as znoc receiver judge chibomba had set 28th february 2002 as the commencement date of speedy trial on or around the 26th february 2002 president mwanawasasc rang and asked to withdraw the court action to challenge zanaco appointment of mr richard mandona as znoc receiver manager saying that he was going to resolve the matter amicably in line with what i had advised him and he asked to make an appointment to meet him at state house once he came back from australia i tol d president mwanawasasc that since the request was coming from him the preside nt i was going to oblige when i told mr mumba malila about the conversation i had with pres ident mwanawasa sc he advised that there was need for the other party zanaco to c onsent to the withdraw because the withdraw on our part alone would not only withdraw zno c defences but also run the risk of paying legal fees to zanaco lawye rs mr malila rang mr mutemwa the zanaco lawyer in order to try and find out discret ely if he had received any instructions to have the matter withdrawn by the consent of the parties from the telephone conversation mr mumba malila had with mr mutemwa it was clear that there were consent withdraw instructions given to mr mutemwa nd mr malila advised not to proceed to withdraw alone and he wrote lett er explaining this 24point saying that president mwanawasasc being lawyer will unders tand since by this time president mwanawasasc was out of the country on his way to australia i gave the letter from mr mumba malila to the president mwanawasas c late brother mr harry mwanawasa to give the letter from znoc board members lawyer mr mumba malila to his brother president mwanawasasc day before trial on 27th february 2002 the then minister of energy and water development mr kaunda lembalemba in president mwanawasa led mmd government dissolved the znoc board thereby removing the locus stand of the znoc boa rd in course number 2001hpc0073 where president mwanawasas legal firm mwanawasa and company was party to the proceeding representing bp z limited it would be interesting to find out how much bp z paid mwanawasa and company for representing them in this course which ended in these particular circumstances mr kaunda lembalembas letter to znoc directors was also like mr dona ld chandas letter copied to mr richard mandona the zanaco appointed znoc receiver manager on 18th march 2002 mr richard mandona the zanaco appointed znoc receiver manager instructed absa to transfer the znocs u 65 million oil financing facility with absa to trans sahara trading tst indicating that the minist er of energy and water development mr kaunda lembalemba had chosen tst as company to procure oil on behalf of zambia according to the auditor general report mr richa rd mandona the zanaco appointed znoc receiver manager had paid himself k816736000 from znoc monies in addition to that he had also lodged in claim for k13111712400 with the illegal appointed znoc liquidator mr george sokota chairman of standard chartered bank and managing partner of deloittes and touche bringing the total amount payable to mr richard mandona to about k14 billion this colossal amount of k14 billion payable to mr richard mandona lusaka lawyer and partner in permanent chambers is not representative of the five months work he did as znoc re ceiver manager because the zanaco deed of his appointment did not provided for paym ent of any such fees this colossal payment of k14 billion to mr richard mandona lusaka lawyer and partner in permanent chambers therefore is for the role he played in channeling minister kaunda lembalembas instructions to absa to transfer the zno cs us 65 million oil financing facility to tst it is not coincidence that tst local representative was mr teta vundamina mr teta vundamina is not only mr kaunda lembalembas friend but is also his next door neighbor in mufulira under the rules of energy regulation board erb company can be given lice nse to deal in petroleum product if such company does not have specified mini mum storage facilities of its own or leased facilities mr george sokota chairman of standard chartered bank and managing partner of deloittes and touche the illegal ly appointed znoc liquidator made paid for advertisements in all the newspapers in z ambia where he claimed not to have had any dealings with tst therefore tst could not have leased the 25znocs fuel terminal from the illegal znoc liquidator mr george sokota chairman of standard chartered bank and managing partner of deloittes and touche the certificate of incorporation of tst made by the ichitos mnb indicated that the registered office of tst was mnb offices in kitweit is therefore highl questionable how the energy regulation board under mr moses nzama and mr hibanjeni i ssued license to tst to deal in petroleum products when tst did not have i ts own or leased petroleum products storage facilities anywhere in zambia at the time mr moses nzama and mr hibanjeni flouted erbs own rules which they were supposed to be enforcing on 28th march 2002 the nchito legal practice mnb through mr chima nchito incorporated tst as foreign company with mnb offices in kitwe as the registered office of tst on 4th april 2002without following the law znoc was purportedly put in new deal mmd government illegal sponsored liquidation on 5th april 2002 the nchito brothers legal practice mnb registered the us65 million oil financing facility debenture on behalf of tst in favor of absa 26th april 2002the revenue appeals tribunal passed judgment in favor of znoc against zambia revenue authority in the mean time president mwanawasa had been using mr mr mute mbo ichitoa lusaka lawyer partner in mnb businessman and task force private prosec utor to try and get information from to implicate former president dr fjchiluba in plunder of zambian economy through znoc i have known mr mr mutembo ichito from the early 1990s when we used to work from the same building zsic premium house when he used to work as junior lawyer for shamwana and company and i worked as an ccountant for zambezi river authority and later on we were neighbors for some time unt il 2001 when he lived at plot 3811 manda hill in the house that he later gave to fdd to use as its secretariat and i lived at plot 3809 on the same manda hill road mr mutembo ichito came to my house several times to try and get information from t implicate former president dr fjchiluba i told mr mr mutembo ichito that the storie s about znoc were untrue and the fact that the znoc liquidation was illegal he then challenged that if the stories were untrue why wasnt i taking any legal acti on i told him that i had lawyer to represent because most of the lawyers were not ready to take up my case and i gave him the example of mrs nellie muti whom mysel f and mrs mwaka samundengu ngoma former znoc company secretary had approached to represent us in an action to challenge the illegal znoc liquidation before mrs nellie muti was appointed chairperson of the anti corruption commission but for reasons best known to herself she could not take up our case mr mutembo ichito then offe red that he could represent through his legal firm mnb it was therefore agreed that mr m r mutembo ichito was going to represent and mrs mwaka ngoma in legal challenge of the znoc liquidation i told mr mr mutembo ichito that if he wanted to pursue plunder he 26should follow up the total international fake claim of us 116 million on the znoc receiver and liquidator mr mr mutembo ichito however later came back to ask to provide him with some other information on plunder that could directly link former president dr fjchiluba because the task force chairman mr mark chona d been stopped by president mwanawasa from following up on us 116 million tota l international claim on znoc receiver and liquidator because total int ernational had financed the mmd in the 2001 presidential and parliamentary electi ons i told mr mr mutembo ichito that i did not have the type of information he was asking for because znoc problems were created when mr everisto kasunga was znoc chief executive i therefore advised him to look at znoc operations during the tenure of mr everisto kasunga for information to link former president dr fjchiluba to plunder i f ever he had any such information later mrs mwaka ngoma and myself met mr mr mutembo ichito at mnb offices where we provided him with information to use in our joint action to chall enge the illegal znoc liquidation we provided mr mr mutembo ichito with all the docum entary evidence relating to this matter including proof that znoc debt at z anaco was us 103 million and the znoc absa us 65 million oil financing f acility documentation mnb proceeded even to prepare the summons and affidavit for mys elf and mrs mwaka ngoma meeting was arranged at mnb offices attende d by myself dennis mumba mrs mwaka ngoma mr mr mutembo ichito mr chima nchit mr patrick matibini and mr mutembo nchitos legal assistant mr songolo to finalize the summons and affidavits for the court action to challenge the illegal z noc liquidation few days later after this meeting mr samuel ngoma former time s of zambia political editor who is mrs mwaka samundengu ngomaznoc company secretarys husband was appointed by president mwanawasa as press secretary at the z ambian embassy in south africa mrs mwaka samundengu ngoma therefore decided not to be part of the court action mr mr mutembo ichito on the other hand kept my documents for over two months and kept on giving excuses among such excuses were that his assistant mr songolo who had been working on the summons and affidavits had left mnb to go and work as company secretary for zambia national broadcasting corporation znbc while i left mr mr mutembo ichito holding on to my documents i procee ded to seek another lawyer to represent finally mr charles chota of lewis n athan agreed to represent on the day the post newspaper run my court affidavit chal lenging znoc liquidation i went to mr mr mutembo ichito at mnb to collect my papers that i left with him mr mutembo ichito told that he had rang his good friend mr amos malupenga at the post newspapers to find out where he got the znoc story from but mr malupenga could not tell him the source of the story mr mutembo ichit went on to tell that he could not represent because mnb had signed an greement with the government were mnb was to prosecute plunders and that the znoc z anaco issue had been referred to them and that if there was any thing i did w rong at znoc he was going to prosecute i told him that he was free to go ahead and i asked him to give my papers back 27it was only later after the above encounter that i came to find out that mnb were the lawyers who actually incorporated trans sahara trading company tst and registered the us 65 million debenture on behalf of tst in favor of absa bank on 25th october 2002 i proceed in my personal capacity as creditor to try and protect our country zambias interests by challenging the illegal liquidation of znoc in course number 2002hp0419 by suing the znoc liquidator before judge imasiku in spite of president mwanawasas mmd government frustrations such as the dissolution of the znoc board by minister kaunda lembalemba so as to remove the znoc board locus stand in legal cause before the courts were the board had challenged the illegal zanaco appointment of mr richard mandona and the direct phone call i re ceived from president mwanawasa himself directing to withdraw the acti on against zanaco among others the affidavit in reply filed in by mr don mac donald british nat ional and now managing director of zambian airways company in which the nchit have substantial shareholding on behalf of mr george sokota chairman of standard chartered bank and managing partner of deloittes and touche the znoc l iquidator indicated that znoc liquidation was members voluntary liquidation t hat was made through special resolution made by members mr emmanuel kasonde and mr boniface nonde at the next court hearing that followed after judge imasiku established that the purported znoc members mr emmanuel kasonde and mr boniface nonde who signed the special resolution were minister of finance and national planning and the cretary to the treasury respectively judge imasiku ordered that the zambian government through the attorney general be adjoined to the course as co defendants with the znoc liquidator the necessary summons and amendments were made to attach the za mbia government as co defendants and i made the following prays 1 declaration that the znoc liquidation was null and void since neither section 308 or 314 was complied with 2 declaration that mr george sokota should not have been appointed because there was conflict of interest because mr george sokota was chairman of standard chartered bank who were one of znoc creditors 3 declaration that the following activities were fraudulent miss josephine mapoma permanent secretary in the ministry of energy and water developments transfer of znoc fuel terminal to indeni refinery now under total outre mer b mr borniface nondes letter appointing mr george sokota as liquidator where he instructed mr george sokota not to consider the crude oil in the tazama pipeline as part of znoc assets 28c mr richard mandona transfer of znoc absa us 65 million oil financing facility to trans sahara trading company mr george sokota was represented by mr vincent malambo and mr sunday nkonde the solicitor general represented the zambian government and i was re presented by mr charles chonta and mr mudenda of lewis nathan at the subsequent hearing judge imasiku directed the parties to fill i n witness statements and documentations i submitted all the documents ranging from the defectiv purported special resolution signed by mr ekasonde and mr boniface nonde where they purported to be shareholders when there were not to all the documents proving that t he quantum of znoc debt to zanaco was us 103 million and not us 51 million as claimed by the government and zanaco and all the signed agreements relating t the us 65 million absa financing facility and evidence that znoc had posi tive us 71 million dollars balance sheet among other evidence and documentation on the defe nse side the liquidator and the government did not submit anything after i submitted the above documentary evidence in court mr george sokota quickly called for creditors meeting under section 311 1 i applied to judge imasiku for an injunction against the creditors meet ing from taking place judge imasiku ruled on 11 th april 2003 that he could not grant the i njunction because mr george sokota had not been sued in his personal capacity in stead of judge imasiku restricting himself to the injunction application he proceeded to even rule that my action was nullity for lack of leave of court supreme court judge dennis chirwa refused to review judge imasikus ruling when the date that had been originally set for the hearing came judge imasiku in his opening address to the parties indicated that he was allowing the ac tion to go ahead because he had realized that the second part of his ruling relating t leave of court was wrong and advised the parties to ignore that portion of his ruling at this stage there was change in the liquidators the new liquidator was mr richard mazombwe managing partner of price waterhouse coopers and his lawyer was dodia upon hearing opening pronouncements by judge imasiku the solicitor general mr sunday nkonde and the liquidator lawyer dodia requested for adjournment so that they could get i nstructions from their clients at the later court appearance the liquidator and the government lawyers reque sted for an indefinite adjournment of the case since they had opted to have the mat ter settled outside court judge imasiku however refused to grant such an application but inst ead gave the parties timeframe of up to 11th november 2003 within which to conclude the negotiations 29the negotiations however failed because i insisted that they should bri ng back the company znoc in addition to having written acknowledgement of all the wrong doings which were committed prior to and during the purported illegal zno c liquidation but the government was only interested in paying off when we went back to court and reported failure in the settlement on 11th november 2003 surprisingly instead of the matter proceeding judge imasiku turn around and said that his earlier ruling on 11th april 2003 that my action was nullity for lack of leave of court still stood judge imasikus refusal to grant injunction against mr george sokota holding creditors meeting has been critised by some lawyers who have indicated that under the rules of the high court judge has powers to attach or detach any person to the proc eedings in the same way that judge imasiku ordered that the zambian government be adjoine d to the proceedings as co defendants with the znoc liquidator some lawyers have argued tha t in the interest of justice judge imasiku should have attached mr ge orge sokota in his personal capacity as co defendant to the proceedings and granted the injunction against the holding of creditors meeting on 11th april 2003 the zambian supreme court has passed ruling with respect to obtaining leave of court in the matter between sachika sitwala versus lima bank limited in liquidation the supreme court held in ruling and i quote we therefore have difficulty in accepting mr sitwalas first argume nts that section 3172 of the companies act the section on which the learned trial judge relied falls in division 135 captioned provisions applicable only to creditors voluntary winding upown emphasis we accept his argument that for section 3172 to be invoke d it had to be established before the court that the respondents winding up was c reditors voluntary winding up falling under division 135 of the companies actconsequentially we hold that there has to be evidence before any court seized with any matter relating to company which is winding up for tha t court to decide whether or not such winding up falls under members voluntary winding up or creditors voluntary winding up there has to be evidence to establish whether or not there was compliance with section 308 or 314 of the companies act it is w ell established principle that he who alleges must prove his allegation i commenced the action to have the znoc liquidation annulled by the courts when mr george sokota was the purported znoc members appointed liquidator i had provide d documentary evidence before judge imasiku of the purported members special resolution placing znoc in members voluntary liquidation and the only affividavit ever filled by the defendants signed by mr don mac donald presently managing director of zambian airways company in which the ichitos of mnb have substantial shareholding on behalf of mr george sokota also stated that the liquida tion was 30members voluntary liquidation signed by members mr emmanuel kasonde and mr boniface nonde with the above documentary evidence before judge imasiku and the defendants affividavit admitting that the znoc liquidation was members voluntary liquidation and the fact that it was on the basis of the contents of the defendant s affividavit that judge imasiku ordered the zambian government to be attached as co fendants with the znoc liquidator it is only judge imasiku alone who can explain w hy he made ruling that my action was nullity for lack of leave of court ruling which is not based on any zambian legal provision judge imasiku himself had before expressly stated that the portion of his ruling tha t dealt with leave of court was wrong and therefore allowed the parties to cont inue appearing before him from 11th april 2003 when he first made the wrong ruling to11th november 2003 when the parties could not reach settlement outside the court l eft lot to be desired about our court system and begs the question if in deed our courts are any longer places of recourse particularly in matters were the new deal mmd government is involved given that the zambian president mr levy patrick mwanawasa sc had personally rang meinstructing to stop court action against zanaco when znoc directors challenged zanaco appointment of mr richard mandona as znoc receiver manager and the fact that energy minister mr kaunda lembalemba had dissolve d the znoc board in order to remove the board locus stand in the case were the zn oc board challenged zanaco actions coupled with the fact that on numerous occa sions i resisted attempts by the solicitor general mr sunday nkonde to have make deal with the government i have every reason to doubt judge imasikus judicial independence from the executive wing of the zambian government in this particular matter given the information that i submitted in court in this course it wi ll be interesting to find out what advise the attorney general of zambia mr george kunda advised t he zambian mmd government on how to proceed in this matter and whether the advi he gave was in the interest of the country i could not appeal to the supreme court against judge imasikus ruling because by this time my personal security and that of my family had became untenabl and therefore instead of appealing against judge imasikos ruling i had to attended t my security concerns the conflict of interest exhibited by mr george sokota the purported znoc liquidator and chairman of standard chartered bank z limited one of znoc creditors and his complete disregard of the law in his appointment as znoc liquidator nd the illegal manner in which he discharged his duties was not an oversight but was liberate and 31was part and parcel of the overall strategy of the international and local forces at pl ay that wanted to have znoc out of the oil supply chain as i have already indicated every time there was an international monetary fund imf and world bank hipc review mission to zambia these missions alw ays used to have meetings with oil marketing companies namely total mobil agip nd bp at worldbank offices in lusaka before any hipc letters of intent were signed with the zambian government the following stringent conditions were introduced in the hipc letters of intent signed by the imf and the world bank with the the n minister of finance and national planning dr katele kalumba the current mmd national secretary that indeni refinery was not going to be re constructed znoc will come out of the oil supply chain and become manager of strategic reserves 25 customs duty on imported finished petroleum products that has always applied since tazama and indeni were constructed in 1969 and was part of the tazama and indeni construction agreements between the zambian government and tazama pipelines and eni group holding company of agip respectively the imf had made it very clear that it did not have the expert knowledge on oil business and was only interested in insuring that the moratorium that the zambi an government had imposed on the taxes applicable on petroleum products by holding various appl icable taxes fixed as way of mitigating the fuel price increases in zambia immediately following the indeni fire disaster was removed and taxes to be appl ied advelerom the imf therefore left the world bank to incorporate all the hipc conditionaliti with respect to petroleum sector the world bank manager responsible for zambia economic programme in washington was french national what is intriguing in the znoc saga is t hat when the above zambia hipc conditional ties on petroleum sector were being superintend on by french national at the world bank in washington we had situation whereby french company total internationals associate company total outre mer company ow ned by total international and with some mmd leaders took over the znoc s role in the oil supply chain as result of the zambian government implementation of hipc conditionalities on znoc which was disguised as liquidation the real reason why there was vehement resistance to the re inst atement of 25 customs duty on imported finished petroleum products was revealed to i n business meeting i had with mr john janes the then managing director of standard chartered bankmr john janes had asked what progress we had made towards the indeni refinery reconstruction when i told him that the indeni refinery was going to commence operations in few months time he told to the face t hat dennis you will not be able to start the indeni refinery because standard chartered bank in botswana 32had just given big loan to botswana company to buy brand new fuel tankers to ferry fuel into zambia and that some of the shareholders in this botswana c ompany were ministers in government these brand new fuel tankers are the tankers in bp colors that ferried heavy fuel oil for bp z to the mines the financial justi fication for the loan was based on the cash flow revenues to be generated from ferrying oil into zambia and if the 25 customs duty was re instated on the imports of finished petrol eum products then the ferrying of the oil imports into zambia was going to be cut off immediately thereby affecting the ability of this botswana company to service its loan to standard bank botswana coincidentally the whole deal for botswana standard chartered bank funded trucks that ferried imported fuel for bp z was structured at the when swana national mr don moloka was bp z managing director the list of creditors that mr george sokota the purported znoc liquidator and chairman of standard chartered bank was forced to distribute at the credit ors meeting held at holiday inn on 11 april 2003 indicated that znoc owed standa rd chartered bank the following amounts standard chartered bank k 39831 927125 standard chartered bank k 30103372200 k 69935299325 payment by zesco k 17850000000 k 87785299325 i came to find out later that zesco was made to pay k17850 billi on to standard chartered bank on behalf of znoc and that is the reason why zesco appe ared on the list of znoc creditors znoc liability to standard chartered bank was about us 8 million which is quivalent to k36 billion the znoc indebtedness to standard chartered bank at the time mr george sokota chairman of standard chartered bank and managing partner of deloittes and touche served as znoc liquidator was indicated as being k877 bil lion therefore there was an overstatement of znoc liability to standard chartered bank by k417 billion the purported appointment of mr richard mazombwe managing partner of pric waterhouse coopers as the creditor appointed liquidator is also null and void for the following reasons for any liquidation to qualify as voluntary winding up be it membe rs or creditors the companys act requires in section 305 1 2 that the company resolves by means of special resolution to wind up voluntary and section 306 states that voluntary winding up starts at the time of the passing of the special resolution the s pecial resolution signed by mr ekasonde and mr bnonde that placed znoc in voluntary liquidation is invalid 33because the persons who signed the resolution ware not shareholders therefore there can never be either members or creditors voluntary winding up in the absence of valid special resolution the purported creditors meeting at which mr richard mazombwe managing p artner of price water house coopers was purported to have be elected to be chosen as liquidator by the creditors did not comply with either section 311 or section 314 of the company act it is also not coincidence that the chairman of committee of znoc creditors is superintended by none other than president mwanawasas colleague in the u niversity of zambia unza land grabbing saga mr edward chisha section 3111 of the company act states that if the liquidator is at any time of the opinion that the company will not be able to pay or provide for the payment of its debts in full within the period stated in the solvency declaration he shall forthwith convene meeting of the creditors and lay before the meeting statement of the assets and liabilities of the company the calling of creditors meeting by mr george sokota under section 311 1 of the act was not within the armpit of this provision of the law since when mr george sokota was purportedly appointed there was valid directors declaration of solvency even if the calling of the meeting under section 311 1 of the act were to be legally valid the voting at the said creditors meeting was not in line with section 3312a which provides that each creditor shall have votes in proportion to the amount of t he balance due to him if voting if any at all did take place then such voti ng did not take into account the proportion of the amounts due to individual creditors section 353 1e state and i quote person who being past or present officer or past or present membe r of company which is being wound up knowing or believing that false debt has been proved by any person fails for period of one month to inform the liquidator thereof shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to fine not exceeding t wo thousand monetary units or to imprisonment for period not exceeding two years or both in line with this section i brought to the attention mr george sokota through letter i wrote him on 25th april 2003 that as past officer of zambia national oil company i knew that the creditors list he was forced to circulate by znoc cre ditors on 11 th april 2003 contained false debts that had been proved by the some creditors like total international us 116 million zanaco us 51 million k14 billion due to the mr richard mandona among others therefore valid voting would have taken place by creditors in proportional interests of various creditors in the midst of such fake and fraudulent claims by some purported creditors 34further meeting could not have been called under section 314 because there was valid resolution for the voluntary winding up of the company since the resolut ion signed by mr ekasonde and mr bnonde was defective because the two signatorie s were not shareholders of the company it therefore follows that like mr george sokota chairman of standard chartered bank and managing partner of deloittes and touche all actions of mr ric hard mazombwe managing partner of price waterhouse coopers in this liquidation are also illegal it is clear from anyone reading the auditor general report that the report iberatively focused only on period of time that i served as chief executive t his report contained extremely serious unfounded allegations this is so because some znoc board members and executive management staff come from certain provinces in zambia that the new deal mmd government does not like and above all znoc board chairman mr donald chanda was special assista nt for economic and national development to president dr ftjchiluba and it is for these reasons why the new deal mmd government used the auditor general report on z noc operations as its mmd government political propaganda tool to supplement its propaganda in private and public media to not only raise extreme hatred emot ions and anger by falsely criminalizing through the press and zambian parliame nt targeted people from certain provinces of zambia that indeed such people had plundered the zambian resources and use this as reason to remove people from these parts of our country from participating in the economic and political governance of zambia while on one hand president mwanawasa allowed the illegal znoc liquidation and the gigantic fraud that followed to take place right under his watch while the wheels of j ustice could not move for those of us that wanted to stop this fraud through the court system president levy patrick mwanawasa is the uncle to mr ken njel eka who saved as znoc director of operations when mr mr everisto kasunga was znoc chief executive president levy patrick mwanawasa is also related to mr shimukowa through kinshi p and is brother in marriage to mr samuel musonda the former zanaco m anaging director the former auditor general who wrote the auditor general report on znoc mr fred siame is cousin to mr kasunga it is important to note that mr everisto kasunga one time served as special assistant to zambias first president dr kenneth kaunda at the same time when the task force chairman mr mark chona was also dr kaundas special assistant for nepotistic reasons the auditor general report was used to shield president mwanawasas nephew mr ken njeleka the znoc director of opera tions under mr kasunga and mr shimukowa and mr mr samuel musonda at zanaco for t he same 35nepotistic reasons mr siame used false auditing as contained in hi s audit report to protect is cousin mr kasunga even though there were extraneous and exceptional events which negatively ffected the znoc performance like 1996 spm problem which was followed by the 79000 tric tons of sludge coming out of the pipeline after the pigging excise of the t azama pipeline during mr everisto kasunga tenure when mr ken njeleka mr president levy patrick mwanawasas nephew was znoc director of operations when miss edi th nawakwi was minister of energy and water development their performance in t erms of transparency corporate governance and operational efficiency can not be compared w ith the time that i saved as chief executive to deserve audit attention all the decisions that i executed when i served as znoc chief xecutive which have been questioned in the auditor general report were approved by the board in line with how oil decisions were made by the boards of the companies that preceded z noc ie zimco and zambia national energy corporation znec which were responsible for oil procurement on the other hand decisions which were made by mr everisto kasunga and mr president levy patrick mwanawasas nephew mr ken njeleka without any zno c board approval have not been questioned in this audit report the chairman of the znoc boa rd when mr everisto kasunga was chief executive was mr romance sampa t he permanent secretary in the ministry of energy and water affairs it is during the time that mr everisto kasunga was chief executive with miss joyce muwo now cha irperson for times of zambia as company secretary that the company operated wi thout the board meetings taking place with spot oil contracts signed by mr everist kasunga and mr ken njeleka president levy patrick mwanawasas nephew who was znoc director of operations under mr kasunga with independent petroleum group ipg of kuwait nd socap of france and jovenna without any board approvals mr everisto kasungas company zamfreight company he has been running with his young brother mr dan kasunga was the local agent for ipg when i did not renew mr ken n jeleka president levy patrick mwanawasas nephew contract as znoc director of ope rations after i became chief executive he went to work as ipg representative in zi mbabwe all the oil transactions which created the znoc debt at zanaco were transacted and either s igned for by mr everisto kasunga or by president mwanawasas nephew mr k njeleka who was znoc director of operations procurement of over 55000 metric tons of unpumpable crude oil which marooned in dar salaam for over 12 months and the 79000 mt of unprocessable sludge coming from the tazama pipeline all happened under mr everisto kasunga and when mr president levy patrick mwanawa sas nephew mr ken njeleka was znoc director of operations when mr everisto kasunga was znoc chief executive he was also board member of bp z limited the biggest znoc client at the same time 36the status of znoc under mr kasungas tenure of office as company chief xecutive with president mwanawasas nephew mr ken njeleka as znoc dire ctor of operations when miss edith nawakwi was minister of energy and water deve lopment is well recorded for three consecutive years ending march 19971998and 1999 the company recorded huge losses by the time mr everisto kasunga was removed the company had negative balance sheet of k138206399319 ie about negative us 60 million using the exchange rate that prevailed at the time the bulk of these liabili ties were dollar denominated included in these liabilities were the znoc debt at z anaco other people who became ministers of energy after miss nawakwi mr sures h desai mr by mwila and mr david saviye all found the problems in the petroleum sec tor at znoc which were left when miss edith nawakwi was minister of energy within three years that i served as znoc chief executive i turned the company round cleared the us 60 million negative balance sheet left by mr eve risto kasunga into positive balance sheet of us 75 million successfully managed the emergency importation of petroleum products for 18 months when indeni was gutted repaid zanaco us352 million to part pay the old debt left by mr everisto kasunga and ken njeleka and negotiated and structured the us 65 million oil financing facility with absa bank again for nepotistic reasons through this auditor general report the new deal mmd government wanted to transfer the zanaco problems to znoc as if the zanaco problems were created by znoc at the time i served as znoc chie f executive mr samuel musonda former zanaco managing director and mr simukowa and i ndeed the entire zanaco board and management should have been made to account for the following 1 us 416504630 overstatement in the values of letters of credits that znoc opened through zanaco 2 us 2636540318 znoc deposits that zanaco deliberately misposted to cover factious entries that they created 3 k12364142195050 k123 billion false zanaco created entries posted to unilaterally zanaco created znoc accounts the number of these accounts in question are 0030240000000681003614000002006100361400000200570030240000000779 0036140000020097 and 0030240000000867 for reasons best know to zanaco board and management zanaco engaged in false accounting and its handling of the znoc account can at best be descri bed as repudiation of accountability and transparency and introduced anarchy in financ ial management issues it is these zanaco acts that the new deal mmd government and the auditor general of zambia have condoned hence their attempt to cover zanaco the big question is why the harried planned privatization of zanaco is melt to cover these acts and the criminal activities committed against znoc and the people of zambia in the name of zanaco 37 the false accounting that zanaco practiced brought about the above differences and raises question regarding how bank of zambia was supervising and monitoring t he operations of commercial banks i have wondered what the reported officials from bank of zambia inspectorate have been doing on the task force on plunder when t he same bank of zambia inspectorate allowed zanaco to engage in the above li sted false accounting entries i should hasten to mention here though that at various meetings that were held dr jacob mwanza was the only person other than myself w ho used to refute the quantum of the znoc debt as quoted by mr samuel musonda the then z anaco managing director and dr jacob mwanza is the only person who used t openly support the implementation of absa oil financing facility by znoc the fact that the auditor general has been silent on the fake znoc debt of k838645 billion as declared by miss josephine mapoma permanent secretary i n the ministry of energy and water development and by expressly acknowledging the zanaco false quantum of znoc debt to zanaco raises very serious questions regarding t he accountability of the mmd government we know that the auditor general report on znoc contained many extremely serious allegations two of examples of such allegations i hereby quote as below 1 it is discernible from the foregoing paragraphs that some of the petroleum products which were ordered and paid for were not delivered according to the interim audit report therefore total of 1000 tankers carrying 35575456 cubic litres of fuel worth us 13853625 in respect of the tanzanian and rsa routes were unaccounted for between the dispatch and the off loading points 2 the feedstock facility agreement was ostensibly to help znoc finance the importation of crude oil however through the subsidiary agreements with tazama indeni zncb and others total became the sole supplier of crude oil the transporter through tazama and the manufacturer through indeni they also became the wholesalers of finished products the proceeds from the sale of oil were mainly for the benefit of total znoc therefore became the agent of total without control over the core business for which the company was established it is evident from the foregoing that the situation was not controlled total will emerge as monopoly in the oil industry and control the supply and eventually the prices of oil in the country and hold the zambian economy to ransom this will inadvertently defeat the original purposes for which tazama and indeni were established the refinery is strategic to zambias economic sustenance and therefore the country should avoid risks associated with price and other manipulations that could be harmful to the national economy under cip and ddu supply contract for finished petroleum products znoc had wi th total international the responsibility to deliver the goods to destinat ion rests with the seller in this case total international therefore if indeed 1000 tanke rs carrying 35575456 cubic litres of fuel worth us 13853625 in respect of the tanzanian and 38rsa routes were unaccounted for between the dispatch and the off loading poi nts as claimed by the auditor general then in line with the cip and dd u incoterms it was total international that was supposed to be held responsible however before answers were provided to any of the allegations raised by the auditor general the new deal mmd government under president mwanawasa handed over the znoc role and profit potential in the oil supply chain to total outre mer at indeni refinery it is clear to all who have been following the unfolding of events in the oil s ector that the adverse effects of the dangers of total monopoly on the zambian economy referre d to in example number two above that the auditor general cautioned about has been created out of the free will of president levy patrick mwanawasa sc after the tst saga even before answers were provided to the auditor ge neral report on znoc and disregarding advise of his then vice president mr enoch kavi ndele as revealed by the published exchange of letters between mr mwanawasa and mr k avindele before the fallout over tst and fully aware of the total international fa ke claim on znoc of us 116 million which was deliberately not mentioned in the auditor general report but which matter i had told president mwanawasa at the mee ting i had with him and also included in my written submissions to him president mw anawasas government killed znoc and delivered the znoc role in the oil supply chain to total outre mer indeni there by creating the total monopoly in the oil s ector with all its attendant adverse effects on the zambian economy as cautioned by the auditor general i was not aware that president mwanawasa was total international l awyer at the time total international was dealing with znoc i only came to be awa re of this fact when it was revealed by former president dr fjchiluba in one of his responses to president mwanawasas charges against him to parliament given what has t ranspired so far regarding the znoc saga there is need therefore to establish what rol president mwanawasa personally played in demise of znoc both before and after he attained the zambian presidency the essence of the grand master plan was for total outre mer t take over the agip shares in indeni refinery as strategic equity partner and take over znoc role and profit potential in the oil supply chain this action served two purposes 1 the scheme was ostensibly to provide means to bank roll the bankrupt mmd political party as evidenced by trans sahara trading company tst payments of money to mmd through former vice president kavindele which money mr kavindele partly passed on to president mwanawasa through the presidents special assistant mr jack kalala when tst had briefly occupied znoc s role in the oil supply chain the payments of moneys by companies with questionable dealings with government to mmd through government leaders as evidenced by tst payments to vice president kavindele has been taken to be normal practice 39by president mwanawasa since he used this same issue at the last held mmd conversation against mr enoch kavindele to the mmd delegates that mr kavindele did not hand over part of the moneys obtained this way to the mmd the total outré mel scheme at indeni was also for personal enrichment of some mmd leaders who held shares through proxies in total outré mer it is because of the private interests of certain zambians in mmd in total outré mer that we had situation whereby while shares in the former agip distribution network filling stations was acquired by total international the agip shares in indeni refinery were acquired by total outré mer and not total international 2 the existence of 2000 kilometer tazama pipeline from tanzania to ndola zambia provides the least cost mode of transporting petroleum products which could not be marched by either rail or road not only into zambia but also the copper mines of the katanga in the congo and northern zimbabwe the take over of znocs role in the supply chain has made total outré mer have the exclusive use of tazama pipelines and its infrastructure and this was the strategic interest of total outré mer international principals as way of expanding their influence in the region this was the essence of the grand master plan and all other things in between like the tst linking znoc to the matrix of plunder as reported by the post newspapers among other unfounded stories and the fact that each time the fake znoc debt to zana co was mentioned znoc was deliberately always mentioned with the disgrac ed indian company that destroyed luanshya ramcoz all these were smokescreens to divert attention from the fraud they had committed by transferring znoc role in the oil sector and profitability from zambians to initial trans sahara trading and lat er on total outre mer at indeni refinery with the auditor general report on znoc operati ons being the mother of all smokescreens the auditor general report on znoc has been used to conceal the mas sive fraudulent activities that has been perpetuated against zambia through the ille gal liquidation of znoc ranging from but not limited to the following from day one of the commencement of the znoc illegal liquidation nei ther mr george sokota chairman of standard chartered bank and managing partner of deloittes and touche nor mr richard mazombwe managing partner of pric waterhouse coopers the illegal liquidators were ever given an opportunity to have the znoc assets the znoc fuel terminal or the 90000 mt crude oil in the tazama pipeline to be under their control in line with the law in letter appointing mr george sokota as znoc liquidator mr boniface nonde directed that the crude oil in the pipeline was not to be considered as part of znoc assets the znoc us 65 million oil financing facility with absa was structured in such way that the 90000 mt of znoc crude oil in the tazama pipel ine was going to be pumped out and the proceeds realized there from of about us 36 million used to pay znoc creditors absa would then have had l ien on the 40crude oil in the tazama pipeline which they would have financed neit her zanaco nor indeed other znoc creditors have been paid from funds realized from sale of znoc assets the us 36 million that must have bee n realized from sale of znoc crude oil in the tazama pipeline has never been used to pay zanaco nor indeed any of znoc creditors and has thus not been accounted for the need to have the us 36 million realized from the znoc crude oi l in the tazama pipeline accounted for is further compounded by the fact that there s been legal battle between the new deal mmd government and tst over ownership of the crude oil in tazama pipeline with tst claiming owne rship of the crude oil in the tazama pipeline and tst saga has been thorn in the sale of zanaco to absa the current hurried momentum to privitise zanaco has got something to do with attempts to the conceal this matter among other reasons as if what is contained above is not enough we have come to witness some bizarre conflict of interest of some people involved in this issue in one way or anotherin the tst case against the mmd government tst lawyer was m r vincent malambo mr malambo was the lawyer to the illegal zn oc liquidator mr george sokota chairman of standard chartered bank and managing partner of deloittes and touche in whom by law all znoc assets were supposed to have been vested including the crude oil in the tazama pipeline which wa s not only the subject of the dispute between the mmd government and tst but was also subject of dispute between myself dennis mumba and the znoc l iquidator in course number 2002hp0419 it is therefore strange that mr malambo was representing tst in case between tst and the new deal mmd gove rnment where tst was claiming title to property crudeoil in tazama pi pelines which property was supposed to have been vested in mr malambos clie nt mr george sokota the purported znoc liquidator miss josephine mapoma permanent secretary in the ministry of energy and water development wrote letter transferring the znoc terminal to indeni soon there after the energy regulation board increased the handling fees tha t the terminal charges oil marketing companies all these terminal fees w hich run into millions of dollars since znoc illegal liquidation have always been c ollected by total outré mer at indeni the liquidators both mr george sokota chairman of standard chartered bank and managing partner of deloittes and touche and mr richard mazombwe managing partner of price water house coopers have never been allowed access to these funds in the president ial election petition one of the witnesses mr xavier chungu former direc tor general of the zambian intelligence service revealed in court the xistence of group of permanent secretaries who were used in order to raise funds for the mmd it is important to note that miss josephine mapoma permanent s ecretary in the ministry of energy and water developments name was mentioned as being one such permanent secretary there is therefore need to establis h whether the illegal transfer of znoc fuel terminal to total outer r at indeni refinery by miss josephine mapoma permanent secretary in the minist ry of energy and water development was therefore done to facilitate pay back to total 41international for the us 116 million fake claim on znoc that total international used to finance the mmd during the 2001 presidential and parliamentary elections that task force private prosecutor mr mutem bo ichito ichito told about miss josephine mapoma permanent secretary in the ministry of energy and water development without getting information from any known znoc official declared that znoc had deficit of k838645 billion without even item izing the purported znoc creditors when she has technical capacity to make s uch declaration the passing of resolution that the zambian government was going to take over this factious debt represent direct theft on the treasury of the zambian republic it will soon be four years since this fraudulent scheme was executed and by which time minimum of us240 million in form of znoc profits would have bee n siphoned out of zambia through either tst or total outre mer indeni honorable members of the public accounts committee of the zambian parli ament i submit to you that zambia has been robbed blind the president levy mw anawasa led the way for then finance minister emmanuel kasonde and auditor genera l fred siame among others to use parliament as forum from which to decisive zam bians with impunity for this despicable fraud to take place since lying in zambian parliament has consequences persons in the government leadership used inside information that came to them through their positions in government regarding the profitability potential of certai n zambian companies including znoc and hurriedly had these companies sold to the ir overseas friends under new coined concept of strategic equity partner i now wish to answer the specific issues raised in the auditor general report page 2 audit limitation auditor general statement it is stated that the state of the company changed from going concern to receivership and was finally placed under liquidation t he audit of znoc commenced in august 2001however on 30 th october 2001 the company w as placed under receivership and the chief executive and the company secret ary were sent on forced leave answer the company secretary mrs mwaka samundengu ngoma and myself dennis mumba the chief executive were not sent on forced leave on 30 th octobe r 2001 as deliberately and falsely alleged by the auditor general but we we re purportedly dismissed by the zanaco appointed receiver manager mr richard mandona lusa ka lawyer and partner in permanent chambers on 21 st december 2001 after the znoc board court summons challenging his appointment were served on him on 16th december 2001i was one of the znoc directors that took the court action i was 42therefore purportedly fired as company chief executive with the company secret ary mrs mwaka samundengu ngoma for the decision we took as management supported by the board of directors to defend and protect the company znoc by challenging the illegal zanaco appointment of mr richard mandonaa lusaka lawyer and partner in permanent chambers as znoc receiver manager see annexure 11 the audit statement made here is deliberate subtle mispresentati on of facts designed to place blame on company management in order to hide or disguise the fraudule nt activities of the powers that be presently in charge of the zambian government there is mention anywhere in the auditor general report of the fact tha t the znoc receivership was on 13 december 2001 challenged in the courts of law by the directors of znoc in course number 2001 hpc0073 where president mwanawasa was the lawyer representing bp z limited and the fact that the matter could not be concluded in courts of law because the locus stand of the directors in the case was removed when the board was dissolved by the minister of energy and water development m r kaunda lembalemba on 27 th february 2002 day before speedy trial to determine not only the legal validity of the zanaco appointment of receiver over znoc but also the quantum of the znoc debt to zanaco historical background page 3 last paragraph auditor general statement due to high costs and other problems encountered cheaper and more reliable method of transportation of petroleum products had t be found this led to the formation under indeco limited of tazama to facilitate the transportation of both finished petroleum products and crude oil imports and inden i to process crude oil into finished petroleum products these companies were crea ted under indeco technical services between 1966 and 1970 and later placed under zambia national energy corporation znec which was created to coordinate issues relating to the energy sector under the overall policy direction of the ministry of s tate participation whose minister was the president the company was also mandated to hold strategic reserves page 11 first paragraph auditor general statement following the decision by government to dissolve zimco in 1994need arose to establish another company to carry out the functions of procuring processing and distributing petroleum products that previously fell under zimoil consequently znoc now in liquidation limited liability company and wholl owned by the zambian government was created answer it is important to note that what is indicated in the auditor genera l statement when he states that the zambia national energy corporation znec when it co ordinated issues relating to the energy was under the ministry of sta participation whose minister was the president the president being referred to here is zambias first 43president dr kenneth kaunda all oil decisions during zambia national energy corporation znec period were made by znec board zimoil did not have corporate status it operated as division of zimco and all zimoil decisions were made by the by zimco board as for znoc all the decisions that i exe cuted at the time i saved as chief executive were made by the board the auditor general claim that znoc was wholly owned by the zambi an government is false through this statement the auditor general created an impression that mr emmanuel kasonde and mr boniface nonde who were minister of finance and secretary to the treasury in president mwanawasa mmd government had the legal right to put the znoc in members voluntary liquidation through the purported membe rs special resolution they signed on 4 th april 2002when in fact they di d not have any such rights because znocs shareholders were zimco in liquidation and professor be n mweene page 13 fourth paragraph audit statement it is stated that during the period from january to october 2001 the board met fifteen 15 times and were paid amounts totaling us 29500 i n setting allowances answer the stated period in which the board is claimed to have met 15 times was difficult one in that this was the initial period of commencement of operations t indeni refinery after 18 months of shut down therefore there was need for the board to meet regularly in order to not only make decisions which affected the company short term operations but also decisions which were going to bring long term stabili ty in the petroleum sector such as approval of the company start up strategy ie normally the company imported 90000mt cargoes but this could not be ordered in the initial stages because the reliability of the spm was uncertain since it was also not opera tional for over 18 monthsthe small off loading facility koj which handles shipments of 45000 mt had to be used initially close monitoring of the indeni and tazama operations the indeni loss in the initial period stood at 20 instead of the normal process loss of 65 and this was source of serious concern risk assessment of the spm had to be made and decisions as to when to use it made decisions on who the suppliers of the initial crude oil supply which invol ved review of the glencore total international among other prospective crude oi l suppliers supply terms decisions on the type of financing facility to put in place that i s review of financing proposals among them interim facilities such as total interna tional feedstock financing facility and absa us 5 million interim fac ility and the review of the pta bank financing facility and the structuring of long term us 4465 million absa oil import financing facility which was very involvi ng to structure and appropriate decisions had to be obtained from the board from time to time to guide management it took about five to six months to struc ture and have all the necessary documentations before the us 65 million znoc oil financing facility with absa bank was finally approved by znoc board page 15 performance of the company the results of the company indicated on page 15 have not indicated the ba lance sheets of the company in the periods indicated however the draft audited accounts for the year ended 31 st march 1999 revealed that the company had negative net wort h of k138206399319 ie about us 60 million the bulk of these liabilities were dol lar denominated answer the negative net worth of the company as indicated above were partly due to the following extraneous and exceptional events 1 in september 1996 the single mooring point spm the offloading facility owned and operated by tanzania harbor authority developed leak in the under water sea piping network such that for over 60 days vessel sea trader carrying approximately 90000 mt of crude oil for znoc could not discharge in addition to the demurrage incurred the country through znoc had to make alternative arrangements to bring into the country finished petroleum products by road and rail however the pump prices of finished petroleum products were not increased to reflect the increased cost brought about by the spm disturbance so as not to adversely affect the macro economic environment in the country znoc was to recover the increased costs over period of time when operations were normalized 2 however before znoc could recover from the spm losses the world bank funded petroleum sector rehabilitation project commenced at the end of year1997 this project involved the rehabilitation of tazama pipelines and the modernization of the znoc fuel terminal in ndola process known as pigging had to be under taken first before the project could commence pigging involved pushing in the pipeline an instrument known as pig which while it is being pushed through the pipeline by crude oil it would not only clean the line but also read the relative strength of the pipeline from which readings the scope of works to be carried on the pipeline were determined this process to be undertaken required steady flow of crude oil more than the normal requirements of the country the world bank tazama rehabilitation project credit did not provide for the financing of crude oil required to push the pig it is for this reason that the us 45 million revolving oil import facility was negotiated with zambia national commercial bank zanaco unfortunately at the end of the pigging excise 79000 mt of sludge came out of the pipeline this sludge could not be processed and represented not only loss in revenues but also increased costs 45preparations of accounts the issue of going concern was explained to the auditors that the losse s were caused by results of extra ordinary events as explained above the accounts for the year ended 31 st march 1999 were also ready but not signed for the same reasons accounts were prepared for the year ended 31 st march 2000 and 2001 beca use this is the period covered during the emergency importation of finished petroleum products after indeni was gutted extra ordinary data was generated by the import ation which needed to be analyzed and reconciled before the accounts could be prepared page 17 service agreements auditor general statement there is statement to the effect that the single customer relationship between tazama and znoc on one hand znoc and indeni on the other made the three companies vulnerable in that one companys operational proble ms were significantly impacted on the operations of the other two companies answer the inter dependence of the three companies has always been there be cause the utilization of the three companies infra structures depend on each other therefore if there is problem ie operational or other wise at any of the three c ompanies that would affect the operations or efficiency of the other two companies as was the case in the following instances break down in the single point mooring spm in 1996 in dar salaa m resulted in shut down of the pipeline and indeni refinery and znoc importation of finished petroleum products the pigging of tazama pipelines in the period 1997 to 1998 resulted in 79000 mt of unprocessable sludge arriving at the indeni refinery and negatively impacted on the operations of the refinery and had serious negative consequences on the znoc balance sheet the gutting of indeni refinery in 1999 resulted in the shut down of not onl indeni refinery but also the tazama pipelines for over 18 months and z noc engaging in unprecedented importation of finished petroleum products indeni refinery can not operate without it having access to the finis hed petroleum finished products storage facilities at znoc fuel terminal the point being illustrated by the above examples is that inter dependenc on each other of these companies can not be avoided however the difference is that under zimco all these companies were under the zimco director responsible for energy who was able to oversee the operations of these companies after zimco demise each com pany znoc tazama and indeni operated as an independent unit independent of each others operations and as result the three companies had way of knowing the problems of the other companies and only come to know the existence of problem aft er it had occurred 46it is observed here that the auditor general report is conspicuously silent about the institution that has taken over znocs role in crude oil procurement and co ordination of cargo delivery pumping and processing and marketing of finished petroleum produc ts and neither has he stated if this interdependence does not exist anymore page 18 last paragraph auditor general statement it is however not clear whether the above losses were within the allowable normal consumption losses of 65 of the processed mounts by indenithe above losses adversely affected the profitability of znoc answer the stated process losses charged to the profit and loss accounts of znoc were within allowable normal consumption losses of 65 excess losses were charged to the indeni current account in the balance sheet as deduction against fee s payable to indeni page 19 under processing fees auditor general statement as can be seen from the table above the outstanding fees as at 31 st december 1995 were k26 billion which rose to k91 bill ion in 1998 and reduced to k39 billion in 2000the delay in settlement of processing fe adversely affected the liquidity position of indeni answer the history of the processing fees is that under zimco indeni used to prepare budget which once approved by the board was used as basis for termining the processing rate which was quoted in zambian kwacha the indeni processing rate of us 21 which was later increased to us 24 per metric ton came after the demise of zimco it has always been held that processing rate of us 21 or us 24 per metric ton was not in line with processing rates charged internationally in fact if you add the process losses the actual rate comes to almost us 32 per metric ton indeni also used to argue that the rate was justified because the refinery capacity utilization was only 600000 mt instead of 800000 operating capacity of the 1100000 mt installed ca pacity it is important to note that the utilization capacity of 600000 mt wa s demand driven limitation the time that the outstanding fees rose to k91 billion in 1998 was when there was problem of sludge as result of pigging of the tazama pipelines auditor general statement however the outstanding fees had increased to k11543118150 as at 31 st october 2001the non payment of fees by znoc had negative impact on the operations of tazama answer the year 2001 was difficulty one since this was the year in whi ch the operations of the refinery had to be tested after completion of reconstruc tion in december 2000the refinery products yield in the initial period was different from what was anticipated such that more heavy fuel oil was produced than gas oil resulting in deficit of projected revenues of about us 2 million further the refinery losses were 47about 20 instead of 65 before refinery stability was achieved during this period indeni got preferential treatment over tazama in terms of payments because indeni was critical factor at the time in the stabilization of the oil supply chain page 23 under purchases of crude oil auditor general statement since the establishment of the indeni oil refinery in 1970zambia acquired its crude oil from the middle east countries such as ira q iran sauda arabia and kuwait the oil was acquired and financed through bilat eral arrangements such as loans and grants from the governments since 1995 however znoc purchased its requirements mainly from two companies that is t he independent petroleum group ipg and socap international socap on alternate basis however from 1998total international total of france was engaged as the sole supplie r of crude oil to the country answer it would have been beneficial if the auditor general in the interest of the public had explained how the mechanism of acquiring oil financed using bilatera l arrangements through loans and grants from government worked he could also have stated why t he mwanawasa government has not implemented oil importation through the mecha nism he has referred to i did not come across any past papers which ever indica ted that oil was ever financed through bilateral arrangements in form of loans and grants from government what i know is that there was financing facility through burga n bank of kuwait in the middle east which facility was guaranteed by bank of zambia however this facility fell through after some time the zimoil balance on the outstandi ng amount that was called on bank of zambia through this facility was transfe rred as part of the znoc liability which liability znoc subquestly paid to bank of zambia contrary to what has been claimed by the auditor general there was change in the way oil was procured under zimco through zimoil from the way oil was procured under zambia national oil company the balance of the oil supply contracts that zimoil had with socap and ipg were transferred to znoc for execution on the demise of zimcothe only change in oil procurement that has taken place since 1969 when the p ipeline and the refinery were constructed has happened under mr mwanawasa government when ts t and total outré mer at indeni refinery fraudulently took over znoc s role and profit potential in the oil supply chain page 24 first paragraph auditor general statement this entails that during 19992000and 2001 the refinery was operating at below half the yearly capacity of 11 million metric tons answer 11 million metric tons is the installed capacity while the ope rating capacity is 800000 metric tons in other words due to the age of the refinery it can not operate at 11 million tons but at 800000 metric tons however zambias demand for pet roleum products is 600000 metric tons per year 48page 27 under evaluation of tender supply of 720000 metric tons of crude oil auditor general statement the cargo was due to be loaded on vessel called olympic serenity between 24 th and 26 th may 1999due to the fire the order had to be ca ncelled consequently total charged an amount of usd 600000 as compensation for marketi ng losses arising from emergency sales and cancellation of the charter party answer as result of the fire that gutted indeni refinery znoc had to declare force majeure situation and advised total international not to proceed wi th the loading on mt olympic serenity on receipt of the znoc declaration and request for cancellation of the loading and in accepting znoc request total international indic ated that they might incur charges in range of about us 600000this was provisional charge that total international had indicated that they might incur as result of the cancellation which was to be claimed against on production of invoices from the third parties who would have charged them such amounts ie the shipper or the harbors authority at the port of loading such claim of this amount was lodged in by total international and this amount was there fore not paid page 28 sport purchases auditor general statement every thing under this heading answer when the refinery was gutted lot of quick decisions had to be made such as cancellation of loading of mt olympic serenity immediate constructi on of rail off loading facilities at znoc fuel terminal attendance to insurance matters etc there was also need to place an order for diesel and petrol to cover the period of mobilization to meet the challenges of the fire at indeni refinery without this order be ing put in place the country run the risk of dry period in diesel and petrol during mobilizat ion because stock position of key petroleum products as at 18 th may 1999the day after the indeni fire was as follows premium petrol 9050 metric tons 27 days domestic kerosene 230 metric tons 5 days industrial kerosene 80metric tons 4 days jet a1 580 metric tons 7 days low sulphur gas oil 70 metric tons 2 days gas oil 10580 metric tons 19 days fuel oil 12400 metric tons 44 days bitumen 1695 metric tons 24 days the total international supply contract was signed on 4 th june 1999 ie 18 days after the accident by which time the gas oil and petrol stock days in t he country would have been 1 day and 9 days respectively clearly if this order was not ma the country would have run out of diesel and petrol by the time supplies under the main cont ract started arriving 49pages 29 and 30 auditor general statement page 29the evaluation committee submitted its recommendations to the chief executive officer ceo of znoc for considera tion and processing to zntb in his recommendation to zntb however the ceo in letter dated 27th may 1999 advised that socap had failed to completely execute the order of 10000 metric tons of gas oil under previous contract and he therefore doubted the capacity of the company to deliver the 40000 metric tons of gas oil as recommended by the evaluation committeeaccordingly zntb awarded the entire contract for both lots to total the board however directed that the prices be negotiated downwards and that the results of the negotiations be reported to the board auditor general statement page 30it was observed that while the evaluation committee encouraged selection of two companies to foster competit ion znoc disregarded that fact and recommended one company at cost us 1271600 more than the company recommended by the evaluation committee but rejected by z noc management this extra cost inadvertently had to be borne by the zambian consumer answer it is pity that the auditor general report has not made any comments on how the importation of finished petroleum products excise was carried out in 1996 when there was problem with the spm in september1996 which was later on fol lowed by fire on the spm on christmas day of the same year if he had reviewed this importation excise he would have reported that socap was given contract to supply 10000 met ric tons within period of one month but ended up supplying only 2000 metric tons over period of four months and the contract had to be terminated for this reason the fire at indeni of 17 th may 1999was preceded by national security threats one to two months before which threats were not secret but public knowledge sinc it was even reported in the post news papers that angola was going to bomb t he indeni refinery as well as the ndola airport given this background the security of supply of petroleum products to the country was of paramount importance it was manageme nts considered view that the issue of socap inability to deliver in 1996 be brought to the attention of the board since all the board members were new in the s ense that they were not there in 1996hence were not aware of this material critical fact the information was therefore brought to the board attention so that whatever decision the board made was arrived at with the full knowledge of all relevant facts managements role was only to make full disclosure of relevant information but the final decision of award rested with the board further socap bid was based on 100 rail delivery ex dar sal aam using tazara rail even though rail rate using tazara was the cheapest compared w ith the rail rate ex rsa tazara had real capacity limitations since tazara did not and still does not have the requisite rolling stock that was required to meet the cha llenge and these constraints were also taken into account total international did give discount of us 450000 on the contract amount 50page 33 auditor general statement all the statements made on page 33 answer what the auditor general refers to as aepem standing for arithmetic average of the high and low of the platts european marketscan is the world m arket price which changes on daily basis and this would change regardless of who the suppl ier is therefore in order to evaluate the competiveness of the bids the world pri ce aepem on bid opening date is taken as the aepem price for bid evaluations purpo ses only therefore once the award was made and contract signed the world price ae pem element in the pricing move in line with the world prices on daily basis it is therefore very unlikely on 24 th may 1999 aepem price of us10350 per metric ton for gas oil 02 used for the evaluation of the tenders would have bee n the same world price for gas oil 02 at the time of the contract as claimed it is important to note that this contract time is not dated but i take it that it relat to the time of loading the product the explanation given for gas oil above is valid for premium as well it should also be noted that during the 18 months period of importation of petroleum products world prices were on steady increase recording the highest prices ever in 10 years at the time page 34 under addendum 1 18 th june 1999 auditor general statement it would seem that the amendment was meant to avoid the reimbursement of us 428461710 owed by total to znoc on the outstanding balance for the purchase of crude oil answer there was stock of feedstock at the tank farm in dar sal aam certified by inspectors its caleb brett on june 31999 whose total cost value was us 627134534this feedstock was sold to total international at this cost with the option for znoc to buy back the same feedstock at the same price subjec t to interest being charged in the future reconciliation of the znoc account with total international as at the time of sale was also done and the net amount payable to znoc was us 428481710the said amount was to be offset against payments due to total international under the contract for the supply of finished petroleum products page 35 under addendum 2 30th july 1999 auditor general statement this amendment effectively changed the quantity of goods delivery schedule and the prices covered by the contract an additional c ommodity was introduced delivery by road was introduced whereas part of the rationale in choosing total as supplier as earlier indicated was that they would deli ver by rail road delivery was more expensive 51answer at the time the decision was made by the board to make the finishe d petroleum products supply contract with total international all the parties concerned were advised that the indeni reconstruction was going to take 8 months from the date of the fire 17 th may 1999 after review of delivery performance of total international particularly tha t they part owned natref refinery situated in johannesburg provided the extra comfort regarding the reliability of supply of petroleum products other refineries in south afric are much further from zambia ie in durban and cape town on the other hand tanzani tiper refinery did not have capacity to supply zambia in fact during the course of importation periodtiper refinery was shut down permanently the board observed that there would be danger in disrupting the logistics tha t had been put in place as there was need for petroleum products stock build up in order not only to prepare for the anticipated increase in demand of petroleum products during the rain season because of increased farming activities during this time of the year but also to avoid being caught up in rail traffic jam due to the maize haulage whi ch was imminent which problem was to be further compounded by rail haulage of copper from the democratic republic of congo it is important to not that the decision to engaged other companies ie those indicated on page 45 of the audit general report to bring in petroleum products was ma at the same time it is true that delivery by road was incorporated in this addendum this c ame up after an objective assessment was made by the board that even if total int ernational had the ability to load 100 of znoc imported petroleum products on rail wagons t he wagons belonged to south african rail way company spoornet which company s erved not only zambia but also zimbabwe botswana and swaziland and they had put limit on the wagons that could be dedicated to zambia for their risk management purposes the capacity of tazara on the other hand was extremely limited due t lack of rolling stock wagons but what ever tazara capacity was available was utilized addendum 6 12 th august 1999 auditor general statement all statements made answer the additional cip deliveries to kitwe mufulira was to cover for liveries to the mines should there be an urgent need to do so the additional rate re presented the normal standard transport rate that oil marketing companies used to pay t ransporters to transport petroleum products from ndola to the indicated destinations znoc never sent any road or rail tankers directly to the named dest inations the rail or road tankers would report to the off loading facilities at znoc fuel termi nal or indeni refinery which was used as znoc agent to receive petroleum products at the time and 52were there was an urgent need for petroleum products in the mine from time to time instead of the road or tail tanker off loading and then the same product reloaded on zambian road or rail tanker for the same product to go to mines through this arrangement when ever an urgent need to make deliveries to the mines arose the same road or rail tanker would then be consigned through to deliver directly to the mines it is important to note that all such deliveries were consigned as sale to the respective oil marketing companies who dealt with the mines since znoc had direct contract with the mines on top of the product cost znoc levied an additi onal transport against the oil marketing companies through this process therefore the incremental t ransport cost from ndola to the other indicated destinations was therefore recovered from the oil marketing companies through whom the products were consigned the same reasoning applied to the heavy fuel oil delivery by rail addendum 3 26 th august 1999 auditor general statement this addendum effectively changed the type of sale from cip to delivered duty unpaid ddu every occurrence of the cip in the c ontract was changed to ddu this had very serious ramifications as it meant tha t total would now deliver the goods to the named locations without payment of any taxes on importation of the goods and the tax had to be paid by znoc the prices were however to remain as quoted for cip this obviously meant that the landed cost of the products at znoc depots had been remarkably increased this also changed conditions greatl disadvantaging znoc and favoring total for instance the payment terms w ere charged from 120 days to prepayment and the title to the goods was to remain t otals despite znoc paying for storage insurance duty import and all other charges includi ng interest on due prepayments answer according to the international chamber of commerce icc guide to incoterms 2000page 133 has defined cip as carriage and insurance paid to named place of destination it also goes to state the following carriage and insurance paid means that the seller delivers the goods to the carrier nominated by him but the seller must in addition pay the cost of ca rriage necessary to bring the goods to the named destination this means the buyer bears all risks and any additional costs occurring after the goods have been so delivered however in the cip the seller also has to procure insurance against the buyers risk of loss or damage to the goods during the carriage the cip term requires the seller to clear the goods for export page 163 of the icc guide to incoterms 2000defines ddu as delivered duty u npaid named place of destinationit also goes to state the following deliver duty unpaid means that the seller delivers the goods to the buyer not cleared for import at the named place of destination the seller s to bear the costs and risks involved in bringing the goods thereto other than where applicable any duty which term includes the responsibility for and the risk of the carrying out of customs formalities and the payment of formalities customs 53duties taxes and other charges for import in the country of destination such duty has to be borne by the buyer as well as any costs and risks ca used by his failure to clear the goods for import on time international chamber of commerce icc guide to incoterms 2000page 24 of this book states the following with respect to the duties connected with xport and import clearance incoterms are based on the main principle that the party best positioned to undertake the function to clear the goods and to pay duties and other costs in connection with export and import should do so thus under all f terms the seller should do what is necessary to clear the goods for export under all c terms the seller assumes the obligation with respec t to export and the buyer assumes the obligations with respect to import under all d terms except ddp the buyer should do what is necessa ry to clear the goods for imports given the above explanations i do not understand how the auditor general got t he view that under the cip contract the supplier total international was supposed to pay taxes and not znoc the fact is that in both instances cip or ddu the im port taxes were borne by the importer in this case znoc and not the supplier in this case total international this amendment was done because the oil prices on the world market was on the steady increase and this fact started affecting the loading schedule because under cip confirmed letter of credit had to be established before any loading coul d take place since title to the product passed from the seller to the buyer upon loading whe reas under ddu there was requirement of letter of credit to be establishe d before loading could take place since the title to the product did not pass to the buyer on loading in zambia demand for petroleum products goes up during the rain season due to increased activities by the farmers the amendment for provision of ddu was to ensure that the country had enough petroleum products in the country to meet the anti cipated demand of the farmers further the same was used to ensure build up of petroleum stocks in the country as part of the preparedness to meet the challenges posed by the y2k computer risk failure associated with the change over from 1999 to 2000 ddu did not replace cipddu deliveries were to be made in addition to cip deliveries the addendum in the whereas stated and i quote whereas the definations article 1the type of sale clause article 2the quantity and delivery of goods articl 4the quantity and quality measurement article 5the delivery clause article 8the price clause article 9the payment clause article 12and the title and risk clause article 16 of the main contract are being amended by addition and new clause taxes article 30 is being added to the main contract 54where securities ie letters of credit were in place loadings were on cip terms and only where there were securities were deliveries done under ddu so that loading programmes were not disturbed again it is only because the auditor general has like i have stat ed before not reviewed how the importation of finished products was done in 1996 when president mwana wasa nephew mr ken njeleka was znoc director of operations if he d done so he would have come across deliveries which were made on what was termed as consignment basis the principal of deliveries under consignment basis is the same as ddu except that consignment basis is not an incoterm and it was for that reason why this term was not used this time and we settled for known incoterm ddu the payment terms did not disadvantage znoc as claimed the 120 supplie r credit still remained the stocks delivered under ddu were to be in znoc storage facilities for maximum number of 120 days from the date of loading if the stocks were up li fted later than 120 days then znoc would be charged interest if the stocks were uplifted earlier than 120 days then znoc was paid interest on the time saved up to 120 days in other words the supplier credit of 120 days was converted into strategic stock position addendum 4 9 th september1999 auditor general statement such quantities to be delivered ddu znoc storage installations in ndola shall remain up to 25000 metric tons it appears as if this was merely new purchase altogether which ne eded to be referred to zntb for normal tender procedures answer total international had put cap on the maximum quantities of petrol eum products that could be supplied under ddu to be maximum 25000 metric tones this amendment confirms what has been stated above that ddu did not replace cip addendum 5 1 st december1999 auditor general statement here the original payment terms of 120 days which were replaced by prepayment conditions in addendum 4 were reinstated this was subject to guarantee to seller being provided by the puchaser to the seller answer this addendum meant that ddu was to be applicable only where there w as security provided by buyer to seller in place at the time of loading where there was security then delivery was to be under cip pages 3839 covering addendums 78 and 9 auditor general statement it was difficult to establish why znoc agreed to use the viamaxa more expensive option as there was shortage of fuel in the count ry at the timeanother statement was made to the effect that it was howe ver observed that the premium of us20968 per mt was higher than the premium of usd 158 per gas oil 55contained in the contract of 4 th june 1999the last statement was that as can be seen from the table above prices were reduced on average by 12 for period of 20 days but were increased by an average of 3 for two and half months answers what has not been mentioned is the fact that rail rates started going up in july 1999 because of the fuel crisis in zimbabwe there were revisions in t he rail rate due to the cost of fuel for the trains when covering the zimbabwe portion of the di stance the problem was further compounded by the wash away of bridges in southern african by cyclone therefore in the months january 2000 there were constant revisions caus ed by alternate routes used between beit bridge route in zimbabwe and the ot her route through botswana it should be noted that bbr rail line which linked beit bridge di rectly to bulawayo had also been commission not long before the revision made by spoornet the south african rail company were as follows spoornet spoornet increase increase rate usd decrease effective to decrease effective to product

indicated on page 38 of the auditor general report as new premium are the rates that were being charged for standard trains after the above spoornet rate revisions it is important to note that standard trai n took 14 days to reach zambia while viamax train took 4 days but the rail rate charged for both trains was the same the viamax train used to take 3 to 4 days to reach zambia and 7 days to reach dar salaam in tanzania this was special trial train which s poornet used to run once every one or two weeks this option was accepted because it manage d to bring in diesel faster than the normal train which used to take 14 days and helped to normalize the kerosene supply which was in short supply most of the time from the curity of supply point of view the country is more secure with petroleum products in the country than in 56transit outside its border jurisdiction this train helped in the y2k preparedness and when the bridges were washed away by cyclone the us 158 rate that has been referred to was tazara rail rate even though tazara offered the best rail rate its capacity to move volumes wa s extremely limited due to lack of rolling stockwagons with the wash away of bridges in southern africa there was need for contingency measures to bring in more products particularly gas oil from the northie tanz ania the rate of us 158 is the tazara rail rate that was the auditor gene ral compared with the negotiated road rate of us 20968 for road deliveries to move 4000 mt of gas oil from dar salaam as already indicated even though tazara rail rate was the cheapest tazara had capacity to move the required volumes due to lack of rolling stock therefore in negotiations with the road transporters it was the ex rsa rail rate that was used in the negotiations since the bulk of products were moved through rsa rail route it is important to note that the distance between ndola dar salaam is basically the same as johannesburg ndola therefore the negotiated road rate of us 20968 per mt to move 4000 mt of gas oil from dar salaam should have be compared to the ex rsa rail rate which was us 20195 per mt at the time additional contingencies put in place to cover the problem of wash way of bridges was to increase the volume of products to move by road ex rsa the road rate that was negotiated was just marginally higher than rail rate at the time for example when the ra il rate for gas oil was us 20195 per mt road rate ex rsa was us 20435 per mt after the spoornet rail rate increase of 1 st april 2000by us 215 per mt on all products we had situation where by the negotiated road rates from both ex tanzania and ex south africa were less than rail rates ex south africa for example after 1st april when spoornet increased rail rate us 215 per metric ton ex rsa the rail rate for gas oil became us 21843 per mt but the road rate ex rsa remained at us 20435kindly find attached on annexure 6 to 10 various letters from south africa rail company spoornet where the above increases in the rail rates as indicated above were advised these spoornet letters were signed by mr alan wesson spoornet account manager for fuel and petroleum the telephone number is 0117744962fax number 01177443288 rosebank south africa pages 39 and 40 addendum 10 13 th november2000 auditor general statement this addendum merely formalized decrease in the fee paid by the purcha ser for storage insurance the inspection fee and the fee paid by seller to caleb brett as per collateral management agreement from 1 to 5 of the value of the stored products effective 1 st march2000howeverthe refinery became operational in june 2000 only 10 of the consignment was delivered by road while 90 was delivered by road 57answer there was requirement for having letter of credit opened in favour of the supplier for deliveries to be made under ddu however the supplier inc urred extra costs like storage insurance and fees to the inspector which were not incurred under cipthe 1 which was charged represented such costs which were later reduce d to 5 after the supplier finally concluded the insurance and inspection agreements with the inspector it is not true that the refinery commenced operation in june 2000the refinery s tated operations mid december 2000the statement that 90 of the consignment cam by road is logistical impossibility since there are road haulage trucks which exist either in zambia south africa or tanzania which could have been dedicated to move the magnitude of petroleum liquid cargo that was moved to zambia in the t ime and neither would have the zambian boarder points of entry been able to handle the ma gnitude of consignment that was moved if what is claimed were to be true t he trueth of the matter is that the south africa government had prevailed on spoornet to dedica more rail wagons to deliver fuel to zambia without the support that zambia recei ved from south african government through spoornet zambia could not have successfully gone through the indeni fire disaster the correct position is that about 75 of the consignment came by rail while about 25 came by road page 40414243 and 44 under the headings discrepancies in the purchase and receipt of fuel finished products not received and interim internal audit r eport ministry of finance and economic development mofed page 43auditor general statement it is discernible from the foregoing paragraphs that some of the petroleum products which were ordered and paid for were not delivered due to poor record keeping and the fact that there were many receiving points of the petroleum products ordered s uch as zccm omcs znoc ndola terminal indeni refinery etc it was diffi cult to determine the extent of losses suffered by znoc as result of the short deliveries page 44 auditor general statement according to the interim audit report therefore total of 1000 tankers carrying 35575456 cubic litres of fuel worth us 13853625 in respect of the tanzanian and rsa routes were unaccounted for between the dispatch and the off loading points answer its is most surprising to note that the auditor general confirmed that 1000 tankers worth us 13853625 went unaccounted for between the dispatch and the off loading points in spite of his own admission of audit limitation s stated on page 4 and i quote due to the complexity of the audit it was not possible withi n the time available and in adequate funds to verify the importation and delivery of finished products from the ports of entry to all the off loading points in zambia reliance was therefore placed on the work of the independent inspectors internal auditors and the reports by zn oc the audit conclusions on the volume of finished products imported and delivered in the country are based on the information and reports obtained from the aforesaid 58secondary it is important to note that there is list of the supposed 1000 unaccounted for fuel tankers worth us 13853625this list of tankers showing the tanker registrat ion number name of the transporter date of loading quantity loaded loading termi nal and independent inspectors certification that the tankers were loaded with l for znoc would have been necessary not only for the purpose of this auditor general report but it could also have enabled authorities to identify transporters that could ve connived in the disappearance of the claimed missing tankers the truth is that such tankers disappeared and it is for this reas on why the list was not provided because they feared reaction and evidence of delivery to be provi ded by the transporters whom they were going to falsely accuse absent of list of 1000 missing tanker the auditor general report is incomplete and the public accounts com mittee of parliament should demand for this list to be provided this claim is at the root of part of the grand scheme to decisive the public and m ake them believe that indeed plunder of national resources did take place at zno c and in the process disguise the fraud that they have committed by closing znoc t he present auditor general annie chifungula was the principal author of the report in which the 1000 missing tankers claim was made when she an auditor was at t he ministry of finance and national planning in order for to further explain this matter kindly allow to define cip and ddu according to the international chamber of commerce icc guide to incoterms 2000page 133 has defined cip as carriage and insurance paid to named place of destination it also goes to state the following carriage and insurance paid means that the seller delivers the goods to the carrier nominated by him but the seller must in addition pay the cost of ca rriage necessary to bring the goods to the named destination this means the buyer bears all risk s and any additional costs occurring after the goods have been s delivered however in the cip the seller also has to procure insurance against the buyers risk of loss or damage to the goods during the carriage the cip term requires the seller to clear the goods for export page 163 of the icc guide to incoterms 2000defines ddu as delivered duty u npaid named place of destinationit also goes to state the following deliver duty unpaid means that the seller delivers the goods to the buyer not cleared for import at the named place of destination the seller s to bear the costs and risks involved in bringing the goods thereto other than where applicable any duty which term includes the responsibility for and the risk of the carrying out of customs formalities and the payment of formalities cust oms duties taxes and other charges for import in the country of destination such duty has to be borne by the buyer as well as any costs and risks ca used by his failure to clear the goods for import on time 59in line with the provisions of cip and ddu when znoc established t hat 53 rail wagons indicated on page 42 of the auditor general report carrying znoc fuel on cip terms worth us 55954824znoc management established to the supplier total interna tional that the said wagons did not reach the designated destination total international agreed with znocs findings and insurance claim was lodged in by total internat ional on behalf of znoc in line with cip terms of sale when it was also established that 55 rail wagons and 4 road tanke rs carrying fuel destined for znoc on ddu terms worth us 63975315 did not reach znoc i n line with ddu terms of sale total international were asked not to invoice znoc in re spect of these 55 rail wagons and 4 road tankers it should be noted here that according to rules that govern rail carriage t he rail company is allowed to decant linking tanker in order to avoid risk of fire and as way of mitigating loss of product due to linkeages it is for this reason why m ost of the show tankers were rail tankers most of which were decanted on the way ven by our own zambia railways whenever linking takers were identified in line wi th the normal trade rail rules such tankers were treated as show in znoc records and the rail way carrier and the supplier had mechanism of resolving such tankers as for road ta nkers few of them were involved in road accidents or other form of operational problems according to the international chamber of commerce icc guide to incoterms 2000page 34 under risk of performance if goods are lost or damaged and i quote another important question concerns the risk of performance in case of the goods become lost or damaged incoterms can resolve who has to bear the risk of loss of or damage to the goods but they do not determine whether the affected party is relieved from his obligation to perform consequently if the seller has undertaken to deliver the goods under any of the d terms and the goods are lost in transit he is still obliged to perform by finding substitute goods as quickly as possible if unforeseen and fortui tous event have caused the loss or damage he may avoid having to pay damages caused to the buyer by the delay but he can not avoid to perform the contract unless he c an be relieved under term of the contract or exceptionally under the applicable law this position supports the way znoc management handled the issue of show rail or road tankers it therefore follows that under cip and ddu the responsibility to deliver the goods to destination rests with the seller in this case total internati onal therefore if indeed 1000 tankers carrying 35575456 cubic litres of fuel worth us 13853625 in respect of the tanzanian and rsa routes were unaccounted for between the dispatch and the off loading points as claimed by the auditor general then in line wit h the cip and ddu incoterms it was total international that was supposed to be held responsible 60we all know that before any explanation was given to the nation regarding these supposed 1000 missing tankers and indeed answers to the various issues contained in this auditor general report were provided by anyone total international through the company it formed in partnership with bankrupt mmd political party and it s leaders total outer mer not only took over the agip shares in indeni refine ry without following the zambia privatization agency rules on how rights to pre mptive shares are given up but was also given the znoc role and profit potential in the oil supply chain this was the essence of the grand master plan and all othe r things in between like the tst the auditor general report on znoc operations linking znoc to the matri x of plunder as reported by the post newspapers among other numerous unfounded post editorial comments on znoc and the fact that each time the fake znoc debt to zanaco was mentioned znoc was deliberately always mentioned w ith the disgraced indian company that destroyed luanshya ramcoz all these were deliberate machinations made to disguise the master plan to transfer massive znoc profits to mmd leaders whose private interest were catered for in total out ré mer at indeni refinery it is this plan that i alerted president mwanawasasc two we eks before he became president of zambia but for reasons best known to himself president mw anawasa when he became zambian president through the actions of himself and his g overnment not only actively participated in making sure that this fraudulent schem went through but also interfered with administration of justice thereby frustrating fforts by those of us that wanted to prevent this scheme from taking place through the court proces s which was the only means we had available president mwanawasa additi onally unleashed massive propaganda against znoc using state machinery in both state and private controlled print media the auditor general report on znoc sadly is als part of political propaganda tool of president mwanawasa to conceal the real mot ive and the truth behind the illegal fraudulent liquidation of znoc through which so far hundreds of millions of united states dollars have been siphoned out of zambia may i take this opportunity to address what has before been reported in za mbian parliament that petroleum products designed for zambia were diverted to zimbabwe in march 2000 there was cyclone in southern africa that wept out bridges in mozambique and in certain parts of zimbabwe beit bridge in zambabwe was therefore closed and all the rail cargo consignment re routed to pass through bos twana into then into zimbabwe through plum tree noczim the zimbabwe national oil compa ny was concerned that since beit bridge was their main route of supply of petrole um products the re routing of the rail wagons through bostwana might affect supply of some of the key sectors in zimbawe mr ncube the then noczim chief executive rang on friday afternoon and told that the information that the rail company bbr had given noczim indicated that the block train in front on the bostwana rail s ystem belonged to znoc while the noczim block trains were behind in the line mr nc ube requested that in order to forestall oil supply problems to key zimbabwean industrial sector they wanted 61permission that once the znoc block train reaches zimbabwe the sa delivered to noczim i advised mr ncube to get in touch with the zambian high commis sion to submit their request through the government diplomatic channel immediately i finished talking to mr ncube mr ben shawa the then zambia deputy high commissioner to zimbabwe rang and to the fuel situation in zimbabwe was desparate as result of the cycl one and that the zimbabwean government had normally requested that we assist them as per request of noczim the zambian high commission in zimbabwe had forwarded the request of zimbabwe on this particular matter to the ministry of foreign affairs in lusaka since there was znoc board meeting taking place on saturday i t abled the noczim request before the board and the board approved that znoc should give the block t rain to noczim as requested because the board felt that in the circumsta nces it was difficult to refuse such request considering that the passage of znoc fuel in through zimbabwe has been very smooth on monday afternoon bbr bulawayo office the company that run the rail system in zimbabweie this is owned by the same people who are now running zambia railways sent fax with details of block train that reached zimbabwe through plum tree after the re routing i authorized bbr to allow the specific wagons in the fax to be delivered to noczim week before former president chilubas immunity was removed by the zam bian parliament i was summoned to zambia police force head quarters i went to the force head quarters with mr constantine chimuka lawyer from ellis and company the police interrogated in the presence of mr siwale an auditor from the ministry of finance i was interrogated on two issues 1 why i signed the ddu contract 2 to explain issue of fuel going to zimbabwe i explained to the officer the reasons why i signed the ddu contract and the circumstances of the block train to zimbabwe as explained above i went on to advise the officer the specific file in znoc offices were he could find the deta ils of the wagons in question i further went on to advise him that it was later establ ished that the block train in question actually did not belong to znoc and therefore znoc stopped following noczim for payment of the block train the police officer asked to go back to the police after three da ys so that he could obtain warn and caution statement from when i reported at the force head quarters the police office dealing with the matter told to go away saying that he would call later but never did from then on 62page 44 under independent inspectors auditor general statements it was observed that due to the non payment of fees its could not provide the relevant reports to znoc to enable them verify the ac tual quantities and the quality of the products ordered loaded at load points and received by indeni answer intertek testing services its agreement with znoc was rvice contract to verify the quality and quantity of petroleum products loaded and discharged and producing reconciliation of loaded quantities to received quantities st ating any differences if any however its reports did not meet their contractual obligati ons when it came to reconciling the quantities it was due to its failure to m eet their contractual obligation that some of the invoices were not paid by znoc pages 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 and 58these pages deals with feedstock facility agreement and related agreements that znoc enter ed into with total international page 57 auditor general statement the feedstock facility agreement was ostensibly to help znoc finance the importation of crude oil however through the subs idiary agreements with tazama indeni zncb and others total became the sole supplier of crude oil the transporter through tazama and the manufacturer through indeni they also became the wholesalers of finished products the proceeds from the sa of oil were mainly for the benefit of total znoc therefore became the agent of tot without control over the core business for which the company was established it is evident from the foregoing that the situation was not controlled total will emerge s monopoly in the oil industry and control the supply and eventually the prices of oil in the country and hold the zambian economy to ransom this will inadvertently defeat the original purposes for which tazama and indeni were established the refinery is strategic to zambias economic sustenance and therefore the country should avoid risks as sociated with price and other manipulations that could be harmful to the national economy on page 57 of the auditor general report is breakdown of how in the period 1 st may 2001 to 30 th april 2002 k2138 billion was realized and distributed as below name amount purpose kbillion total 1765 825 importation of crude oil indeni 133 63 crude oil refinery costs tazama pipeline 102 48 crude oil transportation costs zncb 98 46 partial recovery of znoc debt znoc 40 18 operational needs total 2138 answer while i share and agree with the auditor general comments about the dangers of total becoming monopoly in the oil supply i do not agree that the s tated position 63was created by the feedstock facility agreement and the relate d agreements that znoc entered into with total international the auditor general is again clearly hiding the facts on the ground in order to shield the perpetrators of this fraud who used the name of the government to cover up this despicable fraudulent scheme the prelude to transferring znocs role in the oil supply chain was not t he feedstock financing facility that znoc signed with total international on 27 th april 2001 as claimed by the auditor general but the illegal zanaco appointment of mr richard mandonaa lusaka lawyer and partner in permanent chambers as znoc rece iver manager on 30th october 2001the feedstock financing facility that znoc signed wit h total international was not only cleared by the attorney general but wa s also continued to be used by mr richard mandona when he was illegally appointed as znoc receiver manager by zanaco up to until the time znoc was placed in yet another mmd government sponsored illegal voluntary liquidation on 4 th april 2002 where has it been acknowledged anywhere in the auditor general report t hat the same total feedstock financing facility and the related agreem ents that znoc signed with total international limited was cleared by the attorney gene ral neither has the auditor general also acknowledged in his audit report the fact that myse lf and two other board members dr george chabwera and mr lupunga did all we could to protect the znoc by challenging in the courts of law the illegal appointment of receiver manager by zanaco and the znocs board efforts were only curtailed when the board was dissolved by president mwanawasas mmd government these omissions by the auditor general of material facts is deliberate and designed to sled the public blame innocent management and cover mmd government leaders involvement and role in this saga the false impression of the allegedly distribution of k2138 billion conta ined on page 57 of the auditor general report is yet again futile attempt be the uditor general to decisive zambians in believing that znoc operations were not profitabl and yet the contrary is the case on reconstruction of indeni refinery znoc had potential of making profit veraging us 60 million per year znoc was supposed to be making us 10 m illion profit for every 90000 metric ton cargo delivery on average six 90000 metric tons cargo deliveries are made per year znoc was therefore surposed to be making us 60 mill ion per year i provided president mwanawasa sc with this information regardi ng the znoc profit potential in both verbal and written submissions i made to him bot h before and after he attained the zambian presidency this windfall of profits was created because of the following reasons 64at the end of the importation excise when indeni was reconstructed for example the landed cost per metric ton of gas oil ex rsa was us 21843 per m etric ton and the pump price prevailing in the market at the time provided for the recovery of this transport element when indeni refinery was reconstracted this us 21843 in the pricing formula was going to be substituted by us 53 per metric ton made up of tazama pumping fee of us 21 per metric ton and us 32 per metric ton indeni processi ng feebroken down into us 24 processing fees and 65 allowable losses there was the refore saving in the gas oil transportation of us 16543 per metric ton ie the difference between us 21843 per metric ton and us 54 per metric ton when indeni was rec onstructed the situation was the same for other petroleum products as well it was the existence of this profit potential that created the greed desire in some people to advocate the transfer of znoc role and profit potential to total internati onal at indeni refinery through company they had formed which we have all now come to know as total outer mer which company have some zambians in mmd politi cal party and government leadership in disguised way as shareholders together with t otal international it is because of the private interest of certain zambi ans and mmd in total outer mer that we had situation whereby while the shares in the former agip distribution network filling stations was acquired by total internationa l the agip shares in indeni refinery were acquired by total outer mer and not total international znoc could not reduce the pump price immediately to the level that reflected the reconstructed tazama pipelines and indeni refinery production costs for t he following reasons 1 there was need for znoc to recover the replacement cost of the 90000 metric tons of crude oil that was stuck in the tazama pipeline for period of 18 months during the shut down period this was so because in the 18 months period the world market price of oil had more than doubled 2 it was in the znoc strategic plan that znoc was going to use the super normal profits to be generated upon indeni reconstruction as resulted of the above indicated freight differentials to pay all outstanding debts and reduce the pump prices after 6 months of full operations 3 the actual operational efficiency of the tazama and indeni system had not yet been ascertained for example the initial indeni operational losses were 20 instead of the allowable 65 and the products yields were not in line with the expectations 4 the zambia revenue authority under the chairmanship of mr emmerneal kasonde with mr kelvin donavan expatriate zra commissioner general were unfairly taxing petroleum products ex indeni at selling price while taxing finished imported petroleum products by oil marketing companies at cost had serious consequences on znoc for the following reasons 65c on account of zra adverse taxation of ex indeni petroleum products the tazama indeni system could not recoup 90 of the national petroleum demand requirements this market was lost to finished imported petroleum products imported by oil marketing companies d all the super normal profits that znoc generated on reconstruction of indeni as result of the freight differential explained above were held in the form of over taxation by zra consequently hampering znoc strategic plans this situation was compounded by the fact that zra had issued directive that taxes due on znoc petroleum products sold to oil marketing companies should be paid directly to zra without passing through znoc books compromising the audit trail in the flow of funds in the process through the distorted distribution of the proceeds of k2138 billion as indicate d in this report the auditor general by coniviently omitting inclusion of the k100 bi llion tax refund from zra that was generated from the oil procured under the total feedst ock financing facility the auditor general was again trying to decisi ve zambians into believing that the znoc operations were not profitable if the zra tax refund is incorporated in the table on page 57 of the audit or general report the table would be as below amount namekbillio n purpose total 17650 5625 importation of crude oil indeni 1330 424 crude oil refinery costs tazama pipelines 1020 325 crude oil transportation c osts zncb 980 312 partial recovery of znoc debt znoc 400 127 operational needs tax refund 10000 3187 zra tax refund total 31380 from above table the following can be inferred 1 the k1765 billion used to purchase the crude oil represents 56255 of the total proceeds and amounts accruing to znoc zncb and the tax refund amount to k1138 billion representing 3626 2 the income of znoc was therefore not very minimal and neither was there any loss of control over the source of income as claimed by the auditor general 3 it is also not correct to state that znoc became an agent of total international if znoc was an agent of total international then the zra tax refund would have been paid to total international when the revenue tribunal made its ruling 4 it is also very clear that the znoc business became very profitable after the reconstruction of the refinery 66on page 18 the auditor generals report indicated the various process losses that znoc suffered in the period 1996 to 1999however the auditor generals report has not indicated here that the indeni process loss were about 20 in the i nitial periods after reconstruction the losses only normalized after the refinery stabilized this excess loss had revenue implications further around august 2001 tazama pipelines had spillage of 1800metrictones the indeni refinery excess losses and tazama spil lage have revenue implications which were not incorporated in the auditor generals table it is clear znoc business is very profitable when operations are normal as evidenced by the fact that after indeni reconstruction in december 2000up to the t ime the company was liquidated on 4 th april 2002 the company made profits in excess of k1138 billion with only 10 of the market share znoc however experienced severe cash flow problems due to over taxation for which judgment to the dispute with zra was only passed on 26 the april 2002 t hree weeks after znoc had been put in an illegal mmd government sponsored liquidat ion on 4 th april 2002 the cash flow constraint caused by over taxation could not be ased by the znoc securing other financing facilities because the znoc could not provide its assets as security since this was also locked in yet another state s ponsored legal battle with zanaco procurement of oil is transacted through letters of credit opened and confirm ed by first class banks and not by cash basis in addition to the difficulties t hat the company experienced with zanaco and zra other extreme difficulties encountere d by znoc in arranging for an oil financing facility after indeni refinery was re constructed are as below what was being started up in december 2000 was not only indeni refi nery but the entire zambian petroleum sector system starting with the spm in tanzania the almost 2000 km tazama pipeline and the indeni refinery all of whi ch had been down for period of 18 months the state of the quality of 90000 metric tones of crude oil feedstock that had been stuck in the tazama pipeline for 18 months was suspect further the possibility of leakages on the tazama pipeline was very high because the pipeline had been dormant also for 18 months experiences elsewhere are such that when refineries go through such major rehabilitations particularly when new components are mixed with old components the possibility of such refineries catching fires in the i nertial period of start up is very high the catching of another fire at indeni one we ek after commencement of operations was therefore not comforting to financial institutions in the letter of intent with the world bank and the imf the zam bian government had made commitment to the bank and the imf that indeni refinery was not going to be reconstructed and that znoc was going to come out of the s upply 67chain this commitment on znoc made financial institutions to be he sitant in advancing znoc oil financing facilities the law requires that imported finished petroleum products be charged 25 customs duty when indeni was gutted based on znoc recommendation s way of mitigating cost of oil this duty was reduced to 5however when indeni was recommissioned in december 2000 the ministry of finance and national planning under dr katele kalumba the current mmd national cretary and zra under the chairmanship of mr eg kasonde were resisting reinsta ting this customs duty to 25 in line with the law this fact couple d with the fact that petroleum products ex indeni were taxed at selling price while the imported finished petroleum products were taxed at cost made imported finished petroleum products cheaper than the locally produced petroleum products and the fact that znoc did not have its own retail filling stations distribution network made znoc loss 90 of its market share of the national demand of petroleum products with only 10 of the national demand it was impossible to efficiently operate the zambian petroleum sector system of tazamaindeni and znoc resulting in frequent shutdowns in the system operations faced with the above problems znoc entered into an interim financi ng facility with total international signed on 27th april 2001 as last resort after arrangements with other suppliers like glencore could not materialize due to absence of financing facility zanaco was party to the total financing facility agreement as i have stated before the total international financing facility was also cleared by the attorney general this facility managed to result in the following positive aspects demonstrated to the outside world that the zambian petroleum infrastruct ure starting with the spm tazama pipelines and the indeni refinery was able to work again in the case of spm that it could receive vessels of 90000mt for tazama that the line was able to operate without major leakages allied the fears that the feedstock that was stuck in the pipeli ne for over 18 months had gone into bad spec that the indeni refinery was able to produce again and allied the fire fears associated with the situation indeni was in after shut down of over 18 months in addition to the money paid to zanaco the k100 billion that zra overcharged znoc come from the petroleum products produced from crude oil financed by the total international financing facility it is shame note that in his efforts to spin on behalf of his princ ipals the auditor general could not even put in his report the fact that the us 65 mill ion oil financing facility with absa was arranged structured and negotiated by znoc management the feedstock financing facility with total was an interim fa cility that was used to create confidence of financial institutions in the zambian oil infrastruc ture after the 18 68months shut down while this confidence was being created through the total feedstock facility znoc management embanked on protracted negotiations for long term oil financing facility with absa bank the us 65 million revolving oil financing facility that znoc negotiated with absa was not simple generi c facility but tailor made structured facility designed to meet the needs of all the za mbian petroleum sector stakeholders namely indeni tazama zanaco znoc and its customers covering various technical aspects like oil tender document insurance and stock monitoring generating various related agreements znoc had proprietary right and inte rest to the facility znoc on 27th september 2001 paid absa bank us 50000 through stanbic bank z in order to secure and dedicate the us 65 million credit lines for znoc use the main agreement the us 65 million revolving oil supply credit wa s executed by absa and znoc on 14th september 2001 and the escrow agreement was also executed by absaznoc and zanaco in mid october 2001mr mwambazi zanaco bank deputy managing director and the bank secretary mr amos siwila signed on behalf of zanaco while myself and the company secretary mrs mwaka samundengu ngoma znoc company secretary signed on behalf of znoc this agreement provided for the payment of us 24 million to zanaco within one and half m onths of the implementation of the znoc absa financing facility and zanac was to discharge it security charge over znoc upon payment of this amount znoc manageme nt was mandated by the znoc board to sign the escrow agreement where zanac was to be paid us 24 million immediately on implementation of the facility even though what was due to zanaco was only us 103 million because it was considered that any overpayment to zanaco could be recovered later once the matter was resolved in court and the absa facility provided an opportunity to znoc to come out of the zanaco bondage through letter dated 30th october 2001 absa informed znoc that the us 65 million oil financing facility had been finalized and that the absa bank credit committee approval had been obtained and the facility was ready to be implemented the advantages of this us 65 million oil financing facility were as follows all the proceeds to be realized from 90000 metric tons of znoc crude oil in the tazama pipeline worth approximately us 36 million less direct expe nses was to be used to pay lump sum amounts of us 24 million to zanaco and balance to standard chartered bank in within one and half months payment of other znoc creditors were to be paid from future znoc profits the facility amount of us 65 million was to guarantee minimum of three 90000 mt crude oil shipments depending on the world prices thereby enhancing the security of oil supply to the country the facility provide for prompt payment to service providers indeni and tazama there was dedicated supplier tender documents had been generated under this facility and znoc was about to issue an oil supply tender since the financier and the supplier were going to be different that coul d have provided znoc an opportunity to negotiate better terms with the supplier 69oil marketing companies were to be given seven days credit before paying for their uplifts bank of zambia guarantee was required all the super normal profits that was to be made as result of freight differentials of approximately us 60 million per year was going to be retained by znoc all the documents relating to this facility were forwarded to the re levant ministries ie ministry of energy and water development ministry of finance and nistry of legal affairs the omission by the auditor general to in his report the existence of the us 65 million financing facility that znoc had with absa for which the zno c had even paid us 50000 to abas on 27th september 2001 through stanbic z limited for absa to dedicate the us65 million credit lines for znoc s use is there fore deliberate and part of the strategy to cover up the truth surrounding this matter the sole purpose why znoc was illegally put in receivership on 30th october 2001 was to prevent znoc from implementing the absa us 65 million oil financi ng facility i picked it from conversations with total international officials that the promoters of the scheme to transfer znocs role and profit potential in the oil sector to total internationa l at indeni refinery in the mmd government thought that the znoc absa us 65 million oil financing facility was competing with their sche and if implemented by znoc then their scheme to transfer znoc roles and profit potential in oil sector to total international at indeni refinery would not work the us 65 million znoc absa oil financing facility was therefore seen as threat to the mmd clandestine policy to take over znoc by total outer mer at indeni refinery it is for this reason why the announcement of the zanaco appointment of receiver manager over znoc was made by the then mmd national secretary and minister of informat ion mr vernon johnson mwanga and later when znoc was put in the illegal mmd government sponsored liquidation on 4 th april 2002total outer mer was the first c ompany to be given the znoc s role before tst came into the picture mr vernon johns on mwanga then as mmd national secretary and minister of information in pres ident levy mwanawasas government appeared on zambia national broadcasting televisi on with total outer mer chairman west african mr omar gee promoti ng total outer merthis west african gentleman to date is the chairman of total outer mer at the meeting had with president mwanawasa sc two weeks before he became president i advised him that there was clandestine plan to trans fer znocs role and profit potential in the oil supply chain to total international i advise d president mwanawasa sc that while the agip shares in indeni were changing hands to total international there was side by side well co ordinate mechanis m of using zanaco zambia revenue authority imf and world bank through letters of intent signed with them based on false data coupled with massive mmd government spons ored smear campaign in both private and government owned media to kill znoc and its role and 70profit potential transferred to total international at indeni refinery i ca utioned president mwanawasa sc that transfer of znoc role to total interna tional at indeni upon total international take over of agip shares in indeni refinery was not only going to result in lot of money being siphoned out of zambia but the curity of zambia as country would be compromised not only for now but for foreseeable t ime in the futurei told president mwanawasa sc that the existence of 2000 kilometer tazama pipeline from tanzania to ndola zambia provided the least cost mode of transporting petroleum products which could not be marched by either rail or road not only into zambia but also the copper mines of the katanga in the congo and northern zimbabwe i also told president mwanawasa sc that by total international taki ng over znocs role then total international would have take over the exclusive use of tazam pipelines and its infrastructure and this was the strategic interest of total inte rnational principals as way of expanding their influence in the region at this same meeting with president mwanawasa and in writte n submission that i made to him i told mr levy mwanawasa about the existence of the us 65 million znoc absa financing facility and it is for this reason that he mentione d this facility in the letters he sent to zanaco and standard chartered bank however when mr mwanawasa became president instead reversing the illegal zanaco appointment of receiver manager over znoc or letting the court process determine the matter in the courts of law since the receivership was challenged by the znoc board his mmd government not only removed the znoc board locus stand i n case before the courts by dissolving the znoc board but president mwanawas new deal mmd government also instructed mr richard mandona lusaka lawyer and partner in permanent chambers the zanaco appointed znoc receiver m anager through the then energy minister mr kaunda lembalemba to advise absa that it should transfer the absa znoc us 65 million oil financing facilit to trans sahara trading company tst tst was hurriedly incorporated on 28th march 2002 using the ichito brothers legal firm mnb and inchitos legal firm mnb registered the absa us 65million debenture on behalf of tst in favour of absa on 5 april 2002 the following day after znoc was liquidated on 4th april 2002 it is important to note the k14 billion fees that mr mr richard mandona lusaka lawyer and part ner in permanent chambers was claiming on znoc as fees for the five months pe riod that he served as the znoc receiver manager do not represent fees for the rece ivership duties as the same were not covered by the deed of his appointment but represent the fees due to him for his role in transferring the znoc absa us 65 million oil financing facility to tst the role of the ichito brothers should also be noted the ichito brothers were already actively working with the government on the investigations of plunder and had access to government and znoc records and potential conflict of interest is apparent in their dealings with tst at variance with the law president mwanawasas mmd government dire cted that 90000 metric tons of znoc crude oil in the tazama pipeline was not to be considered as 71part of znoc assets what happened to the proceeds realized from of this crude oil is yet to be established because it later became subject of lega l battle between the mmd government and tst with tst claiming that the crude oil in the ta zama pipeline belonged to it the nation has not been told what happened to the zno c crude oil in the tazama pipeline and indeed where the proceeds from this crude oil went it is important to note here some bizarre conflict of interest of some pe ople involved in this issue in one way or another in the tst case against the mmd government tst lawyer was mr vincent malambo mr malambo was the lawyer to the illegal znoc liquidator mr george sokota chairman of standard chartered bank and managing partner of deloittes and touche in whom by law all znoc asse ts were supposed to be vested including the crude oil in the tazama pipeline which was not only the subject of the dispute between the mmd government and tst but also between myse lf dennis mumba and the znoc liquidator and the government it is therefore strange t hat mr malambo was representing tst in case were tst was claimi ng title to property crude oil in tazama pipeline which property was supposed to have bee n vested in his client mr george sokota whom he had been representing in the case i had against the znoc liquidator and the zambian government again at variance with the law president mwanawasa new deal m md government instructed miss josephine mapoma then permanent secretary in the ministry of energy and water development to transfer the znoc fuel terminal to tot outer mer at indeni refinery soon there after energy regulation board increased the handli ng fees that the terminal charges oil marketing companies from inception of the illegal znoc liquidation all the billions of kwachas that have been raised from the znoc fuel terminal in the form of terminal fees have been paid to total outer mer at indeni refinery and not to the purported liquidators mr george sokota or mr richard mazombwe in the presidential election petition one of the witness mr xavier chungu former director general of the zambia intelligence service reve aled in court the existence of group of permanent secretaries who were used in order to raise funds for the mmdit is important to note that miss josephine mapoma permane nt secretary in the ministry of energy and water developments name was mentioned as being one such permanent secretary there is therefore need to establish whether miss josephine mapoma then permanent secretary in the ministry of energy and wate r developments role in the znoc saga in this particular instance was to fulfill the mmd agenda of raising funds using permanent secretaries in order to facilitate pay back to total international for the us 116 million that task force official and pros ecutor mr mr mutembo ichito told about total international used to finance the mmd during the 2001 presidential and parliamentary elections the auditor general has correctly raised one fundamental point which is valid though directed at wrong facility i will again quote this concern by the auditor general because of its importance total will emerge as monopoly in the oil industry and control the supply and eventually the prices of oil in the coun try and hold the 72zambian economy to ransom this will inadvertently defeat the original pu rposes for which tazama and indeni were established the refinery i s strategic to zambias economic sustenance and therefore the country should avoid r isks associated with price and other manipulations that could be harmful to the national economy it is clear to all who have been following the unfolding of events in the oil s ector that the above dangerous situation that the auditor general was trying to caustion has been created out of the free will of president mwanawasa after the tst saga even before answers were provided to the auditor ge neral report on znoc and disregarding advise of his then vice president mr enoch kavi ndele as revealed by the blame game that was played through the published exchange of letters between president mwanawasa and vice president kavindele after t he fallout over tst and fully aware of the total international fake claim on znoc of us 116 million which was deliberately not mentioned in the auditor general report but w hich matter i had told president mwanawasa about at the meeting i had with him and also included in my written submissions to him president mwanawasa under his watc h allowed the illegal liquidation of znoc and delivery of the znocs role and profit potential to total international there by creating the total international monopoly in the oil sector with all its attendant adverse effects on the zambian economy as cautioned by the auditor general i was not aware that president mwanawasa was total international lawyer at the time that total international was dealing with znoc i only came to be aware of this fact when the former president dr fjchiluba revealed this fact in one of his replie s to the charges raised against him in zambian parliament by president mwanawasa given what has transpired so far regarding the znoc saga there is need therefore to tablish what role president mwanawasa personally played in the znoc saga both before and after he attained the zambian presidency pages 59 60 61 62 63 under znocs indebtedness to zncb page 59 auditor general statement in 1995 and prior to1996 znoc financed the importation of the crude oil from internal resources in 1996the company started facing liquidity problems and therefore resorted to heavy borrowings from financial instit utions in order to finance the importation of oil during the period from 1997 to 2001zn oc entered into financing agreements with zncb stanbic stanchart and ci tibank in order to finance the importation of both crude oil and refined petroleum products answer the draft audited accounts for the year ended 31 st march 1999 revealed that the company had negative net worth of k138206399319ie about us 60 million the bulk of these liabilities were dollar denominated the negative net w orth of the company as i have already indicated before were partly due to extraneous and exce ptional events below 73in 1996 when the spm in dar salaam could not receive znoc ca rgo on bond ship known as sea trader znoc had to make alternative arrangements to bri ng into the country finished petroleum products by road and rail the government however direct ed that the pump prices of finished petroleum products were not increased to re flect the increased cost brought about by the spm disturbance so as not to adversely affect the macro economic environment in additional znoc had to subsidize imports made by oil marketing companies the tazama rehabilitation project credit did not provide for the financing of crude oil required to push the pig it is for this reason that the us 45 milli on revolving oil import facility was negotiated with zambia national commercial bank za naco at the end of the pigging excise 79000 mt of sludge came out of the pipeline this sl udge could not be processed and represented not only loss in revenues but also increased costs oil trading is transacted through by means of letters of credits opened and confirmed by first class banks lines of credits from zanaco were used for the i mportation of crude oil only when mr everisto kasunga was chief executive with preside nt mwanawasa s nephew mr ken njeleka as znoc director of operation the other banks were used for the importation of finished petroleum products following the gutting of indeni refinery when i was chief executive zanaco was never used in the importa tion of finished petroleum products when indeni was gutted through the auditor general report there has been deliberate attempt to try and portray false impression as if the znoc inability to repay zanaco w as caused by way the importation of finished petroleum products was handled when i was chief exe cutive hence the false accusations of loss of 1000 tankers worth us 13 mill ion among others when the truth of the matter is that the us 352 million reali zed from the proceeds of imported finished petroleum products financed by other banks was paid to za naco under my management to liquidate the old debt left by mr everisto ka sunga when miss edith nawakwi was minister of energy and water development page 59auditor general statements an examination of records maintained by znoc showed that the company owed zncb total amount of us5151817918 as at 4 t h april 2002 page 60 is an auditor general statement that on 18th november 1997znoc negotiated line of credit of us 30 million with zncb other c onditions included representation of the bank on the board of directors of znoc page 60 is an auditor general statement that in addition to the us 30 million line of credit on 18th november 1997the bank agreed to refinance znocs working capital by restructuring the overdue debts this facility was guaranteed by the governm ent as security of the loan the bank demanded assignment of all proceeds from oil deliveries by znoc to zccm or the new power division of zccm 74page 61 is an auditor general statement that an examination of the relevant records showed that letters of credit extended to znoc under the us 30 m illion oil import facility

an amount of us 474105854 was outstanding as at april 2001 in respect of us 50 million loan facility however the records maintained by zncb showed that an amount of us 5151817918 was outstanding as of april 2000 resulting in difference of us 410759378 answer there were such records maintained by znoc as claimed by the auditor general further the figures in the auditor generals schedule of letters of credit on page 61 do not add up for example there is explanation of how balance of u s 2973602083 later on came to became us 4741058540 there is also explanation given as to why fictious loans created by zanaco of about us10980000 have been added to us 13598236922 to arrive at us 14698320240 and to be considered as part of letters of credit opened under the us 30 million oil import facility further the claim by the auditor general that the letters of credit extended to znoc under the us 30 million oil import facility up to 26th february 1999 were valued at 75us 14698320240 is not true the correct amount is us 13578955097kindly refer to my schedule below all what the auditor general wrote regarding znoc debt to zanaco is not true but conscious fabrication made in order to use parliament as forum to diss eminate lies to the nation and hide the real motive behind the illegal liquidation of znoc by the mmd government the auditor general was not only provided with bounded information package rel ating to znoc transactions with zanaco by znoc staff i also personal ly had discussion with him which lasted over 10 hours and i provided him with written submissions month before he released his audit report therefore all the mispresentations contained in his audit report were consciously and deliberate made by the auditor general the information package that znoc staff handed over to the auditor genera l revealed that the znoc debt to zanaco as at 31 st october 2001 was us 1031144107this is the same information that i produced in court when i challenged the znoc liquidation this package contained the following information together with the relevant supporting documentation as indicated below there were disputes in the figures prior november 1997 in november 1997 znoc owed zanaco the following figures 76us dollar amount 264005264 balance on 211197 on london collection ac 58h1512505 1082113292 balance on 291197 on loan ac 109355011 1346118556 procurement of oil is normally transacted by means of letters of credi t opened and confirmed by first class banks and not by cash basis to establish letter of credit the applicant would need to provide security to the bank 77on 18th november 1997 zanaco offered znoc an usd 15 million working capital refinancing facility through which facility zanaco restructured the overdue amounts znoc owned it of us 1346118556 referred to above by way of refinancing through an overseas bank on 18th november 1997 znoc signed for an us 30 million oil import facility with zanaco this facility was available for period of 12 mont hs subject to satisfactory review every 6 months the above two facilities ie the us 15 million refinancing facil ity and the us 30 million oil import facility is what is combined and collecti vely referred to as us 45 million revolving oil import credit on 26 th november 1997 znoc signed deed of assignment coupled with power of attorney with zanaco as security to cover these facilities on 28th november 1997 znoc signed unlimited floating debenture in favor of zanaco to as additional security in summary therefore the facility that znoc signed with zanaco on the 17th november 1997 was for us 45 million split into i us 30 million oil import facility ii us 15 million working capital refinancing it is important to note that all these facilities were entered i nto and signed when mr everisto kasunga was chief executive of znoc with miss joyce muw as company secretary kindly note that there was never us 50 million loan facility as claime d by the auditor general but what was there was us 45 million oil import financi ng facility split as indicated above these facilities were secured by the following securities that znoc offered zanaco 1 deed of assignment coupled with power of attorney 2 unlimited floating debenture the us 1346118556 refinanced through the us 15 million working capital had been completely repaid by znoc together with the interest thereon by 18th february 1999 it is important to note that the us 15 million working capital facil ity was not guaranteed by government as claimed by the auditor general but was sec ured by znoc securities namely deed of assignment coupled with power of attorne and unlimited floating debenture and neither was this facility secured by assignm ent of all proceeds from oil deliveries by znoc to zccm or the new power division of zccm as cl aimed by the auditor general since znoc never transacted directly with zccm or the power division all deliveries to the zccm were made through oil marketing companies 78terms of the above oil import revolving facility were as follows the tenure of the facility was for period of 12 months znoc was supposed to pay upfront 30 of the letter of credit value before the letter of credit could be established on the maturity date znoc was supposed to pay additional 20 of the letter of credit value bringing the total repayment to 50 after adding the 30 up front payment made at the time of opening the remaining 50 was refined by the overseas confirming bank the confirming bank would call on zanaco if at maturity of the refinanc ed 50 znoc did not have the required cash cover zanaco would then refinanc and charge libor plus 475 the meaning of above was that during the tenure of the facility znoc w as entitled to revolve utilize the facility as many times as possible as long as the total outstanding letters of credit were within the facility amount ie us 45 llion znoc was required to pay 30 cash upfront before any letter of credit was opened and establ ished there fore by design of the financing facility structure was us315 million 70 of us 45 million there was letter of credit that was opened and establ ished without znoc paying the required 30 cash cover up front with these inbuilt self checking mechanism on the bank exposure to znoc in the facility documentation it is the refore not only inconceivable but practically impossible that znoc could owe zana co us 5151817918 as claimed by the auditor general because for one the financing fa cility amount was only for us 45 million and secondary the structure of the facilit would not allow

november 2001 to 4th april 2002 when znoc was under the management of receiver manager appointed by zanaco additional payments should have been made by the receiver manager mr richard mandona to zanaco to reduce the znoc debt it is worth noting that zanaco charged lot of factious entries penal ty charges funding costs management costs and other charges that were not supported by the law or by the agreement the oil financing facility that znoc signed wi th zanaco together with the unlimited floating debenture provided that zanaco was to charge interest at the rate of libor plus 475 per annum in respect of any amounts that zana co refinanced after maturity of any letter of credit the normal procedure before was that if there was any amount that needed to be finance d in kwacha terms and not dollars then the parties zanaco and znoc would enter into supplementary agreement which agreement spelt out the specific terms nd the interest rate to apply for kwacha loan amounts there was however such supplem ental arrangement that was entered into by zanaco and znoc for the ficti ous charges that zanaco charged zanaco just proceeded to charged lot of factious ent ries penalty charges funding costs management costs and other charges that were not s upported by the law or by the agreement znoc protect to zanaco were disregarded with impunity znoc payments made to zanaco were

us 410759378as claimed by the auditor general but the differences were sum made up of the following us 416504630 overstatement in the values of letters credit charged aga inst znoc us 2636540318 znoc deposits used by zanaco to clear fictious debits k 12364142195050 k123 billion uncleared fictious debits that remained in accounts that zanaco had opened unilateral in znocs name therefore for reasons best known to zanaco board and management zanaco engaged in false accounting and its handling of the znoc account can at best be described as repudiation of accountability and transparency and introduced anarchy in financial accounting and management it is these zanaco acts that the new deal mmd government and the auditor general of zambia have condoned in their attempt to cover zanaco the big question is why znoc came into being on 1st april 1995 mr everisto kasunga was the first chief executive he served as znoc chief executive from april 1995 to december 1998when i took over from him the auditor general has correctly observed on page 57 t hat in 1996the company started facing liquidity problems however any one reading thi s audit report will clearly note that this report has not covered the time mr veristo kasunga served as znoc chief executive but it concentrated on the period dec ember 1998 to october 2001 the period that i saved as znoc chief executive with p resident dr fjchilubas special assistant for economy mr donald chanda as znoc board chairman mr everisto kasunga and the auditor general are cousins miss edith nawakwi was the minister of energy and water development for the most period of mr eve risto kasungas tenure of office as znoc chief executive and mr kasungas right nd man mr ken njeleka who was znoc director of operations is presi dent levy patrick mwanawasas nephew even though there were extraneous and exceptional events which negatively ffected the company performance like 1996 spm problem which was followed by the 79000 metric tons of sludge coming out of the pipeline after the pigging excise of the tazama pipeline during mr kasungas tenure as znoc chief executive with mr ken njeleka mr president levy patrick mwanawasas nephew as znoc director of operations under mr kasunga their performance in terms of transparency corporate governance nd operational efficiency cannot be compared with the time that i saved as chief executive to deserve audit attention it is during the time that mr everisto kasunga was znoc chief exe cutive that znoc operated without the board meetings taking place despite three man board being in placethis board comprised mr romance sampa as board chairman with m r robinson 85mwansa then managing director of zesco and mr everisto kasunga w ith miss joyce muwo now chairperson for times of zambia as company secretary mr eve risto kasunga and president mwanawasas nephew mr ken signed numerous spot oil contracts with independent petroleum group ipg of kuwait and socap of fra nce and jovenna without any board approvals these spot oil contracts were financed through zanaco financing facility the zanaco financing facility was entered into by mr everisto kasunga and miss joyce muwo in their respective positions as chief executive and company secretary respectively the contracts for all the letters of credit worth usd 13598236922 listed on page 61 of the auditor general report opened through zanaco financing faci lity were entered into and signed for either by mr everisto kasunga or by president mwanawasas nephew mr ken njeleka who was znoc director of operations the status of znoc after mr kasungas tenure of office as company chie f executive is well recorded and documented for three consecutive years ending march 19971998and 1999 the company recorded huge losses the audited accounts for the year ended 31st march 1999had negative status of k1382 billion which at the exchange rate prevailing at the time was equivalent to us 60 mill ion the bulk of the liabililities were dollar denominated and included the zanaco liability the znoc debt at zanaco therefore was created when mr everisto k asunga and president mwanawasas nephew mr ken njeleka it is important to note that the first two digits in the letters of credit numbers indicated on page 61 of the audi tor general report represent the year in which the respective letter of credit was ope ned and the information provided clearly shows that these letters of credit were opened during the tenure of office of mr kasunga through the auditor general report false impression has been created li ke the znoc debt at zanaco was created during my tenure as znoc chief executi ve through the importation of finished petroleum products when indeni was gutted hence l the false claims ranging from pricing to loss of 1000 fuel tankers the truth of the mat ter however is that zanaco financing facility was used by mr everisto ka sunga and president mwanawasas nephew mr ken njeleka to import crude oil and the zana co financing facility was never used in the procurement of finished petroleum products w hen indeni refinery was gutted when i became chief executive i not only inherited the us 60 milli on deficit that was left by mr everisto kasunga and president mwanawasas nephew mr ke n president levy patrick mwanawasas nephew mr ken njeleka but five months l ater i had to shoulder the burden of guttered indeni refinery among many success whic h were recorded in the three years i served as znoc chief executive were t he way we handled the emergency importation of petroleum products when indeni refinery was out of service for 18 months us 352 million was repaid to zanaco to c lear the mr 86everisto kasunga old znoc debt from proceeds realized from emergency finis hed petroleum products financed by other banks we wiped out completely the s 60 million deficit left by mr everisto kasunga and put the company in black with positive ba lance sheet of k31041 billion equivalent to us 75 million additionally we had succ essfully negotiated very important oil financing facility that has never before ver been negotiated in the history of the zambian oil sector the us 65 llion long term oil financing facility with absa bank which facility was unashamedly stolen by the perpetuators of znoc liquidation when they formed tst company they us ed like total otre mer at indeni to take over znocs role in the oil s upply chain and siphon million of united states dollars from zambia given what has transpired it is clear that retrogressive backward nepot istic considerations had an overriding consideration over facts because it is clear that relatives of the powers that be starting with mr president levy patrick mwanawasas ne phew and znoc director of operations under mr kasunga and mr mr everisto kasunga at znoc but also zanaco chairman mr shalaulwa shimukowa and mr samuel musonda former zanaco managing director whose wife is related to powers that be have been protected there was also deliberate attempt by lacing through the auditor general report all the short comings of not only mr everisto kasunga and mr njeleka at znoc but also those of mr shimukowa and mr samuel mr samuel musonda at zanaco on zno c during the time that i dennis mumba served as znoc chief executive with mr donald chanda special assistant to president dr ftj chiluba as board chairman be cause we come from provinces that the new deal mmd government does not like this act fitt ed in perfectly with the new deal mmd government political agenda of tarnishing the names of people from these provinces in an effort to remove them from participating in the economic and political governance of our country zambia page 62 auditor general statement verification of znoc indebtedness to zncb carried out at zncb offices in september 2002 revealed that in 1998znoc requested zncb to extend credit facility of up to us 50 million to enable the company enhance its working capital to facility the importation of crude oil in this regard zncb opened letters of credit in amounts totaling us 498 million on behalf of znoc as shown below october 1998 us 166 million december 1998 us 116 million january 1999 us 95 million march 1999 us 121 million us 498 million the security pledged by znoc was unlimited floating debenture over the underlying assets and rights of the company power of attorney assigning all receivables and stocks 87including us 20 million in the pipeline government further guaranteed us 28 million of the debt at the time of the inquiry in april 2002zncb management stated that the full commitment of znoc to the bank was us 5151817918the debt comprised five outstanding letters of credit opened in 1998 and 1999 for total amount of u s 2536201842 inclusive of interest and bank charges of us 365955998 and us 1800855 respectively and other kwacha loans amounting to us 2615616076 answer the only letters of credit which were opened by znoc through zanaco re those amounting to us 13578955079 indicated on page 61 of the auditor general report i am not aware of these additional letters of credit for us 498 million the auditor general would do better to indicate the letters of credit num bers and the beneficiaries of these letters of credit further the only securitie s that were executed by znoc in favor of zanaco are those already indicated above the additi onal securities of power of attorney and assigning of all receivables and stocks incl uding 90000 metric tons of crude oil worth us 20 million in the pipeline and government further guarantee of us 28 million have been quoted in the wrong context and were not give n to zanaco in the manner described but as i have explained earlier further the zanaco balances of us 5151817918 are all wrong in fact at be st represent balances of the factious entries that znoc disputed for not bei ng in line with the facility agreements and the law page 62 auditor general statement that it is also noted that as of january 2002 the ministry of finance and economic development owned k36000000000 by znoc in respect of loan repayment to zanaco by the ministry on behalf of zno c under the loan guarantee answer in 1996when miss edith nawakwi was minister of enegy and water development with mr everisto kasunga as znoc chief executive and president mwanawasa nephew mr ken njeleka as znoc director of operations the single mooring point spm the offloading facility in dar salaam develope d leak in the under water sea piping network such that for over 60 days vessel trader carrying approximately 90000 mt of crude oil for znoc could not discharge in addition t the demurrage incurred the country through znoc had to make alternative arrangements to bring into the country finished petroleum products by road and rail however through government directive the pump prices of finished petroleum products were not increa sed to reflect the increased cost brought about by the spm disturbance so as not to adversely affect the macro economic environment in the country the increased cost s that the company did not recover together with subsidy the company gave to oil ma rketing companies on government behalf amounted to us 28 million the government did not refund znoc for this loss until much later in 1999 when the government decided to issue guarantee for us 28 million in favor of zanaco on behalf of znoc when 88zanaco undertook to release the bp and agip receivables which at the time were pledged to zanaco under the deed of assignment the payment of k36 bi llion by government on this guarantee represented payment of us 10 million paid by the government on behalf of znoc to zanaco leaving balance of us 18 million unpaid on the us 28 million guarantee the payment of k36 billion by gove rnment on behalf of znoc therefore only represented repayment of what was due to znoc from government as result of government directive to znoc not to increase t he pump price in 1996 following the disturbance at the spm what is interesting on t his matter are two points that the auditor general has not reported 1 the k36 billion or us 10 million that zanaco purportedly received from government on znocs behalf through this guarantee zanaco applied these monies ie k36 billion or us 10 million to clear factious debts that it had created against znoc not single kwacha or dollar was applied to clear any genuine znoc debt 2 there was therefore balance of us 18 million remaining on this us 28 million government guarantee to zanaco on behalf of zanaco it is important to note that this us 18 million balance on government guarantee to zanaco was worth much more than the us 103 million that znoc owed zanaco the auditor general therefore should have enquired why the government was eager to take over factious znoc debt of us 51 million before it even clear the us 18 million balance on its earlier commitment pages 64656667686970 these pages deal with financing facilities that znoc utilized during the importation of finished petroleum products after indeni was gutted as indicated by the audited draft accounts for the year ended 31 st m arch 1999znoc had negative balance sheet of about k138 billion ie us 60 million month and half before the indeni fire on 17 th may 1999 znoc had to use the following financing facilities for importation of finished petroleum products standard chartered bank us 12 million stanbic bank us 15 million citi bank us 125 million the above facilities were stand alone ones and not revolving ones meaning that once t he facility was used once its availability was subject to n application being lodged for its usage again once it had been paid for completely the above facility amounts were fully paid for the first time round and further letters of credit opened for the s econd time in the case of standard chartered bank the facility amount were increased to us 20 million 89znoc was advised that the refinery reconstruction was going to take 8 months hence some of the proceeds realized from the sale of finished petroleum products fi nanced by the above facilities were utilized for the following us 12 million to standard chartered bank for the feedstock stuck in the pipeline as the result of the indeni fire us 78 million payments to tazama and indeni during the shut down pe riod for their part services relating to the pumping and process of crude oil be fore 17 th may 1999 fire at indeni refinery us 352 million payment to zanaco for servicing zanaco old debt accumulated from the letters of credit associated with the importa tion of crude oil before the indeni fire us 24 million payment for buy back of crude oil used for the agitation of the pipeline during shut down to avoid sludge formation us 35 million loss in order to claim increased cost of working c apital on the insurance policy us 13 million excess transit loss during importation of finished pet roleum products claimed on total international us 18 million excess storage loss claimed on indeni refinery us 559 shows cip deliveries claimed on total international payments to zanaco have been stated to be us352 million this payment is made up of us 13 million from the us 14 million that bank of zambia guaranteed znoc for facility with citi bank but the proceeds from which net of fees were paid to zanaco and was not used for the importation of oil while k36 billion us10036million dollar equivalent of the amounts paid by ministry of finance as indicated on page 62 of the auditor generals report leaving us12235 paid by znoc from proceeds realized from importation of finished petroleum products therefore when the reconstruction completion period moved from 8 months there w as need to rearrange the financing facility structure into long term one t aking into account the fact that proceeds from the first arrangements had been utilized for t he above mentioned purposes thereby gap had already been created with the full commitment that bank of zambia was going to support the financing facility by means of guarantee znoc negotiated us 35 mill ion revolving oil financing facility with standard bank of london whose guarantee was to be made on piece meal basis as and when the previously guaranteed facilities were retired in the middle of the indeni crisis the us 35 million oil financ ing facility between znoc and standard bank of london was aborted because the finance minist er dr katele kalumba the current mmd national secretary had signed furt her hipc conditionality with the international monetary fund imf which prohibited i ssuance of guarantees to parastatal companies 90znoc therefore had to only await until the refinery commenced operations in order for it to arrange an oil financing facility secured by znoc own assets this is what led to the negotiation of the us 65 million oil import facility with abs to be structured the way it was without any zambian government or bank of zambia guarantee insurance znoc had an insurance policy of k175 billion broken down as below k10 billion for increased cost of working capital k 75 billion for loss of profit in order to claim for the above insurance the claimant znoc had t demonstrate that the loss had been recorded as result of the occurrence of an insured vent in this case the gutting of indeni refinery since for insurance purposes for the above policy the premises of znoc included indeni tazama pipelines and tazama tank farms in dar salaam since any disturbance at any of these premises would affect the operations of znoc znoc therefore submitted documentary evidence to demonstrate that the com pany had suffered loss in the form of increased cost of working capital as res ult of the gutting of indeni this loss is the incremental difference between the cost of importation of finished petroleum products by rail and road as opposed to the cost of obt aining the same from indeni refinery the loss adjusters had advised that in view of the fact that the c ompany had been making losses for the past three years it was going to be difficulty to claim for k75 billion loss of profit after lot of negations zsic and znoc came to an understanding that payment of k6 billion on account of increased cost of working capital would constitute final settlement of the claim and statement of discharge to reflect this underst anding was signed between the parties it however transpired that when zsic re insured the znoc risk wit h their re insurers they had re insured for increased cost of working capital for only k1 billion and not k 10 billion therefore only k 1 billion was paid by zsic very late after the cla im was submitted and the balance of k 5 billion is still outstanding page 72 wasteful expenditure auditor general statement it was observed in this regard that the payment of total amount of k9730000 in legal and bailiffs fees could have been avoided had znoc settled the amount of us 8947611 timeously 91answer the balance of us 8947611 was in favor of miba of congo dr however miba representative came with letters purporting to come from miba head office in congo dr that the said amount be paid by znoc in the name of the representative znoc was apprehensive with this proposed arrangement especially given the fact that there was way to verify the authenticity of the authorized signatories of miba of congo dr decision was taken take that it was prudent to pay the debt through the courts of law as protective mechanism for znoc page 76balance due to ioc this amount had been held because indian oil corporation ioc who at one were engaged as management contractors of znoc fuel terminal in order to m eet the world bank conditionality for the bank funded tazama rehabilitation project which also contained small component for the rehabilitation of the znoc terminal however when ioc left there were some parts of the fuel terminal that had be cannibalized without ioc making good these parts as per the terms of the agreement with them page 77 and 78 fuel levy and customs duty auditor general statement s invoked the provision of section 171 of the customs and excise act and directed omcs to pay every 10 days all taxe s and duties in full zra further directed that the taxes be paid directly to zra through the designated bank accounts as of october 2001no mechanism had been put in place to clear the bts and credits in znocs books in the accounts answer maintenance of audit trail is extremely important in the recording of business transactions in the books of account and avoidance of fraud the zra commissioner general mr kelvin donovan directed around december 2000 just when the refinery was about to be recommissioned that all oil marketing companies were to be paying taxes on petroleum products up lifted from znoc directly to zra by passing znoc this meant that the audit trail for receipts of tax monies from oil marketing companies and payment of the same to zra by znoc was compromised there was way znoc could clear the debits for the amounts invoiced against the oil marketing companies in respect of taxes protest letters were sent to the ministry of finance and national planning and zra by znoc over this directive highting the fact that the system was accessible to fraudulent manipulation but corrective measures were taken additionally zambia revenue authority zra was also wrongly taxing znoc on ex indeni products based on selling price instead of cost of manufacturing as required by schedule 6 of the customs and excise act while on the other hand fi nished petroleum products imported by oil marketing companies were being taxed on cost up t the border point of entry based on schedule 5 of the customs and excise act an unfair situation was therefore created were by more tax was levied on products ex indeni than t hat on imported finished petroleum products znoc management made appeals to the zra 92commissioner general mr kelvin donavan expatriate zra commissioner ge neral and his chairman mr egkasonde against the adverse tax regime on petroleum products produced at indeni when znoc could not get favorable response from the zra commissioner gene ral and his chairman znoc management decided to take the matter to the revenues appeals tribunal on 26th april 2002 three weeks after znoc was purportedly liquidated the revenue appeals tribunal ruled in favor of znoc regarding the basis of determination of products refined at indeni refinery the tax over charge of k468 billion which was to be refunded to znoc was based on the figures c overing the 8 months period from 1st january 2001 to 31 august 2001 when znoc took the case to the tribunal even when the case was before the appears tribunal zra continued taxing znoc for petroleum products refined at indeni based on selling price instead of cost of manufacturing as required by section 6 of the customs and excuse act therefore if figures of the following 7 months september 2001 to 4th april 2002 when znoc was liquidated are taken into account plus interest the tax over charge would be in excess of k100 billion this tax overcharge created severe cash flow constrain on znoc operations the law requires that imported finished petroleum products be charged 25 cus toms duty when indeni was gutted based on znoc recommendation as way of mitigating cost of oil this duty was reduced to 5 however when indeni wa s recommissioned in december 2000 the ministry of finance under dr katele kalumba the c urrent mmd national secretary and zra under the chairmanship of mr eg kasonde we re resisting reinstating this duty to 25 in line with the law coupled with the fact the petroleum products ex indeni were taxed at selling price while the imported finished petroleum products were taxed at cost and the fact that znoc did not have its own retail filling stations outlets made oil marketing companies import and market importe d finished petroleum products than the locally produced indeni petroleum products making znoc loss 90 of its market share of the national demand with only 10 of the national demand it was impossible to efficiently operate the zambia n petroleum sector system of tazama indeni and znoc whose operational efficiency pended on volumes resulting in frequent shutdowns in the system operations without znoc taking the dispute it had with zra over the taxation of petroleum products refined at indeni refinery to the revenue appeals tribunal the entire system of refining crude oil at indeni refinery would have collapsed on account of taxation particularly that this same 25 customs duty on imported finished petroleum products was again reduced to 5 by the government through statutory instrument signed by mr egkasonde as reported in the weekly post of 25 th november 2002 it is important to note that all these matters were deliberately not been reported in the auditor general report page 79 appointment of receiver manager 93auditor general statement as indicated in the foregoing paragraphs the financial situation of znoc worsened such that they failed to honor their obli gations to creditorsconsequently stanchart bank limited one of the creditors threatened to place znoc under receivership in october zncb also one of the major creditors of znoc consulted government on what action to take to protect their interest in znoc following the consultations the managing director of zncb informed the boa rd on 31st october 2001 that the attorney general had appointed receiver from perma nent chambers answer there was threat from stanchart to place znoc in receivership s tanchart debenture was only on bp receivables and not other znoc assets and the refore stanchart bank could therefore not place the znoc under receivership as claimed by the auditor general further the auditor general report has also not mentioned the fact that zanaco appointment of receiver was challenged by znoc directors though the legal validity of the receivership could not be determined in the courts of law beca use on the day before commencement of trial on 27th february 2002the minister of energy and water development mr kaunda lembalemba dissolved the znoc board thereby removing the locus stand of the board in the course it worth noting that the auditor g eneral decided not report on such significant action taken by the znoc board of direc tors to protect the company and how their efforts were frustrated by the mmd government the reasons for the challenge of the receivership were 1 that there were multiplicity of courses by zanaco there had been long standing dispute between znoc and zanaco before the courts of law since february 2001 under cause no2001hpc0073 regarding zanaco claim to bp receivables and znoc counter claim for the reconciliation of the debt bp z was represented in this course by mr levy patric mwanawasa sc of mwanawasa and company when zanaco appointed mr richard mandona lusaka lawyer and partner in permanent chambers as receiver manager over znoc the znoc directors used the same cause to challenge zanaco appointment of receiver manager after two court appearances with the consent of the parties it was decided that all the matters in course 2001hpc0073 be dealt with at the same time and the judge chibomba granted speedy trial to commence on 28th february 2002 day before the speedy trial was to commence the minister of energy and water development mr kaunda lembalemba dissolved the znoc board thereby removing the locus stand of the directors in this cause the directors were therefore denied an opportunity to prove in the courts of law that zanaco did not have any right to bp receivables and nether did it have right to appoint receiver and the fact that the znoc debt to zanaco was us 1031144107 as at 30 th october 2001 2 the board of directors was also further prevented by the action of the energy minister mr kaunda lembalemba from demonstrating in the courts of law that znoc had just conclude us 65 million oil import financing facility to which 94zanaco was party and had signed an escrow agreement of this facility through which agreement zanaco was to be paid us 24 million with in one and half months of implementation of the facility and zanaco had agreed to discharge its securities on znoc once this amount was paid znoc was ready to have zanaco paid us 24 million even though they were only entitled to us 103 million because znoc could not wait until the quantum of the debt was settled in court since the nature of znoc business was such that without financing facilities it was almost impossible to do business the excess payment was to be recovered later all znoc wanted was to free itself from zanaco bondage 3 znoc and total international had entered into feedstock financing facility whose subsidiary agreements was an escrow agreement dated 27th april 2001 which was entered into among zanaco znoc and total international this agreement indicated how zanaco was to be paid from the oil proceeds from crude oil financed under the feedstock financing facility zanaco did not repudiate this agreement before the receiver was appointed oil continued to be processed even under receivership under this financing facility and escrow agreement 4 government had only paid us 10 million to zanaco on behalf of znoc on the us 28 million guarantee that it had issued to zanaco leaving balance of us 18 million yet to be paid it is important to note that the us 18 million balance on this guarantee was more than enough to discharge the us 1031144107 that was due to zanaco 5 that zanaco had not compiled with the following debenture provisions before appointing receiver since none of the following events had occurred the bank had not demanded payment of any money or discharge of any money or discharge of any liabilities secured the company had not ceased or threatened to cease to carry business or an effective resolution had been passed or an order made for the winding up of the company or an encumbrancer had taken possession or receiver appointed of the whole or any part of the assets or undertaking of the company or any distress or execution had been levied or enforced upon or issued out against any of the chattels or property of the company that was not discharged within seven days of being levied the company for the purposes of section 272 of the companies act or any amending or replacing enactment deemed to be unable to pay its debts the auditor general in his false audit report did not bring out any of the bove fundamental issues page 81 appointment of liquidator auditor general statement following the difficulties faced by the company to settle its obligations government as shareholders decided to take over the company bts to 95zncb amounting to about us 52 million the takeover of the debt was m ade through issuance of the bonds in favor of zambia national commercial bank in addi tion government has decided to wind up the affairs of the company in this regard liquidator has been appointed to close the affairs of the company answer just like with the receivership the auditor generals comment on the liquidation of znoc was like it followed natural consequence and as if the law was complied with and yet the entire liquidation was marred with seri ous legal irregularities some of which are as follows this liquidation is null and void because it was made in direct cont ra version of section 305 1 and 2 of the company act which state as follows section 305 1 of the company act provides that company may be would up voluntary if the company so resolves section 305 2 of the company act provides that the resolution shall be special resolution unless the period if any fixed by the articles for the duration of the company has expired or the event if any has occurred on the occurrence of which the articles provide that the company is to be dissolved section 306 of the company act provides that for the purposes of this act voluntary winding up commences at the time of passing of the resolution for voluntary winding up the special resolution to dissolve the znoc had two unknown signatures without any names indicated signed against shareholders on zambia national oil company limited letter head through the affidavit submitted in court case i come t lean that the two signatures on the special resolution belong to mr egkasonde and mr bonifa ce nondethe fact however remains that mr egkasonde and mr boniface nonde si gned the special resolution to dissolve znoc as shareholders on zambia national oil company limited letter head the zambia government were not the sharehol ders of znoc and as such could not place the company in voluntary liquidation t he shareholders were zimco in liquidation represented by mr brian musonda and professor ben mweene section 3081 of the company act provide that where it is proposed to wind up company voluntarily the directors of the company may before the date on which notices of the meeting at which the resolution for the winding up of the company is proposed are sent out at meeting of directors make written declaration to the effect that they have made full inquiry into the affairs of the company and have formed the opinion that the company will be able to pay its debts and liabilities in full within pe riod specified in the declaration being period of not more than twelve months after the comm encement of the winding up section 308 2 of the company act provide that there shall be attached to the declaration statement of affairs of the company showing 96a the assets of the company and the total amount expected to be realized there from b the liabilities of the company and c the estimated expenses of winding up made up to the latest practicable date before the making of the declaration section 308 3 of the company act provides that the declaration shall ve effect for the purposes of this act unless it is made at the meeting of directors referred to in subsection 1 b it is made less than five weeks before the passing of the resolution for voluntary winding up and c it is lodged with the registrar on or before the date on which the notices of the meeting at which the resolution for the winding up of the company is to be proposed are sent out miss josephine mapoma permanent secretary in the ministry of energy and water development purported to make directors declaration of solvency instead of as required by the act under section 308 but made it under section 289 of the companie s act which deals with the powers of the liquidator miss josephine mapoma permane nt secretary in the ministry of energy and water development declared that the z noc deficit was k838645 billion and further claimed that the shareholders had agreed to et in full all the debts and obligations of the company miss josephine mapoma permanent secretary in the ministry of energy and water development declaration falls short of the standards set by section 308 3 for declaration of solvency to be valid in that miss josephine mapoma p ermanent secretary in the ministry of energy and water development was not director of the company at the time she signed the declaration since the board had been dissolve d on 27th february 2002therefore the capacity in which she signed this declaration is quest ionable further there was directors meeting as required by the act and neither did permanent secretary in the ministry of energy and water development obtain the declared deficit from known company officers despite her not having the technical capacity t provide or justify such colossal deficit further miss josephine mapoma perm anent secretary in the ministry of energy and water development declaration did not menti on and itemize who the purported znoc creditors were and which znoc assets were used in arrivi ng at the declared deficit of k838645 billion neither was this declaration made five weeks before the passing of the purported special resolution as required by the act but was made weeks after the passing of the said special resolution that liquidated znoc on realizing that the purport declaration of solvency by miss josephine m apoma permanent secretary in the ministry of energy and water development was invalid in law the purported shareholders passed ordinary resolution of the shareholders made under section 321c in which they promised to capitalize the company up to the full extent of the debt the ordinary resolution of the shareholders made under sect ion 321c 97can not be held as solvency declaration as errously referred to by mr george sokota chairman of standard chartered bank and managing partner of deloittes in the notice of meeting of creditors called under section 311 of the act section 321 deals with the powers and duties of liquidators and section 321 states the liquidator may convene meetings of the company for the purpose of obtaining the sanction of the company in respect of any matter or for any other purpose he thinks fit the declaration of solvency is made in respect of the company abilit to generate funds from its assets and operations to meet the debts within twelve mont hs from the time it is put in liquidation the declaration of solvency is not dependant on the contri bution from the shareholders as contemplated in this case because the law governi ng the liability or contribution of the members is very clear as contained in sections 265 and 266 of the act section 265 1 states and i quote this section shall apply only in the case of company limited by guarantee an unlimited company and company having shares which are not fully paid up section 265 2 states and i quote when company is wound up every member at the time of the commenc ement of the winding up shall subject to section 266be liable to contribute to the assets of the company an amount sufficient for payment of its debts and liabilities nd the costs charges and expenses of the winding up and for the adjustment of the rights of the members among themselves section 266 1 states and i quote in the case of public company or private company limited by share s section 265 shall not require from any member contribution exceeding the amount if any unpaid on the shares in respect of which he is liable as member zambia national oil company was private company limited by shares its authorized share capital was 200 million ordinary shares of k1each only k19252000 shares had been issued and paid for leaving balance of 180748000 unsubscribe for therefore t he only amount that the shareholders can be legally be compelled to contribut is k180748000 1807 million the purported shareholders promise to capitalize the company to the level of the total debt portfoliok838645 billion made under sec tion 321 1 has therefore legal backing this would be the legal position eve n were the government were the direct shareholders of in znoc given the magnitude of the znoc deficit that miss josephine mapoma permanent secretary in the ministry of energy and water development declared of k838645 billion the auditor general was not only obliged to report this figure in hi s audit report but also expected and obliged to comment on its reasonableness since his audit of znoc coincided with its liquidation he should therefore have had good knowledge of t he 98znoc creditors and assets together with their respective values at the of liquidation more so that this colossal deficit of k838645 billion was to be take over by the government and paid out using public funds further he should also have pointed out that the government was not legally bound under the provisions of the company law under which znoc was incorporated to take over this debt as zambian citizen i have been extremely concerned if this is the way government accumulates debt bot h local and foreign debt the auditor general should have also pointed out the fact that out of the government us 28 million guarantee issued in may 1999 issued to zanaco on account of znoc debt the government had only paid us 10 million by october 2001leaving ba lance of us 18 million outstanding and therefore before the government finished honoring it s obligation on the first guarantee it under took to take over unverified zno c deficit of k838645 billion which included unverified znoc debt at zanaco of us 52 million after the zanaco debt of us 103 million and standard chartered bank bt of us 8 million have been by k100 billion refund due from zra the

addition to the above positive balance sheet the company had usd 65 million oil import financing facility with absa bank which has not been reported on in the false audit report of the of the auditor general the auditor general should have also commented on the appointment and conduct of the purported znoc appointed liquidator mrgeorge sokota chairman of standard chartered bank and managing partner of deloittes and touche first and foremost mr george sokota chairman of standard chartered bank and managing partner of deloittes and touche should not have been appointed zn oc liquidator because of the apparent conflict of interest because at the t ime of his appointment mr george sokota was chairman of standard chartered bank one of the znoc creditors further as professional mr george sokota chairman of standard chartered ba nk and managing partner of deloittes and touche should have ensured that he was properly appointed by satisfying himself that the purported shareholders who dissolved the company mr ekasonde and mr bndonde had powers to do so and in the abse nce of valid declaration of solvency under section 308 of the company act and absence of creditors meeting as required by section 314 of the company act mr g eorge sokota chairman of standard chartered bank and managing partner of deloittes and touche should have known that there was neither members voluntary liquidation nor creditors liquidation and therefore he was not properly appointed mr george sokota chairman of standard chartered bank and managing partner of deloittes and touche made attempt to ensure that the law was followed in discharging his duties as liquidator as demonstrated below with out regard to section 322 1 of the companies act mr george sokota chairman of standard chartered bank and managing partner of deloittes and touche as liquidator transferred the core business of the znoc that of crude oil importationtransportationrefinining and marketing of petroleum products in zambia initially to total outre mer then to trans sahara trading company nd then back to total outre mer indeni section 3221 of the companies act provide that 100where it is proposed that the whole or part of the business or property of company in this section called the company be transferred or sold to another body corporate in this section called the corporationthe liquidator may with the approval of special resolution of the company in the case of members voluntary winding up or b the court or the committee of inspection in the case of creditors voluntary winding up receive in compensation or part compensation for the transfer or sale fully paid shares debentures or other like interests in the corporation for distribution among t he members of the company or may enter into any other arrangement whereby the membe rs of the company may in lieu of receiving cashsharesdebentures or other like int erests or in addition thereto participate in the profits of or receive any other benefi t from the corporation section 322 6 further provides that special resolution shall not be val id for the purposes of this section unless it is passed before or concurrently with the resolution for voluntary winding up none of the above was complied with when znoc busi ness was transferred to tst and total outre mer when the znoc liquidation s been under the liquidation of either mr george sokota chairman of standard chartered bank and managing partner of deloittes and touche or mr richard mazombwe managi ng partner of price water house coopers mr george sokota chairman of standard chartered bank and managing partner of deloittes and touche further allowed the taking away of znoc valuabl assets directly contravening section 353 1 11 of the companies act which regards the removal of any part of the property of the company having value of more than ten mone tary units as fraud in total disregard of this section of the law through letter dated 4 th april 2002in which letter mr bnonde appointed mr george sokota chairman of standard chartered bank and managing partner of deloittes and touche as liquidator he advised the liquidator to note that the ndola terminal all the tanks and the dead stock in the pipeline were not part of the zambia national oil company property and through letter dated 5th april 2002 miss josephine mapoma permanent secretary in the ministry of energy and water development transferred the management and operations of the znoc fuel terminal to indeni petroleum refinery he also llowed the us 65 million anoc absa oil financing facility to be transferred to trans sahara trading tst when this was facility in which znoc had propriet ary rights and for which znoc had paid absa us 50000 in order for absa to dedicate t he us 65 million credit lines for znocs use mr george sokota chairman of standard chartered bank and managing partner of deloittes and touche also did not comply with section 321 1 of the companies act when he disposed off the znoc assets this section of the act provides that the liquidator may 101with the approval of resolution of the company in the case of members voluntary winding up or b the court or the committee of inspection in the case of creditors voluntary winding up exercise any of the powers given by section 289 to liquidator in winding up by the court since the znoc liquidation was neither members nor creditors voluntary liqui dation mr george sokota chairman of standard chartered bank and managing partner of deloittes and touche had authority to disposal off znoc assets among the assets disposed off are motor vehicles which were advertised for sale in t he times of zamia of july 312002 which vehicles have since been sold all the above illegal actions of mr george sokota chairman of standard chartered bank and managing partner of deloittes and touche had the effect of not only diluting the company value but also transferring billion and billion of kwacha of znoc profits to third parties further since mr george sokota chairman of standard chartered bank and mana ging partner of deloittes and touche did not make any declaration to acc ount for the receipts and payments as required by section 338 1 it is not possible to asce rtain whether he received any consideration in form of cash or shares when he transferred the znoc core business of oil importation to total outre mer indenior trans sahara t randing company or when the znoc crude oil in the pipeline was removed by mr b nonde or indeed if any consideration was received from the transferring znoc term inal to total outre mer and later on account for assets disposed which assets included motor vehicles section 338 1 of the companies act which mr george sokota chairman of standard chartered bank and managing partner of deloittes and touche did not comply with provides that liquidator shall within one month after the end of the period of six months from the date of his appointment b the end of every subsequent period of six months and c ceasing to act as liquidator or obtaining an order of release lodge with the registrar and if the liquidator is not the official rece iver with the official receiver accounts of his receipts and payments and statem ent of the position in the winding up verified by statutory declaration the conflict of interest exhibited by mr george mr george sokota chairman of standard chartered bank and managing partner of deloittes and touche and his complete disregard of the law in his appointment as znoc liquidator nd the illegal manner in which he discharged his duties was not an oversight but was liberate and 102was part and parcel of the overall strategy of the international and local forces at pl ay that wanted to have znoc out of the oil supply chain as i have already indicated every time there was an international monetary fund imf and world bank hipc review mission to zambia these missions alw ays used to have meetings with oil marketing companies namely total mobil agip nd bp at worldbank offices in lusaka before any hipc letters of intent were signed with the zambian government the following stringent conditions were introduced in the hipc letters of intent signed by the imf and the world bank with minist er of finance and national planning dr katele kalumba the current mmd national secretary that indeni refinery was not going to be re constructed znoc will come out of the oil supply chain and become manager of strategic reserves 25 customs duty on imported finished petroleum products that has always applied since tazama and indeni were constructed in 1969 and was part of the tazama and indeni construction agreements between the zambian government and eni group holding company of agip and tazama pipelines the imf had made it very clear that it did not have the expert knowledge on oil business and was only interested in insuring that the moratorium that the zambi an government had imposed on the taxes applicable on petroleum products by holding various appl icable taxes fixed as way of mitigating the fuel price increases in zambia immediately following the indeni fire disaster was removed and taxes to applie d advelerom the imf therefore left the world bank to incorporate all the hipc conditionaliti with respect to petroleum sector the world bank manager responsible for zambia economic programme in washington was french national what is intriguing in the znoc saga is t hat when the above zambia hipc conditional ties on petroleum sector were being superintend on by french national at the world bank in washington we have situation whereby french company total international took over the znoc s role in the oil supply chain as result of the zambian government implementation of hipc conditionalitie s which was disguised as liquidation the real reason why there was vehement resistance to the re inst atement of 25 customs duty on imported finished petroleum products was revealed to i n business meeting i had with mr john janes the then managing director of standard chartered bank z limited mr john janes had asked what progress we had made towards the completion of indeni refinery reconstruction when i told him that the re finery was going to commence operations in few months time he told to the face that dennis you will not be able to start the refinery because standard chartered ba nk in botswana had just given big loan to botswana company to buy brand new fuel tankers to ferry 103fuel into zambia and that some of the shareholders in this botswana c ompany were either ministers or senior government officials at the ministry of fi nance in zambia these brand new fuel tankers are the tankers in bp colors that ferried heavy fuel oil for bp z to the mines the financial justification for the loan was based on the cash flow revenues to be generated from ferrying heavy fuel oil into zambia and if the 25 customs duty was re instated on the imports of finished petroleum product s then the ferrying of the oil imports into zambia was going to be cut off immediat ely thereby affecting the ability of this botswana company to service its loan to standard bank botswana coincidentally the whole deal for botswana standard chartered bank funded trucks that ferried imported fuel for bp z was structured at the time when swana national mr don moloka was bp z managing director the list of creditors that mr george sokota chairman of standard chartere d bank and managing partner of deloittes and touche was forced to distribute at the creditors meeting held at holiday inn on 11 april 2002 indicated that znoc owe d standard chartered bank the following amounts standard chartered bank k 39831 927125 standard chartered bank k 30103372200 69935299325 payment by zesco 17850000000 87785299325 i came to find out later that zesco was made to pay k17850 billi on to standard chartered bank on behalf of znoc and that is the reason why zesco appe ared on the list of znoc creditors znoc liability to standard chartered bank was about us 8 milli on which is equivalent to k36 billion the znoc indebtedness to standard chartered bank at the time mr george sokota chairman of standard chartered bank and managing pa rtner of deloittes and touche served as znoc liquidator was therefore overstat ed by k417 billion the purported appointment of mr richard mazombwe managing partner of price waterhouse as the creditor appointed liquidator is also null and void for the following reasons for any liquidation to qualify as voluntary winding up be it membe rs or creditors the companys act requires in section 305 1 2 that the company resolves by means of special resolution to wind up voluntary and section 306 states that voluntary winding up starts at the time of the passing of the special resolution the s pecial resolution signed by mr ekasonde and mr bnonde that placed znoc in voluntary liquidation is invalid because the persons who signed the resolution ware not shareholders therefore there can 104never be either members or creditors voluntary winding up in the absence of valid special resolution the purported creditors meeting at which mr richard mr richard mazombwe managing partner of price water house coopers was purported to be elected to be chosen as liquidator by the creditors did not comply with either section 311 or s ection 314 of the company act section 3111 of the company act states that if the liquidator is at any time of the opinion that the company will not be able to pay or provide for the payment of its debts in full within the period stated in the solvency declaration he shall forthwith convene meeting of the creditors and lay before the meeting statement of the assets and liabilities of the company the calling of creditors meeting by mr george sokota chairman of standard chartered bank and managing partner of deloittes and touche under section 311 1 of the act was not within the armpit of this provision of the law since when mr ge orge sokota was purportedly appointed there was valid directors declaration of solvency even if the calling of the meeting under section 311 1 of the act were to be legally valid the voting at the said creditors meeting was not in line with section 3312a which provides that each creditor shall have votes in proportion to the amount of t he balance due to him if voting if any at all did take place then such voti ng did not take into account the proportion of the amounts due to individual creditors in fact tline section 353 1e which state and i quote person who being past or present officer or past or present membe r of company which is being wound up knowing or believing that false debt has been proved by any person fails for period of one month to inform the liquidator thereof shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to fine not exceeding t wo thousand monetary units or to imprisonment for period not exceeding two years or both in line with this section through my letter dated 25th april 2003 i brought to the attention of mr george sokota that as past officer of zambia national oil company i knew that the creditors list he was forced to circulate on 11 th april 2003 to creditors contained false debts that had been proved by the some creditors like total internati onal zanaco k14 billion due to the receiver mr richard mandona among others therefore valid voting would have taken place by creditors in proportional interests of various creditors in the midst of such fake and fraudulent claims by some purported creditors it therefore follows that like mr george sokota chairman of standard chartered bank and managing partner of deloittes and touche and all actions of mr richard mazombwe managing partner of price water house coopers in znoc liquidation are also illegal 105on page 9 of his report the auditor general gave history background of the indeni oil refinery i quote in 1971with the help of bechtel international corporation of the usa as governm ent consultant to the refinery project contract was finalized with sna m progetti for the construction of the refinery as joint venture between indeco and eni of italy in j une 1971indeni refinery limited was established with an authorized share capital of k10000 divided into 5000 shares of k200 each the shares were held on 5050 basis between indeco and eni in 1989the government abolished zimco subsidia ry companies including indeco limited and created zimco investment aut hority accordingly the shares in indeni were transferred to zimco on pages 2 to 4 the historical background of znoc was given and on page 5 to 8 the historical background of tazama was also given it is however not only surprising but also strange that while the auditor general deemed it necessary to give an historical back grounds of companies in the pet roleum sector he choose or found it immaterial to report on the changes in the indeni shareholding which brought in total outre mer company that replaced agip shareholding in indeni and the entrance of trans sahara trading company in the zambian petroleum sec tor all of which took place during the time he was auditing znoc and yet these two developments are at the are at the center of the illegal liquidation of znoc and the transferring of its massive profits in billions to total outre mer indeni and trans sa hara trading company limited eni had advised the zambian government of its decision to disinvest of not only there shareholding in indeni but also of their intention to disposal off there retail distribution network they operated through the agip filling stations znoc had expresse d its interest in the acquisition of the agip retail distribution network as wa of playing its strategic role in the price setting of petroleum products in the country at the dist ribution stage ie filling stations three man zambian government delegation comprising mr mwamfuli then permanent secretary in the ministry of energy mr fred zama general manager indeni and myself znoc chief executive was sent to italy to express this interest to eni and the italian government in the 2000as part of the preparedness zno c applied to energy regulatory board erb for distribution licence erb however wit hout any explanation could not grant znoc distribution licence even znoc repe ated appeals to the ministry of energy and water development for interversion in thi s matter did not bear any fruits by december 2001 while all the assets in the agip distribution net work were sold to total

require that for company to be given licens to deal in petroleum products such company should have own oil storage facilities or the same be leased to it at variance with its own rules erb granted an oil import license to tst when tst did not own or indeed leased any oil storage facilities there is direct relationship between these fraudulent schemes not re ported by the auditor general and the illegal liquidation of znoc that was designe d in order to defraud zambia out of millions of united states dollars the pronouncements of making total outre mer indeni the sole oil import of petroleum products should not be seen as having been any different from the tst arrangement in that the both tst and total outre mer indeni have one and the same object of transferring millions of united states dollars to these c ompanies the perpetrators of this fraud just used these two vehicles to achieve their objective to defraud zambia and its peoples 107finally madam i wish to express my sincere gratitude to the publ ic accounts committee of the zambian parliament for affording an opportunity to respond to the auditor general report on operations of zambia national oil company limited 108
