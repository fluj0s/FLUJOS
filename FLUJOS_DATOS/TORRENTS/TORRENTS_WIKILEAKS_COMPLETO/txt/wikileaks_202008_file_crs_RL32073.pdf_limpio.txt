security issues for congress summary liquefied natural gas lng is hazar dous fuel shipped in large tankers from overseas to us ports because lng infrastructure is highly visible and easily identified it can be vulnerable to terrorist attack since september 11 2001 the us lng industry and federal agencies have put new measures in place to respond to the possibility of terrorism nonetheless pub lic concerns about lng risks continue to raise questions about lng security faced with perceived national need for greater lng imports and persistent public concerns about lng ri sks some in congress are examining the adequacy of security provisions in federal lng regulation lng infrastructure consists primarily of tankers import terminals and inland storage plants there are nine active us terminals and proposals for many others although potentially catastrophic events coul d arise from serious accident or attack on such facilities lng has record of relative safety for the last 40 years and lng tanker or landbase d facility has been attacked by terrorists the likelihood and possible impacts from lng attacks conti nue to be debated among experts several federal agencies oversee lng infra structure security the coast guard has lead responsibility for lng shipping and marine terminal security under the maritime transportation secu rity act of 2002 pl 107295 and the security and accountability for every port act of 2006 pl 109347 the office of pipeline safety ops and the tran sportation security admin istration tsa both have security authority for lng storage plants within gas utilities as well as some security authority for lng marine terminals the federal energy regulatory commission ferc approves the siting with some s ecurity oversight of onshore lng marine terminals and certain utility lng plants the coast guard ops and ferc cooperate in the siting pproval of new lng facilities inspection and operational review of existing facilities informal communication and dispute resolution federal initiatives to secure lng are still evolving but variety of industry and agency representatives suggest they are reducing the vulnerability of lng to terrorism s 1594 would strengthen federa l protection of vessels and infrastructure handling lng and other especially hazar dous cargoes through new international standards new training requi rements vessel security cost sharing incident response and recovery plans and other provisions hr 2830 which passed in the house of representatives on april 24 2008 but which pr esident bush has threatened to veto would require the coast guard to secure lng tankers and would limit the agencys reliance on state and local resources in doing so among other provisions as congress continues its oversight of lng it may consider whether future lng security requirements will be appropriately funded whet her these requirements will be balanced against evolving risks and whether the lng industry is carrying its fair share of the security burden congress ma also act to improve its understanding of lng security risks finally congress may initiate action to better understand the security and trade implications

their increasingly important role in the nations energy infrastructure and their potential vulnerability to terrorist attack lng has long been important to us natural gas markets although ener gy economics and public perceptions about lng risks have limited the industrys growt h concerns about rising natural gas prices and the possibility of domestic gas shortages have been driving up demand for lng imports but lng is hazardous1 liquid transported and stored in large quantities consequently lng infrastructure may directly impact the security of communities where this infrastructure is cated faced with the widely perceived national need for greater lng imports nd persistent public concerns about lng risks some in congress are examining the adequacy of security provisions in federal

vann background what is lng when natural gas is cooled to temperatures below minus 260 ef it condenses into liquefied natural gas or lng3 as liquid natural gas occupies only 1600th the volume of its gaseous state so it is stored more effectively in limited space and is more readily transported by ship or truck single tanker ship for example can carry huge quantities of lng enough to s upply the daily energy needs of over 10 million homes when lng is warmed it regasifies and can be used for the same purposes as conventional natural gas such as heating cooking and power generation in 2007 lng

lng imports began to supplement domestic production due primarily to low domestic gas prices lng imports stayed relatively small accounting for only 1 of total us gas consumption in 20026 in countries with limited domestic gas supplies however lng imports grew dramatically over the same period japan for example imported 97 of its natural gas supply as lng in 2002 over 11 times as much lng as the united states7 south korea france spain and taiwan also became heavy lng importers natural gas demand has accelerated in the united states over the last several years due to environmental c oncerns

overview of us lng infrastructure the physical infrastructure of lng consists of interconnected transportation and storage facilities each with distinct physical characteristics affecting operational risks and security needs this overview focuses on the three major elements of this infrastructure tanker ships marine terminals and storage facilities lng tanker ships lng is transported to the united states in very large specialized tanker ships lng tankers are double hulled containing several massive tanks each sealed and insulated to maintain safe lng temperature and prevent leakage during transit there are currently 200 tankers in servi ce around the world with combined cargo capacity of over 24 million cubic meters of lng equivalent to over eight times the average daily us natural gas consumpti on more than 200 additional tankers are expected to enter service by 201311 there are usflagged lng tankers lng marine terminals lng tankers unload their cargo at dedicat ed marine terminals which store and regasify the lng for distribution to domestic markets onshore terminals typically consist of docks lng handling equipment storage tanks and interconnections to regional gas pipelines as discussed later in the report the siting of onshore lng import terminals is regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc there are eight active onshore lng terminals in the united

because offshore ter minals would be located far from land they also would present fewer security risks than onshore lng terminals offshore terminals may present environmental concer ns however if they use seawater for regasification such process cools the wate rs in terminals vicinity with potential impacts on the local ecosystem due to the lower water temperatures23 as discussed later in the

is combustible so an unc ontrolled release of lng poses serious hazard of explosion or fire lng also poses hazards because it is extremely cold experts have identified seve ral potentially catastrophic even ts that could arise from an lng release the likelihood and severity of these events have been the subject of considerable research and analysis while open questions remain about the impacts of specific hazards in an actual accident there appears to be consensus as to what the greatest lng hazards are pool fires if lng spills near an ignition source the evaporating gas in combustible gasair centration will burn above the lng pool30 the resulting pool fire would spread as the lng pool expanded away from its source and continued evaporating such pool fires are intense burning far more hotly and rapidly than oil or gasoline fires31 they cannot be extinguished all the lng must be consumed before they go out because lng pool fires are so hot their thermal radiation may inju re people and damage property considerable distance from the fire itself many experts agree that pool fire especially on water is the most serious lng hazard32httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32073crs9 33 quillen d chevrontexaco corp lng safety myths and legends presentation to the natural gas technology conferen ce houston tx may 1415 2002 p 18 34 havens

lng spills but does not immediately ignite the evaporating natural ga s will form vapor cloud that may drift some distance from the spill site if the cloud subsequently encounters an ignition source those portions of the cloud with combustible gasair concentration will burn because only fraction of such cloud would have com bustible gasair concentration the cloud would not likely explode all at once but the fire could still cause considerable damage an lng vapor cloud fire would gradually burn its way back to the lng spill where the vapors originated and would continue to burn as pool fire33 if an lng tank failed due to collision or terror attack experts believe the failure event itself would likely ig nite the lng pool before large vapor cloud could form34 consequently they conclude that large vapor cloud fires are less likely than instantaneous pool fires flameless explosion if lng spills on water it could theoretically heat up and regasify almost instantly in flameless explosion also called rapid phase transition while the effects of tankerscale spills have not been studied extensively shell corporation experiments with smaller lng spills in 1980 did not cause flameless explosions even if there were flameless explosion of lng experts believe the hazard zone s around such an event would not be as large as either vapor cl oud or pool fire hazard zones35 in addition to these catastr ophic hazards an lng spill poses hazards on smaller scale an lng vapor cloud is not toxic but could cause asphyxiation by displacing breathable air such clouds rise in air as they warm however diminishing the threat to people on the ground alternativ ely extremely cold lng could injure people or damage equipment through direct contact the extent of such contact would likely be limited however as major spill would likely result in more serious fire the environmental damage associated with an lng spill would be confined to fire and freezing impacts near the spill since lng dissipates completely and leaves residue as crude oil does36 safety record of lng the lng tanker industry claims record of relative safety over the last 45 years since international lng shippi ng

the lng marine safety reco rd is partly due to the double hulled design of lng tankers this desi gn makes them more robust and less prone to accidental spills than singlehu lled oil and fuel tankers like the exxon valdez which caused major alaskan oil spill after grounding in 198939 lng tankers also carry radar global positioning systems automatic distress systems and beacons to signal if they are in trouble cargo safe ty systems include instruments that can shut operations if they deviate from normal as well as gas and fire detection systems the safety record of onshore lng terminals is more mixed there are more than 40 lng terminals and more than 150 other lng storage facilities worldwide since 1944 there have been approximately 13 serious accidents at these facilities directly

petrochemical plant fire in algeria in over 40 years41 according to press reports the accident resulted from poor main tenance rather than facility design flaw42 another three accidents at worldwide lng plants since 1944 have also caused fatalities but these were construction or maintenance accidents in which lng was not present43 lng security risks lng tankers and landbased facilities may be

potentially more accessible than fixed terminal facilities because they may transit nearer to populated areas and because lng spills from tankers could be more difficult to control according to 2004 report by sandia national laboratories an intentional lng spill and resulting fire could cause major injuries to people and significant damage to structures within approximately 500 meters 03 mile of the spill site more moderate injuries and structural damage up to 1600 meters 10 mile from the spill site and lower impacts out to 2500 meters 15 miles44 these results are used by federal agencies in reviewing lng terminal siting applications other lng hazard studies have reached somewhat different conclusions about lng tanker vulnerability report by th government accountability office gao released in 2007 reviewed six unclassified studies of lng tanker hazards including the sandia study the gao report concluded that45 because there have been largescal lng spills or spill experiments past studies have developed modeling assumptions based on smallscale spill data while there is general agreement on the types of effects from an lng spill the results of these models have created what appears to be conflicting assessments of the specific consequences of an lng spill creating uncerta inty for regulators and the public following the gao report members of cong ress have expressed continuing concern about the uncertainty associated with l ng tanker vulnerability nd hazard analysis46 in 2008 congress appropriated 8 million to fund largescale lng fire experiments by the department of energy addressing some of the hazard modeling uncertainties identified in the gao report47 it remains to be seen to what degree this research will increase policy makers confidence in

1215 1985 49 snl december 2004 p 151the gaz fountain attack although there have been terrorist att acks on lng tankers there is at least one documented case of gas tanker of similar construction being attacked in wartime during the iraniraq war in the 1990s the doublehulled lpg tanker gaz fountain was fired upon by an iranian airc raft using three airtoground armor piercing maverick missiles two of th missiles exploded on or above the ships deck causing relatively minor damage the third missile penetrated the deck and exploded above butane storage tank openi ng 6 squaremeter 65 squarefoot hole in the roof of the tank the escaping gas ignited establishing large fire on deck above the missile entry hole the fire aboard the gaz fountain was successfully extinguished by salvage ship her remaining cargo was successfully unloaded to another ta nker and she was eventually repaired48 the gaz fountain attack and salvage provides some evidence as to the robustness of doublehulled gas tankers like those that carry lng but the relatively benign outcome in the gaz fountain attack does not necessarily demonstrate that attacks on lng tankers would have similarly limited impacts the gaz fountain was fortunate that its storage tank was breached only at the top if missiles had been targeted at the hull of the ship rather than its deck one might have penetrated the side of storage tank causing major spill on water and an inextinguishable pool fire furthermore if the gas involved had been lng rather than butane the gaz fountain might have been subject to cryoge nic damage since lng is transported at much lower temperature than butane 260 ef vs 25 ef according to the sandia report such combination could lead to cascading failure of adjacent storage tanks and presumably an even

regulations mandated by pl107295 are discussed below under pl107295 the coast guard and the maritime administration share siting approval authority for offshore lng terminals shortly after september 11 20 01 the coast guard began to systematically prioritize protection of ships and facilities including those handling lng based on vulnerability assessments and the potential consequences of security incidents the coast guard evaluated the overall susceptibility of marine targets their use to transport terrorists or terror materials and their use as potential weapons in particular the coast guard evaluated the vulnerability of tankers to boat loaded with explosives or being comma ndeered and intentionally damaged50 while the assessments focused on coast guard jurisdictional vessels and facilities some scenarios involved other vital port infrastru cture like bridges channels and tunnels51 the coast guard used these assessments in augmenting security of key maritime assets and in developing the agencys new maritime security standards the coast guard began increasing lng tanker and port security immediately after september 11 2001 for example th coast guard suspended lng shipments to everett for several weeks after the terro r attacks to conduct security review and revise security plans52 the coast guard also worked with state environmental and police marine units to

compared to other hazardous chemical infrastructur which receives less public attention in 2004 report the ferc stated that for new lng terminal proposal the perc eived threat of terrorist attack may be considered as highly probable to the local population however at the national level potential terrorist targets are plentiful many of these pose similar or greater hazard to that of lng115 the ferc also has remarked however that unlike accidental causes historical experience provides little guidance in estimating the probability of terrorist attack on an lng vessel or onshore storage facility116 former director of central intelligence james woolsey has stated his belief that terrorist attack on an lng tanker in us waters would be unlikely because its potential impacts would not be great enoug h compared to other potential targets117 lng terminal operators whic h have conducted pr oprietary assessmen ts of potential terrorist attacks against lng tankers have expressed similar views118 i n september 2006 evaluation of proposed l ng terminal in long island sound the coast guard stated that there were curren tly specific credible threats against the proposed lng facility or tankers serving the facility119 the evaluation also noted however that the threat environment is dynamic and that some threats may be unknown120 because the probability of terro rist attack on lng cannot be known with certainty policy makers and community leaders must to some extent rely on their own judgment to decide whether lng security measures for specific facility will adequately protect the public

lng tankers and crews there are currently usflagged lng tankers and few if any us citizens among lng tanker crews some policy makers are concerned that compared to us vessels and crews foreignflagged lng tankers may not face the same security requirements or may not face the same leve l of security oversight and verification121 this rationale under lies the provisions in pl 109241 that promote lng shipping to the united states on usflagged vessels with us crews prompted by these provisions at least four lng developers have committed to using us crews in their lng terminal siting proposals122 some stakeholders have called for similar measures to promote us flags and crew s for tankers serving onshore lng terminals regulated by ferc notwithstanding the lng tanker provisions in pl 109241 coast guard officials have stated that existing security provisions for foreignflagged lng tankers and foreign place them on an equal security footing with potential us counterparts123 our domestic maritime security regime is closely aligned with the international ship and port facility security isps code under the isps code vessels in international service including lng ve ssels must have an international ship security certificate issc to be issued an issc by its flag state the vessel must develop and implement threatsca lable security plan that among other things establishes access control measures security measures for cargo handling and delivery of ships stores surveillance and monitoring security communications security incident procedures and training and drill requirements the plan must also id entify ship security officer who is responsible for ensuring compliance with the ships security plan the coast guard rigorously enforces this interna tional requirement by evaluating security compliance as part of our ongoi ng port state control program others have questioned pref erential treatment of us lng tankers and crews on the grounds that it may impinge on free trade prin ciples by discriminating against foreign lng tanker operators fully adheri ng to international standards124 given the potential maritime treaty and trade implications federal efforts to promote us flags and crews on lng tankers may require careful consideration of pot ential benefits and costshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32073crs27 conclusions the us lng industry is growing quickly while rising lng imports may offer economic benefits they also pose ri sks lng infrastructure is inherently hazardous and it is potentially attractive to terrorists both lawmakers and the general public are concerned about these ri sks although the lng industry has long history of relatively safe ope rations and has taken steps to secure its assets against terrorist attack lng tanker or landbased facility has been attacked by terrorists and federal state and local governments ve put in place security measures intended to safeguard lng against newly perceived terrorist threats these measures are evolving but variety of industry and ag ency representatives suggest that these federal initiatives are reducing the vulnerability of us lng to terrorism the ongoing debate about lng infrastruct ure security in the united states has often been contentious local officials and community groups have challenged numerous lng infrastructure proposals on th grounds that they may represent an unacceptable risk to the public heightened public scrutiny of lng fac ilities has made it difficult to site new lng terminals near major gas markets and has increased the cost and complexity of lng terminal siting approval none theless both industry and government officials acknowledge th at enough new lng infrastructure will likely be approved to meet longterm us import requirements indeed federal agencies have approved the construction of number of new us import terminals several of them onshore numerous dditional terminal pr oposals await federal approval together with the expansion of the existing us import terminals and the construction of new lng terminals in canada and mexic the approved us facilities would provide enoug h added capacity to meet the bulk of us lng demand for the next 20 years new us lng terminals may not be ideally located so as to minimize the cost of natural gas but building them in these locations may be better than not building them at all furthermore because their security has been subject to intense public scrutiny new lng terminal and tanker operations may be safer than they might have been without such scrutiny and their siting may be less likely to be challenged at later time when construction is already underway the construction and subsequent closure of the shoreham nuclear power plant in the 1980s due to new public opposition offers an example of the need to resolve safety and security concerns before capital is invested from purely economic perspective therefore the added costs of building more heavily protected lng terminals potentially farther from their primary markets may represent the us publics willingness to pay for lng security whether this implicit price of lng security is reasonable is an open question but the continued interest of private companies to invest billions of dollars in us lng terminals suggests that it will not prevent needed lng development as congress continues its oversight of lng infrastructure development it may decide to examine the public costs and resource requirements of lng security especially in light of dramatically increasing lng imports in particular congress may consider whether future lng security requirements will be appropriately funded whether these requireme nts will be balanced against evolving risks and whether the lng industry is carrying its fair share of the security burden congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32073crs28 may also act to improve its understanding of lng security risks costly blanket investments in lng security might be avoided if more refined terror threat information were available to focus security spending on narrower set of infrastructure vulnerabilities finally congress may initiate action to better understand the security and trade implicati ons of efforts to promote usflagged lng tankers in addition to these specific issues congress might consider how the various elements of us lng security activity fit together in the nations overall strategy to protect critical infrastructure maintain ing high levels of security around lng tankers for example may be of limited benefit if other hazardous marine cargoes are less wellprotected us lng security also requires coordination among many groups international treaty organizations fe deral agencies state and local agencies trade associations and lng infrastructur operators reviewing how these groups work together to achieve common security goals could be an oversight challenge for congress
