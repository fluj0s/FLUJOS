procedure precedents and practices sdoc 10128 101st cong 2nd sess washingt on gpo 1992 p 1098principles of senate parliamentary practice the senate applies the regulations t forth in its various parliamentary authorities in accordance with several principles that remain generally applicable across the entire range of parliamentary situations among these principles may be listed the following 1 senate procedures derive from multiple sources 2 the senate has the constitutional power to make its own rules of procedure 3 senators often must initiate enforcement of their ru 4 the senate conducts much of its business by unanimous consent 5 the senate usually follows its precedents and 6 the senate adheres to many informal practices each of these principles is discussed below multiple sources of senate procedure the standing rules of the senate ma be the most obvious source of senate parliamentary procedure but they are by means the only one other sources of senate procedures include requirements imposed by the constitution particularly those in article i section 5 standing orders of the senate precedents of the senate statutory provisions that establish procedural requirements hereafter referred to as rule making statutes rules of procedure adopted by each committee rules of the senates party conferences procedural agreements entered into by unanimous consent and informal practices that the nate adheres to by custom in order to answer question about sena procedure it of ten is necessary to take account of several of these sources for example rule xix of the senates standing rules provides that the presiding officer shall recognize the senator who shall first address him1 when several senators seek recognition at the same time however there is precedent that priority of recognition shall be accorded to the majority leader and minority leader the majority manager and minority manager in that order2 this precedential principle sometimes can have significant consequences on the senate floor for example it gives the majority leader the opportunity to offer the debateending moti on to table or to propose seconddegree amendments to unfriendly firstdegree amendments httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30788crs4 3 special rules are resolutions reported by the house rules committee that usually specify how measure is to be considered on the floor once the house adopts special rule by majority vote it governs consideration of the measure special rules often waive procedural requirements imposed by the rules of the house or rulemaking statutes 4 section 904 of the congressional budget act establishes procedure by which the senate can vote to waive certain budgetrelated prohi bitions and requirements in an individual case by majority vote or by threefifths vote of all senators 5 an important exception occurs when the nate is operating under cloture when this happens the precedents provide that the presid ing officer has the authority to rule all dilatory motions out of order on his own initiative see senate rule xxii paragraph 2 in senate manual sec 222 constitutional rulemaking authority of the senate article i of the constitution gives the sena the authority to determine its rules of procedure there are two dimensions to the senates constitutional rulemaking authority first the senate can decide wh at rules should govern its procedures the senate exercises this rulemaking power when it adopts an amendment to the standing rules or creates new standing ru by majority vote the senate also uses its rulemaking power when it creates standing orders and when it enacts rule making provisions of statutes such as the congressional budget and impoundment act of 1974 standing orders and rulemaking provisions of law have the same standing and effect as the senates standi ng rules because all are created through an exercise of the senates constitutional rulemaking authority the second dimension to the senates rule making authority is that the chamber can decide when its rules of procedure should not govern in practical terms this means the senate can waive its rules by unanimous consent under provision of senate rule v the body can also suspend its rules by twothirds vote although this course is procedurally di fficult and rarely taken th senate has established means to supersede its rules by majority vote an option that is available to the house through the adoption of special rule3 the senate can achieve the effect of waiving rule if majority votes to overrule decision of the presiding officer to sustain point of order or not to sustain point of order that the presiding officer has submitted to the full body for decision4 action of this kind however not only sets the rule aside for the immediate situati on but thereby establishes precedent that will govern subsequent rulings of the presiding officer interpreting the meaning and applicability of that rule in some cases decisions of the senate on points of order have had the effect of rendering rule unenforceable in its previous generally accepted sense enforcing the senate rules and precedents the senates presiding officer whether it is the vice president or senator of the majority party does not always call to the chambers attention that violation of senate rules is taking place5 the senate often can viol ate its procedures unless senator makes point of order at the ri ght moment that the proposed action violates the standing rules or precedents constitu tional provision or source of procedurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30788crs5 6 riddicks senate procedure pp 989 and 14911492 7 for examples of provisions that would re quire such supermajority see section 904d of the congressional budget act pl 93344 as amended 2 usc 621 notethat has the same authority as standing rule ie standing order rulemaking statute or unanimous consent agreement when point of order is raised the presiding officer usually makes ruling without debate under rule xx the pres iding officer has the option of submitting any question of order for the decision of th senate he rare ly does this but may do so if the existing rules and precedents do not speak clearly on the parliamentary question at hand in such cases the presid ing officer will often invite debate on the question of order the presiding officer must submit two types of questions of order to the senate for it to decide first under rule xvi paragraph 4 the sena decides questions concerning the germaneness or relevance of most amendments to appropriations bills and does so without debate second according to the senates precedents the senate is to decide all constitutional questions with debate usually allowed6 this practice rests on the principle that the presidin g officer possesses authority only over the interpretation of procedures established by the senate and onl the senate itself possesses any such authority in relation to the constitution any senator can appeal the ruling of the presiding officer on question of order the senate then decides usually by major ity vote to uphold or overturn the presiding officers decision this vote usually estab lishes precedent that guides the presiding officer in deciding future questions of order unless and until this precedent is overturned by another decision of the senate or by rule s change some rulemaking statutes require supermaj ority vote to overturn on appeal the presiding officers ruling on point of order7 senators are much more likely than repres entatives to appeal decisions of their presiding officer this difference in the pr actices of the two chambers arises largely because the officer who presides over the proceedings of the house of representatives is either the speaker of the house who is the elected leader of the majority party or her designee an app eal of the decision of the chair on point of order could thus be viewed as vote against the speakers leadership this situation does not arise in the senate because the c onstitutional presiding officer of the senate is the vice president who is not elected as leader of senate majority parliamentary actions taken on the basis of an inform practice or rule of one of the senates party conferences are not enforceable on the senate floor while informal practices and party conference rules can affect senate committee and floor action they are not invoked through an exer cise of the senates constitutional rule making authority hence they do not have the same authority as senate rules and procedures informal practices evolve ove r the years as custom and party conference rules are adopted and enforced by each party httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30788crs6 8 body of pr ecedents has developed on how unanimous consent agreements are to be interpreted and applied in different procedural situations these precedents are covered in riddicks senate procedure pp 13111369 the majority leader often calls up measure by unanimous consent rather than by offering motion to proceed to consideration of the measure the motion to proceed is usually debatable and hence open to filibuster 9 riddicks senate procedure p 1311the senates reliance on unanimous consent the senates standing rules emphasize the rights of individual senators in particular by affording each senator the right to debate at length and the right to offer amendments even if they are not relevant to the bill under consideration it would be impossible for the senate to act on legislation in timely fashion if senators always exercised these two powerful rights for this and other reasons the senate often agrees by unanimous consent to operate outside its standing rules in practice senate busin ess is frequently conducte d under unanimous consent agreements known as time agreements when they include limits on the time for debating measures amendments motions or other questions these agreements also may structure the amendment process and require the germaneness or relevance of amendments unanimous consent agreemen ts may be used to bring up measure8 to define how the measure will be consid ered on the floor and to control how the senate will consider individual amendments given the fact that it takes only one nator to object to unanimous consent agreement each agreement is carefully crafted by the majority leader in consultation with the minority leader leaders of the committee that reported the bill in question and other senators who have indicated par ticular interest in the legislation the agreement is then formally propounded on th floor usually again by the majority leader and takes effect if senator objects once entered into consent agreement has the same authority as the senates standing rules and is enforceable on the senate floor consent agreements have the effect of changing all senate rules and precedents that are contrary to the terms of the agreement9 one could argue that these agreements are even stronger than th standing rules because once entered into they can be altered only by further nimous consent this is more rigorous threshold than the majority vote requirement for changing the senates standing rules the importance of precedents the published precedents of the senate expound the ways in which the senate has interpreted and applied its rules the precedents both complement and supplement the rules of the senate as illu strated earlier by the example of according priority recognition to the majority leader the close interplay between the precedents and the standing rules often makes it necessary to consult the precedents for guidance on how rules are to be understood the brevity of the senates st anding rules often makes the bodys precedents particularly im portant as determinant of proceedings precedents are analogous to case law in their effect just as attorneys in court will cite previous judicial decisions to support their arguments senators will citehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30788crs7 10 riddicks senate procedure p 987precedents of the senate to support point of order or defend against one or to argue for or against an appeal of the pr esiding officers ruling on point of order similarly the presiding officer will ofte n support his or her ruling by citing the precedents in this way precedents influence the manner in which current senate rules are applied by relating past decisions to the specific case before the chamber precedents usually are established when the senate votes on questions of order ie on point of order that the presidin g officer has submitted to the body or on whether to uphold or overturn ruling of the presiding officer or when the presiding officer decides question of order and this ruling is not appealed historically the senate follows such precedents until the senate in its wisdom should reverse or modify that decision10 precedents also can be creat ed when the presiding officer responds to parliamentary inquiry precedents do not carry equal weight inasmuch as the senate itself has the ultimate constitutional author ity over its own rules precedents reflecting the judgment of the full senate are considered the most authoritative accordingly precedents based on vote of the senate have more weight than those based on rulings of the presiding officer responses of the presiding officer to parliamentary inquiries have even less weight because they are subject to process of appeal through which the full senate could confirm or contest them in addition more recent precedents generally have greater weight than earlier ones and precedent that reflects an established pattern of rulin gs will have more weight than precedent that is isolated in its effect all precedents also must be evaluated in the historical context of the senates rules and pr actices at the time the precedents were established senators seeking precedents to support or rebut an argument may consult the senate parliamentarian s office 46128 the senates unofficial practices some senate procedural actions are based on unofficial practices that have evolved over the years and become accepted custom these practices do not have the same standing as the chambers rules nor are they compiled in any written source of authority although these unofficial practices cannot be enforced on the senate floor many of them are well established and cu stomarily followed some contemporary examples of unofficial practices include respecting holds that individual senators sometimes place on consideration of specifi c measures and giving the majority leader or his designee the prerogative to offer motions to proceed to the consideration of bill to recess or to adjourn httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30788crs8 11 the senate manual also includes variety of historical and statistical information this report describes only those materials included in the manual that

budget resolutions as already noted the constitutional gr ant to each chamber of congress of authority over its own rules permits the senate to establish procedural regulations through simple resolutions which are dopted through action of the originating chamber alone in certain cases nevertheless the senate institutes procedures through provisions included in statutory measures bills and joint resolutions which can become effective only through agreem ent between both houses and presentation to the president or through concurrent resolutions which require agreement between both houses given that these procedures are created through an exercise of each chambers constitutional rulemaking authority they have the same standing as senate and house rules statute or c oncurrent resolution that contains rule making provisions in this sense usually also incorporates section titled exercise of rulemaking power which asserts the rulemaking authority of each chamber by declaring that the pertinent provisions shall be considered as part of the rules of each house and are subject to being changed i n the same manner as in the case of any other rule of such house21 that is for example by adoption of simple resolution of the senate in the senate statutory rulemaking pr ovisions are principally of three kinds 1 those derived from legislative reor ganization acts 2 those establishing expedited procedures for cons ideration of specific classes of measure and 3 those derived from the congressional budget act and related statutes governing the budget process in addition provisions regula ting action in the senate or house of representatives or both in the congressional budget pro cess are often contained in congressional budget resolutions which are concurrent resolutions adopted pursuant to the congressional budget act rulemak ing provisions of most of these kinds are not comprehensively compiled in any doc ument of the senate and where such compilation exists the provisions applicable to the senate can most readily be found only by referring to the statutes or concurrent resolutions themselves legislative reorganization acts the legislative reorganization act of 1946 pl 79601 60 stat 812 and the legislative reorganization act of 1970 pl 91510 84 stat 1140 are important rulemaking statut that affected legislative procedures many rulemaking provisions in these statutes were later incorporated into the senates standing rules and some others appear in the compilation of laws relating to the senate presented in the senate manual as discussed earlier expedited procedures the term rulemaking statute is most often used in connection with laws that include provisions specifying legislative procedures to be followed in the senate or the house or both in connection with the consideration of class of measure also specified by the statute this type of rulemaking statute commonly referred to as expedited procedures or fast track provisions defines

fort h under the heading legislative procedures enacted in law in the house manual 25 this house compilation however does not include certain statutes that establish pr ocedures for the sena alone and presents some statutes in form that omits procedural provisions pertaining only to the senate budget process statutes three of the most important rulemaking statutes define specific procedures for considering budgetary legislation the congressional budget and impoundment act of 1974 commonly known as the congressional budget act the balanced b udget and emergency deficit control act the socalled grammrudmanhollings act and the budget enforcement act of 1990 for example section 305b of the congressional budget act defines senate floor procedures for considering the annual congressional budg et resolution an excerpt from section 305b appears on the fo llowing page in general rulemaking provisions of these stat utes are set forth in budget process law annotated discussed below procedural provisions in budget resolutions the chief purpose of the concurrent resolution on the budget th at the congressional budget act requires congress to adopt each year is to set spe nding revenue and defi cit targets for the fiscal year and to allocate spending budg et authority and outlays subject to those targets among budgetary functional categories in recent years however the senate has often also included in this cong ressional budget reso lution supplementary procedural regulations to g overn subsequent action on spe nding bills or other budget related measures the procedures blished by these provisions may be made applicable only to the coming years budg etary action but are often established as permanent procedures and ar subsequently altered or abolished only by further action in subsequent budget resolution ne vertheless they are not comprehensively compiled in any single source and may best be identified by examining the texts of adopted congressional
