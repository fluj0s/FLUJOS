pakistan updated november 28 2006 sharon squassoni specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress weapons of mass destruction trade between north korea and pakistan summary in october 2002 the united states confronted north korea about its alleged clandestine uranium enrichment program soon after the agreed framework collapsed north korea expelled international inspectors and withdrew from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt us intelligence officials claimed pakistan was key supplier of uranium enrichment technology to north korea and some media reports suggested that pakistan had exchanged centrifuge enrichment technology for north korean help in developing longer range missiles us official statements leave little doubt that cooperation occurred but there are significant details missing on the scope of cooperation and the role of pakistans government north korea and pakistan both initially denied that nuclear technology was provided to north korea president musharraf admitted however in 2006 that such technology had been transferred this report describes the nature and evidence of the cooperation between north korea and pakistan in missiles and nuclear weapons the impact of cooperation on their weapons of mass destruction wmd programs and on the international nonproliferation regime it will be updated as events warrant the roots of cooperation are deep north korea and pakistan have been engaged in conventional arms trade for over 30 years in the 1980s as north korea began successfully exporting ballistic missiles and technology pakistan began producing highly enriched uranium heu at the khan research laboratory benazir bhuttos 1993 visit to pyongyang seems to have kicked off serious missile cooperation but it is harder to pinpoint the genesis of pakistans nuclear cooperation with north korea by the time pakistan probably needed to pay north korea for its purchases of mediumrange dong missiles in the mid1990s upon which its ghauri missiles are based pakistans cash reserves were low pakistan could offer north korea route to nuclear weapons using heu that could circumvent the plutoniumfocused 1994 agreed framework and be difficult to detect wmd trade between north korea and pakistan raises significant issues for congressional oversight are there sources of leverage over proliferators outside the nonproliferation regime do sanctions interdiction and intelligence as nonproliferation tools need to be strengthened how is the threat of proliferation interpreted within the nexus of terrorism and wmd further has counterterrorism cooperation taken precedence over nonproliferation cooperation if so are there approaches that would make both policies mutually supportive see also crs report rl33590 north koreas nuclear weapons program by larry niksch and crs report rs21391 north koreas nuclear weapons latest developments by sharon

agreed to control trade related to weapons of mass destruction wmd to complement the agreements comprising the nonproliferation regime supplier controls are not foolproof but many observers believe that national and multilateral export controls can slow deter and make wmd acquisition more difficult or costly for the determined proliferator until political change makes the weapons irrelevant or longer desirable1 recurrent problem in controlling technology transfers is that key states do not participate in the regimes although they are still targets of supplyside restrictions some proliferating states now are able to reproduce wmd technologies and systems and sell them abroad without formal restraints on trade north korea pakistan and india are three such examples in the case of nuclear weapons and missile technology2 when export controls and interdiction fail some us laws impose penalties on countries entities or persons for proliferation activities the provisions are varied and extend across the range of foreign assistance aid financing government contracts military sales3 penalties for engaging in enrichment or reprocessing trade were strengthened by the 1976 and 1977 symington and glenn amendments to the foreign assistance act now sections 101 and 102 of the arms export control act later penalties were added for nuclear detonations and other provisions established penalties for individuals missile proliferationrelated sanctions were established in the missile technology control act 1990 which added chapter vii to the arms export control act and similar language at section 11b of the export administration act of 1979 in addition to legislated penalties the us government also imposes sanctions through executive orders 1 several countries have made political decisions to stop wmd programs sometimes coinciding with regime changes eg argentina and brazil halted their nuclear weapons programs and south africa dismantled its nuclear weapons in the 1990s the us stopped its biological weapons program in advance of the biological weapons convention and libya renounced all its wmd programs in december 2003 2 china has only belatedly joined supplier restraint groups member of the zangger committee china joined the npt in 1992 and has agreed to adhere to mtcr guidelines china also joined the nuclear suppliers group in 2004 3 see crs report rl31502 nuclear biological chemical and missile proliferation sanctions selected current law by dianne rennack crs2 in october 2002 the bush administration announced that north korea had been pursuing clandestine uranium enrichment program us intelligence officials leaked to the press few days later that pakistan among other countries was implicated4 the outlines of missilesfornuclear technology trade were reported in the press5 pakistani government officials denied such trade the state department offered assurances that cooperation between the two was thing of the past in march 2003 the bush administration imposed sanctions on north korean and pakistani entities for cooperation in missiles6 in letter to congress the state department explained that the facts relating to the possible transfer of nuclear technology from pakistan to north koreado not warrant the imposition of sanctions under applicable us laws in late 2003 convoluted turn of events involving nuclear safeguards inspections in iran and decision by libya in december to renounce its wmd programs provided evidence that pakistani scientists had supplied nuclear technology to iran libya and north korea pakistani officials denied any government knowledge of such cooperation and at first denied that aq khan former head of khan research laboratories and his associates had assisted libya or north korea khan confessed to his proliferation misdeeds in early february 2004 and was pardoned by president musharraf immediately interviewed on february 17 2004 musharraf noted that pakistans investigation had not uncovered evidence of transfers to other countries other than iran and libya7 it was not until president musharraf published his memoirs in september 2006 that he admitted nuclear technology had been sold to north korea nonetheless president bush in speech that focused on proliferation at the national defense university on february 11 2004 stated that khan and others sold nuclear technologies and equipment to outlaw regimes stretching from north africa to the korean peninsula bush further stated that khan and his associates provided iran and libya and north korea with designs for pakistans older centrifuges as well as designs for more advanced and efficient models8 both north korea and pakistan have been subject to sanctions in the past for wmd trade north korea has been under one form

httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases200402200402114html crs3 to fifty years pakistan has been sanctioned in what some observers deem an on again off again fashion mostly for importing wmd technology and also for testing nuclear device9 the sanctions on the north korean entity changgwang sinyong corporation were imposed pursuant to the arms export control act and the export administration act on the basis of knowing involvement in the transfer of category i under the missile technology control regime missiles or components the sanctions on the pakistani entity khan research laboratories were imposed pursuant to executive order 12938 from march 2003 to march 2005 both of these entities have been sanctioned repeatedly in the past for missile trade on the nuclear side all sanctions were waived following september 11 2001 and it is unlikely that such sanctions will be imposed again absent significant evidence of the pakistani governments involvement in nuclear trade rogue state symbiosis at first glance north korea and pakistan do not seem the likeliest of proliferation bedfellows however they have traded in conventional armaments for over thirty years and forged firm relationship during the iraniraq war 19801988 during which both provided assistance to iran north koreas sale of scuds and production capabilities proved particularly important to iran10 neither state lies completely outside the nonproliferation regimes despite its extreme isolation north korea signed the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt in 1985 under pressure from the soviet union and is party to the biological weapons convention bwc however north korea never lived up to its npt obligations and formally withdrew from the treaty effective april 10 200311 most observers believe north korea has one or two nuclear weapons or at least the plutonium for them and may now be able to add six or eight weapons to its arsenal given successful reprocessing of the spent fuel at yongbyon north korea told an unofficial us delegation in january 2004 that it had completed reprocessing the fuel at the end of june 2003 the unofficial delegation including former head of the alamos national laboratory sig hecker was shown an empty spent fuel pond but little else to prove north korean claims12 on october 9 2006 north korea tested nuclear device which many experts believe did not achieve its desired yield if it achieved nuclear yield at all most observers believe north korea probably has biological weapons north korea does not participate in the missile technology control regime mtcr nor 9 see

north korea became leading exporter of ballistic missiles beginning in the 1980s according to the central intelligence agency cia north korea attaches high priority to exporting ballistic missiles which is major source of hard currency14 pakistan on the other hand has never been as isolated as north korea it has relied significantly on outside sources of technology for its weapons programs but has not been thought of as major exporter of wmdrelated items it remains to be seen whether the pakistani military andor government was involved at all with khans nuclear deals pakistan has long rejected the npt and tested nuclear weapons in 1998 but is party to the bwc and the cwc nonetheless the us department of defense believes pakistan has the resources and capabilities to support limited bw research and development effort and likely has chemical weapons capability15 pakistan has sought technical assistance in its ballistic missile programs from north korea and china for over decade to some proliferation by states that have newly acquired wmd is inevitable resulting from diffusion of technology insufficient political will to enforce controls or demand fueled by perceived threats or the continuing prestige of wmd in the past however technology transfers between countries outside of the control regimes seemed limited by the lack of technical skill and technology or hard currency by the mid1990s however north korea had proven track record in ballistic missiles and pakistan had demonstrated its uranium enrichment capabilities although pakistan apparently was hampered by lack of hard currency it could provide north korea with route to nuclear weapons using highly enriched uranium heu this route would not only circumvent north koreas agreed framework with the united states but would also be difficult to detect using satellite imagery north korean enrichment at the time the 1994 agreed framework with north korea was negotiated there was concern about but scant evidence of north korean interest in uranium enrichment reports relating to north koreas procurement of enrichmentrelated equipment date as far back as the mid1980s time when north korea was progressing rapidly in its plutonium production program for example in 1987 north korea reportedly received small annealing furnace from the west german company leybold ag although they have many other uses annealing furnaces can be used in production of centrifuge rotors for uranium enrichment fiveyearlong german intelligence investigation conducted from 1985 to 1990 concluded that iraq and possibly iran and north korea obtained uranium melting information from 13 see the international institute for strategic studies north koreas weapons programmes net assessment london january 2004 for excellent descriptions of all north koreas wmd programs 14 see httpwwwciagovciareports721_reportsjan_jun2003htm 15 department of defense proliferation threat and response january 2001 crs5 pakistan in the late 1980s16 us intelligence sources also believed that technicians employed by leybold ag were involved in transferring equipment and information to north korea one or two such technicians were in north korea in 1989 and another leybold employee reportedly was seen there in 1990 subsidiaries of leybold ag were also involved in exporting centrifugerelated welding equipment to iraq in the late 1980s17 negotiators of the agreed framework were aware that north koreas npt obligations did not prohibit uranium enrichment and that the agreed framework did not directly address uranium enrichment18 north korea was bound not to possess plutonium reprocessing or uranium enrichment facilities by virtue of the 1992 joint declaration of denuclearized korean peninsula bilateral agreement with south korea that called for subsequent meetings the usnorth korean agreed framework required north korea to make progress in implementing the joint declaration but the process languished throughout the 1990s the us government continued to look for signs of enrichment and in 1998 the united states sent team to kumchangni to look for undeclared nuclear activities including uranium enrichment the team concluded that the site was not nuclearrelated by 1999 according to one former official however there were clear signs of active north korean interest in uranium enrichment current status north korea has continued to deny it has an enrichment program vice minister kim gye gwan told an unofficial us delegation to pyongyang in january 2004 that we do not have highly enriched uranium program and

robert gallucci who negotiated the agreed framework told roundtable convened at the center for strategic and international studies in 2003 that i would have to say that yes the agreed framework is less than perfect and there are vulnerabilitiesthe most glaring problem was that we were trying to stop the nuclear weapons program and we focused on the existing weapons program in north korea based upon plutonium but we did not achieve any additional transparency we had new inspection regime and all of us were keenly aware that one could build nuclear weapons not only with the existing facilities but also with new secret ones i was asked in testimony in 1995 and many times privately by senators and congressmen whether north korea could cheat i said yes they could and if they did it would probably be in the area of enrichment and the technology would be centrifuge this was common sense many of us had been around the track with other countries that had done exactly this although we could predict it why did we not do something about it because we did not think it was negotiable thats judgment of the negotiating team and the government at the time it was not my personal judgment only we made the best deal we could and we reported that the way to deal with this vulnerability was to monitor north korea just as carefully as we would if we did not have deal through our intelligence capabilities and the intelligence capabilities of our allies we would try to catch them if they cheated and the program we knew about we could monitor crs6 admitted to one19 in addition north korea has not admitted that it has an enrichment program in the course of the sixparty talks on february 24 2004 cia director george tenet told the senate select committee on intelligence that we believe pyongyang is pursuing production scale uranium enrichment program based on technology provided by aq khan which would give north korea an alternative route to nuclear weapons this estimate indicates either that north korea has made progress since the cia distributed onepage unclassified white paper to congress on north korean enrichment capabilities in november 2002 or that the cia has new information on north korean capabilities the november 2002 paper noted that the united states had been suspicious that north korea has been working on uranium enrichment for several years and that it obtained clear evidence recently that north korea had begun constructing centrifuge facility20 the cia concluded that north korea began centrifugebased uranium enrichment program in 2000 further the paper noted that in 2001 north korea began seeking centrifugerelated materials in large quantities it also obtained equipment suitable for use in uranium feed and withdrawal systems the cia learned that the north is constructing plant that could produce enough weaponsgrade uranium for two or more nuclear weapons per year when fully operational which could be as soon as middecade in the deputy director of national intelligences report unclassified report to congress on the acquisition of technology relating to weapons of mass destruction and advanced conventional munitions 1 january31 december 2004 pursuant to section 721 of the of the fy1997 intelligence authorization act there is mention of any north korean uranium enrichment activity or capability few observers believe that north korea now has an operating uranium enrichment plant media reports suggested that the cia had evidence of construction and of procurement clear evidence of construction of centrifuge facility could mean photographs of construction sites but the phrasing that the cia learned that the north has begun constructing plant is ambiguous enough to suggest the possibility that such information comes from defector according to former us ambassador donald gregg who became ambassador to south korea in 1989 after retiring from the cia north korea is an extraordinarily difficult target to go after21 the unclassified onepage paper distinguishes between north korea seeking materials and actually obtaining equipment according to us intelligence officials the cia does not know where north korea is enriching uranium22 according to state department official the administration has narrowed possible uranium enrichment sites down to three outside observers have suggested that

chonmasan might all be potential sites for enrichment one defector who was debriefed by chinese officials in 1999 he later returned to north korea where it is assumed he was killed claimed that north korea was operating secret uranium processing site under mt chunma commercial satellite photos of hagap show tunnel entrances but little else detecting clandestine uranium enrichment is generally considered to be more difficult than detecting clandestine plutonium production for several reasons first satellite imagery is most useful when changes can be detected at known facilities or in detecting new facilities reactors and reprocessing facilities used in plutonium production often have telltale signatures shape size features like windows in reprocessing plant connection to water source power plants or connection to an electricity grid environmental releases which facilitate remote detection uranium enrichment plants often do not although this varies among the techniques used for example gaseous diffusion enrichment plants often are very large and require tremendous amounts of electricity offering some distinguishable features in contrast centrifuge plants can be small emit few environmental signatures and do not require significant amounts of energy to operate pakistani assistance there is currently detailed unclassified information on the assistance pakistan might have offered one media report citing western officials said the aid included complete design package for centrifuge rotor assembly while japanese report stated that pakistan had exported actual centrifuge rotors 20003000 to north korea23 the washington post reported that north korean efforts to procure high strength aluminum and significant construction activity tipped off the united states24 apparently north korea attempted to obtain materials from china japan pakistan russia and europe but pakistan provided most of the assistance related to the rotors pakistani official involved in khans investigation reportedly said north korea ordered p1 centrifuge components from 1997 to 200025 the scope of pakistans cooperation with libya and iran including p1 and p2 designs nuclear weapon design for libya and some complete rotor assemblies raises significant questions about how much other help khan might have given to the north koreans in his september 2006 memoir pakistani president musharraf stated that he believes that khan sent some of pakistans most technologically advanced nuclear centrifuges26 23 cia assessment on dprk presumes massive outside help on centrifuges

times feb 10 2004 26 in book musharraf expands on north korean nuclear link washington post sept 26 2006 crs8 technical implications if north korea may already have plutoniumbased nuclear weapons what is the technical significance of acquiring uranium enrichment capability on the one hand acquiring fissile material is to many observers the most difficult part of nuclear weapons acquisition on the other hand north koreas plutonium production program is longer bound by the agreed framework north korea began operating its 5mw reactor and has claimed to have completed reprocessing the spent fuel in storage although the us has not confirmed this north korea therefore now may be able to augment its current stockpile of 12 weapons worth of plutonium with additional plutonium for about 5 to 6 weapons currently most accounts suggest that north korea does not have completed enrichment plant in order to produce enough heu for 1 to 2 weapons about 50kg north korea would require cascades of thousands of centrifuges if north korea has the capability to produce its own centrifuge rotors or has completed assemblies already producing heu might be considered easier that its other fissile material production options the unofficial us delegation that visited north korea in january reported that the larger reactor under construction at yongbyon was clearly in disrepair the unclassified cia 2002 paper estimated that north korea could produce enough weaponsgrade uranium for two or more nuclear weapons per year when the enrichment plant is fully operational27 it is not clear how this estimate was arrived at and whether evidence that pakistan provided p1 or even p2 centrifuge technology was available at that time28 revelations that libya received nuclear weapons design from foreign source raise concerns about whether north korea also received such nuclear weapons design29 according to media reports the packet of information that libya received on the nuclear weapon included chinese text and stepbystep instructions for assembling vintage1960s heu implosion device30 the chinese markings are significant because of longstanding rumors that china provided pakistan with nuclear weapons design for north korea receiving proven design for an heu 27 untitled working paper on north koreas nuclear weapons and uranium enrichment distributed by cia to congressional staff on november 19 2002 28 the p1 centrifuge design uses aluminum and is modified from 1970s urenco design which aq khan reportedly stole the pakistani program apparently now uses p2 centrifuge design which is more advanced design with greater efficiency using maraging steel 29 the international atomic energy agencys iaea report gov200412 implementation of the npt safeguards agreement of the socialist peoples libyan arab jamahiriya february 20 2004 states libya received documentation related to nuclear weapon design and fabrication from foreign source p 6 30 warhead blueprints link libya project to pakistan figure new york times february 4 2004 and libyan arms designs traced back to china washington post february 15 2004 the implicit assumption is that pakistan provided nuclear weapon design it received from china in the 1980s to libya crs9 implosion device would be significant advantage for its nuclear weapons program31 quite possibly the main benefit of centrifuge enrichment program the ability to produce fissile material clandestinely may longer be of great importance to north korea since it left the npt in 2003 nonetheless such program may make the north korean arsenal less vulnerable to possible military strikes because centrifuge enrichment facilities are hard to detect in addition the production of highly enriched uranium together with plutonium production could give the north koreans the option of producing more sophisticated nuclear weapons for example using composite pits or boosted fission techniques although there are indications that they have the technical skill to do so pakistans missile development pakistan according to many observers has two clearly distinct missile development programs the first program is run by the pakistan national development complex pndc in collaboration with the pakistan space and upper atmosphere research commission suparco and the pakistan atomic energy commission paec and has focused since the early 1980s on solidfueled ballistic missiles pakistan currently fields about 80 of the first variant the hatf 1 the hatf 1 is shortrange solid propellant unguided missile considered by some to be too small for nuclear warhead which was flighttested in 1989 and fielded in 1992 the 80kmrange was extended to 300km in the hatf 2a and to 800km in the hatf 3 despite claims of indigenous development there are many indications that the hatf 1 2 and 3 benefitted from chinese and european assistance some believe that pakistan renamed some imported chinese m11 missiles as hatf 2a missiles in the early 1990s many believe that the hatf 3 are variants of chinese m9 missiles and there are those who believe that the hatf 4 shaheen 1 may be based on chinese m 11s pakistan tested its hatf 6 missile shaheen 2 which reportedly has 2000km range in early march 2004 for the first time the second development program has been headed by khan research laboratories one report has suggested that these competing ballistic missile development efforts were aligned with competing nuclear warhead efforts that is the team developing plutonium warhead for pakistans bomb the paec worked towards developing chinesederived nuclearcapable missiles while the heu team krl collaborated with north korea on liquidfueled missiles derived from scuds32 in any event it is clear that krl cooperated with north korea in 31 there are some reports that north korean scientists were present at pakistans 1998 nuclear tests and some speculation that pakistan tested north korean plutonium device during those tests but there is little

pakistani ballistic missile engineers developed working relationships with north korean engineers in the mid1980s when they both assisted iran during the iraniraq war in fact the close resemblance of irans shahab missile and the ghauri 1 has led many to conclude that the development of the missiles was coordinated between pakistan iran and north korea around 199334 in 1992 pakistani officials visited north korea to view dong prototype and again in 1993 for dong flight test35 there are reports that thenprime minister benazir bhutto visited pyongyang for one day in december 1993 and many analysts believe missile sales were on the agenda of her visit despite her public denial36 according to one report north korea sent 5 to 12 dong missile assembly sets to pakistan between 1994 and 1997 north korea denies the allegation37 at the end of 1997 intelligence agencies observed regular flights from north korea to pakistan accelerating in the beginning of 1998 when there were about 9 flights per month these flights reportedly followed the visit of highlevel north korean officials to pakistan38 aq khan apparently made 13 visits to north korea beginning in the 1990s39 many observers believe pakistan accepted between 12 and 25 complete dong missiles in the late 1990s some observers believe that cooperation has gone both ways that pakistan assisted north korea in developing solid propellant technology the taepo dong 1 which was flighttested in august 1998 reportedly had third solidpropellant stage both iranian and pakistani personnel apparently were present for the flight test

have expressed interest in space launch vehicles north korean missiles have overwhelmingly used liquid propellants if pakistan provided such cooperation it likely would have come from paec and not krl technical implications in missile development some important milestones include extending range and payload improving accuracy and enhancing deployability for example through stable propellants and mobile launchers the mediumrange ghauri 1 missiles significantly increase pakistans ability to target india and improve pakistans ability to deploy nuclear warheads by increasing the payload with payload of 1200kg and range of 1500km the ghauri well exceeds the mtcr standard for category i or nuclearweapons capable missile 500kg300km by contrast the hatf 1 missiles have range and payload of 80km and 500kg aq khan has stated that the ghauri is pakistans only nuclear capable missile the ghauri 2 still in development will have range of between 1800 and 3000km both could reach major indian cities with large payloads the ghauri missiles because they use liquid propellant are not as easily deployed as the shaheen 1 and 2 missiles hatf 4 and 6 these solidfueled mediumrange missiles apparently are based on chinese m11s the shaheens are easier to prepare require fewer support vehicles and personnel and are far more accurate than the ghauris40 there have been unconfirmed reports that the ghauri missiles will be shelved in favor of the shaheens on the other hand the shaheen 1 has range of just 600km while the shaheen 2 has range reportedly of 2000km north korea adhered to moratorium on flighttesting ballistic missiles from september 1999 to july 2006 on july 5 2006 north korea flighttested seven missiles including taepodong2 that failed 42 seconds after launch how north koreas renewed testing will affect north koreanpakistani missile cooperation is unclear because the objectives of north korean testing and future directions of the pakistani program are not known however pakistan probably would be interested in increasing the payload and improving the accuracy and mobility of its missiles which could indicate more interest in chinese than north korean assistance pakistans nuclear sales the genesis of pakistans nuclear cooperation with north korea is murky there are few reports in trade journals of equipment passing through pakistan on the way to north korea but it is difficult to pinpoint when cooperation began in 1986 swiss officials seized equipment autoclaves and desublimers route to pakistan that is typically used in uranium enrichment

diverted from the german partner in urenco uranit gmbh to pakistan via switzerland and then reexported to north korea41 whether provided solely at the behest of khan or with the governments blessing it is clear that nuclear cooperation accelerated in the 1990s one report says that cooperation between pakistan and north korea expanded into the nuclear and missile areas in benazir bhuttos second term 1993 to 1996 to include exchanges of scientists and engineers42 if khan piggybacked his nuclear deals onto missile cooperation then he certainly would have had many more opportunities in the mid and late1990s than before as noted earlier pakistani official involved in khans investigation reportedly said north korea ordered p1 centrifuge components from 1997 to 200043 it is clear that the pakistan government sought to reorganize some of its nuclear programs and structure following the may 1998 tests reportedly because it was now declared nuclear weapons state part of this restructuring apparently included issuing regulations for controlling nuclear exports in june 2000 the pakistani government published an advertisement announcing procedures for commercial exports of nuclear material prospective exporters would need objection certificate from the pakistan atomic energy commission which would also have the authority to verify and inspect all prospective nuclear exports according to an article in the pakistan daily dawn the items listed in the advertisement can be in the form of metal alloys chemical compounds or other materials containing any of the following 1 natural depleted or enriched uranium 2 thorium plutonium or zirconium 3 heavy water tritium or beryllium 4 natural or artificial radioactive materials with more than 0002 microcuries per gram 5 nucleargrade graphite with boron equivalent content of less than five parts per million and density greater than 15gcubic centimeter44 many of those items would be useful in nuclear weapons program the advertisement also listed equipment for production use or application of nuclear energy and generation of electricity including nuclear power and research reactors reactor pressure vessels and

towers neutron generator systems and industrial gamma irradiators these guidelines which implied that fissile material could be exported apparently conflicted with earlier regulations several days later pakistans ministry of commerce retracted the notice saying that procedures were still under consideration45 the us state department reportedly responded by suggesting that the regulations did not authorize such exports but seemed to be drawn from international control lists us and pakistani officials apparently have been discussing export control measures since at least 2000 key feature of pakistans regulations however is the explicit exemption of ministry of defense agencies from controls which suggests that weapons programs under military leadership could skirt domestic export control laws46 us government responses us officials reportedly raised with islamabad suspicions of nuclear technology transfers between pakistan and north korea in 2000 prompting an investigation that revealed that krl scientists had large deposits of money in their personal bank accounts pakistani officials reportedly informed the united states that the cooperation was conducted by individuals 47 in march 2001 reportedly at us insistence aq khan was removed from his position as head of krl but retained the post of presidential adviser until early 2004 shortly after khans dismissal deputy secretary of state armitage was quoted by the financial times as saying that people who were employed by the nuclear agency and have retired could be spreading nuclear technology to other states including north korea48 senior us nonproliferation official explained weeks later that armitages statement led to confusion about the cooperation that it was really limited to missile cooperation49 45

involvement with north koreas nuclear program pakistans ambassador to the united states ashraf jehangir qazi told the washington post that material technology ever has been exported to north korea adding that while pakistan has engaged in trade with north korea nobody can tell us if there is evidence one is challenging our word there is smoking gun50 nonetheless secretary of state powell told abcs this week that president musharraf gave his assurance as he has previously that pakistan is not doing anything of that naturethe past is that past i am more concerned about what is going on now we have new relationship with pakistan51 powell stressed that he has put president musharraf on notice in my conversations with president musharraf i have made clear to him that any any sort of contact between pakistan and north korea we believe would be improper inappropriate and would have consequences52 khans confession in 2004 raises an important question of whether the pakistani government knew of aided or abetted his nuclear assistance to north korea khan has alleged that military officials knew of the transfers but few details have emerged one account states that generals musharraf karamat and waheed knew of aid to north korea when they were chiefs of the army staff53 pakistani officials have consistently averred that any nuclear technology was transferred on personal basis without the acquiescence or knowledge of the pakistani government54 this could explain why the bush administration thus far has not sought sanctions against pakistan in letter to key senators and members of congress on march 12 2003 assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs paul kelly wrote that the administration carefully reviewed the facts relating to the possible transfer of nuclear technology from pakistan to north korea and decided that they do not warrant the imposition of sanctions under applicable us laws however president musharraf revealed in his 2006 memoir that he suspected khan was cooperating with north koreans as early as 1999 when he received report that some north korean nuclear experts under the guise of missile engineers had arrived and were being given secret briefings55 50 pakistans n korea deals stir scrutiny aid to nuclear arms bid may be recent washington post november 13 2002 51 reported in north korea got little help from neighbors

news agency according to this and other reports the apparent tipoff was tens of thousands of dollars deposited into the personal bank accounts of pakistani scientists at kahuta khan research laboratories 55 in book musharraf expands on north korean nuclear link washington post sept 26 2006 crs15 apparently president musharraf sought to dampen rumors that pakistan traded nuclear secrets for missile help by stating that whatever we bought from north korea is with money56 evidence of such barter would clearly implicate the pakistani military and government which could complicate us decisions on aid to pakistan and possibly trigger us sanctions one analyst has suggested that pakistans foreign currency reserve crisis in 1996 might have made barter arrangement attractive57 in that year the government was able to avoid defaulting on external debt with help from the international monetary fund and borrowed 500m from domestic banks58 the reserves at that time were 773 million the equivalent of about three weeks of imports59 the next year visits of north korean and pakistani officials accelerated although this could be attributed solely to missile cooperation issues for congress north koreas actions alone raise significant policy questions for congress specifically on how to roll back capability that north korea refuses to admit it has however wmd trade between two proliferators raises host of other issues that may be pertinent to congress oversight of nonproliferation programs and strategy and counterterrorism first leverage is needed from outside the traditional nonproliferation framework since neither north korea nor pakistan is member of the missile or nuclear control regimes china is an obvious source of leverage because of its longstanding diplomatic military and economic ties to both countries but the development of new relationship between the united states and pakistan based on counterterrorism cooperation may also be source of leverage second this example of secondary proliferation highlights the critical roles of sanctions interdiction and intelligence nonproliferation sanctions appear to have had little effect on north korea and pakistan while comprehensive sanctions against libya over thirty years appear to have helped libya decide to renounce its wmd60 although intelligence information was used to help alert pakistani officials to khans technology trade interdiction appeared to play secondary role it is not yet clear whether khans forced retirement in 2001 cut off trade in which case intelligence would have played leading role or whether it continued beyond that until inspections in iraq and libyas confessions made khans position untenable 56 pakistan rejects nuclear inspection london financial

approached the united states in 1999 to discuss eliminating its wmd crs16 further intelligence information has not been able to locate uranium enrichment facilities in north korea congress may wish to explore in the context of the presidents nonproliferation initiatives outlined on february 11 2004 how to improve these capabilities the example of wmd trade between north korea and pakistan raises particular questions about how to interpret proliferation threats within the nexus of terrorism and wmd do these developments compromise the security of the united states and its allies because pakistan and north korea are developing new capabilities or because sales of sensitive technologies continue unabated and could expand to terrorists since september 2001 the nexus of proliferation of wmd and terrorism has been called one of the greatest threats to us security although north korea is one of the seven state sponsors of terrorism some in the administration believe that the nexus of terrorism and wmd is not as pronounced in north korea as it has been elsewhere for example in iraq61 others believe however that there is danger of north korea proliferating its nuclear technology pakistan while not state sponsor of terrorism clearly has terrorist activities on its soil and potential terrorist access to its nuclear weapons has been particular concern since september 11 2001 at that time nonproliferation concerns about pakistan centered on the security of the pakistani nuclear arsenal from terrorists and the activities of pakistani nuclear scientists providing assistance to terrorists or other states the inadvertent leakage of nuclear knowhow appeared to be serious threat although the pakistani government repeatedly has assured the world that its nuclear program is safe there are those who believe this may not be true in the case of trade with north korea it is unclear whether alleged nuclear transfers occurred with the blessing of the pakistani government or on the personal initiative of scientists some have maintained that pakistan should be able to provide evidence that it provided cash rather than nuclear technology in return for north korean missiles and components that apparently were loaded onto governmentowned c130 aircraft others maintain the united states should press harder for direct access to khan to learn the scope of his activities broader question is whether the bush administration has given higher priority since september 2001 to cooperation on counterterrorism than to cooperation in nonproliferation for example when north korea shipped scud missiles to yemen in december 2002 north korea was sanctioned while yemen was not sanctioned for receiving them yemen has been actively cooperating with the united states in counterterrorism activities62 when asked if the countries that provided assistance to north korea on the enrichment program would risk being cut off from us assistance white house spokesman ari fleischer responded 61 remarks by deputy secretary of state armitage to senate foreign relations committee hearing on north korea february 4 2003 62 when asked at the daily press briefing on december 11 2002 about waiving sanctions against yemen for its receipt of scuds from north korea state department richard boucher said we decided to waive it because of the commitments that they yemen had made and in consideration of their support for the war on terrorism he later elaborated that we have done lot of cooperation training exchange of information law enforcement cooperation with the government of yemen and we want to continue to do that crs17 well yes since september 11th many things that people may have done years before september 11th or some time before september 11th have changed september 11th changed the world and it changed many nations behaviors along with it and dont read that to be any type of acknowledgment of what may or may not be true but september 11th did change the world63 fleischers statement appears to imply that forgiveness of proliferation that occurred before september 11 2001 is in order because counterterrorism takes precedence over counterproliferation combating terrorism and weapons of mass destruction however are both important objectives for the united states and congress may consider in its oversight role how we can successfully balance both pakistan is clearly key ally in the global war on terror but the considerable uncertainty about the pakistani governments involvement in khans activities particularly with respect to north korea raises questions about its past but also future cooperation in combating the spread of weapons of mass destruction 63 transcript white house press briefing october 18 2002 for
