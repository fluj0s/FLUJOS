civil war had thorough and effective set of rules with which to protect individual and group privacy from the means of compulsory disclosure and physical surveillance known in that era1 toward the end of the 19th century new technology the telephone the microphone and dictograph recorder and improved cameras presented major new challenges to privacy protection during the closing decades of the 20th century extensions of these and other new technology developments the computer genetic profiling and digital surveillance further heightened anxieties about the loss of personal privacy in response congress has legislated various privacy protections and on two occasions mandated national study commissions to assist in this effort 1 alan f westin privacy and freedom new york atheneum 1970 pp 337338 crs2 privacy protection study commission while the privacy act of 1974 directly addressed several aspects of personal privacy protection the statute also mandated the privacy protection study commission temporary sevenmember panel tasked to make study of the data banks automated data processing programs and information systems of governmental regional and private organizations in order to determine the standards and procedures in force for the protection of personal information2 the commission was to recommend to the president and the congress the extent if any to which the

care sectors of the us economy some 200 bills incorporating recommendations from the commissions report were introduced during the 96th congress but major legislation applying fair information practice principles to personal information collected and managed by the insurance and medical care industries failed to be enacted and the opposition was sufficient to discourage return to such legislative efforts for several years federal paperwork commission in 1974 congress also established temporary 14member commission on federal paperwork giving it broad mandate to consider variety of
