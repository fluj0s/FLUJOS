capital crimes made punishable by death life imprisonment or imprisonment for any term of years the suggestion that sentence of imprisonment for zero years is sentence any term of years being inconsistent with the intent of congress given the seriousness of the offense to which the sentence attaches on the other hand most would probably not char acterize as mandatory minimum any capital or flat sentence statute that permitted imposition of fine as an alternative sentence see eg 18 usc 1589 emphasis added if death results from viol ation of this section the defendant shall be fined under

recognized category of mandatory minimums consists of the flat or single sentence statutes1 closely related are the capital punishment statutes that require imposition of either the deat h penalty or imprisonment for life2 the piggyback statutes make up third class the piggyback statutes are not themselves mandatory minimums but sentence offenders by referen ce to an underlying statute with mandatory minimums or otherwise3 the final and least obvious group is comprise d of statutes whose violation results in the imposition of mandatory minimum term of imprisonment by operation of law or more precisely by operation of the sentencing reform act and the sentencing guidelines issued in its name this category includes many felonies punishable by imprisonment for not more than 5 years and most felonies with maximum penalties in excess of 5 years we have omitted discussion of the pr oposals in this category in the interest of brevity constitutional boundaries the constitution precludes
