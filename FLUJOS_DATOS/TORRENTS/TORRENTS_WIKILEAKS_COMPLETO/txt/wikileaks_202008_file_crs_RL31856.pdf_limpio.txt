commissioner from puerto rico holds an office specifically differentiated from that of territorial delegate in congress the office of territorial delegate has been recognized in law since before the adoption of the federal constitution the northwest ordinance of 1787 measure enacted by congress under the articles of confederation provided for territorial delegate to represent the territory northwest of the ohio river when the constitution was ratified and the new congress assembled the northwest ordinance was reenacted providing for the organization of gove rnment in the territory under the act the territorial legislature once formed was authorized to elect delegate to congress who shall have seat in congress with right of debating but not of voting during this temporary government 1 the first territorial delegate was seated in 1794 subsequently the territorial delegates served as transitional figures during the period in which various territorial governments moved gradually toward admission as states this was the traditional practice for territories created during the westward continental expansion regardless of whether territory had been part of the original land area claimed by the 13 former british colonies or whether the territory had been acqu ired by purchase or conquest through the treaty ending the spanishamerican war of 1898 the united states acquired number of overseas territories the legal status of the inhabitants of these territories was matter of controversy2 what emerged was new legal concept that of an unincorporated territory earlier incorporated territories were considered integral parts of the united states to which all relevant provisions of the constitution applied it was generally understood that such territories were bound for eventual statehood the overseas territories acquired through the peace treaty ending the war of 1898 were considered unincorporated territories however and only the fundamental part of the constitution applied to these lands3 in the case of puerto rico and the philippines congress granted by law new form of territorial representation these two territories were to be represented in washington dc by resident commissioners the term was new to american lega l usage but was widely used in the british empire to indicate crown representative sent to territory to manage the affairs of the home government in american usage the resident commissioner was an agent of the local government and citizenry sent to represent their interests at the national capital the office of resident commissioner was clearly different from that of congressional delegate delegates like members of the house were chosen for twoyear terms the resident commissioners were chosen initially for twoyear but later for fouryear terms delegates were legislators while the statutes creating the posts of resident commissioner gave these officials legislative duties and executive responsibilities as well 1 act of aug 7 1789 ch 8 1 stat 50 this law incorporating provisions from the earlier ordinances of the articles of confederation congress was necessary to fit the territorial structure in the old northwest into the new constitutional framework 2 one of the foremost constitutional scholars in american history max farrand commented extensively on the varieties of government established in us possessions during the 18th and 19th centuries see his article territory and district american historical review vol 5 4 july 1900 pp 676681 see also his booklength treatment legislation of congress for the government of the organized territories of the united states 17891895 newark nj baker printers 1896 3 the concept of unincorporated territories was first enunciated by chief justice edward d white in concurring opinion in downes v bidwell 182 us 244 45 l ed 1088 21 s ct 770 1901 the distinction between incorporated and unincorporated territories was first endorsed by majority of the

although the house passed bill in 1900 providing for the selection of delegate from puerto rico the senate amended the measure to establis h instead an office of resident commissioner the senate action was predicated on opposition to potential for statehood that was implicit in establishing the post of delegate as senator john coit spooner chairman of the senate rules committee stated there is difference between delegate in congress and member except in the matter of vote it has always been considered pledge of statehood congress gives delegate to people except upon the theory that the time is to come when they shall be admitted to statehood and entitled to participate as one of the states of the union i know not how time may change my own view on that subject but i am frank to say with heart full of kindness for that people i am not yet ready nor are we called upon now to give that quasi pledge of statehood or to imply that they will ever reach condition where it shall be either for their interests or certainly for ours to let them become one of the members of this union 4 at first the resident commissioners were not fully welcome in the house of representatives the act creating the office set the salary of the resident commissioner at 5000 per annum the same as that for members of congress but did not specify his responsibilities in the house of representatives if any as one scholar has ted the resident commissioner was given neither voice nor vote in congressional deliberations in fact he was not even allowed on the floor of the house his only contacts with the members were at their private quarters or in committee rooms 5 the house took incremental steps to grant more privileges to the resident commissioner from puerto rico on june 28 1902 the house agreed to hres 169 introduced by representative henry allen cooper rwi the chairman of the house insular affairs committee to amend house rules to give floor privileges to the resident commissioner with the adoption of the resolution the commissioner was put on par with the clerks of house committees heads of executive departments foreign ministers and the librarian of congress in having access to the house chamber however the resident commissioner was still not allowed to speak on the house floor it was not until 1904 that the house granted to the resident commissioner the same right to speak on the floor and to serve on committees as was accorded to territorial delegates the issue of granting more parliamentary rights to the resident commissioner was directly connected to efforts by representative cooper and others to amend the organic act for puerto rico to provide for the election of territorial delegate instead of resident commissioner the house rules committee reported resolution hres 197 58 th congress amending house rule xii to grant the commissioner the same powers and privileges as to committee service and in the house as are possessed by delegates representative john sharp williams the ranking minority member of the rules committee sought to recommit the resolution to the rules committee with instructions that the resident commissioner receive the same rights and privileges as delegates and that the house begin consideration within two weeks of bill hr 3540 sponsored by 4 sen john coit spooner remarks in the senate congressional record apr

order raised by representative john dalzell the rules committee floor manager the speaker ruled williamss motion to recommit out of order the house agreed to h res 197 by voice vote thereupon speaker joseph g cannon named the resident commissioner federico degetau to the committee on insular affairs6 initially the resident commissioner was limited to service on the insular affairs committee but the house slowly took actions to assign the commissioner to other panels in 1933 in the 76th congress resident commissioner santiago iglesi as became the first commissioner to serve on additional committees being named to the agriculture labor and territories committees in addition to the committee on insular affairs thereafter resident commissioner served only on the insular affairs committee or the current committee on resources which has assumed jurisdiction over territorial affairs legislation

serve on broader range of committees the commissioner had right to vote in committee nor to acquire seniority leading to leadership post on subcommittee or full committee7 this changed with the passage of the legislative reorganization act of 1970 measure reorganizing the operations of the house and senate including their committees provisions in the reorganization bill then being considered by the house sought to remove obsolete provisions from house rules among these provisions still in house rules in 1970 was language specifying the committees to which th resident commissioner from puerto rico and the delegates from alaska and hawaii were to be assigned as additional members despite the admission of the latter two territories to statehood decade earlier the house version of the bill proposed merely to delete references to alaska and hawaii and to continue language in rule xii requiring the resident commissioner to serve as an additional nonvoting member on the committees on which he served without accruing seniority resident commissioner jorge cordova offered an amendment in the committee of the whole to revise the rule to read as follows 6 resident commissioner to the united states from porto rico remarks of rep john dalzell and others congressional record feb 4 1904 vol 38 pp 15231529 the house was less direct in providing such rights to the two resident commissioners from the philippines on feb 4 1908 the house agreed to resolution reported by rep dalzell granting the privileges of the floor with the right of debate to the philippine resident commissioners because this resolution did not amend house rules its authority lapsed with the expiration of the 60 th cong in the 61st cong on jan 7 1910 dalzell presented by unanimous consent standing order not rule authorizing the privileges of the floor with the right to debate to the two resident commissioners by name commissioners legarda and quezon in the 62nd cong another resolution granted the right of debate to the two resident commissioners from the philippines thereafter the house did not renew these reso lutions and the philippine resident commissioners were recognized for debate by unanimous consent unlike the resident commissioner from puerto rico the philippine resident commissioners were never assigned to committees 7 the resident commissioner was not the only one to be denied the right to vote or accrue seniority in committees the ban applied to all territorial delegates as well but after the admission of hawaii and alaska to statehood the resident commissioner from puerto rico was the only nonvoting member of the house delegates were provided for the district of columbia the us virgin isla nds guam and american samoa during the 1970s

be elected to serve on standing committees in the same manner as members of the house and shall possess in committees the same powers and privileges as the other members the effect of the amendment was to give the resident commissioner the right to vote in any committee on which he was elected to serve to accrue seniority and to assume leadership post within any committee the amendment was opposed by the bills floor manager representative bf sisk who was also senior member of the house rules committee arguing that the office of delegate and by implication that of the resident commissioner was created as courtesy to the territories sisk claimed that just as it would be unconstitutiona l for delegate to vote in the house it would be equally unconstitutional for delegate to vote in committee delegate from territory is not member of the house of representatives manifestly the house could not elect to one of its standing committees person who is not member of the house representative thomas s foley supported the amendment arguing that giving delegates voting rights in committee was only matter of the internal organization of the house and did not raise constitutional question the committees of the house of representatives are creatures of the house of representatives they can be extinguished at will and created at will the point is that the constitutional issue does not touch preliminary advisory votes which is what standing committee votes are but only the votes which are cast in committee of the whole or the full house these votes can be cast only by members of congress so nothing that the resident commissioner could do in committee vote could become final decision unless majority of the elected members of congress supported his position representative robert mcclory member of the joint committee on the organization of congress which had assembled the recommendations contained in the bill supported foleys position it is true that if he delegate or resident commissioner acts on matters in committee that he is not going to be able to make any laws through vote on the floor of the house with respect to such legislation sisk responded to the statements in support of the cordova amendment by clearly enunciating the parliamentary implications of permitti ng delegates to vote in committee i wanted to ask the gentleman from washington mr foley if he wishes to or will accept him the resident commissioner as part of quorumin other words will he be counted for the purpose of quorum in committee i do not see the gentleman on the floor at the moment but i am curious to know if it would be interpreted that he would be entitled to vote in the committee of the whole house on the state of the union as the committee of the whole certainly is separate and apart from the house and in the same sense is creature of the house in the same sense that committee is creature of the house although representative foley was not present to answer the inquiry commissioner cordova claimed that it was not his intention to seek voting rights in committee of the whole the amendment which i have offered refers expressly to the standing committees i believe the committee of the whole house is not standing committee representative hugh carey member of the interior committee on which cor dova also served noted that any delegates decisive committee vote in support of measure or an amendment could be overturned by subsequent vote of the house

expanding the authority of the resident commissioner to vote in the committee of the whole house on the state of the union greater attention was paid to the issue in subsequent years in the 1970s congress authorized the election of nonvoting delegates from the district of columbia guam the us virgin islands and american samoa together the nonvoting members have achieved greater degree of influence because of their rising numbers suggestions were made as early as 1985 that the nonvoting members could constitutionally be permitted to vote in committee of the whole house on the same basis through which they were permitted to vote in house committees the committee of the whole is in some respects the house of representatives meeting in another form every house member including the nonvoting members is automatically member of the committee of the whole unlike the house however the committee of the whole operates under different rules that permit more members to participate in debate and provide for the expeditious consideration of amendments to bills actions taken by the committee of the whole however are not final any amendment agreed to in committee of the whole must also be submitted to the full house for approval an amendment defeated in committee of the whole is not normally considered again in the house house rules also set the quorum in committee of the whole at 100 members an unconstitutionally low number that would prohibit any final action on measure from being taken there participation in committee of the whole is important because if the house is going to permit amendments to be offered to measure the measure will almost always be considered in committee of the whole additionally house rule s require that measures dealing with money appropriations and revenue measures as well as authorizing bills be considered in committee of the whole in 1993 the house amended its rules to permit the resident commissioner and the delegates to vote in committee of the whole some members were concerned that the votes of delegates and the resident commissioner against an amendment could succeed in blocking consideration of the proposal by the full house thereby allowing nonvoting members to determine the final outcome on legislative item because granting this potential authority to them might be considered unconstitutional the new house rule permitted the resident commissioner and the delegates to vote on amendments in committee of the whole but required an immediate second vote in the house with only members from the states voting if the combined votes of the resident commissioner and the delegates were decisive in the outcome of the committee of the whole vote the house republican leadership filed suit arguing that the rule was unconstitutional court rulings at the us district court and appeals court levels let the rule stand 9 at the beginning of 8 the complete debate on the cordova amendment can be found in

the 110th congress or about 21 per member including the nonvoting members there is much greater variation among house members in the number of measures each endorses as cosponsor partial survey of the data indicates that the resident commissioner and the delegates are often more active in cosponsoring bills than is typical voting member of the house it may be that the resident commissioner and the delegates use cosponsorship as an implied substitute for vote on the floor in support of measure the resident commissioner can also have substantial impact on legislation considered by the committees on which he serves as voting member although nonvoting member has served as standing committee chair or ranking minority member since the delegates and resident commissioner were granted committee voting rights number of have served as subcommittee chairs or ranking members such subcommittee leaders play major role in determining the agenda of their subcommittee in determining which measures will receive action and which will not and in allocating staff resources to conduct investigations into matters within the purview of the subcommittee continued 9 michel v anderson 817 f supp 126 ddc

already been settled to qualify to offer the motion the member offering it must have voted on the winning side during the earlier vote since the resident commissioner and delegates cannot vote in the house they cannot have voted on the winning side and therefore do not qualify to offer such motion httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31856g20g142g156g146g141g142g151g157g561g5g152g150g150g146

can offer amendments or other parliamentary motions during committee consideration of bills these can often change the pending measures substantially for example in the 105th congress hr 856 the united statespuerto rico political status act was reported from the house natural resources committee after the committee had agreed to three amendments offered during the committee markup by the resident commissioner from puerto rico12 the resident commissioner and delegates can also use other parliamentary mechanisms to convey their specific views on pending legislation for example in 2002 the resident commissioner introduced hr 3955 bill to designate certain lands in the caribbean national forest as wilderness areas when the measure was reported from committee the commissioner took the opportunity provided by house rules to file written supplemental views for inclusion in the committee report13 such statements help guide federal agencies in implementing bills which later become law the resident commissioner has often acted in concert with hispanic members of the house in 1970 resident commissioner cordova was one of the five founding members of the congressional hispanic caucus commissioners since that time have been active members of the caucus regardless of their political party affiliation acting together with others on matters of mutual concern provides some means by whic h the resident commissioner can influence action in the committees on which he does not serve since most of the hispanic caucus members are voting members of the house they can also wo rk with the resident commissioner on matters of mutual interest nevertheless there are subjects on which the hispanic caucus is divided and the resident commissioner may not always have th support of colleagues in the caucus these factors can help the resident commissioner in the legislative functions assigned to the office notwithstanding these practices the lack of vote in the house has an obvious impact on the role and influence that the resident commissioner or any of the delegates may have in the legislative process as mainland representative commented about the role of the resident commissioner in seeking legislative action on measure important to the island i cannot describe what life must be like at the bargaining table without vote14 the resident commissioner can also benefit from the large presence of puerto rican voters in many congressional districts on the mainland nearly three and onehalf million people of puerto rican origin or ancestry live in the continental united states according to the 2000 census and form significant electoral base in number of states matters of concern to puerto ricans living outside the commonwealth may therefore become matters of importance to house members from these states in addition several representatives and senators have had firsthand experience in puerto rico serving as peace corps volunteers in the commonwealth or serving in puerto rico during their military service as former resident commissioner was quoted as saying about his interactions with colleagues we are american citizens and somebody has to go 12 us
