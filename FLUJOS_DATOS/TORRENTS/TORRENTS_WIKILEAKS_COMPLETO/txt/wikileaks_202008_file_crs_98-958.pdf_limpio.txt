is brief overview of the adjustments made in recent treaties to accommodate american law enforcement interests and then nutshell overview of the federal law gove rning foreign requests to extradite fugitive found in this country and united states request for extradition of fugitive found in foreign country extradition treaties are in the nature of contract and generate the most controversy with respect to those matters for which extradition may not be had in addition to an explicit list of crimes for which extradition may be granted most modern extradition treaties also identify various classes of offenses for which extradition may or must be denied common among these are provisions excluding purely military and political offenses capital offenses crimes that are punishable under only the laws of one of the parties to the treaty crimes committed outside the country seeking extradition crimes where the fugitive is national of the country of refuge and crimes barred by double jeopardy or statute of limitations extradition is triggered by request submitted through diplomatic channels in this country it proceeds through the departments of justice and state and may be presented to federal magistrate to order hearing to determine whether the request is in compliance with an applicable treaty whether it provides sufficient evidence to satisfy probable cause to believe that the fugitive committed the identified treaty offenses and whether other treaty requirements have been met if so the magistrate certifies the case for extradition at the discretion of the secretary of state except as provided by treaty the magistrate does not inquire into the nature of foreign proceedings likely to follow extradition the laws of the country of refuge and the applicable extradition treaty govern extradition back to the united states of fugitive located overseas requests travel through diplomatic channels and the only issue likely to arise after extradition to this country is whether the extraditee has been tried for crimes other than those for which he or she was extradited the fact that extradition was ignored and fugitive forcibly returned to the ited states for trial constitutes jurisdictional impediment to trial or punishment federal and foreign immigration laws sometimes serve as less controversial alternative to extradition to and from the united

over hundred of the nations of the world although there are many with whom the united states has extradition treaty2 international terrorism and drug trafficking have made extradition an increasingly important law enforcement tool3 although extradition as we know it is of relatively recent origins4 its roots can be traced to antiquity scholars have identify procedures akin to extradition scattered throughout history dating as far back as the time of moses5 by 1776 notion had evolved to the effect that every state was obliged to grant extradition freely and without qualification or restriction or to punish wrongdoer itself and the absence of intricate extradition procedures has been attributed to the predominance of this simple principle of international law 6 1 harvard research in

evolution of the principle modern extradition treaties and practices began to emerge in this country and elsewhere by the middle eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries7 our first extradition treaty consisted of single terse article in jays treaty of 1794 with great britain but it contained several of the basic fe atures of contemporary extradition pacts article xxvii of the treaty provided in its entirety it is further agreed that his majesty and the united states on mutual requisitions by them respectively or by their respective ministers or officers authorized to make the same will deliver up to justice all persons who being charged with murder or forgery committed within the jurisdiction of the other provided that this shall only be done on such evidence of criminality as according to the laws of the place where the fugitive or person so charged shall be found would justify his apprehension and commitment for trial if the offence had there been committed the expense of such apprehension and delivery shall be borne and defrayed by those who make the requisition and receive the fugitive 8

treaties are in the nature of contract and by operation of international law state party to an extradition treaty is obligated to comply with the request of another state party to that treaty to arrest and deliver person duly shown to be sought by that state for trial on charge of having committed crime covered by the treaty within the jurisdiction of the requesting state or b for punishment after conviction of such crime and flight from that state provided that none of the grounds for refusal to extradite set forth in the treaty is applicable 9 subject to contrary treaty provision federal law defines the mechanism by which we honor our extradition treaty obligations10 although some countries will extradite in the absence of an applicable treaty as matter of comity it was long believed that the united states could only grant an extradition request if it could claim coverage under an existing extradition treaty 18 7 by the latter part of the nineteenth century that principle had yielded to the view that delivery of persons charged with or convicted of crimes in another state was at most moral duty not required by customary international law but generally governed by treaty and subject to various limitations network of bilateral treaties differing in detail but having considerable similarity in principle and scope has spelled out these limitations and in conjunction with state legislation practice and judicial decisions has created body of law with substantial uniformity in major respects but the network of treaties has not created principle of customary law requiring extradition and it is accepted that states are not required to extradite except as obligated to do so by treaty i d from the perspective of one commentator the history of extradition can be divided into four periods 1 ancient times to the seventeenth century period revealing an most exclusive concern for political and religious offenders 2 the eighteenth century and half of the nineteenth century period of treatymaking chiefly concerning military offenders characterizing the condition of europe during that period 3 1833 to 1948 period of collective concern for suppressing common criminality and 4 post 1948 developments which ushered in greater concern for protecting human rights of persons and revealed an awareness of the need to have international due process of law regulate international relations b assiouni at 33 8 8 stat 116 129 1794 9 1 r estatement 475 at 559 10 18 usc 3181 to 3196

this requirement however was one of congressional choice rather than constitutional requirement12 g16g152g561g22g155g142g138g157g162g561 congress appears to have acted upon that assumption when in 1996 it first authorized the extradition of fugitive aliens even at the behest of nation with whom we have extradition treaty 13 and then by statute making the extradition procedures applicable to requests from international tribunals for ugoslavia and rwanda14 the initial judicial response has left the vitality of those efforts somewhat in doubt district court in texas initially ruled that constitutional separation of powers requirements precluded extradition in the absence of treaty but the fifth circuit court of appeals upheld the constitutional validity of extradition by statute rather than treaty when it overturned the district court finding on appeal15 question has occasionally arisen over whether an extradition treaty with colonial power continues to apply former colony becomes independent although the united states periodically renegotiates replacements or supplements for existing treaties to make contemporary adjustments we have number of treaties that predate the dissolution of colonial bond or some other adjustment in governmental status fugitives in these situations have sometimes contested extradition on the grounds that we have valid extradition treaty with the successor government that asks that they be handed over for prosecution these efforts are generally unsuccessful since successor governments will ordinarily have assumed the extradition treaty obligations negotiated by their predecessors 16 11 18 usc 3181 the provisions of this chapter relating to the surrender of persons who have committed crimes in foreign countries shall continue

an explicit list of crimes for which extradition may be granted most modern extradition treaties also identify various classes of offenses for which extradition may or must be denied common among these are provisions excluding purely military and political offenses the military crimes exception usually refers to those offenses like desertion which have equivalents in civilian criminal law 20 the exception is on relatively recent vintage21 in the case of treaties that list specific extraditable offenses the exception is unnecessary since purely military offenses are not listed the exception became advisable however with the advent of treaties that make extraditable any misconduct punishable under the laws of both treaty partners with the possible exception of selective service cases arising during the vietnam war period 22 recourse to the military offense exception appears to have been infrequent and untroubled the political offense exception however has proven more

number of nations have abolished or abandoned capital punishment as sentencing alternative29 several of these have preserved the right to deny extradition in capital cases either absolutely or in

resides in all extradition treaties that do not deny its application33 the point is largely academic since it is common feature of all american extradition treaties34 subject to varying interpretations the united states favors the view that treaties should be construed to honor an extradition request if possible thus dual criminality does not require that the name by which the crime is described in the two countries shall be same nor that the scope of the liability shall be coextensive or in other respects the same in the two countries it is enough if the particular act charged is criminal in both jurisdictions 35 when foreign country seeks to extradite fugitive from the united states dual criminality may be satisfied by reference to either federal or state law36 our treaty partners do not always construe dual criminality requirements as broadly in the past some have been unable to find equivalents for ttempt conspiracy rico cce and crimes with prominent federal

where they are committed there have always been exceptions to this general rule under which nation was understood to have authority to outlaw and punish conduct occurring out side the confines of its own territory in the past our extradition treaties applied to crimes committed within the territorial jurisdiction of the country seeking extradition 41 largely as consequence of terrorism and drug trafficking however the united states now claims more sweepi ng extraterritorial application for our criminal laws than recognized either in our more historic treaties or by many of todays

country to refuse to extradite ones own nationals is probably the greatest single obstacle to extradition the united states has long objected to the impediment45 and recent treaties indicate that its hold may not be as formidable as was once the case at one time it was fair to say that united states extradition treaties contained generally three types of such provisions the first does not refer to nationals specifically but agrees to the extradition of all persons judicial construction as well as executive interpretation of such clauses have consistently held that the word person includes nationals and therefore refusal to surrender fugitive because he is national cannot be justified the second and most common type of treaty provision provides that neither of the contracting parties shall be bound to deliver up its own citizens or subjects congress has enacted legislation to overcome judicial construction that precluded the united states from surrendering an american under such provision 46 the third type of treaty provision states that neither of the contracting parties shall be bound to deliver up its own citizens under the stipulations of this convention but the executive authority of each shall have the power to deliver them up if in its discretion it be deemed proper do so47 these basic three have been joined by number of variants growing number go so far as to

this has lead to discomfort whenever an effort is made to insert the federal courts in the midst of an executive or legislative process such as the issuance of purely advisory opinions68 the fact that extradition turns on the discretion of the secretary of state following judicial certification has led to the suggestion that the procedure established by the extradition statute is constitutionally offensive to this separation of powers first broached by district court in the district of columbia69 subsequent courts have rejected the suggestion in large measure under the view that much like the issuance of search or arrest warrant the task is compatible with tasks constitutionally assigned to the judiciary70 continued doc 10422 eff nov 21 1996 extradition treaty with uruguay art 16 35 ust

fearing torture may petition through habeas corpus for review of the secretarys decision to rrender him following court certification of extraditability id at 101415 because the secretary had not yet made an extradition decision in the case the court affirmed the denial of habeas relief without prejudice to new filing should the secretary decide to extradite the petitioner id at 101617 after the secretary made the decision to extradite the petitioner filed second habeas petition based on cornejobarreto i on appeal the ninth circuit held that the conclusion in cornejobarreto i as to the availability of apa review was nonbinding dicta b ecause the secretary had not yet made decision to extradite when that case was decided cornejobarreto v siefert 379 f3d 1075 1082 9th cir2004 cornejobarreto ii considering the issue anew the court concluded that under the doctrine of noninquiry the secretarys decision to extradite was not subject to judicial review and farr and the apa did nothing to change this result id at 1087 the ninth circuit granted rehearing banc in the case but following the government s decision to withdraw its extradition claim the case was dismissed as moot

that the case satisfies the legal requirements for extradition the fugitive has right of appeal but may be entitled to limited review under habeas corpus 103 habeas corpus is available only to inquire whether the magistrate had jurisdiction whether the offense charged is within the treaty and by somewhat liberal extension whether there was any evidence warranting the finding that there was reasonable ground to believe the accused guilty104 in this last assessment appellate courts will only examine the magistrate judges determination of probable cause to see if there is any evidence to

approve requests for extradition of fugitives from federal charges or convictions and may be asked to review requests from state prosecutors before they are considered by the state department113 provisions in the united states attorneys manual and the corresponding justice departments criminal resource manual sections supplement treaty instructions on the pr ocedures to be followed in order to forward request to the state department114 the first step is to determine whether the fugi tive is extraditable the justice departments checklist for determining extraditability begins w ith an identification of the country in which the fugitive has taken refuge115 if we have extradition treaty with the country of refuge extradition is not likely option116 when there is treaty extradition is only an option if the treaty permits extradition common impediments include citizenship dual criminality statutes of limitation and capital punishment issues many treaties permit country to refuse to extradite its citizens even in the case of dual citizenship 117 as for dual criminality whether the crime of conviction or the crime charged is an extraditable offense will depend upon the nature of the crime and where it was committed if the applicable treaty lists extraditable offenses the crime must be on the list118 if the applicable treaty insists only upon dual criminality the underlying misconduct must be crime under the laws of both the united states and the country of refuge119 where the crime was committed matters some treaties will only permit extradition if the offense was committed within the geographical confines of the united states120 timing also matters the speedy trial features of us law require good faith effort to bring to trial fugitive who is within the governments reach121 furthermore the lapse of time or speedy trial component of the applicable extradition treaty may preclude extradition if prosecution would be barred by statute continued before transmission to the department of state if the stat department is satisfied that the conditions for extradition under the applicable treaty have been met it will request extradition in the name of the united states and where appropriate will arrange for representa tion of the united states at the proceedings in the requested state when extradition proceedings in the foreign state have been completed and the person sought has been certified to be extraditable the secretary or her authorized deputy may issue warrant to federal or state officials to act as agents of the united states for the purpose of taking custody of the person in the requested state for return to the united states 113 the office of international affairs oia provides information and advice to federal and state

prohibit extradition for capital offenses more often they permit it but only with the assurance that sentence of death will not be executed123 prosecutors may request provisional arrest of fugitive without waiting for the final preparation of the documentation required for formal extradition request if there is risk of flight and if the treaty permits it the justice department encourages judicious use of provisional arrest because of the pressures that may attend it 124 the criminal resource manual contains the form for collection of the information that must accompany either federal or state prosecutors application for justice department request for provisional arrest125 although treaty requirements vary the justice department suggests that prosecutors supply formal documentation in the form of an original and four copies of prosecutors affidavit describing the facts of the case including dates names docket numbers and citations and preferably executed before judge or magistrate particularly if extradition is sought from civil law country 126 copies of the statutes the fugitive is said to have violated the statutes governing the penalties that may be imposed upon

success encouraging other countries to surrender fugitives other than their own nationals without requiring recourse to extradition142 ordinarily american immigration procedures on the other hand have

fugitive is an alien moreover they frequently require the united states to deposit the alien in country other than one that seeks his or her extradition 144 yet in few instances where an alien has been naturalized by deception or where the procedures available against alien terrorists come into play denaturalization or deportation may be considered an attractive alternative or supplement to

kidnaping defendant overseas and returning him to the united states for trial does not deprive american courts of jurisdiction unless an applicable extradition treaty explicitly calls for that result148 nor does it ordinarily expose the united states to liability under the federal tort claims act nor individuals involved in the abduction to liability under the alien tort statute149 the individuals involved in the abduction however may face foreign prosecution or at least be the subject of foreign extradition request 150 moreover the effort may strain diplomatic relations with the country from which the fugitive is lured or abducted151 g8g152g155g142g146g144g151g561g18g155g152g156g142g140g158g157g146g152g151g561 final alternative when extradition for trial in the united states is not available is trial within the country of refuge the alternative exists primarily when extradition has been refused in because of the fugitives nationality andor where the crime occurred under circumstances that permit prosecution by either country for the same misconduct 152 the alternative can be cumbersome and expensive and may be contrary to us policy objectives153 147 united states v

not permit extradition if the defendant has been lured into their territory such ruses may also cause foreign relations problems with both the countries form which and to which the lure takes place

country for subsequent extradition expulsion or deportation to the united states as noted above some countries will not extradite person to the united stats if the persons presence in that country was obtained through the use of lure or other ruse in addition some countries may view lure of person form its territory as an infringement on its sovereignty 152 see eg hungarian extradition treaty art 3
