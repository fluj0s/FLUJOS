uncertain months after powersharing agreement was signed in an effort to resolve the standoff resu lting from the countrys flawed 2008 elections for the first time since independence the ruling party has lost its majority in the national assembly the results of the presidential race belatedly announced in may amid rising tensions indicated that opposition leader morgan tsvangirai had received more votes than the incumbent president robert mugabe but had failed to garner the 50 percent needed to avoid runoff days before that runoff was scheduled to take place in late june 2008 tsvangirai pulled out of the race citing widespread political violence and the absence of conditions for free and fair election mugabe was declared the winner in the runoff but many observer missions suggest the poll did not reflect the will of the people on september 15 2008 after weeks of negotiations tsvangirai and president mugabe reached an agreement to form unity government as part of the deal president mugabe would remain head of state tsvangirai would become prime minist er and cabinet positions would be divided among the parties disputes over the allocation of key ministries have delayed implementation of the agreement although mediation efforts continue the united states the european union and several african leaders have called for mugabes resignation reports of violence and political repression increased significantly in the wake of the march elections which were held amidst deepening economic crisis zimbabwes gross domestic product gdp has decreased over 50 percent in the last decade the inflation rate is estimated at over 200 million percent and unemployment is higher than 80 percent the adult hiv infection rate of 18 percent has contributed to sharp drop in life expectancy and more than third of the population required food aid in 2008 over 1500 died between august and december 2008 from widespread cholera outbreak that some estimate could infect as many as 60000 in the coming months deteriorating conditions in the country have led many zimbabweans to emigrate to neighboring countries creating substantial burden on the region in south africa immigrants

robert mugabe 84 and his party the zimbabwe african national union patriotic front zanupf have ruled zimbabwe since it s independence in 1980 rising inflation and unemployment rates contributed in the late 1990s to the creation of the opposition movement for democratic change mdc the mdc enjoyed initial success campaigning against referendum in 2000 that would have expanded the presidents powers made government officials immune from prosecution and allowed the uncompensated seizure of whiteowned land for redistribution to black farmers the referendum failed and the mdc won nearly half the parliamentary seats in that years election zanupf has since taken numerous often undemocratic actions to maintain power september 2008 powersharing agreement negotiated between zanupf and the opposition has yet to be implemented and recent nationwide cholera outbreak has drawn international attention to the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation

had planned to run ag ainst mugabe and tsvangirai withdrew as presidential candidate and expressed his support fo r makoni it is unclear how many supporters of his faction voted for makoni instead of tsvangirai the main mdc faction claimed victory for tsvangir ai days after the election with over 50 percent of the votes cast basing its claim on tallies of poll results posted outside the polling stations and constituency centers immediately following the ections some have differed with the mdc count suggesting that while tsvangirai almost certainly received more votes than mugabe he may not have achieved the necessary 50 percent to avoid runoff24 zesn noted that results were not posted in three constituency tabulation centers despite legal requirement to do so the results of the presidential race were not officially announced until five weeks after the elections the opposition called for nationwide strike on april 14 to protest the delayed release of results asking supporters

facing crisis that the delayed release of the presidential results was natural process and that zimbabweans must patiently await their release tsvangirai criticized mbeki for his quiet support for the dictatorship and called for him to step down as mediator in early 2008 62 according to reports mbeki wrote president bush letter warning the united states not to interfere in the zimbabwe situation after the march elections63 in the months following zimbabwes general elections domestic public pressure may ultimately have forced mbeki to take stronger position on the violence there mbeki visited the country several times and in may dispatched six retired generals to investigate reports of attacks on the opposition the generals reportedly expressed shock at the level of violence 64 on the day of the runoff the anc issued public statement noting the effect zimbabwes instability has had on the sadc region accused the zimbabwe government of riding roughshod over the hardwon democratic rights

mauritania from all organizational activities after the countrys military led ccessful coup against the president in office for 21 years reports suggest that most mauritanians supported the militarys actions nevertheless the au upheld the suspension because it opposed the unconstitutional overthrow of civilia n regime following an investigation the au decided against sanctions but held the suspension until elections were held in 2007 mauritania was suspended from the au again in august 2008 following another coup and the west african country of guinea has received similar treatment

distanced himself from mbekis quiet diplomacy approach in late april he told reporters definitely there is something wrong with those elections i think the manner in which the electoral commission has

africa and sadc have already deployed inquiry teams the presence of monitors could be influential particularly if the zimbabwe government takes initiative to investigate or prosecute abuses the mugabe

inputs to production are in short supply thousands of experienced farm workers were reportedly forced to flee seized commercial farms and many of those who now hold farmland have agricultural expertise the displacement of farm workers and vandalism that has followed the march elections also contributes to food insecurity the 2008 maize harvest was severely affected by combination of flooding followed by extreme dry weather the crop production deficit in much of the country is estimated at 75 to 100 percent global food needs have increased dramatically since the beginning of 2008

activities are primarily responsible for the surge in the countrys money supply in recent years losses from such activities were estimated to be 75 percent of gdp in 2006 these activities include monetary operations to absorb excess liquidity subsidiz ed credit sustained foreign exchange losses through subsidized exchange rates for selected government purchases and multiple currency practices and financial sector restructuring after the government implemented its price control policy in june 2007 cutting prices of basic commodities by 50 percent in an effort to stem inflation manufacturing output fell more than 50 percent within six months and many firms were forced to close the price controls also resulted in shortage of basic goods and have contributed to worsening social indicators

foreign exchange98 and bring in the imf to assist in reforming the governments fiscal policies tsvangirai has also floated the idea of replacing the zimbabwe dollar with new currency99 some analysts have suggested that the existing dollar could be temporarily linked to either the south african rand or the us dollar to stabilize its value the partys economic policy stresses free market approach and promises to privatize most stateowned companies dismantl patronage networks and simplify the tax code in recognition that the governments bloated budget has contributed significantly to current economic woes tsvangirai initially promised significantly smaller cabinet if he were to become president as part of deficitreduction strategy in addition the mdc has proposed land audit and program to harmonize landtenure so that those on communal lands can hold an individual title the party would consider comp ensation for those who lost land illegally it remains unclear how much influence the mdc would have in pressing its economic policies under the unity government proposed in the september agreement the need for land audit for example was acknowledged in the deal but the large power sharing cabinet may challenge tsvangirais goal of reducing the size of government the state departments fy2009 budget request states that if political change ensues and legislative restrictions are lifted zimbabwe will need significant support from the united states in coordination with other donors to reform rebuild and recover western donors including the united states met twice in europe in 2007 to

that of south africa striking healthy balance between reconciliation and accountability 103 prior to the september 2008 agreement he offered mugabe an honorable exit as father of the nation but it is unlikely that the mdc would consider extending such an offer to all senior security officials implicated in acts of violence 104 under the terms of the power sharing agreement new constitution is
