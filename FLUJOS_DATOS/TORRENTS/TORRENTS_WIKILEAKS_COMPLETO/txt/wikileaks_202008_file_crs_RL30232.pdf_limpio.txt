legislation affecting hedge funds may be considered by the 106 congressth in april 1999 the presidents working group on financial markets n interagency group of financial regulators issued report on the implications of the ltcm case the report focused on the systemic risk posed by highlyleverage d financial institutions which include not only hedge funds but many large banks and securities firms the failure of one of these instituti ons could be contagious to others because they trade heavily with one another the challenge to policy is to constrain excessive leverage the working group report concludes that the best defense against excessive risk taking is marke t discipline but notes that history shows that from time to time market participant s become complacent and f ail to monitor the risks posed by their creditors and trading partners firms themselves may often underestimate the risks of their own financial positions and trading activities measurement of risks involved in complex globa l investment strategies is difficult what was thought to be safe position may b revealed as highly risky in market crisis the working group puts forward number of specific recommendations some requiring legislative action including more disclosure by hedge funds and the firms that trade with them improve ment in risk measurement techniques by regulators and private firms enhanced authority to monitor affiliates of re gulated institutions and the imposition of international standards on offshore financial centers this report will be updated as needed to reflect legislative regulatory an

management ltcm hedge fund1 nearly failed when its investment strategy devised by nobel prizewinnin g economists and legen dary wall street traders fell apart in the market turmoil that followed the asian financial crisis and russias default on its government bonds rather than allow the fund to collapse the fede ral reserve bank of new york called in officials of 13 large investment and commercial banks all of which had money in ltcm either as investors or as creditors and had them contr ibute 36 billion in new capital to allow the fund to meet its shortterm obligations in return they becam 90 owners of ltcm even though government funds were used many were critical of the feds involvement in the ltcm rescue hedge funds are limited by law to wealthy sophisti cated investors and they are known to pursue risky investment strategies why should the failure of such an entity warrant government response it i s commonly assumed that the federal reserve may take steps to prevent the collapse of large bank with billions in federallyinsured deposits s uch as continental illinois or that banks will be directed to extend credit to brokerage houses during marke t disruptio n such as that of october 1987 in this role the fed is the lender of t resort the final bulwark against financial chaos critics of the ltcm re scue view the feds intervention as dubious expansion of the lenderoflastresort function why should private partnership with only few dozen employees dedicated to highrisk speculation on behalf of small group of wealthy investors be saved from its own mistakes more generally if hedge fund can be considered too big to fail wont similar institutions be tempted to assume excessiv risks for capital to be allocated to the most productive sectors of th economy investors must bear the risk s not just reap the rewards of their investment choices those decisions will be distorted if market participants believe there is chance that the government will cushion their losses the savings and loan failures of the 1980s are recent example of this the fed ce rtainly anticipated that many would interpret its ltcm role as n unjustifiable expansion of the safety net under financial institutions and markets still it chose not to let ltcm go into default in public explanations the fed s stated that in the unsettled market conditions of the fall of 1998 ltcm was indeed too big to fail it was not just matter of losses to the funds partners lenders and trading partnershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30232crs2 statement of alan greenspan in us congress house committee

an d recommendat ions of the working groups report just as the feds role the ltcm rescue broke new ground the working groups report offers new look at th problem of maintaining financial stability in

to buy stocks and bonds and businesses cannot raise money fall in business investment has shortr costs in lost jobs and longrun costs in terms of lower than optima l growth in the economy if these are the consequences clearly there is public interest in controllin g systemic risk one could argue that in the united states the central institutions f financia l regulation were set in place principally to reduce systemic risk moder n banking regulation with deposit insurance and the separation of commercial an d investment banking and federal securities regulation with restrictions on short selling and limits the use of debt to finance securities purchases both came into being in the 1930s aimed in great part at preventing recurrence of the bank failures and stock market crash that preceded the great depression on the other hand economists and policy makers agree that risktaking i s essential to economic growth financial resources must be placed in the hands f those who can produce innovations in technology or business organization that will create wealth and raise the standard of living this unavoidably creates risk for the intermediaries that oversee the allocation of capital and some of them will fail i f regulators are too fearful of the systemic consequences of such failure they ma curtail risktaking by for example requiring financial institutions to maintai n unnecessarily high capital reserves against possible losses if financial risk is overregulated the result will be less investment and slower growth underregulation on the other hand may lead to financial instability s regulators seek to strike the right balance the more information they have abou t systemic risk about the pathways and processes by which finan cial trouble becomes contagious the better their judgements will be however despite the existence of an enormous and rapidly growing literature on the subjects of financial crises and systemic risk there is consensus among economists and market participants about how financial crises start or spread h ow to prevent or contain them or even whether regulators should be concerned with systemic risk at all different views of systemic risk5 the asian financial crisis of 19971998 provides useful illustration of th different concepts of systemic risk number of countries most of which d experienced very impressive rates of economic growth over the preceding decade were struck by dramatic currency depreciations sudden drops in the price of stocks and other assets withdrawals of capital by domestic and foreign investors an d disruptions in banking and capital markets subsequent ly several suffered and some continue to suffer rise s in unemployment and either recession or sharp reductions

and anna schwartz monetar history of the united states 18671960 7 new york national bureau of economic research 1963the rate of growth in the real economy more remarkably the crisis did not strike the entire region at once but appeared to hopscotch from one country to the next 6 economi sts ways of looking at these events can be divided into three basi c groups one group tends to see financial crisis as byproduct of some underlyin g fundamental economic imbalance in thi s view government energy is better spent on macroeconomic policies if these are sound the financial markets will generally take care of themselves second view is that the crisis originates within the financia l system itself but probably is the result of some market imperfection or government policy that impedes the optimal functioning of the markets the third group would agree with the second that the crisis may be endogenous to the financial sector but it views instability as inhe rent the nature of financial markets makes them vulnerable to intermittent episodes of instability the first group sees the financial disturbances as nothing but symptom of some underlying fundamental problem the problem according to this analysis does not reside in the financial system but in the real economy for example the asia n currencies were pegged to the dollar while the dollar was gaining value against th yen making southeast asian goods more costly relative to japanese depressin g exports and so on or it may be that the problem was overinvestment i n manufacturing capacity triggering deflation in prices of commodities and goods whatever the assigned cause the financial shocks do not generate the crisis and are in themselves relatively unimportant the best known analysis of this kind i s friedman and schwartzs argument made in the early 1960s against the prevailin g opinion of the time that the depression of the 1930s was not caused by financia l shocks from the banking and stock markets but by the monetary policy response7 the policy prescript ions flowing from this analysis tend to be laissezfaire private markets are seen as better judges than government about how much risk to take on or the appropriate prices for f inancial assets volatile financial markets represent the process of adjusting to new information about firms and the economy markets will stabilize themselves when new equilibrium price is reached let governmen t maintain price stability and enforce private contracts and it will do more to foste r financial stability than by worrying about systemic risk the counter argument in the asian case and elsewhere is that financial crises often seem to be grossly out f proportion to the fundamental problem said to be the cause an exchange rate imbalance for example need not an d does not always cause widespread financial devastation the second and third types of analysis therefore focus on the financial system itself as the source of the crisis the second view is that markets can become unstable because of factors tha t cause bias in investment decisions after the crisis the asian markets were said to be in the grips of crony capitalism where loans were made on the basis of familyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30232crs5 miller merton merton miller on derivatives new york john wiley and sons 1997 8 continuedor political connections rather than where the return was likely to be highest i n addition both private and public accounting and disclosure systems were said to be inadequate so that investors were not aware of problems in institutions and markets until too late there were also accusations that hedge funds and other speculator s were engaged in market manipulation driving currency prices below thei r fundamental values solutions for problems of this type are well known and are among the basi c features of us market regulation keep investment decisions in the hands of those who stand to lose if the investment goes bad require institutions and marke t participants to disclose certain financial data to regulators or the publi c transparency and maintain system of trading rules and market surveillance to deter manipulation these steps certainly contribute to market trans parency and efficiency but in the third view they do not guarantee stability that is markets even in the state f perfect compe tition experience occasional bouts of instability these occur because investors are not always rational but sometimes subject to what is variously described as animal spirits the herd ins tinct irrational exuberance or lemminglike behavior this irrationality may manifest itself in asset price bubbles where fundamental values and history are disregarded and investors act as though p rices will rise forever which eventually end in panic which takes the form of rush for the exits in this view financial crisis is driven by internal market dy namics and there is little point in seeking an exogenous cause an random event may trigger the crisis when the panic is on the fundamentals do not matter in the asian context this view suggests why the crisis appeared in virtuall identical form in countries with quite different economic conditions and regulator structures it supports the idea of financial contagion as source of systemic risk trouble here may undermine confidence over there and so on this view of markets which sees instability as result of human nature lend s support to regulatory focus on crisis management and containment such as th function of lender of last resort most regulators subscribe to this view in practice if not in theory however it is offensive to many economists of the first group who believe that explanations based on economic fundamentals can account for even the most extreme instances of financial volatility it also challenges fundamental axiom of market economics that individuals can be counted upon to act rationally in their own selfinterest the concept of contagion for instance suggests that investors are unable to distinguish between sound and failing institutions or firms two statements made in different places may be combi ned to form an exchange illustrating

of the presidents working group on financial markets the ltc m incident has not changed their minds how ltcm created systemic risk the working groups report ltcms strategy and market positions details on ltcms investment strategy and the contents of its portfolio have not been made public nevertheless the broad outlines of its market positions an d problems have appeared in the press and are included in the working groups report ltcms core strategy was convergence trading this means it analyzed price relationships between different types of securities and took positions when thos relationships diverged from their historical patterns expecting to profit when prices returned to normal after the asian turmoil in 1997 the price of us government bonds was high relative to other bonds ltcm bet in effect that the price spreads between treasuries and other bonds would narro w as markets settled down instead with the russian default demand for treasuries grew the spread widened

designed to be marketneutral to show profit whether the overall marke t went up or down as long as the price relationships converged on their historica l norms however market conditions following the russian default in the summer of 1998 overwhelmed its hedging strategies risks that it thought were hedged r mutually offsettin g turned out to be correlated ltcm lost money on both sides of its trades and the firms capital was reduced to few hundred million dollars by the time of the rescue the systemic risk scenario why was an ltcm default viewed by the f ed as threat to the financial system at large rather than just to the institutions and investors directly involved with th hedge fund the report discusses the ri sks that accompany the failure of any highly leveraged ins titution such institutions in accumulating leverage in effect assume14 risk from ot her market participants when they fail those risks are discharged back into the market therefore highlyleveraged institutions have the potential t exacerbate instability in the market as whole there are direct and indirect effects of such an institutions failure the direct effects are losses to lenders trading partners and derivatives counterparties more serious are the indirect effects losses to other market participants through pric changes caused by the disappearance of invest ors willing to assume higher risk how do these indirect effects occurhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30232crs8 working group report section i c15the failure of highlyleveraged institution will often be followed by disorderly liquidation of assets to sat isfy the claims of creditors markets may already be under stress as they were in the ltcm case so this liquidation will very likely be fir sale at depressed prices if volatility and price declines are exacerbated the ability of market participants to judge credit risk will be impaired uncertainty about credit standing will begin with those f irms believed to have links to the failed institution but may not stop there there may follow general disruption of the intermediation of credit the market will not be able bring borrowers and lenders together the final result will be to heighten the risk of contraction in economic activity excessive leverage policy implications in the working groups analysis ltcm posed systemic threat not because of any feature unique to hedge funds but because it was highly leveraged other highly leveraged institutions include some commercial banks and securi ties firms the failure of one of these could likewise pose syst emic risk particularly since they trade heavily with each other the key question ad dressed by the report is how excessive leverage can be constrained in the answer lie the major policy prescriptions of the report the principal constraint on excessive leverage must be market discipline i n normal times market discipline is an effective check on excessive risktaking first banks and securities firms have the incentive and the capability to use variety of risk management tools to protect th emselves they should be able to measure the risk of their own trading activities and that of firms to whom they supply credit so that they can survive market reverse second shareholders of these institutions an d hedge fund customers can exert pressure if they believe firm has taken on too much risk third hedge funds and other risktakers cannot get leverage without using the credit and clearing services of the banks and brokerages that are at the center f derivatives and securities markets why did market discipline fail to operate in the ltcm case the report notes several reasons ltcm as noted above had stellar cast of managers and wa s highly profitable during its first years of operation banks and securities firms judged it highly advantageous to do business with it and similar hedge funds the funds were active traders yielding significant brokerage revenues they were willing to assume risks that banks and brokerages wished to lay off and bank s and brokerages may have sought to fol low the hedge funds trading strategies as result ltcms creditors and counterparties were willing to lend more with l ess disclosure from the hedge fund than was customary an d the collateral and margin arrangements that protect lenders and counterparties were relaxed in effect the report notes the main limitation of ltcms scale and leverage was that p rovided by its own managers and principals15 according to the report similar relaxat ions of market discipline can be expected to recur history tells us that creditors counterparties and investors from time tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30232crs9 ibid section iii16 see general accounting office riskbased capital regulatory and industr y17 approaches to capital and risk gaoggd98153 july 1998 186 p working group report appendix section 318 ibid section iii19time misjudge their risks and that sometimes they become complacent in their ris k assessments in an attempt to achieve higher returns16 another major problem is the measurement of risk highlyle veraged institutions that trade actively depend on complex computer models to gauge the overall risks of their positions these models generally base the probability of large loss n historical market behavior but in the wake of ltcm it is not clear that firms ca n anticipate how all the components of their portfol ios will behave in turbulent markets ltcm as noted had 60000 trades on its books it expected that the ris k correlation of these many positions was relatively low that when some lost value others would gain the funds actual experience suggests that many global portfolios of large i nstitutions may in certain conditions be less diversified than the model s predict banking regulators in recent years have placed growing reliance on banks internal risk models to calculate the amount of capital reserves an institution should hold against the poss ibility of loan or trading losses if these models are less robust17 than assumed it means that institutions may be more risky than regulators believe however the breakdown in market discipline in the ltcm case does not lead the regulat ors in the working group to set aside their conclusion that marke t discipline rather than government policy is the main defense against excessiv leverage and systemic risk if financial institutions are required by regulation to set aside enough capital to ensure their surviv even in rare periods of extremely volatile market the result would be to disrupt trading and financial intermediation tha t support the financing of the economy the report also notes that the innovations in risk management techniques such as derivative instruments that allow risks t be unbundled and transferred to willing counterparties have most likely lowered t he financing costs borne by the real sectors of the economy the tradeoff of course is that the risk shed by nonfinancia l18 business and others must be assumed by someone very likely highlyleverage d hedge fund bank or brokerage whose fi nancial condition may thereby become more fragile finally the working group does not discuss directly the circumstances unde r which the government ought to intervene in the markets as lender of last resort but the general tenor of the report is that the ltcm rescue was fully justified as theoretical basis for such intervention the report offers this observation firm has an incentive to limit its risk taking to reduce the dange r of contagion to other firms19 in other words there is social cost to private risk taking that only government can meethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30232crs10 specific recommendations the specif ic recommendations put forward by the working groups report are the following improved disclosure by hedge funds hedge funds that now report to the cftc as commodity pool operators should report quarterly rather tha n annually the reports should include estimates of the total value at risk in the funds positions including stress testing for worstcase scenarios th reports should be available to the public an alternative means for disclosure should be developed for hedge fun ds not reporting to the cftc this would require legislative action disclosure of exposure to hedge fu nds publiclytraded firms that report to the sec should include with their quarterly and annual reports statement of their credit exposure to hedge funds and other highlyleveraged institutions risk measurement international financial supervisors should develop meaningful measure of the future credit exposure implicit in presen t leveraged position regulators should also encourage improvement in th internal risk measurement systems of private institutions risk assessment authority the congress should enact greater authority for the cftc and the sec to overs ee risk in affiliates of regulated brokerdealers and futures commission merchant s specifically the regulators would like the authority to require more detailed reporting from affiliates and to review risk management controls at the holding company level offsho re financial centers regulators should consider creating stronge r incentives for offshore financial centers to comply with international capital accounting and other financial standards conclusion the working groups report began as an investigation into the risks posed by hedge funds but took an unexpected turn it concludes that ltcm posed threat to financial stability not because it was hedge fund unregulated secretive and prone to highrisk speculation but because it was highlyleveraged institution classificatio n that includes many large banks and securities firms this is new way of looking at financial markets classic financial panics often had their origins in the structure of banking balance sheets liquid liabilities versus illiquid assets banks assets are longterm loans while their liabiliti are shortterm deposits if enough depositors demand their money at any one time the bank is in trouble and depositors know this historically if on bank failed others were liable to runs even though their financial condition wa s fundamenta lly sound deposit insurance has made bank runs rare in the unite d stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30232crs11 schwartz anna systemic risk and the macroeconomy presented at conferenc e20 sponsored by the office of the comptroller of the currency washington dc december 2 1994 p 2securities firms on the other hand have not tradition ally been viewed as sources of financial contagion their assets are primarily marketable securities which can be sold as needed to meet liabilities thus even very large securities firms such as drexel burnham lambert in the late 1980s have been allowed to fail withou t systemic repercussions why does the workin g group now lump banks and securities firms together as potential sources of systemic risk as markets have evolved both types f institutions now rely more on propr ietary trading as source of profits they act as principals rather than as intermediaries greater change is that both are represented among the major dealers in the overthecounter derivatives market derivative s allow users financial institutions corporations and governments to limi t financial risk but that risk may th be concentrated among two dozen or so dealers the commer cial and investment banks that account for over 90 of global 7 0 trillion market since there is ready market for many derivat ives contracts dealers assets have be come less liquid like bank loans in the old days dealers seek to limit their risk exposure by assuming offsetting risks but in extreme market conditions the correlation of those risks may not act as expected what is the systemic risk scenario implied here number of factors coul d combine to set off widespread financial panic that could threaten the real economy these include the possibility of major bank or securities firm taking on excessive leverage in support of its derivatives and proprietary trading positions the interdependence of large financial institutions the historical tendency of market participants to become complacent abou t risk and the globalization of financial markets and the mobility of capital which mean that disturbance in one national market is more likely than in the past to be transmitted to others is this an alarmist vision fabricati on of overheated imaginations of academics and regulators to regulators the probability may be small but the economi c20 damage that might result is potentially severe enough to justify attention to systemic risk concerns however given the lack of consensus about th nature and seriousness of systemic risks and the acknowledged costs of overregulation elegant solution is likely to be found instead regulators will press for the kind of incrementa l improvements in government oversight and private market practices that ar recommended by the working groups report
