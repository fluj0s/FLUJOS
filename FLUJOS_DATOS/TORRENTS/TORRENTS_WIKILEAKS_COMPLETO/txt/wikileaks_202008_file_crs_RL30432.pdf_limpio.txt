3 1999 the justice department filed seven lawsuits against electric utilities in the midwest and south charging them with violations of the new source review nsr requirements of the clean air act caa in addition the environmental protection agency epa issued an administrative order against the tennessee valley authority tva alleging similar violations through preconstruction permitting process nsr is designed to ensure that newly constructed facilities or substantially modified existing facilities do not result in violation of applicable air quality standards the suits represent continuing effort by epa to reduce pollution from existing sources particularly coalfired electric generating facilities the primary pollutants of concern have been nitrogen oxides nox and sulfur dioxide so2 the question the epa lawsuits raise is whether the specified facilities have engaged in rehabilitation actions that represent major modifications of the plants in which case the caa would require the installation of best available pollution control equipment the crucial definition of major modification derives from an epa ruling that life extension project by wisconsin electric power company wepco triggered nsr requirements since 1992 after considerable litigation and congressional debate the test to determine the applicability of nsr compares whether facilitys projected actual emissions after the modification are more than its actual emissions before the modification utilities argue that the modifications that epa cites in the suits were just routine maintenance which do not trigger nsr nsr is an attractive enforcement tool because epa can ask the court to impose substantial monetary penalties and to require violating source to install best available control technology thus epa states that these facilities could be required to reduce their emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides by 85 to 95 because the caa is complex piece of legislation built up over time however the reductions that might result from successful prosecution of the nsr suits may not be completely realized in the case of so 2 any reduction achieved under nsr would interact with cap on emissions set under title iv of the caa because of the system of tradable allowances established under title iv reductions from nsr compliance might be shifted to unaffected facilities the situation with respect to nox is also confused largely because of inconsistencies in epas new and existing source nox regulations as result of partial remand of regulations by court by seeking to enforce nsr requirements epa exploits an existing authority that holds the potential for reducing emissions epa clearly believes that some sources have been evading nsr requirements however the action appears to raise the classic enforcement issue will the outcome be reduced emissions or just costly litigation the suits expose the complex interactions of nsr with other provisions of the caa complexities that might compromise air pollution reductions sought through the nsr suits knowledge gained through 30 years of caa implementation suggests options for updating the acts approach to regulating the utility

enacted as part of the 1977 caa amendments and modestly modified in the 1990 caa amendments nsr is designed to ensure that newly constructed facilities or substantially modified existing facilities do not result in violation of applicable air quality standards the nsr provisions establish permit requirements for constructing new major pollution sources as well as for making major modifications to existing major pollution sources the specific requirements dictated by nsr depend on where the facility is sited in attainment areas those meeting the national ambient air quality standard naaqs for pollutant the governing requirements are the prevention of significant deterioration psd provisions of the caa in non attainment areas those not in compliance with naaqs for one or more pollutant the governing requirements are covered by nonattainment provisions some facilities can be subject to combination of both if the area is in attainment for somehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30432crs2 5

the specific project the pollutants involved and the specific state and federal regulatory authorities involved6 in 1996 epa proposed changes to nsr to streamline it however the proposals have been subject to considerable controversy and final rule has not yet been issued7 these complexities and controversies particula rly with respect to major modifications of existing sources become manifest in the enforcement suits filed by the justice department for epa and in the responses to them the suits represent continuing effort by epa to reduce pollution from existing sources particularly coalfired electric generating facilities the primary pollutant of concern has been nitrogen oxides nox criteria air pollutant that is also precursor to ozone itself criteria pollutant acid rain fine particulates and regional haze other pollutants of concern include sulfur dioxide so2 criteria air pollutant and precursor to acid rain fine particulates and regional haze and particulate matter also criteria air pollutant efforts by epa and other groups to reduce these emissions have intensified recently both as result of new regulatory proposals to increase the stringency of the ozone and particulate naaqs8 and to reduce haze9 and as result of the restructuring of the utility industry which some fear may result in increased emissions from existing plants10 epas recent enforcement action raise several questions with respect to the nsr and efforts to further control emissions from existing sources three of them are discussed in this report why is epa taking this action why use the nsr provisions how does the nsr interact with other epa actions currently underwayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30432crs3 11 steven herman assistant administrator for enforcement and compliance assurance epa letter to chairman inhofe march 26 1999 p 2 12 some restrict the term nsr to the review process in nonattainment area only the review process in an attainment area being called psd preconstruction review this paper will use the term to indicate both in addition new and modified sources must meet new source performance standards nsps 13 title i of the 1990 caa amendments reduced the threshold definition of major source for areas of the country substantially out of compliance with ambient air quality standards for ozone carbon monoxide and particulate matter 14 40 cfr 5224 15 it should be noted that source can be affected by the psd requirements for one pollutant and by the nonattainment requirements for another pollutant 16 for details on these provisions and their requirements see clean air act part c prevention of significant deterioration of air quality sections 160169 and part d plan requirements for nonattainment areas sections 171178 why epas enforcement action the epa believes that there should be significantly higher rate of nsr permits authorizing the construction of new or expanded facilities than is currently taking place11 the caa requires preconstruction review of and permit for almost any major modification of an air polluting source or any major new source assuming that state has an epaapproved state implementation plan sip which spells out the states strategy for complying with naaqs regulatory approval to construct the new source or modify the existing source must come from the appropriate state agency to receive this permit to constru ct the applicant must show that the proposed source or modification will not result in or exacerbate violation of naaqs either locally or downwind in addition applicants must show that their proposal will not result in local or downwind exceedences of increments of increased air pollution allowed under prevention of significant deterioration psd regulations in areas complying with naaqs it is this preconstruction review process that is called new source review nsr12 the nsr process is triggered for any new source that potentially could emit 100 tons annually or less in some areas13 of any criteria air pollutant and by any modification that will cause significant increase in annual emissions regulatorily defined as 40 tons for so2 and nox14 the specific nsr requirements for affected sources depend on whether the sources involved are subject to the psd or the non attainment provisions15 if covered by psd the source is required to install best available control technology bact which is determined on casebycase basis and which cannot be less stringent than the federally determine d new source performance standard nsps for that pollutant if covered by nonattainment provisions the source is required to install lowest achievable emission rate laer and obtain applicable offsets for that particular area16 like bact laer must not be less stringent than the federal nspshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30432crs4 17 letter to chairman inhofe p 2 18 data represent net summer capacity energy information administration annual energy review 1998 doeeia038498 july 1999 p 219despite the breadth of coverage suggested by nsr few preconstruction permits have been issued to coalfired power plants over the programs history17 if this situation is examined from the perspective of new construction the lack of permits is not too surprising current us coalfired electric generating capacity is about 300000 megawatts mw and has remained steady at that level for the last ten years18 as indicated in table 1 additions to coalfired capacity while greater than retirements have not been significant capacity that began operation between 1989 1998 constitutes about 3 of

first glance emissions trends for electric utilities appear to confirm the generally static situation with respect to coalfired capacity as shown in figure 1 emissions of nox from coalfired electric generating facilities have remained constant over the last ten years in contrast so 2 emission trends indicate significant drop in emissions in 1995 the first year of the acid rain control program under title iv of the 1990 caa amendments under title iv 111 powerplants were required to reduce their emissions by about 30 from baseline levels specified in the title in additionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30432crs5 19 because of regulatory delays the nox requirement was not implemented until 1996 20 us epa acid rain program technology and innovation may 1996 epa 1996

1993 1994 1995 1996 19970246810121416 noxso2many units were required to install lownox burners to reduce nox emissions19 according to epa the affected phase 1 units emitted about 10 million tons of so 2 in 1990 number reduced to 53 million tons in 1995 likewise the nox provisions reduced emissions from these plants in 1996 by about 04 million tons from their 1990 levels20 however comparing the reductions achieved under title iv with the trends indicated in figure 1 shows that some of the title iv reductions have been offset by increases in emissions from other plants specifically while title iv caused 47 million ton so2 reduction by 1995 emissions data indicates that overall emissions only went down about 36 million tons as shown by figure 1 likewise while title iv led to 04 million ton reduction in nox by 1996 figure 1 reveals an overall reduction of only about 01 million tons this slippage is not surprising as phase 1 does not cover all coalfired facilities but it does imply that within the relatively flat trends for coalfired capacity and for air emissions there are some sources of increasing emissionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30432crs6 the dynamism in coalfired generation is the continuing operation of existing coalfired facilities as indicated by figure 2 despite the general lack of new plant construction coalfired electricity generation and related coal consumption has continued to climb over the past decade this increase results from utility efforts to optimize performance of existing coalfired facilities despite their increasing age historically as plants age they become less reliable and less efficient leading utilities to derate them and move them from baseload to cycling duties however as indicated in table 2 contrary to historical expectations utilization of coalfired capacity has increased over the past decade and the efficiency of units has not decreased this suggests that the economics of plant maintenance has changed fundamentally over the past decade or so making it economic for utilities to spend more to maintain their coalfired capacity than was the case previously the question the epa lawsuits raise is whether these efforts to maintain or even to expand generation from existing coalfired facilities compared to the degradation of capacity that would be expected represent routine maintenance or major modification of those facilities under the caa if such maintenance does represent major modification then the caa would require the installation of pollution control equipment routine maintenance on the other hand would not trigger the requirement for new controls with the restructuring of the electric utility industryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30432crs7 21 see larry parker and john blodgett

summer capacity net generation coal consumption data from energy information administration annual energy review 1998 july 1999 why nsr there are signs that many utilities will not use the term life extension to describe their spending on old power plants even though extended life is one of the major goals of the spending program the reason for the aversion to the term lies in the 1970 clean air act that federal law requires all power plants constructed after august 1971 to restrict emissions of air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide plants built prior to 1971 are exempt which includes most of the early candidates for life extensions the problem is that the law also says that grandfathered plants can lose their exemption if they are modified or reconstructed in major way and emission of proscribed pollutants are increased22httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30432crs8 23 steven merman letter to chairman inhofe march 26 1999 p 3 24 steven merman letter to chairman inhofe answer to questions 5 and 6 march 26 1999 p 14 25 carol m browner administrator epa remarks prepared for delivery clean air enforcement press conference washington dc november 3 1999 p 2currently there is considerable regulatory activity and judicial response with respect to electricity generation and air quality regulatory activities include the ozone transport rule also called the nox sip call several section 126 petitions regional haze rule new naaqs for fine particulates and revised ozone naaqs new nsps for nox for electric utilities initiatives by the ozone transport commission and several legislative initiatives why add nsr enforcement to the list as the primary permitting vehicle for stationary sources nsr is also primary enforcement tool thus the department of justiceepa lawsuits under nsr represent an attempt to enforce existing laws and regulations not add new ones in this sense the nsr actions are fundamentally different from the activities listed above indeed different office within epa handles enforcement as opposed to regulatory development epa has explicitly stated that the enforcement action under nsr is not linked or tied with the regulatory activities listed above23 according to epa the action results from an examination of coalfired utilities that commenced in late 199624 as an enforcement tool nsr is attractive because of the remedial actions epa can seek the court to impose on affected utilities besides substantial monetary penalties epa can ask the court to require an affected source that violates nsr to install the most recent bact at its facilities for so 2 this would involve meeting the percentage reduction requirement promulgated by epa in 1978 this requirement generally involves installing fluegas desulfurization fgd units commonly called scrubbers on coalfired utility boilers likewise epa recently promulgated new nox nsps for new utility boilers if this were imposed on existing boilers that epa alleges have been modified it could require them to install selective catalytic reduction scr units in order to comply these control devices would reduce emissions by about 7090 depending on the specific case for epa these controls could lead to substantial reductions in so2 and nox emissions noting that the powerplants named in the lawsuits would emit 22 million tons of so 2 and 066 million tons of nox in 2000 administrator browner stated controlling the sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from these plants could lead to an 85 to 95 percent reduction respectively in these pollutants taken together these reductions would be the equivalent of taking 26 million cars off the road and reduce acid rain by an estimated 15 percent25 besides the potential payoff in terms of emissions reductions the focus on nsr reflects belief that continuing operation of aging coalfired plants is not shortterm event but wave of the future under electric utility restructuring as indicated in previous crs analysis extending the life of existing coalfired capacity is very costhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30432crs9 26 larry parker and john blodgett electricity restructuring the implications for air quality crs report 98615 enr july 16 1999 27 edison electric institute straight talk about electric utilities and new source review january 2000 p 11 28 as crs noted in 1985 however over the last five years it has become apparent that the actual lifespan of powerplants is not set but relatively elastic with new powerplants costing over 1000 kilowatt to construct utilities have powerful incentives to avoid construction and to rehabilitate older facilities instead this incentive is partially reinforced by environmental regulations which permit facilities to be rehabilitated up to 50 percent of their assessed value without being required to install nsps ie scrubbers with such rehabilitation estimated at about 500 kilowatt although that number can vary substantially operating existing facilities for upwards of 60 years

restructur ed industry could further encourage the existing trend to renovate existing coalfired capacity one means of mitigating the environmental effects of such trend would be to require bact on such facilities through nsr why not earlier the agency epa is bringing legal actions against the utilities for the very maintenance activities it has approved implicitly for nearly three decades27 the trend toward renovatin g existing coalfired capacity is not new but an increasing trend in the industry for almost two decades28 likewise the potential emissions impact of such life extension efforts were also recognized early in this time period29 however it wasnt until october 1988 that epa made serious attempt to enforce nsr on existing coalfired electric generating facilities this apparent difficulty in enforcing nsr for existing coalfired facilities could be ascribed to several causes including epa budget constraints and priorities however the primary substantive difficulty with nsr has been the definition of major modification the caa first used the term modification in the 1970 caa amendments with respect to the nsps program the act defined modification as any physical change in or change in the method of operation of stationary source which increases the amount of any air pollutant emitted by such source or whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30432crs10 30 caa section 111a4 42 usc 7411a4 31 40 cfr 6014a 1975 32 40 cfr 6015 1975 33 for psd see 40 cfr 5221b23i for nonattainment see 40 cfr 5224f10 34 defining the baseline has been key issue every powerplant has what is called nameplate capacity which indicates its theoretical size but the actual output is defined by its operating capacity which is determined by the engineering and operational details of the individual plant moreover from an engineering perspective the operating capacity declines over time as result of boiler deterioration pipe clogging and other predictable changes due to use the issue is then what level of capacity restored by renovations trigger nsr only renovations that increase capacity beyond the facilitys nameplate capacity those that increase capacity beyond the original operating capacity those that increase capacity above an engineeringdefined capacity that projects declines over time or those that increase potential emissions above the actual emissions before the modificationresults in the emission of any air pollutant not previously emitted30 in subsequent regulations epa defined modification as any physical or operational change that resulted in any increase in the maximum hourly emission rate kilograms per hour of any controlled air pollutant31 in addition epa regulations stated that any replacement of existing components that exceeded 50 of the fixed capital costs of building new facility placed the plant under nsps regardless of any change in emissions32 with the advent of nsr in 1977 different approach to defining modification was appropriate as the focus was shifted from enforcing nsps emission rates to compliance with naaqs and psd in promulgating regulations for the psd and nonattainment programs epa defined significant increase in emissions in terms of tons per year emitted by major source for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides the threshold is 40 tons33 facilities that exceed that threshold are subject to nsr enforcing these thresholds has been more difficult than their apparent clarity would suggest epas thresholds for the nsps program generally represent practical constraint on life extension efforts by utilities most life extension efforts improve the availability and reliability of generati ng units not their capacity to generate thus their maximum hourly emission rate would not change likewise most life extension efforts cost far less than the 50 asset value threshold nsr review has far more sensitive trigger tonnage increase in pollutant output because life extension does improve availability and reliability it is likely to increase emissions over levels emitted before the life extension activities were undertaken but how does one measure the change what are the baselines34 these issues came to head in the late 1980s when epa decided to enforce nsr against facilities undergoing life extension efforts in 1988 the epa ruled that life extension project by wisconsin electric power company wepco met the trigger for nsr because of the potential for increased emissions from the facilities after the project compared with actual emissions from the facilities before the project

actual to potential emissions trigger with respect to electric utilities in 199236 the new test to determine the applicability of nsr compares facilitys actual emissions before the modificatio n with its projected actual emissions after the modification actual to future actual specifically actual emissions equal the facilitys average emission rate during 2year period out of the preceding 5 years before the proposed change future actual is the product of the facilitys projected emission rate after the change and its projected actual utilization based on historical and other data these are the current nsr regulations for utility plants utilities also responded to epas interest in their life extension activities in defining modification under nsr epa excludes maintenance repair and replacement that it considers routine in addition increases in production rates that do not involve capital expenditures do not constitute modification responding to this situation utilities began to spread out their life extension efforts in an attempt to make them fit into their routine maintenance schedules indeed the term life extension has fallen out of the professional literature replaced with terms like capital improvement performance improvement and unit integrity condition assessment life operation management review of continued operating requirements and asset management37 the commonly used term currently is rehabilitation program38 by spreading out the life extension efforts and integrating them into facilities operation and maintenance schedules the distinction between modification and routine maintenance is effectively blurred and arguably eliminated what has epa done we expect early resolution 39 the justice departments lawsuits on behalf of epa represent an attempt to enforce the new source review requirements of the clean air act with respect to 1 instances of new construction of coalfired capacity by investorowned utilities and 2 instances in which changing investorowned utility strategies for managing existing coalfired facilities become modifications that in epas view trigger the applicability of the wepco rules in addition epa has issued

investorowned facilities seeks injunctive relief and civil penalties of up to 25000 per day of violation the injunctive relief typically calls for the defendants to comply in the future with all caa requirements and to remedy any past nsr violations by installing bact as appropriate to apply for permits and to audit operations to assure compliance with all nsr requirements for tva epas compliance order asks tva to develop schedule for meeting all applicable requirements affecting the facilities specified to audit all its coalfired power plants to determine nsr compliance and to develop schedule for remedying any noncompliance discovered during the audit and to retire so2 allowances equal to any so2 reductions that result from complying with the order the industrys response to epas enforcement action has focused on an exemption under nsr for routine maintenance nsr regulations state that major modification does not include routine maintenance repair and replacement41 the industry argues that although epa has never explicitly defined this phase epa has over the past 20 years not objected to utilities engaging in those very activities that are now being cited in the complaints as triggering nsr industry further asserts that these activities were wellpublicized in journal articles and government reports42 in effect industry is charging epa with changing the rules in the middle of the game on the substance of the issue the industry argues that the activities cited as violating nsr are nothing more than those necessary to meet its responsibilities to provide for the reliable safe and efficient operation of its plants through proper maintenance practices analogous to replacing worn tires on car that these activities might serve to extend the life of the powerplants is coincidental and thus should not trigger the major modification criterion of nsr what could the nsr enforcement action accomplish in terms of emission reductions emissions cannot exceed the cap emissions wont be below the cap either allowances not used at one source will be emitted somewhere else if you still apply nsr to source s under the cap other sources will produce the pollution avoided by the source subject to nsr this will all occur at higher cost43 in announcing the nsr suits the epa administrator states that controlling the sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from these plants could lead to an 85 to 95 percenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30432crs17 44 carol m browner administrator remarks prepared for delivery clean air enforcement press conference washington dc november 3 1999reduction respecti vely in these pollutants44 based on her statement this would reduce so 2 emissions by 187 million tons and nox emissions by 063 million tons compared to the slippage of title iv reductions noted earlier these cuts in emissions would more than compensate for the erosion in the original title iv reductions for so2 by about 50 more than the slippage and for nox by about double the slippage also given the widespread nature of life extension efforts it is reasonable to assume that further reductions would be achieved as other utilities either installed bact or retired their offending facilities thus at first glance it would appear that very substantial emission reductions could be achieved by epas nsr action however the caa is complex piece of legislation built up over time in the case of so2 any reduction achieved under nsr would interact with reduction requirements under title iv so2 reduction program designed with different premises than nsr specifically title iv limits total so 2 emissions from utilities to 89 million tons beginning in the year 2000 with interim reductions required in 1995 the cap is enforced through tonnage limitations at individual existing utility plants and by an emission offset requirement for new facilities so2 emissions from most existing sources are capped at specified emission rate times historical 19851987 average fuel consumption level thus the tonnage limitation is based on preset and historical data not regulatory limits to implement the program title iv created comprehensive emissions allowance system an allowance is limited authorization to emit ton of so2 during or after specified year issued by epa allowances are allocated to existing facilities in accordance with the emission ratefuel consumption formulas detailed in the law such allowances may be used at the plant they are allocated to or be traded or banked for future use or sale the program has been very successful with 100 compliance this 1990 caa amendments program does not integrate well with the 1977 caa amendments nsr program except that they both focus on existing facilities and so2 they have little in common the nsr is concerned with modifications at existing facilities and installation of bact title iv doesnt address whether existing facilities continue operation or not or whether specific facility installs bact or not compliance with the cap is the determining criterion nsr is an enforcement mechanism to assure compliance with individual plant standards title iv is program to reduce aggregate so2 emissions by permitting utilities considerable flexibility in determining appropriate compliance strategies the current so2 nsps the floor for any bact or laer determination is percentage reduction requirement that reduces so2 emissions by 7090 depending on the coal burned however the allocations under title iv for existing coalfired facilities is not as stringent and can be met with lowsulfur coal thus any facility that installed bact under nsr would overcontrol so2 under title iv and therefore have excess allowances available for sale or to bank for future sale because of this any reductions achieved because of nsr enforcement could be rendered moot by title iv if the affected plant subsequently sold its so2 reduction tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30432crs18 45 the tva

except for any tva reductions the net result would be reductions at least theoretically there is also provision in title iv for adjusting allowance allocations as result of nsr enforcement indeed the law is explicit in that its allowance allocations are based on historical data not on any presumption of compliance with nsps or sip requirements to avoid this allowance trap either congress would have to change the law or utilities would have to voluntarily agree to surrender the excess allowances created by the nsr action the situation with potential nox reduction is more complex first there is the interacti on of nsr and the nox nsps unlike the very stringent so 2 nsps the nox nsps historically has not reflected the cutting edge in technology development46 until the new standard was set in 1998 the nox nsps for coalfired facilities was 0605 lb of nox per million btu of heat input depending on the type of coal burned this standard set in 1979 could be met with fairly simple combustion modifications or lownox burners and did not require the installation of pollution control devices such as selective catalytic reduction scr indeed the standard did not reflect the state of the art with respect to lownox burners in 1998 epa promulgated new nox nsps for coalfired facilities of 015 lb of nox per million btu standard more in line with available technology however this new standard was challenged in court in september 1999 the dc court of appeals vacated the new nox nsps with respect to modified utility boilers while upholding the nsps with respect to new sources47 by vacating the modified standard the nsps for modified sources returns to the previous 1979 standard until such time as epa proposes revised nsps as result the floor for determining bact or laer for modified coalfired sources is unclear at the current time if the floor is the current modified nsps as set in 1979 reductions achieved by nsr enforcement would be considerably less than anticipated by epa in contrast if the floor is the new 1998 nsps the reduction would be substantial as suggested by epa the confusion is exacerbated by the interaction of nsr and title iv the nox reduction program under title iv differs substantially from the so2 program like the nsps program the title iv nox program is based on emission rates not tonnage limitations the difference is that the emission rate for the title iv program is set for existing facilities to be achieved in 1995 or 2000 depending on the facility regardless of whether the facility is modified or not in addition the rate limitation for most boilers under title iv is 045 to 05 lb per million btu or more stringent than the 1979 nox nsps thus you have the curious situation of some existing coal fired facilities having emission controls since 1995 that are more stringent than thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30432crs19 48 office of air and radiation epa analyzing electric power generation under the caaa july 1996 49 chris holly epa offers

determinations over the time period 19911995 sheds light on what bact might be currently data indicate permitted emission rates ranged from 015 to 05 lb per million btu48 thus it is difficult at the current time to project what any actual nox reduction would be achieved by epas nsr action what are the alternatives epa offers utilities offramp from nsr highway to hell 49 by seeking to enforce nsr requirements epa exploits an existing authority that holds the potential for reducing emissions epa clearly believes that some sources have been evading statutory requirements however according to some the action appears to raise the classic enforcement issue will the outcome be reduced emissions or just costly litigation consuming agency and utility resources that might be more effectively invested in other pollution controlling activities nsr was one approach that the clean air act took to control emissions from existing sources but arguably more efficient and more effective methods to ensure declining emissions from existing sources over time have been developed since nsr provisions were added to the caa in 1977 for example title iv of the caa enacted in 1990 explicitly and substantially reduces so 2 and nox emissions from existing utility plants in fact title iv reduced more so 2 emissions from coalfired electric generating facilities in its first year of implementation 1995 than nsr has in its 20 years of existence the cap and trade program has had 100 compliance indeed substantial overcompliance the implicit logic of epas lawsuits suggests nsrs compliance has been near zero the title iv program began without significant delays so2 program ontime nox program 1 year late the epa lawsuits could take years to resolve with uncertain results first alternative is to expand and build on the success of title ivs cap and trade program if the object of nsr enforcement is to reduce so 2 emissions from coalfired powerplants the most straightforward alternative would be to lower the cap on such emissions contained in title iv the practical effect of the 1990 so 2 cap was to reduce so2 emissions from existing facilities to the level required by the 1971 nsps the effect on new sources was to reduce the nsps to zero as all emissions now have to be offset lowering the existing cap by about twothirds would achieve roughly the same emission reductions as all existing powerplants meeting the 1978 nsps but utilities would have some flexibility in achieving such reductions admittedly utilities would get credit for shutdowns that they would not get

memorandum to carol m browner april 10 1998nsr enforcement however the administrative and cost advantages of the allowance system might be considered worth it in any case it would require new legislation which could be long drawn out process similarly new cap and trade program for nox would eliminate the uncertainties involved in the nsr enforcement debate and potentially in several other epa initiatives with respect to nox emissions not surprisingly epa has been strongly urging states to consider regional cap and trade program in implementing its currently stalled ozone transport rule and any possible compliance with section 126 petitions indeed epa has gone so far as to make such program part of its proposed federal implementation plan fip for states that do not submit adequate sips under the otr and its compliance plan for implementing approved section 126 petitions however to implement regionwide cap and trade program under the stalled nox sip call for nox would require either extraordinar cooperation between the states affected because of the sip process or new epa authority second alternative to nsr is to focus on so2 and nox emissions through other regulatory initiatives there are several regulatory initiatives underway at epa that would reduce so2 andor nox emissions in the future besides the previously mentioned otr and section 126 petitions epa has promulgated fine particulate naaqs and regional haze rule both of these regulations will require reductions in so2 and nox emissions as they are implemented the problem with them is that their implementation schedules are very long with few reductions occurring before the year 2010 unlike the alternative of tightening the title iv so2 cap and creating an nox cap these initiatives do not require further legislative authority third alternative to nsr would be to initiate controls on other pollutants associated with coalfired powerplants such as mercury hg and carbon dioxide co2 controls that would correlatively tend to reduce other emissions such as so2 and nox as well currently co 2 is not considered an air pollutant under the caa mercury is hazardous air pollutant under the caa but regulation of utility boilers is contingent upon an epa determination of its appropriateness and necessity50 as result the process to begin controlling hg emissions from electric utility boilers has moved very slowly epa has argued that it has authority under the caa to regulate co2 however that opinion is very controversial51 in lieu of potentially lengthy legal battle any co2 reductions in the near term would have to result from either voluntary initiatives or through ratification of the kyoto protocol final alternative is to reform nsr one reform could be new legislation to define modification in terms of plant age not physical or operation change for example the definition of modification could be altered to include any electric utility generating facility that was 40 years or older regardless of whether it had beenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30432crs21 52 61 federal register 38255 july 23 1996 53 environmental protection agency an emissions cap alternative to new source review september 27 1999 p 2modified or not it would simplify the nsr trigger but would required legislative action another reform could emerge from current epa initiative it is not surprising given the situation outlined above that epa has been considering reforms to nsr for several years one focus of that effort has been proposed offramps to nsr one offramp called the clean unit exclusion would exclude existing units from the complicated nsr applicability rules where they already have stateoftheart pollution control technology52 this exclusion would recognize that nsr is unlikely to result in significant emission reductions if units are already wellcontrolled in the proposal clean unit is defined as one that has installed bact or laer within the last 10 years such units could be modified in any fashion that would not increase the units maximum hourly emissions unit however how much of an improvement this is over the current situation is debatable from epas perspective the problem with all the alternativ is their contingency they imply the need for legislation or for finalization of regulations which require time and which may be problematic of course while epa has the existing authority to initiate its nsr suits the outcome of the litigation is also problematic conclusion nsr ambiguous meaningless or moot epa is embracing cap and trade programs for many pollutants nsr is duplicative and counterproductive on top of cap replacing nsr with cap provides the same environmental protection with lower cost and greater environmental benefit 53 much of the popular debate on nsr has focused on grandfathered powerplants one example from 1998 report by public interest group states the clean air act of 1970 as amended in 1977 and 1990 contains major exemption that allows older coalburning power plants to emit between 4 and 10 times the amount of pollution that new plants may emit under the clean air act in part this colossal loophole exists because industry lobbyists argued successfully that its older plants would soon retire and that therefore it would be wasteful to require expensive retrofits to control pollution from these plants however over 20 years later many of thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30432crs22 54 united states public interest research group lethal loophole us pirg education fund june 1998 p 3same plants built in the 30s 40s 50s and 60s are still operating largely without environmental controls54 the term grandfathered powerplant is much used and little understood concept employed in debate on emissions from existing powerplants specifically grandfathered is an ambiguous and in some cases meaningless term generally used to indicate whether given powerplant is covered under section 111 of the clean air act passed with the 1970 clean air act amendments section 111 requires the epa to promulgate regulations defining the minimum controls necessary for new sources including power plants regardless of their location called new source performance standards nsps they require major new sources construct ed after their promulgation to install the best system of continuous emission reduction which has been adequately demonstrated according to epa currently there are nsps regulations for powerplants that cover three pollutants sulfur dioxide so 2 nitrogen oxides nox and particulate matter typically grandfathered refers to those plants usually coalfired powerp lants that were constructed before the effective dates of those nsps regulations and hence not subject to them nsps regulations for powerplants were first promulgated in 1971 and revised in 1979 the nox nsps regulations for powerplants were revised again in 1998 instead of nsps requirements such grandfathered sources must meet emission rate limits established by state implementation plan sip three aspects of the nsps make the term grandfathered at best ambiguous and at worst meaningless some pollutants of concern such as carbon dioxide co2 and mercury hg are not criteria air pollutants and therefore not covered by the nsps for powerplants at the current time hence grandfathered is meaningless for these pollutants as all powerplants indeed all major sources of these pollutants are grandfathered epa is required to review the nsps every eight years resulting in increased stringency for covered pollutants as technology improves and for determinations of bact and laer therefore what powerplants are grandfathered is ambiguous as there is set baseline for example the nsps for nox was revised in 1998 to stringency that only couple of commercially operating coalfired powerplants currently met by that standard virtually all coalfired powerplants are grandfathered with respect to nox emissions title iv of the 1990 clean air act amendments changed the regulation of existing powerplants with respect to so2 and nox in some cases the requirements under title iv for existing sources are more stringent than some of the existing or previous nsps for example under phase 1 some existing grandfa thered powerplants were required in 1995 to meet nox standards more stringent than then existing nsps nox requirements for new powerplants likewise under phase 2 of title iv existing grandfathered coalfiredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30432crs23 powerplants are required in 2000 to meet so 2 standards that are essentially equivalent to if not more stringent than the 1971 nsps for so 2 the term grandfathered is essentially meaningless under such circumstances if the focus of debate about grandfathered powerplants is nox emissions then age of plant is not relevant consideration fuel source is coalfired facilities regardless of age are the relevant focus of any effort to increase nox controls if the focus of debate about grandfathered powerplants is so2 emissions then the title iv emissions cap is the relevant consideration there age was consideration in allocating emission credits however the relevant definition was not based on nsps compliance or any other caa compliance but on whether the plant was operational under construction or planned at the time of enactment indeed the nsps for so2 for new powerplants is in some ways moot all new sources must completely offset their emissions under the cap as they receive allocation of emission credits the nsps is effectively nil thus if reducing so 2 from electric generating facilities is the goal shrinking the current cap on so 2 is the most logical approach likewise cap on nox emission is logical extension for reducing nox emissions from electric generating facilities not coincidentally epa favors this approach in addressing transported pollution programs in the northeast and the agency has proposed statebystate emissions caps the wepco decision precipitated public debate and congressional oversight and the dojepa actions on nsr may do likewise many of the same issues are being raised the suits depend on interpretations of the legislative intent of several caa provisions especially with respect to modifications of existing sources also many alternatives for addressing nsr issues would require new legislation amending the caa in order to bring consistency to the nsr provisions and to update the clean air acts approach to regulation of the electric utility industrys environmental effect to reflect the knowledge gained by 30 years of caa implementation
