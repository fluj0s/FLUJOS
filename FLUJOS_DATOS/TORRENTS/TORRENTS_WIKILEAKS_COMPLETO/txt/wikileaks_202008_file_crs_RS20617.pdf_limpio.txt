2008 abstract this fact sheet identiﬁes and explains some forms that one may commonly see in which proposed bills may express their intended relation to previously enacted statutes it also suggests some implications of these diﬀerent forms of expressionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20617 order code rs20617 updated june 24 2008 how bills amend statutes richard s beth specialist in the legislative process government and finance division many bills proposed in cong ress address subjects on whic h law already exists and their enactment would result in changes in the body of existing law this report describes how new legislation may commonly express its intention either explicitly to amend existing law or implicitly to supersede its provisions it does not present guidance for drafting legislation for that purpose recour to the office of legislative counsel is appropriate nor does it offer guidance for in terpreting statutory nguage which may be obtained by consulting the american law division of crs for more information on legislative process see httpwwwcr sgovproductsguidesguidehomeshtml altering law bill or joint resolution may directly alter the text of current law only if its provisions are formulated explicitly as amendments to that text provision amending existing law may either 1 insert new text in the law 2 strike out text in the law or 3 strike out text and insert new text in its place these three forms of amendment to law parallel the three forms of amendment to bill in the course of the legislative process by inserting new provisions an amendatory bill can supplement current law and by striking out provisions of current law it can repeal them by ame ndments to strike and insert an amendatory bill may make specific alterations or modifications in existing provisions of law legislative language explicitly altering or modifying provisions of current law may take several forms an am endatory bill may identify each separate point in existing statutes at which text is to be stricken out and for each set forth text to be inserted alternatively it may propose to strike out an entire provision then set forth to be inserted in lieu new text incorporating all the changes in language desired at every point in the provision finally it may simply direct that specified provision be amended so as to read in the way specified by the text th at follows the first approach may aid in determining what changes the bill would make in existing law but the others may more readily reveal the overall effect of the changes whichever approach is used house rule xiii clause 3e1 the ramseyer rule and senate rule xxvi paragr aph 12 the cordon rule re quire that when committee reports bill amending existing law it must provide in its report or otherwise comparative print showing how the bill would alter that law this comparative print can be of great aid in ascertaining the inte nded effect of amendatory legislation thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20617crs2 intended effects of amendments only to inse rt or only to strike out may be easier to determine from their text although they are so to be shown in the comparative print forms of citation amendments to existing law must be made to the official evidence of the law which in most cases means either the united states code or the statutes at large the statutes at large is chronological compilation of the laws enacted by congress the us code arranges laws topically under 50 titles congress has enacted 20 of these 50 titles and part of one other into what is known as pos itive law if title has been so enacted its text constitutes legal evidence of the laws in that title and bill would properly identify existing law being amended by citing the us code eg 50 usc 234b if the law being amended has not been enacted into positive law bill would properly identify the law by either its short title the xyz act of 1999 public law number pl 101 987 or page in the statutes at large 123 stat 456 often existing provisions of law have previously been amended in those cases the bill may refer to the act as amended eg abc ac t of 1987 as amended specific provisions of an act are identified by section number or by the designations of other smaller or larger subdivisions of the act when bill amends an existing statute section numbers of the bill will not generally correspond to those of the statute being amended for example section 102 of bill may set forth rewritten version of section 203 of some existing act in general in this c ontext section numbers within quotation marks will refer to provisions of cited existing law those having none designate the sections of the bill itself the short title of bill to amend existing law may sometimes identify it as such eg clean water act amendments of 2001 b ills identified as reauthorizations too generally include amendments to the previous law being reauthorized they typically extend existing programs either 1 by amendi ng provisions of stat ute such as sunset provisions that specify an expiration date or 2 by inserting text covering additional fiscal years into provisions of statute that authorize ap propriations for the programs these reauthorizing bills frequently also amend existing statutory language to make substantive alterations in the programs in question supplementing or superseding law bills that do not explicitly insert or strike out provisions of existing statutes may nevertheless also have the ffect of supplementing or supers eding current law in these cases however the intended relation between bill and law can be ambiguous and these ambiguities may need to be resolved through judicial interpretation or removed through further enactments if provisions in new enactment address subject already dealt with by existing law they may supplement that law even without explicitly amending it absent conflict between an existing and new provision c ourts normally presume that the two are intended to be read together and will often attempt to give both the fullest effect possible on the other hand provisions of new law ma be read as conflicting with those of an existing statute on the grounds that late r enactment always supersedes an earlier onehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20617crs3 the new provisions might then be treated as overriding previous law in some cases however bill may preface new provisions with such phrase as notwithstanding any other provision of law inasmuch as th is phrase leaves unexpressed which existing provisions it relates to it may have unf oreseen consequences for subsequent interpretation
