govern administration of the mobility hardship and nonremoval allowance it is non pensionable allowance which has three distinct elements the mobility element which varies according to the number of assignments and provides an incentive for greater mobility of staff b the hardship element which reflects the varying degree of hardship at different duty stations and c the nonremoval element which compensates for nonremoval of personal effects and household goods 3 staff in the professional category and above field service staff and internationally recruited general service staff appointed under the 100 series and 200 series of staff rules shall be eligible for payment of the allowance provided they meet the requirements set out in stai20002 section 15 and the conditions governing payment of the allowance set out in sections 2 3 and 4 4 the amount of the allowance payable to each eligible staff member shall be function of his placement on three dimension matrix where the hardship element increases in order of difficulty the mobility element varies according to number of assignments and the length of service at one duty station and the nonremoval element varies according to whether the staff member is entitled to and opts for full removal of household goods 5 unon staff administration section sas is responsible for mobility hardship and nonremoval sas is headed by p4 supported by 3 professional p and 21 general service gs staff who are divided into four units three of which handle mobility hardship and nonremoval for unon unep and unhabitat staff

audit team could find docum entation indicating that any effort had been m ade to recover the overpaym ents m ade sas were unable to explain why action had been taken stai200011 recovery of overpaym ents m ade to staff m embers section 31 states that recovery of overpaym ents shall be lim ited to the am ounts paid during the twoyear period prior to notification to the staff m ember oios is of the opinion that unon cannot recover approxim ately us5000 of the overpaym ents which were paid prior to novem ber 2002 due to failure on the part of sas to act oios noted sim ilar 2 failures in other areas of its audit of entitlem ents and the point is discussed f urther in its audit report on organisation and managem ent of entitlem ents aa 200421102 recommendation to safeguard against erroneous paym ents to locally recruited general service staff the chief staff adm inistration section unon should discuss with the imis coordinator the possibility of building check into imis to ensure that general service staff who are not internationally recruited do not receive hardship allowance while on mission detail discussion should also be held with payroll unit on the possibility of checking entitlem ents generated by imis rec 01 12 unon commented that sas will liaise with its and bfms to develop system to ensure that general service staff members on mission are not automatically paid hardship allowance oios notes the response and will close the recom mendation upon receipt of details of the system put in place to ensure that general service staff who are not internationally recruited do not receive hardship allowance while on m ission detail c incorrect categorization of duty stations 13 hardship allowance is paid at category b to duty stations sas entered wrong data into imis and in the absence of any va lidation checks within or external to imis overpaym ents were m ade to three out of hundred cases sam pled w hilst the num ber of cases is quite sm all as pointed out in the next section sas relies on the accuracy of this inform ation for the m obility count it is im portant for system s that affect payroll that there are controls in place to ensure that errors are as close to zero as possible 14 the audit team sampled 100 out of 661 staff and noted problem s with classification of duty station for professiona l staff however the wrong duty station classification was shown for four gs staff m embers with index num bers 303509 233737 668612 and 363775 resulting in overpaym ent of approxim ately us9000 sas stated that this was the result of known imis problem which allowed the entry of invalid data in the count field oios is very concerned that though sas knew about the problem they did not build in any additional checks to safeguard against incorrect paym ents knowing that errors could be costly and the m ay not be able to recover paym ents where staff concerned left the under stai200011 section 31 recovery of the overpaym ent shall be lim ited to the am ounts paid during the twoyear period thus oios is of the opinion that only us700 paid after novem ber 2002 is recoverable recommendations to ensure accuracy and com pleteness of the duty station classifications the chief sta ff adm inistration section unon should develop procedures to assist staff in checking and confirm ing the accuracy of the duty station classifications rec 02 to ensure the imis system generates correct duty station classifications the chief sta ff adm inistration section unon should request imis coordinator to raise an imis system enhancem ent 3 request to autom atically generate duty station counts for staff members rec 03 the chief staff adm inistra tion section unon should recover total of approxim ately us1400 of hardship allowance overpaid to the general service staff m ember with index num ber 303509 rec 04 15 unon commented in respect of recommendations 2 3 and 4 that sas will in coordination with the hrms systems support unit and the imis coordinator its verify data on mobility count and work to ensure that the correct data is entered for all staff members action will be taken for index 303509 to recover

index num ber 303509 b mobility element 16 us700000 was paid to 49 professional and one gs staff in 20022003 oios found that current arrangem ents for handling m obility were adequate with the exception of the m obility count at the tim of the audit sas relied on the imis system to count assignm ents for purposes of establishing the m atrix classification imis relies on the accuracy of the duty station inform ation to perform this task and as discussed above there are currently controls in place to ensure the accuracy and com pleteness of this inform ation recom mendation num ber three when im plem ented will ensure accuracy of the duty station inform ation c nonremoval element 17 us2 m illion was paid to 409 professional staff and 4 gs staff in 20022003 oios sam pled 115 out of the

lim ited to period of five years at one duty station exceptionally the period of paym ent m aybe extended for further period of up to two years upon certification oios noted that hum an resources officers at times sent rem inders to staff inform ing them of the pending discontinuation of non removal elem ent of the m obility and hardship allowance however the notices are not routinely sent to all staff concerned oios observed that in m ost cases the allowance was autom atically discontinued without any notification b in several instances the reduction date was either incorrect or was m issing altogether in imis w hile overpaym ents were noted there is risk that staff 4 member continues receiving the allowance if the reduction date is not indicated as the system does not autom atically discontinue the paym ent this m atter has been taken up further in oios report dealing with organisation and m anagem ent arrangem ents for adm inistration of entitlem ents aa200421102
