mission monitor see additional comments uploading imagery to cohost and csd using socet see additional comments gbs change in fazzt status continue troubleshooting with sbm and tip imagery products products collected scan eagle fmv imagery quality nothing significant clear fmv and at times choppy and pixely summary successes able to do scan eagle live mission and ped products and post to cohost and csd able to fully test our infrastruc tures with si gnificant issues lesson learned spia tag requirements for diss eminating products using mediaware you cannot load images to csd because csd does not recognize mediaware where help is needed better understanding of how the taskings are coming down additional comments uploading scan eagle images to csd using mediaware mission monitor we discovered that when you try and upload an image that was captured from mediaware the id default is mediaware and the csd does not recognize medi aware therefore receive an error and will not upload however you can upload to the cohost there is call to the socet people to look into this our fix for now is not to use mediaware using mitools and maas there is problem uploading imagery to cohost and csd using socet we discovered why we were unable to upload images to the cohost and csd spia tags with the help from the uk they walked us through how to fill out the required fields they had the same issues yesterday an d so therefore had an answer for us canadian army task force victory location ecr pocs major keith laughton personnel 48 personnel with issues to report activities summary of planned activities change from last dsr significant issue good chat comms with rest of coalition imagery products products collected still imagery from coyote and tsk summary successes successfully moved imagery from tsk without having to put rest of network on standby passed positional information between sensors queued between coyote tsk and scan eagle dcgs 102 location langley afb dgsx pocs chris hadley personnel 4 personnel with issues to report activities summary of planned activities support dib federation across the ddte enterprise function as tped node for u2 and global hawk missions test dcgs 102 ingest capabilit ies of other available imagery from additional platforms during ec08 significant issues at this time we have not been able to fully federate with all the ddte nodes access to imagery to support exploitation for the gh mission has impacted our ability to support the federated tped mission we could not access the imagery throug h dib federation or through the site ipl there is clear connection between scene collected and the exploitation requirement if we can receive imagery it will be cumbersome to identify the appropriate image to be exploited in connection with specific requirement summary lesson learned dib federation cannot be the sole method for receiving imint for exploitation backup method needs to be in place ahead of time in order to address unforeseen system issues associated with dib federation dcgsa v30 and v31 location danville echo 513th and ft monmouth pocs david usechak personnel 3 personnel at danville 2 personnel at echo

from the sensor systems continue to receive sigint from cgs continue to build an sa over lay using mti and sigint data continue to conduct fire mission threads with afatds attempt to exploit global hawk data significant issue high speed guards are still not working and therefore we cannot federate with the cfblnet imagery products products collected we were able to collect the following data mti from both jstars and astor sigint from rj imagery from raptor pulled sharp imagery summary successes we were able to access sensor data from seve ral different systems via the metadata catalog and then we were able to build an sa overlay we were able to conduct several fire missions from echo with afatds at fort monmouth we did not exploit global hawk because the sensor malfunctioned and therefore did not fly instead we downloaded sharp data performed exploitation and posted the resultant products via the dib to the ipl additional comments status of dcgsa node connections there are total of 16 external nodes dcgsa v30 status is 7 nodes are green and 5 are yellow dcgsa v31 status is 10 nodes are green and 2 are amber dhmo dia humint team mivg location michelson labs pocs john
