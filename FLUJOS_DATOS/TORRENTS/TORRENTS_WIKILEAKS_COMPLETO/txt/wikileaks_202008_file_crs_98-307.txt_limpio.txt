analyst on the congress and legislative process government and finance division the speaker usually does not take the initiative to prevent the house from considering proposals or taking actions that would violate the houses rules1 instead whenever member believes that the houses legislative procedures are being violated in some way or are about to be violated that member may insist that the houses procedures be enforced by making point of order against the alleged violation2 see httpwwwcrsgovproductsguidesguidehomeshtml for more information on legislative process3 points of order member who wishes to make point of order must do so at the appropriate time for example point of order may be made against an amendment only after it has been read or designated if it does not need to be read but before debate on the amendment has begun4 once member begins to explain an amendment that he or she has offered it is too late to make point of order against the amendment sometimes member will reserve point of order usually against an amendment which also allows other members to later insist on the point of order the member need not state the reason for reserving the point of order reserving point of order defers action on the point of order until after there has been some debate on the amendment 1 what is said here about the speaker applies equally to any member presiding over the house as speaker pro tempore and to any member presiding as chairman of the committee of the whole the right to make points of order described herein for members also equally applies to delegates and the resident commissioner 2 points of order against measures may be waived in the house by unanimous consent special rule reported from the rules committee or via suspension of the rules see house practice guide to the rules precedents and procedures of the house by wm holmes brown and charles w johnson washington gpo 2003 p 670 3 this report was written by stanley bach formerly senior specialist in the legislative process at crs the listed author has updated this report in the 110th congress and is available to respond to inquiries on the subject 4 for additional information on appropriate timing for raising points of order in specific circumstances eg to enforce rules against appropriations on authorizing measures see house practice p 49 crs2 member may reserve point of order because he or she is not yet sure if point of order lies against the amendment or because the member wishes to give the sponsor of the amendment an opportunity to explain it before the chair rules on the point of order on the demand for the regular order however the member must either make his or her point of order at that time or lose the opportunity to do so if member does make point of order at the appropriate time the speaker gives that member an opportunity to explain precisely what rule or precedent is being violated and why the member whose action is in question then may respond to the point of order the speaker may allow other members to speak on the point of order if the bill manager concedes the point of order the speaker need not entertain debate before ruling5 all debate on point of order is at the discretion of the chair and is only for the purpose of advising the chair on the procedural issue that the point of order raises rulings it is the responsibility of the speaker to rule on each point of order that is made the speakers rulings are based on information and advice provided by the house parliamentarian and reflect the houses voluminous published precedents that document how speakers ruled on similar questions in the past6 in turn each new ruling by the speaker becomes precedent on which he and his successors may rely in the future the speaker is not required to explain the reasons for his rulings but he often does so whenever the procedural question at issue is complex difficult or controversial if the speaker sustains point of order on consideration of measure it is recommitted to either its previous place on the relevant calendar or to the reporting committee if point of order is raised and sustained against specific language in measure the language is struck sustained points of order against portion of an amendment may invalidate the entire amendment7 appeals in most cases any member who disagrees with the speakers ruling can challenge it and ask members to decide by majority vote whether the house will agree to be bound by that ruling clause 5 of house rule i states in part that the speaker shall decide all questions of order subject to appeal by member delegate or resident commissioner anyone wishing to invoke this right simply stands and announces before any other business has taken place that he or she appeals the ruling of the chair most appeals are debatable under rule i but it is unusual for there to be much debate on an appeal8 debate is under the 1hour rule in the house and under the 5minute rule in the committee of the whole however the house can end the debate on an appeal by voting to order the previous question or by voting to close debate if in committee of the whole alternately motion to table an appeal is in order in the house but not in 5 house practice p 669 6 in addition rulings on certain budget points of order require examination of estimates supplied by the house budget committee which monitors the compliance of measure with the congressional budget act of 1974 pl 93344 for more information on budget points of order see crs report 98876 congressional budget act points of order by bill heniff jr 7 house practice p 663 8 quite often motion to table the appeal is offered the ruling is sustained if the tabling motion is adopted house practice p 68 crs3 committee of the whole the speaker puts the appeal to vote by phrasing the question in the following way the question is shall the decision of the chair stand as the judgment of the house or the committee those supporting the ruling vote aye those opposing it vote nay in the house of representatives appeals from rulings of the chair are quite infrequent in the 110th congress approximately two dozen appeals have been taken from rulings of the chair on points of order and none have been overturned9 in fact none have been overturned in half century at least two reasons account for the failure of the house to overturn ruling first the speakers rulings are based on the parliamentarians advice which in turn is based on prior rulings on similar questions generally the correctness of rulings is not in doubt second most members of the majority party can be expected to support ruling made by that partys elected leader or another member whom he or she has designated to preside points of order are to be distinguished from parliamentary inquiries parliamentary inquiries are questions that members pose to the speaker about the current parliamentary situation the speakers replies to these inquiries are explanatory they are not rulings so they are not subject to appeal10 further some decisions of the chair are not subject to appeal for example member can challenge the way in which the speaker exercises his discretionary power of recognition nor can member appeal the speakers ruling that proposed motion is not in order because it is dilatory11 for additional information see house practice guide to the rules precedents and procedures of the house by wm holmes brown and charles w johnson washington gpo 2003 pp 4850 amendments pp 6569 appeals pp 661 674 points of order parliamentary inquiries and pp 823827 rules and precedents of the house it is also available electronically at httpwwwgpoaccessgov hpracticebrowse_108html 9 virtually all of these appeals were disposed of unfavorably when the house agreed to motion to table the remaining few made in committee of the whole and therefore not subject to motion to table were decided directly by the house in vote to sustain the chairs ruling this evaluation of appeals is based on an examination of the daily digest and congressional record through november 20 2008 10 house practice p 66 11 see house practice pp 6667 for other examples of chair decisions not subject to appeal for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98307
