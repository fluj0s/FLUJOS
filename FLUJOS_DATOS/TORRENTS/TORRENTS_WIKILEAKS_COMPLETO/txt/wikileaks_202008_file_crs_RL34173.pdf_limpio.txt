group inc v public utility district 1 of snohomis h county 1 in this decision the court evaluated the author ity of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc to amend wholesale electricity agreements pursuant to the mobilesierra doctrine the decision has widereaching implications for fercs authority under the federal power act fpa and by extension its authority under the natural gas act nga these two statut form the basis of fercs regulatory authority the federal government regulates wholesal sales of electricity and transmission of electricity and natural gas under the fp and the nga these two statutes charge ferc with number of oversight responsibilities2 one of these responsibilities is the review of contracts between electricity and natural gas companies and their wholesale or interstate customers in order to confirm that the rates charged by these electricity and natural gas companies for power and gas are just and reasonable3 for many years ferc evaluated these contracts in an environment of cost based rates that is rate approval was based on the act ual cost of service which includes costs associated with generating or purchasing the electricity or natural gas on the wholesale market as well as transpor tation and other costs plus rate of return thus ferc review of contracts was conducted with an eye toward ensuring that the wholesale customers were paying just and reasonable rates based on the costs incurred by the seller however in recen t years some regula tory authorities have experimented with marketbased rates for electricity in which pricing is determined not by actual cost of service but by market forces this shift was initiated by passage of the ergy policy act of 19924 which created the basic framework for competitive wholesale electricity market this has altered fercs regulatory role to some degree some have wondered how certain funda mental doctrines of ferchttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34173crs2 5 350 us 332 1956 6 350 us 348

utilitys wholesale rate to the retail industrial rate thus expanding the doctrine beyond fixed rates to cases where the rates are subject to change in certain manner papago tribal util auth v ferc 610 f2d 1979 dc cir 1979 papago i holding that the doctrine was applicable to contracts that allo w the utility to seek rate increases pursuant to section 205 of the fparate review would apply in the context of marketbased rates one such ferc doctrine is the mobilesierra doctrine what is the mobilesierra doctrine the mobilesierra doctrine has been foundati on of ferc regulatory behavior since the supreme court decisions were handed down in 1956 the doctrine articulates the extent of fercs authority to amend rate agreements in two concurrent decisions issued in 1956 the us supreme court interpreted fercs authority under the fpa and the nga with respect to contracts and limited fercs authority in situations where the parties seek to reform contracts that ferc had previously approved in these cases united gas pipe line c v mobile gas serv corp 5 and fpc v sierra pacific power co 6 the court held that an electricity or natural gas contract once approved by ferc cannot be changed pursuant to unilateral request of one of the parties absent showing that such change is in the public interest this rule has become known as the mobilesierra doctrine under both the fpa and the nga ferc has substantial authority to amend the terms of an agreement prior to its becoming effective and may amend it to ensure that the rates charged are just and reasonable however once ferc has approved rate agreement presumption of validity sometimes called the mobilesierra presumption is created nd the agreement cannot be am ended absent showing that the change is in the public interest thus the supreme court stated that rate for electric power that had become unprofita ble since formation of longterm agreement could not be changed unless the utility could show that the rate was so low as to adversely affect the public interest as where it might impair the financial ability of the public utility to continue its service cast upon other consumers an excessive burden or be unduly discriminatory7 this has become the ferc standard for determining whether rate is in the public interest evolution of the mobilesierra doctrine the mobilesierra doctrine was strictly enforced for many years after it was first articulated by the court8 in the early 1980s the courts began to articulate the doctrine in way that gave ferc more leeway to make changes to approved contracts series of decisions found th at in certain situations ferc has authorityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34173crs3 9 723 f2d 950 954 dc cir 1983 10 16 usc 824e the act does not furt her define unjust unreasonable

amend rate agreement upon showing that amendment is needed in order to ensure just and reasonable rates in papago tribal util auth v ferc papago ii 9 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit considered utilitys petition to adjust rates pursuant to section 206 of the fpa whic h authorizes ferc to correct rates on its own motion or upon complaint whenever it fi nds them to be unjust unreasonable unduly discriminatory or preferential10 this authority differs from section 205 of the fpa and its accompanying regulations wh ich require utilities to charge just and reasonable rates and authorizes utilities unilaterally to file for changes in such rate schedules as necessitated by changes in costs11 in papago i the court had held that the rate contract in question had contractually eliminated the utilities option to petition ferc for rate changes pursuant to section 205 and thus pursuant to the mobilesierra doctrine the rate could not be ltered absent showing that such change was in the public interest however the utility subsequently filed section 206 complaint the court held that although the mobilesierra doctrine barred section 205 changes to the negotiated rates ab sent showing that such change was in the public interest it did not in this instance bar section 206 challenge to the rate agreement12 therefore ferc could properly evaluate proposed rate change under the less stringent just and reasona ble standard rather than the public interest standard of the mobilesierra doctrine the court noted that the public interest standard is practi cally insurmountable ferc its elf is unaware of any case granting relief under it13 and thus the just and r easonable test provided less restrictive standard similarly second decision issued by the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit on the same day as papago ii also held that the mobilesierra doctrine was inapplicable to anot her type of rate dispute in kansas cities v ferc 14 the court held that under certain circumstan ces rate contracts c ontaining regulatory approval clauses or racs could be amended by ferc under the just and reasonable standard rather th an the stricter public inte rest standard applied under the mobilesierra doctrine racs come in vari ety of types but they generally provide that the rates in the contracts are subject to regulatory approval although the mobilesierra doctrine had previously been held pplicable to such contracts in this case the court found that the rates could be reviewed under the less stringent just

noting that it applied only to the fact pattern presented in the case16 subsequently series of decisions related to northeast utilities service company in the early 1990s suggested furthe r erosion of the once strict application of the mobilesierra doctrine the contract at issue in this dispute explicitly incorporated the doctrine by stating that the rate could not be changed unless ferc found that the rate was contrary to the public interest neve rtheless ferc initially applied the just and reasonable standard in disapproving one aspect of the rate filing17 the us court of appeals for the firs t circuit rejected this holding finding that ferc should have applied the mobilesierra public interest standard as dictated by the contract18 on remand ferc applied the mobilesierra doctrine as directed by the court but st ated that the public intere st standard of review under the mobilesierra doctrine could not be practi cally insurmountable and that more flexible standard is therefore appropriate19 pursuant to this line of reasoning ferc revised the contracts in the public interest setting forth long list of relevant factors to be cons idered in determining whether contract reformation was in the public interest including whether the contract had prev iously been reviewed by the commission and made public whether th contract truly reflects the intent of the parties and what impacts the c ontract might have on third parties20 the united states court of appeals for the first ci rcuit upheld fercs br oad interpretation of the mobilesierra public interest standard in this instance noting as ferc did the importance of protec ting third parties21 the doctrine in the marke tbased rate environment ferc and circuit court decisions in the snohomish matter as described above ferc s application of the mobilesierra doctrine has evolved and some commentator s might suggest that the doctrine has become less significant hurdle to ferc reviewamendment of rate agreements in recent years an interesting twist on the app lication of the doctrine cam about with the introduction of marketbased wholesale rates in the late 1990s traditionally utilities had charged costbased rates in which customers pa id rates that corresponded roughly to the charges incurred by the utilities in providing services the mobilesierra doctrine was generally applied to disputes over contracts fo r longterm wholesale power service where change had occurred since th signing of the agreement for example if costs had shifted dramatically since the parties signed the agreement however in the late 1990s ferc started to permit utilities to charge marketbased rates tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34173crs5 22 this price spike was associated with the hi ghly publicized california electricity

competitive market to ensure that the utility could not abuse its market position utility charging marketbased rates would charge the rate that the market would bear rather than the traditional cost based rate the applicability of the mobilesierra doctrine to contractual rate agreements in the context of marketbased rate environment was put to the test in series of decisions involving several power purchase contracts these agreements were formed in the wake of severe spike in electricity prices on the spot market in california in late 2000 and early 200122 in response to this extraord inary price shift number of utilities and other wholesale power custom ers including snohomish county made longterm power purchase deals to afford them rate stability in each case the wholesale customers paid prices for electricity that were well in excess of the prices available elsewhere during the terms of thei r deals and they were unable to convince state regulatory agencies to allow them to recoup their losses at the retail level these wholesale customers petitioned ferc to change their contract price terms pursuant to section 206 of the fpa the cu stomers felt that the contracts should not be presumed to be just and reasonable under the mobilesierra doctrine because they had not been initially approved by th commission upon formation the customers also argued that they were entitled to c ontract modification b ecause the high prices in the contract were product of extraordin ary circumstances that they could not have predicted caused at least in part by co llusion and market mani pulation and were not in the public interest ferc rejected the wholesal customers argument nd found that the contracts formed in fercauthorized marketbased rate environment were entitled to presumption of validity under the mobilesierra doctrine even if the individual contracts were not review ed prior to formation23 ferc also rejected the customers claim that the contracts should be amended under the mobilesierra doctrine because the rates were so high that they vi olated the public interest noting that the fact that contract becomes uneconomic over time does not render it contrary to the public interest24 the wholesale customers appealed fercs decision to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit in its decision on this matter the court seemed to tread new ground in the application of the mobilesierra doctrine the court found that while there is language in some cases suggesting otherw ise we are convinced that mobilesierra establishes one means of revi ew

public utility district 1 of snohomish county 128 s ct 2733 2008 standard applicable in certain limited circumstances25 the court found that rather than establishing stricter public interest standard for review of certain contracts the mobilesierra doctrine simply establishes that consideration as to what is unjust or unreasonable differ in the cont ext of an established bilateral contract not that the statutory standards longer govern26 in marketbased rate environment the court stated that contracts are presumptively reasonable only if ferc has had an initial opportunity to review them promptly after they are formed27 the court also held that when power purchaser challenges contract that is entitled to presumption of reasonableness under the mobilesierra doctrine ferc should review the contract to determine whether the rate exceeds what the court called the zone of reasonableness28 based on these findings the court held that the requirements for application of the mobilesierra doctrine presumption of contractual validity were not in place when the contracts in question were formed and that ferc therefore was in error in pplying this presumption in its review of these contracts the ninth circuit rema nded its decision to ferc for evaluation of the agreements in accordance with its ruling reining in fercs application of the doctrine the supreme court decision in snohomish the sellers petitioned the supreme court to review the ninth circuits decision the court granted certiorari heard argu ments on february 19 2008 and issued its decision on june 26 2008 the cour t upheld the ninth circuits remand of the contracts to ferc for further review but disagreed with the lower courts rationale and its application of the mobilesierra doctrine the court agreed with the ninth circuit that the only standard that should guide ferc review of contracts is to ensure that they are just and reasonable as required by the fpa29 however the court disagreed with the ninth circuits statement that the mobilesierra doctrine requires ferc to revi ew contracts upon their formation to determine whether they are just and r easonable instead the court found that the doctrine was grounded in the commonsense notion that in wholesale markets the party charging the rate and the party charged are often sophisticated businesses enjoying presumptively equal bargaining power who could be expected to negotiate just and reasonable rate as between the two of them thereforehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34173crs7 30 id at 2746 quoting verizon communications inc v fer c 535 us 467 479

declare it not to be just and reasonable30 the court further stated that ferc did not need to address the possibility of dysfunctional market before it granted mobilesierra presumption of justness and reasonableness to marketbased rate contract31 the court noted that market imperfection is one of the reasons that parties enter into longterm contracts and therefore it would be perverse rule if it were more difficult to enforce longterm contracts formed in volatile markets32 the court also took issue with the nint h circuits assertion that ferc should employ zone of reasonableness test to evaluate buyers claim that contract rate is not just and reasonable ch aracterizing it as overarching33 the court stated that there should not be distinction between power contract challenges brought by buyers and those brought by sellers in bot h cases the court held the proper test is whether the contract rate in question seriously harms the public interest34 the court stated presumption of validity that disappears when the rate is above marginal rate is not presumption of validity at all but reinstitution of costbased rather than contractbased regulation we have said that under the mobilesierra presumption tting aside contract rate requires finding of unequivocal public necessity or extraordinary circumstances in way can these descriptions be thought to refer to the mere exceeding of marginal cost35 despite these rejections of the ninth ci rcuits reasoning the court agreed with the ninth circuits decision to remand th decision to ferc the court was critical of fercs analysis of the customers petition to amend the rates the court noted that ferc appeared to have looked sole ly at the rates paid by consumers immediately after the contracts in question went into effect instead of determining whether consumers bore an excessi ve burden at any later point36 the court was critical of ferc in this respect noting that the unequivocal public necessity that justifies overriding the mobilesierra presumption does not disappear as factor once the contract enters into force37 the court thus set forth what could be c onsidered stricter standard that must be met before ferc will adjust rates noting that contracts should not be adjusted or set aside absent unequivocal public necessity or extraordinary circumstanceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34173crs8 the ninth circuits zone of reasonablene ss test could have been interpreted as greatly extending fercs authority to adjust rate contracts pursuant to the mobile sierra doctrine the courts decision appear s to rein in any such extension of authority the court also took issue with fercs di smissal of the relevance of its own findings that some of the power selle rs in question had engaged in market manipulation the buyers had argued that thei r contracts were entered into as way to hedge against high prices on the open mark et and that these high prices were the result of market manipula tion ferc had dismissed this argument despite ferc staff report that had concl uded that abnormally high ope n market prices during the relevant time frame had influenced the terms of power purchase contracts the court found that given the conclusion of the st aff report ferc had erred in presuming the contracts were just and reasonable as of the date of this report ferc s not taken further action on this matter
