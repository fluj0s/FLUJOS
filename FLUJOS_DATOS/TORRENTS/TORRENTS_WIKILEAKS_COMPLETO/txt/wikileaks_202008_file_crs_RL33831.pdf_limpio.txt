debate in the house floor debate9 opponents of hr 5351 argued that the proposed repeal of il and natural gas s ubsidies 301 and 302 would raise gasoline prices and lead to higher energy costs generally further they contended that such repeal would cause decline in oil industry jobs also some opponents argued that the proposed 35 cap on the renewable energy production tax credit would severely impair the ability of the credit to stimulate the development of new wind farms10 proponents argued that the repeal would focus mainly on the five largest oil companies which have recently made historical recordb reaking profits and thus do not need the subsidies further they contended that the subsidies currently favor conventional fuels and that the bill would help to bring support into more equal balance proponents also argued that th incentives would spur the development of greater numbers of green jobs nd help reduce greenhouse gas emissions11 for more details about the propos ed revenue offsets see th discussion below and see crs report rl33578 energy tax policy history and current issues by salvatore lazzari revenue offsets debate title iii of hr 5351 proposes 180

natural gas produ cers irs 199 title v of the b ill would repeal that deduction for certain large integrated oil companies for other companies it would freeze the deduction at the 6 level this is scaledback version of the proposal in hr 2776 that would have re pealed the deduction for all companies13 the second proposal would restrict oil nd gas companies from claiming foreign tax credits by changing the method used to calculate foreign oil and gas extraction income this is identical to the provision in hr 277614 the revenue offset provisions are the most controversial part of the

5351 directly parallels the house and senate floor bates over similar proposals for hr 6 during the first session in those debates opponents argued that the reduction in oil and natural gas incentives would dampen production cause job losses and lead to higher prices for gasoline and other fuels proponents countera rgued that record profits show that the oil and natural gas incentives were not needed and that the new incentives would help spur the development of green jobs renewable electricity production the bill proposes four incentives for electricity production the production tax cred

the annual distribution of emissions permits or allowances each allowance would represent an authorization to emit one metric ton of carbon diox ide equivalent the bill would legislate an upper limit ceiling or cap that controls total missions by fixing the number of allowances that would be distributed each year thus the number of allowances would cap the annual emissions by covered entities each covered entity would be required to submit one allowance to epa for each ton of carbon dioxide equivalent that it emits the covered entities would include major processors and users of fossil fuels such as petroleum refiners and importers natural gas processing facilities and facilities that use more than 5000 tons of coal per year total emissions would be reduced by gradually shrinking the cap on the number of allowances distributed each year covered entity that would have high cost to reduce emissions could buy or trade allowances with an entity that has lower cost to curb emissions49 the bill would employ three ways of distributing the allowances initially in 2012 about 35 of the allowances would be distributed to entities in covered sectors about 35 would go to nonc overed entities such as state and local governments and about 30 would be sold through auctions in succeeding annual distributions the share of allowances to covered entities would gradually decline to zero meanwhile the annual share of au ctioned allowances would grow revenue from the auctioned allowances would be used for multiple purposes one purpose would be to accelerate deployment of ne w energy technologies

accomplishing the important goals the administration shares and the bill would raise approximately 62 trillion in constant dollars 118 trillion with inflation through the auction of ghg emission allowances to owners and operators of utilities and factories who would have to purchase allowances to stay in business51 alternatively the administrations document contends that several us programs
