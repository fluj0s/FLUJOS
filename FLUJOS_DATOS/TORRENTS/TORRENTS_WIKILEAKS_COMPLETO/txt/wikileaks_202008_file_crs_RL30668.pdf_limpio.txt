globalization often requires information about the economic output of various countries how those countries economies compare with one another and where the united states stands relative to the rest of the world this report provides summary of output measures explaining their strengths and weaknesses and various crosscountry comparisons it does not delve into any of several other measures of economic performance that also may be of use depending on the focus of particular line of inquiry although perhaps seemingly straight forward comparing the economic output of national economies can be complicated for several reasons first there are different indicators to choose from when contrasting national economies these include gross national product gnp per capita gnp purchasing power parity ppp per capita gnp and for contrasting purposes the human development index hdi each measure has relative strengths and weaknesses and one measure provides complete picture for comparative purposes second while all country data originate from national governments comparing them raises numerous problems the world bank is primary source for cross country economic and social data and is the source of data comparison used in this reportwith the exception of one table constructed from united nations data as single comprehensive source the world bank has many advantages standardization reliability and completeness perhaps most importantly using single consistent source when comparing national economies reduces the possibility of distortion from varying data collection and report methods that can occur when multiple sources are being used according to these measures the united states ranks first in total gross national product gnp tenth in per capita gnp fourth in per capita gnp adjusted for purchasing power and third using broader indicator of economic and social well being after discussing the merits of various output measures this report provides detailed comparison of economic output among the worlds economie s including tables summarizing gnp per capita gnp ppp gnp and hdi along with comparisons of selected countries by each category this report concludes with list of

frequently turns to crosscountry comparisons of economic performance in particular policymaking in this time of globalization often requires information on the economic income and output of various countries how those countries economies compare with one another and where the united states stands relative to the rest of the world this report responds to this interest by presenting selected indicators of economic output clarifying how they are measured and interpreted and providing comparative data among various countries it also presents one broader indicator of human development to highlight the fact that economic output although useful is limited as measure of economic and social well being1 according to these measures the united states ranks first in total gross national product gnp tenth in per capita gnp fourth in per capita gnp adjusted for purchasing power and third using broader indicator of economic and social well being statistical data sources international economic data is available from many reliable sources including the world bank wb the international monetary fund imf united nations the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd and others this report relies heavily on data from the world bank because it is frequentlycited source2 in addition even though it may appear at times that domestic source provides more current or accurate data us economic statistics for example the world bank is highly accurate crossnational source known for its standardized reliable and comprehensive information single consistent data series allows for meaningful crosscountry comparisons and the world bank offers several advantages in this regard because its data3 must be reported using common methodology and standardized procedureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30668crs2 4 ibid 5 ibid p 273 reflect world bank primary data collection efforts working with member country statistical sources incorporate information from other international organizations and research institutes such as the imf and oecd when necessary reflect collective professional judgement regarding data reliability and consistency particularly with some often smaller developing countries for which this would otherwise prove difficult allow for meaningful ranking of countries by various measures note of caution however these are rankings of order only the rankings alone do not necessarily provide complete indication of the relative strength or weakness of national economies despite the world banks concerted effort to provide consistent and accurate data collecting large quantities of information from many sources remains inherently problematic the world bank points to the many local factors limiting data usefulness noting that although international standards of coverage definition and classification apply to most statistics reported by countries and international agencies there are inevitable differences in coverage currentness and the capabilities and resources devoted to basic data collection and compilation4 when contrasting economic indicators derived from various countries it is important to realize that considerable effort has been made to standardize the data but full compatibility cannot be assured and care must be taken in interpreting the indicators5 care must also be taken in comparing figures collected by the world bank with those provided by other agencies mixing data from various reporting agencies may reflect different collection methods and basic sources and although the data may be equally accurate it may not be suitable for direct comparison data reported by separate agencies may vary because of differences in definitions methodology and presentation another source that this report uses is the united nations development programme undp this organization publishes the human development index hdi which is used as broad measure of development contrasted herein with narrower indicators of economic output as discussed later the rankings generated by the human development index can vary greatly from those of the other indicators in this reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30668crs3 measures of national economic output there are several indicators that can be used to compare economic output across countries two commonly used measures are gross national product gnp and per capita gross national product the world bank has also developed method called purchasing power parity ppp per capita gross national product another helpful measure in conducting crossnational comparisons is the undps human development index hdi since the hdi uses ppp gnp per capita as one of its variables it is related to these other measures of output but the comparison is expanded by adding two social factors life expectancy and education to provide broader although crude measure of comparative development the several measures are not interchangeable when comparing the output of different countries analysts must ensure that they are using identical figures from common source similarl national rankings vary from measure to measure for example the united states far outpaces all other countries in total gnp but ranks tenth in per capita gnp fourth in ppp per capita gnp and third in the hdi two other examples russia and gabon illustrate even more dramatically how ranking can vary depending on the measure used the following chart shows the ranking for each country in four different measures chart 1 economic performance comparison of russia and gabon russia gabon measure rank measure rank gnp 16thgnp 107th per capita gnp 97thper capita gnp 72nd ppp gnp 83rdppp gnp 89th hdi 62ndhdi 123rd source world bank and united nations hdi the variation evident in these rankings is the product of several factors in the case of russia the country remains one of the worlds largest economies with gnp ranking 16th but that gnp is spread across large population leading to relatively low per capita gnp however that is somewhat compensated for by the cost of living as shown by the higher ranking for ppp gnp furthermore the hdi rank indicates that russian quality of life is somewhat higher than what you would expect based on the per capita gnp ranking alone but considerably lower than the total gnp would seem to indicate in the case of gabon the difference between the gnp and per capita gnp ranks indicates that the country is producing more per person than other countries with similar gnp however the lower ppphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30668crs4 6 dornbusch rudiger and stanley fischer 1994

gabon is high in comparison to the per capita gnp perhaps most tellingly the hdi rank for gabon is much lower than the per capita gnp would lead one to believe it should be see table 6 page 15 for comparison of the top twenty countries ranked by overall gnp per capita gnp and per capita ppp gnp these cases emphasize the importance of looking to various economic indicators when comparing countries depending on which measure is used country may rank higher or lower on relative scale gross national product gnp gnp is the broadest measure of economic output by one nation it is the value of final goods and services produced by domestically owned factors of production within given time period6 it is reported as an annual rate particular countrys gnp is the sum of the output generated by domesticallyowned enterprises plus profits earned abroad by foreign subsidiaries of domestic parent companies and returned to the home country gnp also accounts for taxes less subsidies that are not counted as part of the production7 it does not include the profits generated by foreignowned corporations or individuals and taken out of the country the world bank uses the output approach to measure countrys gnp rather than the demand approach or total purchases plus inventory accumulation8 in broad terms this method measures the value added at each stage of goods production for comparative purposes the world bank converts all gnp figures into us dollars the bank uses its atlas method of conversion to minimize the impact of currency fluctuat ions9 instead of using the exchange rate of the dollar against particular countrys currency on given day the atlas method takes an average exchange rate over the previous three years to calculate the current value in dollars for the countrys gnp fluctuations in the dollars value can sometimes give the impression of growth or recession in foreign economies when in fact the changes are caused by variations in the dollars worth relative to the local currency see table 1 page 10 for an alphabetical listing of countries and their gnp see table 3 page 12 for country rankings by gnphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30668crs5 10 dornbusch rudiger and stanley fischer 1994 macroeconomics sixth edition new york mcgrawhill p 29 11 ibid p 2930 12 executive office of the president council of economic advisors 1992 economic report of the president washington dc gpo p 246gross domestic product gdp gdp is similar in nature to gnp but measures all production within the borders of one country formally defined it is the value of all final goods and services produced in the country within given time period10 usually one year production by all firms governments and individuals regardless of their national origin is counted in the gdp11 this means that the production of british companies and japanese citizens operating in the united states are measured as part of the us gdp similarly the production of american firms operating in brazil is not counted as part of the us gdp but as part of the brazilian gdp the united states began using gdp to measure domestic economic performance in december 199112 gnp and gdp both reflect the output of national economies in terms of market prices so inflation can distort the picture over the long run therefore when evaluating the growth in either gnp or gdp it is important to use figures that are adjusted for inflation known as real gnp or real gdp for international comparisons the adjustment for inflation is calculated using deflators published by the international monetary fund real gnpgdp and other adjustments both gnp and gdp measure the value of products that are bought and sold in the marketplace measuring only market transactions leads to undercounting because of the following gnp and gdp measure only the formal economy in most developed countries this is limited concern in many develop ing countries however the informal economy or the exchange of goods and services between individuals off the books plays an important role in and composes significant share of the actual economy there have been attempts to measure the contribution of the informal economy to national production but significant portion of some national economies goes unmeasured by gnp or gdp neither gnp nor gdp measures the value of services or goods that individuals provide for themselves if that same good or service is provided in the marketplace these measures do capture its value thus gnp and gdp fail to capture the output generated by self provision gnp and gdp also fail to measure the value of leisure time to consumers or the value of clean environment although these mayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30668crs6 13 executive office of the president council of economic advisors 1992 economic report of the president washington dc gpo p 248 14 world bank 2000 world development report 19992000 new york oxford university press p 274 15 executive office of the president council of economic advisors 1992 economic report of the president washington dc gpo p 246enhance the quality of life gnp and gdp do not reflect this value to individuals countries that receive high levels of foreign aid have infusions into their economy that are not measured by gnp or gdp thus the consumption level can be much higher than either of these measures of production would suggest the major difference between gnp and gdp is what is included in calculating the figures in technical terms net foreign factor income as noted above the us government now uses gdp to track the performance of the domestic economy the switch from gnp to gdp was made because gdp corresponds more closely to other indicators of domestic shortterm economic performance13 however the world bank continues to use gnp to make crosscountry economic comparisons14 this is important to note the comparison of one countrys gdp with another countrys gnp can present distorted picture especially if there is large difference in the level of income taken out of or brought into the two countries for some countries there is little difference between the level of gnp and gdp this is true in most industrialized countries such as the united states because domestic firms return approximately the same amount of income from abroad as foreign firms derive from the local economy for developing countries however there can be substantial difference between the two measures for two reasons some countries have many citizens who work abroad high levels of international earnings can cause gnp to be higher than gdp other countries have high levels of foreign investment in their economy with little or corresponding investment abroad this can lead to large profits being repatriated without the balancing effect of foreign earnings flowing back into the local economy in this situation gnp may be low in relation to gdp15 per capita measurement demographic factors can also complicate crosscountry economic comparisons contrasting the overall gnp of the united states 79 trillion with the next largest economy in the world japan 41 trillion shows that the us gnp is almost twice that of japans but this does not take into consideration that the population of the united states 270 million is roughly twice that of japans 126 million gnp is useful when considering geopolitical and strategic policies it is an indicator of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30668crs7 16 world bank 2000 world development indicators cdrom gnp per capita 1998 atlas method and ppp available at httpwwwworldbankorgdatadatabytopic

useful when considering questions of individual standard of living or marketing potential in these cases more accurate comparison between two countries is the amount of production per person this is called per capita gnp per capita gnp is derived by dividing the overall gnp by the population of the country using per capita figures allows meaningful comparisons between countries that vary greatly in population returning to the example of the united states and japan japanese per capita gnp is actually higher than that of the united states 32350 versus 29240 but neither country ranks first in per capita gnpjapan ranks seventh and the united states tenth in the world luxembourg has the highest per capita gnp with 45100 but obviously has little geopolitical power16 per capita gnp does have its shortcomings however it does not measure how well the production of particular country is distributed across its population how much an individual could purchase with the per capita gnp amount or the level of development in the country it also fails to reflect the differences in the quality of life enjoyed by the inhabitants of different countries although the per capita gnp of japan is greater than that of the united states housing costs major quality of life consideration are also much higher this to some extent negates the difference between the two countries other factors such as the cost of food clothing and commuting also escape the calculations of per capita gnp these differences in costs can be accounted for by adjusting gnp for differences in purchasing power see table 2 page 11 for an alphabetical listing of countries and their per capita gnp see table 4 page 13 for country rankings by per capita gnp purchasing power parity gross national product ppp gnp ppp gnp adjusts gnp to account for how much people can buy for their money in given country the ppp gnp can be divided by population to determine it on per capita basis instead of simply measuring total output the ppp gnp method attempts to gauge how much person would have to pay in the local currency for set basket of goods that amount is then converted to the equivalent value in us dollars sometimes also called international dollars so that analysts can make cross country standard of living comparisons this procedure compensates somewhat for the fact that exchange rates do not always accurately reflect differenc in relative prices ppp rates facilitate comparison of real price levels among countries17 ppp gnp per capita is crude measure although it does allow standard of living comparisons it does not accurately represent the actual amount of personal income in us dollars available in the foreign country it reflects how much it costs to buy set of goods in particular country or how much income the averagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30668crs8 18 for more on ppp gnp and other development measures crs report 97759 f comparing countries levels of development by jonathan sanford

does measure the comparative cost of living in various countries but still does not completely portray the amount of goods that individuals can purchase with their local currency salaries18 see table 5 page 14 for country rankings by per capita ppp gnp human development index hdi additionally this report includes listing of world ranking based on the human development index this measure developed by the united nations development programme undp is departure from the other measures discussed in this paper because it is not simple indicator of economic output and income nor is it world bank statistic it was originally developed as an alternative measure of development serving to supplement indicators such as gnp one of the hdis developers mahbub ul haq describes it as measure of the same level of vulgarity as gnp just one measurebut measure that is not blind to social aspects of human life as gnp is19 this approach emphasizes that economic factors are not the only factors that affect an individuals standard of living the hdi takes into account two other factors that play role in how well the average person lives in particular country20 the hdi incorporates three variables to estimate countrys standard of living life expectancy educational attainment and income life expectancy is measured as longevity from birth educational attainment is measured by joining the adult literacy rate with combined score for gross primary secondary and tertiary school enrollment ratios income is taken as per capita ppp gnp21 these values are then used to compute score between 0 and 1 for each country22 the closer to one on the scale the higher the level of development one way to apply the hdi is in concert with the per capita ppp gnp because per capita ppp gnp is part of the hdi index if country has higher hdi rank than per capita ppp gnp rank for example the undp concludes that the country is using its income resources efficiently to meet development goals ninetyseven of the 174 countries the undp evaluated ranked higher in the hdi than per capita ppp gnp conversely sixtynine of the countries had lower hdi rank than per capita ppphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30668crs9 23

higher standard of living23 because of the inclusion of other variables countries with similar per capita ppp gnp levels can have very different hdi scores on the other hand countries with widely different per capita ppp gnp levels can have similar hdi scores the undp acknowledges that the hdi is very rough estimator of countrys standard of living however the hdi is simple enough measure to allow meaningful comparison among countries without becoming bogged down in regional or cultural differences the undp has created other indexes to measure national standards of living in light of gender poverty and equality issues however the hdi is the most widely used of these indexes see table 7 page 16 for listing of countries ranked by hdi levels tables of national economic indicators the
