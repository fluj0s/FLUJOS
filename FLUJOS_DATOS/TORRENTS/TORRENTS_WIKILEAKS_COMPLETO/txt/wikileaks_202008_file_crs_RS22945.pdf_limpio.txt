including flood6 the assistance provided can be classified and will be discussed according to the type of applicant i nvolved 1 state or cal governments 2 private nonprofits and 3 i ndividuals and households the first two categories of applicants are generally eligible for repair and rebuilding assistance under 406 of the stafford act7 which authorizes assistance to repair facilities owned by state or local governments and priv ate nonprofits that provi critical services8 examples of such nonprofits include hospitals schools fire depar tments museums and shelters9 an applicant under 406 may also choose to receive slightly reduced inlieu contribution if it would be in the public intere st not to rebuild or repair the structure the third category of applicants individua ls and

househol ds are only required to get prospective flood insurance if they receive assistan ce for property located in an sfha obligation on the part of the recipient to prospectively maintain flood insurance on the property any flood damage incurred during any period in which flood insurance for such property has lapsed is not eligible for federa l disaster assistance the circumstances in which prospective flood insurance will be requi red are discussed below in the context of specific classes of recipients state and local governments section 311a of the stafford act requires all recipients of 406 assistance to obtain adequate insurance on repaired or rebuilt property for example imagine that city receives fl ood disaster assistance to rebuild damaged police station under 311a of the stafford act12 the city must promise to obtain and maintain flood insurance on that police station as condition of recei ving that assistance furthermore 311b makes that flood insurance prerequisite of future disaster relief if the policy subsequently lapses and second flood damages the police station that damage would not be eligib for assistance under 40613 under 311b disqualification for future disaster assistance is not limited to cases where the prior and current disasters are of the same variety assistance under 406 is unavailable in any type of major disaster if the applicant has not complied with all insurance requirements imposed as conditi ons of previous disaster assistance14 but only insurance related to the earlier disaster is required15 to extend the previous example police station initially damaged by fire must maintain fire insurance in order to receive assistance in any type of later disaster eg flood the police stations lack of flood insurance after the initial fire would not disqualify the property for assistance during the later flood private nonprofits since private nonprofits also r eceive disaster assistance under 406 the flood insurance requirements for private nonprofits that have previously received disaster assistance are the same as those for state and local governments discussed above if priv ate nonprofit has been damaged in flood and uses federal assistance to make repairs it must purchas and maintain flood insurance in order to remain eligible for future disaster assistance individuals and households section 311 does not pply to federal disaster assistance to individuals and households under 408 however individuals and households that have previously received flood disaster assistance under 408 may be subject to similar prospective flood insurance requirement in order to be eligible for future disaster relief16 the terms of this flood insura nce requirement are similar to the terms of 311 homes that were damaged in flood and repaired or replaced using federal disaster assistance must obtain and maintain sufficient flood insurance as ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22945crs4 17 individual and household flood victims may be eligible for special group flood insurance policy backed by the nfip this policy provides coverage for three years and disaster assistance may reimburse the premiums 44 cfr 206119d 18

chargeable rates for flood insurance policies based upon risk of flooding 21 the term community means any governmental tity with the authority to adopt and enforce flood plain management regulations

acquisition or construction purposes excludes stafford act assistance other than assistance under such act in connection with flood 42 usc 4003a4 emphasis addedcondition of receiving the assistance17 this purchase requirement operates independently of the nfias mandatory purchase requirement that may be triggered by the receipt of other types of federa l financial assistance18 individuals and households are only disqua lified from federal di saster assistance if the previous disaster and the current disast er are both floods home that was repaired after an earthquake and subse quently damaged by flood w ill not be denied assistance even if it was not covered by either flood or earthquake insurance policy at the time of the flood similarly home that is first da maged by flood but later damaged by an earthquake is also eligible fo r disaster assistance regardle ss of whether it is covered by flood insurance requirements in special flood hazard areas special flood hazard area sfha is an area that has been determined by the federal emergency management agency fem to have 1 or greater likelihood of flooding in any given year19 the risk assigned to an area impacts the cost of flood insurance policies20 for applicants under 406 of th stafford act flood insurance can also be prerequisite for disaster assistance within an sfha the importance of community participation under the nfia flood insurance policies may be provided within community unless that community participates in the nfip21 participation in the nfip requires community to enact adequate land use controls intended to limit or mitigate damage in the event of flood22 importantly the nfia also prohibits federal officers from authorizing financial assistance for acquisition or construction pur poses in an sfha if the community does not participate in the nfip23 the nfia also explicitly in cludes flood disaster assistance within the definition of financial assistance24 therefore flood victim in an sfha is only eligible for federal disaster assistance if the community participates in the nfip httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22945crs5 25 see 42 usc 4106a 44 cfr 206252b 26 42 usc 5172d 27 42 usc 5172c 28 42 usc 5155 29 see 54 fed reg 11614 all buildings and their contents in an identified flood plain will be treated as if they were fully covered by the standard flood insurance policy available through

participate in the nfip fema has interpreted federal law to prohibit any building assistance to affected state and local governments25 if the community is participating an applicant for 406 assistance may still be subject to reduction in assistance for failing to have sufficient flood insurance provided that an area has b een designated as an sfha for more than one year 406d reduces the amount of assist ance to an uninsured applicant by the maximum amount flood insuran ce policy would have provided26 inlieu contributions to uninsured facilities in an sfha are completely barred rather than reduced27 having flood insurance would not necessar ily increase the amount of assistance damaged structure could receive under 406 th is is because 312 of the stafford act mandates that assistance be reduced by the amount of insurance proceeds covered entity actually receives28 therefore structure with adequate flood insurance may not be subject to reduced assistance under 406d but would be subject to reduced assistance under 312 in this way 406d of the sta fford act essentially acts as presumption that any public structure in an sfha for mo re than one year will have flood insurance accordingly the amount of assistance is re duced as though such flood insurance was in place29 private nonprofits like state and local govern ments that suffer flood damage some private nonprofits are eligible for construction ssistance under 40630 private nonprofit applicants are also subject to the 406d flood insurance requirement if the damaged structure has been located in an sfha for more than one year31 the amount of the reduction in this case is the same as it is for similarly situated state and local governments but 406d3 of the stafford act app ears to create an exception for private nonprofits located in nonpartic ipating communities under this provision the reduction in assistance shall not apply if the only reas on the applicant does not have adequate flood insurance is that flood insurance is not available because the community does not participate in the nfip32 this exception appears to be in conflict with separate provision of the nfia that prohibits an assistance to facilities located in non participating community that is also located in an sfha33 i t i s p s s i b l t r d 406d3 as implicitly repealing the nfia insofa r as they conflict with each other thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22945crs6 34 the nfia prohibition was enacted as 202 of the flood disaster pr otection act of 1973 pl 93234 whereas 406d3 was enacted as part of the disaster relief and emergency assistance amendments of 1988 pl 100707 35 see eg crs report 97589 statutory interpretation genera l principles and recent trends at 10 2627 by george costello 36 44 usc 206252b 37 54 fed reg 11614 emphasis added 38 44 usc 206252b 39 44 usc 206110k2exception in 406d3 of the stafford ac t was enacted after the general prohibition located in the nfia34 section 406d3 also deals with particular factual scenario and type of assistance rather than the nfias broad language furthe rmore it was arguably incongruous for congress to make an excep tion to the reduction imposed by 406d if it also intended the blanket preclusion of ssistance under the nfia to apply in these situations in order to avoid reading 406d 3 as meaningless one could argue that it necessarily also created an exception to the general prohibition contained in the nfia35 nevertheless fema has c onstrued the exception in 406d3 as illusory fema regulations state that the nfia prohibition clearly prohibits any assistance to entities in nonparticipating commun ities that are also located in an sfha36 i n c m m n t s accompanying those regulations they also noted that private nonprofit facilities in special flood hazard areas which are not covered by flood insurance solely because of the local go vernments failure to participate in the nfip are exempted from the reduction in 406d however even t hough this exemption is reflected in current regulations it is misleading because the flood disaster protection act of 1973 prohibits federal assistance in special flood hazard areas of nonparticipating communities37 affected private nonprof it facilities may become retroactively eligible for assistance under 406 if the community later b ecomes participating community within six months of the flood disaster in which the facility was damaged38 individuals and households assistance to individua ls and households located within an sfha will not be limited solely because the app licant lacks adequate flood insurance however like state and local governments and privat nonprofits individuals and households that seek federal assistance to repair or rebuild housing located within an sfha are ineligible for disaster relief if the community does not participate in the nfip however fema regulations pe rmit individuals and households to be eligible if the community begins participating in the nfip within six months of flood disaster39
