neighboring states of georgia and turkey but relations with foreign states have often been guided by their stance regarding the nk conflict azerbaijan views turkey as major ally against russian and iranian influence and as balance to armenias ties with russia ethnic consciousness among some southern azerbaijanis in iran has grown which iran has countered through repressive actions azerbaijani

become part of armenia sparking ethnic conflict in december 1991 an nk referendum boycotted by local azerbaijanis approved nks independence and supreme soviet was elected which in january 1992

foreign minister bernard kouchner presented the foreign ministers of armenia and azerbaijan with draft text basic principles for the peaceful settlement of the nagornokarabakh conflict for transmission to their presidents the basic principles reflected agreements the two sides had reached during the minsk group talks as well as proposals by the cochairs on just and constructive solutions to the few remaining issues of contention the officials urged the two sides to accept the basic principles and work toward comprehensive peace settlement2 although the text was not released azerbaijani foreign minister elmar mammadyarov reportedly claimed that the principles uphold azerbaijans territorial integrity and nks autonomous status as part of azerbaijan armenias thenforeign minister oskanyan asserted on the other hand that the principles accord with armenias insistence on respecting selfdetermination for nk in march 2008 the peace process faced challenges from ceasefire breakdown along the nk front that reportedly led to some troop casualties and from the passage of resolution by the general assembly that called for armenia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw

crs5 peace process many observers suggest that progress in the peace talks may occur only after the current electoral cycle concludes in armenia and azerbaijan political and economic developments the azerbaijani constitution approved by popular referendum in november 1995 strengthened presidential power and established an 125member legislature milli mejlis with fiveyear term for deputies the president appoints and removes cabinet ministers the milli mejlis consents to his choice of prime minister submits budgetary and other legislation that cannot be amended but only approved or rejected within 56 days and appoints local officials the us state department viewed an august 2002 constitutional referendum as flawed and as doing very little to advance democratization in october 2003 ilkham aliyev handily won presidential election beating seven other candidates with about 77 of the vote protests alleging rigged vote resulted in violence and spurred reported government detentions of more than 700 opposition party instigators trials reportedly resulted in several dozen prison sentences in early 2005 the osce issued report that raised concerns about credible allegations of use in the trials of evidence derived through torture aliyev in march 2005 pardoned 114 prisoners including many termed political prisoners by the osce changes to the election law were approved by the legislature in june 2005 including some making it easier for people to become candidates for november 2005 legislative election azerbaijans central electoral commission cec declared that the ruling yeni azerbaijan party won 54 seats and independents 40 seats opposition party candidates were declared the winners in handful of constituencies the us embassy in azerbaijan issued statement urging the government to investigate and rectify some voting irregularities but also praised the election as evidence of democratization progress the cec and courts eventually ruled that 625 122 of precinct vote counts were suspect and repeat races were held in may 2006 in ten constituencies the opposition azadliq electoral bloc refused to field candidates in what it claimed were rigged elections osce monitors judged the repeat race as an improvement over the november election but stated that irregularities still occurred presidential election is scheduled to be held on october 15 2008 in early june 2008 the legislature approved changes to the electoral code including reduction of the presidential campaign season from 16 weeks to about 10 weeks some of the changes had been recommended by the venice commission an advisory body of the council of europe however other recommendations of the venice commission were not enacted including those on eliminating the dominance of government representatives on election commissions clarifying reasons for refusing to register candidates and reducing the number of signatures necessary for candidate registration the opposition azadliq freedom party bloc denounced the reduction in the length of the campaign season as an attempt to limit the exposure of opposition candidates and announced that it would boycott the election other opposition parties have rejected azadliqs call for boycott candidate registration has not begun many observers suggest that the opposition parties will not be able to agree on single candidate so that several leaders of these parties are likely to run incumbent president ilkham aliyev is widely expected to win reelection despite the recent sharp rise in inflation and reported food shortages crs6 according to the us state departments country reports on human rights practices for 2007 released march 2008 the azerbaijani governments human rights record remained poor and worsened in some areas in 2007 torture and beating of persons in police and military custody resulted in four deaths during the year there were cases of arbitrary arrest and detention particularly of members of the political opposition one positive sign was the january 2007 conviction of highranking police official on charges of running kidnaping murder and extortion ring ngos maintained that there were dozens of political prisoners media freedoms significantly deteriorated during the year some observers considered the imprisonment of several journalists to be politically motivated most were released by presidential pardon late in the year or their verdicts were overturned the government intimidated and harassed the media primarily through defamation suits and court fines for libel the government restricted freedom of assembly including by strictly limiting the areas in baku where rallies were permitted some religious groups complained about government harassment the collapse of the soviet union and the nk conflict in the early 1990s contributed to the decline of azerbaijans gdp by over 60 by 1995 the economy began to turn around in 19961997 gdp growth in 2006 and 2007 were estimated at more than 30 per year which contributed to rise in consumer price inflation to an estimated 16 in 2007 world factbook rising inflation may harm economic growth in 2008 the energy sector accounts for most gdp growth and the nonoil economy is fragile state oil fund is supposed to save oil revenues for future use but the government allegedly has extensively tapped it to alleviate budget deficits according to the international monetary fund strong political action is needed to counter the vested interests that discourage competition in several sectors of the economy3 up to onefourth of the

and estimates of 3048 trillion cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves in azerbaijan us companies are shareholders in three international productionsharing consortiums that have been formed to exploit azerbaijans caspian sea oil and gas fields including the azerbaijan international operating company or aioc led by british petroleum developing the azeri chirag and gunashli fields the united states backed the construction of large one million barrels per day capacity oil pipeline from azerbaijan through georgia to turkeys ceyhan seaport on the mediterranean the bakutbilisiceyhan or btc pipeline as part of azerbaijans economic development and because this route neither allows russia to gain undue control over azerbaijans resources nor forces azerbaijan to seek export routes through
