communities largely determine how funds will be used the efs program was not initially authorize d but continued to exist due to annual appropriations until 1987 when the stewart b mckinney homeless assistance act pl 10077 authorized it through fy19882 congress has since reauthorized the program three times first in 1988 for fy1989fy1990 pl 100628 again in 1990 for fy1991 fy1992 pl 101645 and

efs program at 1515 million pl 10990httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22286crs2 3 the national board has been part of the efs program since it originated in 1983 and its composition has remained the same 4 42 usc 11346 5 the guidelines were last updated in 1999 and can be found in volume 64 pages 2291222947 the national board publishes manual of its guidelines annually and makes it available to local boards and recipient organizations 6 the formulas published in the federal register are outdated the current formulas can be found at the national boards website httpwwwefspunitedwayorg the national board although funds for the efs program are appropriated to fema national board was established to carry out the program including the distribution of funds to local jurisdictions3 the board consists of designees from six charitable organizations united way of america salva tion army national council of c hurches of christ in the usa catholic charities usa united jewish communities and the american red cross and is chaired by representative from fema the efs programs authorizing statute gives the national board great d eal of discretion and itself contains only minimal requirements in addition to establishing the national board the statute requires the board to be audited annually release an annual report to cong ress disburse funds within three months of receipt and establish its own written guidelines the statute states that the written guidelines must include met hods to identify local jurisdictions with the highest need methods to determine the amount of funding to give to each local jurisdiction and eligible prog ram costs reporting requireme nts and requirement that homeless individuals be members of local boards4 these guidelines are published in the federal register5 identifying eligible local jurisdictions the national board distributes funds directly to eligible local jurisdictions which then determine how to allocate the funds among local service providers local jurisdictions must fulfill two requirements to be considered eligible first they must either be cities of 50000 or more or counties typically local jurisdictions are counties second they must have the highest need fo r emergency food and sh elter as determined by unemployment and poverty rates specifica lly the national board uses three measures to determine which local jurisdictions have the highest need those with 13000 or more residents unemployed and an une mployment rate of at least 47 those with between 300 and 12999 residents unemployed and an unemplo yment rate of at least 67 or those with 300 or more unemployed and poverty rate of at least 116 once the national board determines which local jurisdictions are eligible to receive funds it calculates the amount of funds each will receive by dividing the amount of available funds by the number of unemploye d within all eligible local jurisdictions combined to arrive at per capita rate of funding per unemplo yed person it then distributes the funds by multiplying the per capita rate by the number of unemployed persons in each eligible local jurisdictionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22286crs3 7

bailey 11 national board websitelocal jurisdictions that do not qualify fo r funding under one of the three measures of unemployment and poverty s ometimes referred to as dir ect funding may still receive funds through state setaside process the national board reserves portion of appropriated funds so that stat may either fund local juri sdictions that otherwise do not qualify for funds or provide dditional funds to jurisdictions that have already qualified in determining the portion of state setaside funds to allocate from the total the national board uses its discretion alt hough it attempts to minimize fl uctuations in funding from year to year and maintain c onstant ratio of per capita stat setaside funding to per capita direct funding7 the state setaside allows states to address pockets of homelessness or poverty help areas that undergo ec onomic changes like plan t closings or assist communities where levels of unemployment or poverty do not quite rise to the required threshold each state has setaside committee that develops its own criteria to determine which local jurisdictions will receive set aside funds however the committees must give priority to those jurisdictions that did not receive funding based on unemployment and poverty measures the national board allocates the state setaside funds based on ratio of each states average number of unemployed individuals in unfunded jurisdictions to the average number of unemployed in unfunded jurisdictions nationwide in fy2006 congress appropria ted 1515 million to the efs program of this just over 138 million was distributed to eligible cal jurisdictions according to measures of unemployment and poverty nd approximately 118 million was distributed as state set aside funding all 50 states the district of columbia puerto ric and four territories received funds totaling 150040072 see table 1 very little efs program funding is used for administrative expenses by statute more than 5 of the total appropriation may be used for administrative purposes8 local jurisdictions may use up to 2 of their funds and state setaside committees 05 of state setaside funds toward the 5 total9 the national board uses more th an 1 of funds for administrative expenses10 in the fy2006 appropriation for the program pl 10990 congress directed that more than 35 of the total award go to pay administrative expenses on average more than 25 of the tota l award is used for these expenses11 local boards and distribution of funds local boards determine which organizati ons within each jurisdiction will receive funds once the national board identifies cal jurisdictions that qualify for funds it directs the united way in each jurisdiction to convene local board if one does not already exist local boards are comprised of representatives from the same six charitable organizations that make up the national bo ard instead of fema representative however the head of the local government entity or designee serves at the local levelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22286crs4 12 42 usc 11332 13 federal register vol 64 p 22914 14 ibid p 22915 15 ibid p 22919 16 ibid pp 2291522916 17

not disaster related emergencies when congress created the program in 1983 th country was in the midst of recession and high unemployment17 so it gave jurisdiction to fema the nations emergency
