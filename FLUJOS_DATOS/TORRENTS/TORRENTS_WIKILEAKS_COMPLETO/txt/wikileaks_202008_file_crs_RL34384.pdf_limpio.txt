for noncompliance with federal pollution control requirements the us environmental protection agency epa reported that for fy2008 regulated entities committed to invest an estimated 118 billion for judicially mandated controls and cleanup and for implementing mutually agreed upon supplemental environmentally beneficial projects epa estimates that these efforts achieved commitments to reduce 39 billion pounds of pollutants in the environment primarily from air and water epa also assessed more than 195 million in civil and criminal fines and restitution during fy2008 nevertheless noncompliance with federal pollution control laws remains continuing concern the overall effectiveness of the current enforcement organizational framework the balance between state autonomy and federal oversight and the adequacy of funding are longstanding congressional concerns this report provides an overview of the statutory framework key players infrastructure resources tools and operations associated with enforcement and compliance of the major pollution control laws and regulations administered by epa it also outlines the roles of federal including regional offices and state regulators as well as the regulated community understanding the many facets of how all federal pollution control laws are enforced and the responsible parties involved can be challenging enforcement of the considerable body of these laws involves complex framework and organizational setting the array of enforcementcompliance tools employed to achieve and maintain compliance includes monitoring investigation administrative and judicial civil and criminal actions and penalties and compliance assistance and incentive approaches most compliance violations are resolved administratively by the states and epa epa concluded 2084 final administrative penalty orders in fy2008 civil judicial actions which may be filed by states or epa are the next most frequent enforcement action epa may refer civil cases to the department of justice doj referring 280 civil cases in fy2008 the us attorney generals office and dojs environmental crimes section or the state attorneys general in coordination with epa criminal investigators and general counsel may prosecute criminal violations against individuals or entities who knowingly disregard environmental laws or are criminally negligent federal appropriations for environmental enforcement and compliance activities have remained relatively constant in recent fiscal years total funding for epas enforcement activities in fy2008 was 5535 million many contend that overall funding for enforcement activities has not kept pace with inflation or with the increasingly complex federal pollution control requirements

enacted laws requiring individuals and facilities to take measures to protect environmental quality and public health by limiting potentially harmful emissions and discharges and remediating damage enforcement of federal pollution control laws in the united states occurs within highly diverse complex and dynamic statutory framework and organizational setting multiple statutes address number of environmental pollution issues such as those associated with air emissions water discharges hazardous wastes and toxic substances in commerce regulators and citizens take action to enforce regulatory requirements in variety of ways to bring violators into compliance to deter sources from violating the requirements or to clean up contamination which may have occurred prior to passage of the statutes implementation and enforcement provisions vary substantially from statute to statute and are often driven by specific circumstances associated with particular pollution concern given these many factors it is difficult to generalize about environmental enforcement this report focuses on enforcement of federal environmental pollution control requirements under the clean air act caa the clean water act cwa the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act c ercla or superfund and other statutes for which epa is the primary federal implementing agency 1 the report provides brief synopsis of the statutory framework that serves as the basi s for pollution control enforcement including an overview of the key players responsible for correcting violations and maintaining compliance implementation and enforcement of pollution control laws are interdependent and carried out by wide range of actors including federal state tribal and local governments the regulated entities themselves the courts interest groups and the general public figure 1 below presents the array of local state tribal and federal entities that constitutes the environmental

applied to sizeable universe of regulated entities by these multiple regulating authorities to ensure compliance general discussion of enforcement monitoring and response tools is included in this report followed by summary of recent federal funding levels for enforcement activities discussion of available enforcement data sources as well as tables illustrating examples of trends in enforcement activities is presented in the two appendices while this report touches on many aspects of environmental enforcement it does not describe every aspect and statute in detail rather the report is intended to provide broad perspective of environmental enforcement by highlighting key elements and general context for the range of related issues frequently debated information included in this report is derived from variety of sources these sources including relevant subjectmatter crs reports providing indepth discussion of specific topics and laws are referenced throughout several themes reflecting congressional concerns over time since epa was established in 1970 are reflected throughout the major sections of this report congress has conducted oversight primarily in the form of hearings on various aspects of the organizational infrastructure and operations designed to enforce pollution control statutes these aspects of enforcement have also been the topic of investigations by the government accountability office gao and epas office of inspector general epaoig 2 the federal governments oversight of and coordination with states in implementing and enforcing federal pollution control laws have been of particular interest to congress3 the following sections briefly discuss some of the key issue areas

pollution control statutes authorize substantial role for states state autonomy versus the extent of federal oversight is often at the center of debate with regard to environmental enforcement not unexpectedly given the cooperative federalism4 that is often used to characterize the federal state and tribal governments in the joint implementation 2 see for example senate committee on environment

and interactions among these key enforcement players often have been less than harmonious disagreements involving environmental priorities and strategic approaches and balancing the relative roles of compliance assistance with enforcement contribute to the complexity and friction that come with enforcing national pollution control laws other contributing factors include the increasing number of statutory and related regulatory pollution control requirements some with conflicting mandates and the adequacy of the resources available for their implementation the effects of variability among statutes coupled with variability in federal and state interpretations and regulations are often central to the debate some argue that this variability leads to too much inconsistency in enforcement actions from state to state region to region or between federal versus state actions others counter that this represents the flexibility and discretion intended by the statutes to address specific circumstances and pollution problems july 2007 gao report found that progress had been made regarding federal oversight of state environmental enforcement programs and that th ere had been improvements with regard to cooperative federalstate planning and priority setting however the gao concluded that greater effort was needed to achieve more consistency and effectiveness 5

the level of federal funding allocated to states and tribes to support effective enforcement of federal pollution control laws has also been longstanding congressional concern 6 in 2004 the environmental council of the states ecos7 reported 1 billion annual gap in the amount of funding needed by states to implement federal environmental laws based on survey of states8 gao reported that although funding overall for enforcement activities had increased somewhat it generally had not kept pace with the increasing number of mandates and regulations or with inflation 9 the adequacy of overall federal enforcement funding and personnel primarily within epa and the department of justice doj to ensure effective enforcement of environmental statutes has also been concern of congress staffing levels of criminal investigators at epa has been of particular recent interest for example congress enacted the 1990 pollution prosecution act pl 101593 requiring epa to hire and maintain 200 criminal investigators provision in the housepassed fy2008 interior and environmental agencies appropriations bill hr 2643 would have required epa to bring the total number of investigators up to the

subject of debate and highlighted in congressional hearings and legislation some additional areas of continued interest include whether there is need for increased compliance monitoring and reporting by regulated entities impacts of environmental enforcement and associated penaltiesfines on federal facilities budgets most notably the department of defense or dod and department of energy or doe how best to measure the success and effectiveness of enforcement eg using indicators such as quantified health and environmental benefits versus the number of actions or dollar value of penalties whether penalties are strong enough to serve as deterrent and maintain level economic playing field or too harsh and thus causing undue economic hardship how to balance punishment and deterrence through litigation with compliance assistance incentive approaches selfauditing or correction and voluntary compliance the effect of pollutant trading programs on enforcement and the level of funding required to effectively achieve desired benefits of enforcement these issues result from disparate values and perspectives among stakeholders but also from the factors that are the focus of this report the statutory framework those who work within this framework and the tools and approaches that have been adopted for achieving compliance with pollution control laws 10 title viadditional general

range of requirements which differ based on the specific environmental problem the environmental media eg air water land affected the scientific basis and understanding of public risks the sources of the pollutants and the availability of control technologies regulatory requirements range from health and ecologically based numeric standards or technologybased performance requirements to facilitylevel emission and discharge permit limits several of the pollution control laws require regulated entities to obtain permits which typically specify or prohibit certain activities or delineate allowable levels of pollutant discharges these permits are often the principal basis for monitoring demonstrating and enforcing compliance in recent years an increasing number of administrative initiatives have favored incentivebased regulatory approaches such as trading of permitted emissions which can affect the applicability of traditional enforcement approaches regulating authorities establish enforcement response and compliance assistance programs to address the enforcement provisions of particular federal pollution control statutes these environmental statutes typically authorize administrative civil judicial and criminal enforcement actions for violations of statutory provisions fo r example 309 of the cwa 113 of the caa and 1414 of the safe drinking water act sdwa cover enforcement provisions 13 as provisions for specific actions vary from statute to statute each epa regulatory program office establishes detailed criteria for determining what sanctions are preferable and authorized in response to given violation the statutes often provide level of discretion to regulators for addressing specific circumstances surrounding certain environmental problems or violations of national requirements enforcement of the many provisions of the major environmental laws across vast and diverse regulated community involves complex coordinated process between federal primarily epa and doj state tribal and local governments congress provided authority to states for implementing and enforcing many aspects of the federal statutory requirements citizens also play role in ensuring that entities comply with environmental requirements by reporting violations or filing citizen lawsuits which are authorized under almost all pollution control laws

authorize epa to delegate to states the authority to implement national requirements 24 for state to be authorized or delegated to implement federal environmental program it must demonstrate the capability to administer aspects of the programs requirements including the capacity to enforce those requirements delegated authority must be authorized under the individual statute and states must apply for and receive approval from epa in order to administer and enforce federal environmental programs while many federal pollution control laws provide authority for states to assume primary enforcement responsibilities there is significant variability across the various laws including as to standards states must meet and epa s authority in determining whether states are authorized or

specific provision while others do not authorize delegation at all for example 1413 of the safe drinking water act sdwa authorizes states to assume primary oversight an d enforcement responsibility primacy for public water systems25 and 402 of the clean water act cwa authorizes statedelegated responsibilities under that act to issue and enforce discharge permits to industries and municipalities under cercla superfund states are authorized to participate in the cleanup of waste from taking part in initial site assessment to selecting and carrying out remedial action and negotiating with responsible parties under fifra states may have primacy for enforcing compliance requirements contained on labels of registered pesticides but are not granted enforcement authority related to registering pesticides or pesticide establishments programs under other laws such as the toxic substances control act tsca do not provide authority for state delegation epa can also authorize state government officials to conduct inspections for environmental compliance on behalf of the agency subject to the conditions set by epa even if specific statute does not provide delegation authority however there must be authority under the specific statute for authorizing such inspections 26 even if delegation is authorized under federal statute states may opt not to seek delegation of particular environmental program or they may choose only to implement select requirement under federal law for example as of november 2007 45 states had obtained the authority to operate the national permitting program under 402 of the cwa but epa had only delegated authority to two states to operate the wetlands permitting program under separate cwa provision 404 27 majority of states have been delegated authority to implement and enforce one or more provisions of the federal pollution control laws28 authorized states generally implement the national laws and regulations by enacting their own legislation and issuing permits which must be at least as stringent as the national standards of compliance established by federal law states consider and approve environmental permits monitor and assess environmental noncompliance provide compliance assistance and information to the regulated community and the public conduct inspections and take enforcement actions local government authorities also may play role in permitting and monitoring for example epa has delegated authority to implement 112 of the clean air act caa to at least three county governments however local governments generally act within the context of assuring states requirements for example local authorities may incorporate land use and other issues as well as code requirements fire construction building safety plumbing etc in their consideration of permits more detailed discussion of the many facets of local authorities is beyond the scope of this report significant proportion of inspections and enforcement actions are conducted by the states comparable comprehensive data from the same or similar sources are not readily available for purposes of directly comparing enforcement activities in states

retained by epa in its databases eg not all states report relevant information into the epa databases reported data are not provided consistently from state to state and reporting requirements are variable from statute to statute epa is working to enhance and improve enforcement reporting by states the agency has developed and has been implementing its state review framework srf tool introduced in 2004 to improve its oversight of state enforcement programs29 under this srf tool epa representatives visit and evaluate each states compliance and enforcement program based on specified criteria through discussions and reports epa provides feedback to each state and based on its review outlines recommendations for improvement f ull implementation of srf was initiated by epa in july 2005 and the agency reported that reviews of all states and territories were completed in 2007 oeca continue s to work with its partners to conduct an evaluation implementing srf recommendations conducted subsequent reviews 30 nevertheless there are still perceived differences between states epa regions and epa headquarters in recent years ecos31 has served as forum to improve coordination and promote joint strategic planning between the states and epa in addition to other strategic planning tools epa and states established the national environmental performance partnership system performance partnerships or nepps32 in 1995 in an effort to improve the effectiveness of epastate coordinated environmental management under this system which includes elements of compliance and enforcement epa and states enter into individual partnerships performance partnership agreements to address jointly agreedupon priorities based on assessments of localized environmental conditions the partnerships can be broad in scope or comprehensive strategic plans and often serve as work plans for funding through epa grants absent delegation epa continues to enforce the federal law in the state although state can enforce its own environmental laws where not preempted by federal law even with delegation epa retains the authority and responsibility as determined by each statute to take enforcement measures generally taking action when there is violation of an epa order or consent decree or when the federal government deems state to have failed to respond to major violation in timely and appropriate manner additionally when noncompliance case involves an emergency or matters of potential national concern such as significant risk to public health and safety the federal government will typically intercede there are cases where states request the federal government to step in and other cases where the federal government on its own initiative acts on violations that are the subject of state enforcement action or settlement known as overfiling epa contends that overfiling occurs infrequently and that 29 epaoeca best practices and program improvements expected to result from srf

overfiling these provisions are not explicit in all the pollution control statutes and are limited to specific subsections and violations33 although overfiling of states enforcement actions has occurred under various pollution control statutes historically overfili ng of resource conservation and recovery act rcra violations has been the subject of considerable debate and litigation states have strongly objected to overfiling and the utility and extent of overfiling with respect to environmental enforcement has been the subject of considerable litigation debate and literature 34

than states have primary jurisdiction 35 indian tribes as sovereign governments can establish and enforce environmental programs under their own laws but must obtain approval from epa to administ er federal environmental programs on their land as with states some of the federal statutes authorize tribes36 with epa approval to assume responsibility for implementing certain federal pollution control programs to obtain epa approval tribes must demonstrate adequate authority and jurisdiction over the activities and lands to be regulated where there is approved tribal program epa exercises its federal authority and may undertake direct program implementation in some instances particularly when there are criminal violations epa may retain role in compliance and enforcement even when there is an approved tribal program in addition to the federal statutes tribal governments authority for environmental protection can arise from federal executive orders treaties and agreements with the united states andor state and local governments 37 some of which explicitly reserve rights pertaining to the environment when addressing environmental issues within tribal lands epa abides by the january 24 1983 american indian policy statement38 which reaffirmed the governmentto government relationship of indian tribes with the united states39 33 provisions of the clean water act cwa under

individuals play an important role in enforcing certain aspects of federal pollution control laws citizen participation specifically authorized by congress in many of the federal pollution control statutes occurs in several ways individuals can identify and report violations of the laws provide comments on settlements that are reached between the federal government and violators of the environmental laws in enforcement cases and initiate enforcement proceedings directly in response to alleged violations in addition individuals may bring actions against the epa for failing to execute nondiscretionary duties required under federal environmental laws 41 to further enhance public participation and reporting of potential environmental violations epa oeca introduced the national report

vary in their activities and operations and in sizeranging from small individual business operations such as drycleaners to facilities and operations that are part of large corporations and conglomerates regulatory agencies generally categorize regulated entities into minor and major emittersdischargers based on factors such as total earnings number of employees production volume and amount of em issions for purposes of implementing and enforcing the various statutes in certain circumstances some of the pollution control statutes make specific distinctions with regard to majo r and minor emittersdischargers designation of major generally applies to those entities that because of their size or operations have the potential to have significant impact on the envi ronment most of the statutes and accompanying regulations include authorities for reducing the stringency and in some cases providing exemptions from regulatory requirements to minimize their impacts on small businesses and operations there is readily available current comprehensive list and description of the complete universe of those who are regulated under all of the major pollution control statutes epa has been criticized for not adequately defining the regulated universe step that gao determined to be critical component necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of enforcement 44 epaoeca compiled data regarding the size of the regulated community in september 2001 and estimated total universe of more than 41 million45 although cited by epa subsequently from time to time most commonly in strategic planning documents the agency has not updated the estimate there are however data and information that provide some indications of the size and diversity of this universefor example in epa s primary enforcement and compliance databases see additional discussion in appendix epa s publicly available enforcement and compliance history online echo contains more than 880000 unique facility records for compliance with cwa caa and rcra these records are primarily based on permitted facilities another epa centrally managed database is the facility registry system frs which primarily identifies facilities sites or places subject to federal pollution control requirements it contains more than 15 million facility records the frs database is primarily based on permit information for cwa caa and rcra but includes information reported regarding cercla sites it does not include information indicating the universe regulated under other statutes in yet another source the ecos indicated that states reported that more than 3 million regulated facilities required state agency oversight for environmental compliance in 2003 46 the differences in the various sources are an

subject to the federal pollution control statutes51 and generally also must adhere to the environmental laws and regulations of the states and municipalities in which they are located to the same extent as others in the regulated community epa reported that it concluded 35 enforcement actions against federal agencies for alleged violations of federal pollution control laws during 2008 resulting in an estimated reduction of more than 17 million pounds of pollutants52 federal agencies are also subject to relevant requirements of executive orders53 regulating federal facilities under pollution control laws presents certain unique challenges although all are potentially subject to pollution control laws and regulations majority of federal agencies and their facilities are not involved in activities that would generally warrant compliance requirements according to epa facilities operated by dod and doe make up significant portion of the universe of major federal facilities 54 major federal facilities generally refer to those facilities that because of their size or operations have the potential to have significant impact on the environment complianceenforcement information for dod and doe is reported individually while other federal agencies are generally categorized together as civilian federal agencies55 gao observed that dod and doe together accounted for 99 of the federal governments environmental liabilities as of fy200456 most of these liabilities consist of the estimated cost to safely dispose of solid and hazardous waste generated from daytoday operations and to clean contamination from releases into the environment the major federal pollution control laws provide epa with authorities to enforce requirements and impose penalties at federal facilities that are not in compliance the federal facility 51 most federal environmental laws contain provisions that subject federal facilities to federal state and local requirements and allow such facilities to be sued just as nongovernmental entity in addition such provisions generally grant the president authority to exempt federal facilities from such requirements when in the paramount interest or less commonly the national security interest of the united states see clean air act 42 usc 7418 clean water act 33 usc 1323 resource conservation and recovery act 42 usc 6961 and safe

environmental enforcement tools to identify and correct noncompliance restore environmental damage and impose penalties intended to deter future violations compliance with pollution control laws is addressed through continuum of response mechanisms ranging from compliance assistance to administrative and civil enforcement to the stronger criminal enforcement the spectra of to ols which escalate in terms of their level of severity and intensity are authorized in each of the environmental statutes the following sections of this report provide brief overview of the various enforcement response mechanisms over the years epa and states have sought to effectively balance the provision of guidance and assistance to prevent violations or achieve compliance by regulated entities with federal pollution control requirements with the imposition of strong enforcement actions in response to violations some critics have depicted environmental enforcement as overly litigious or requiring unwarranted remedies others counter that actions are not pursued with enough rigor and frequency or that penalties are not severe enough to deter noncompliance epa officials have countered that in some instances the agency is relying more on settlements and focusing on requiring increased expenditures on pollution control technologies and that it is focusing judicial actions on larger and more complex cases that are expected to result in larger environmental benefits epa and states maintain considerable degree of flexibility in determining how to respond to potential violations to the extent authorized by individual statutes initially potential violation is identified through monitoring inspecting citi zen reporting or through selfreporting by the regulated entity as first step in the enforcement process unless an imminent danger or hazard has been determined epa and states may attempt to obtain corrective actions by simply issuing warning or notifying facility that minor violations may exist and granting reasonable time for compliance epa or state may then or sometimes as first step initiate civil administrative action under its own authority without involving the judicial process or file formal civil or criminal 58 judicial actions in court sanctions imposed whether through negotiated settlements or decisions by the court generally include required actions to achieve compliance and to correct environmental damage injunctive relief and may include monetary penalties and incarceration in the case of criminal violations 57 42 usc 6961 58 for persons who

violators undertake mutually agreedupon environmentally beneficial proj ects supplemental to other sanctions59 as noted epa states and the courts have considerable discretion in determining sanctions and remedies on casebycase basis so that th individual circumstances of each case are appropriately addressed majority of environmental violations are addressed and resolved administratively by states and epa and many of these cases are settled through negotiations between the government and the alleged violator for example during fy2008 epa issued 1390 administrative orders and filed 2056 administrative penalty order complaints in comparison during fy2008 epa filed 164 civil judicial cases with the court and 192 civil judicial enforcement cases were concluded 60 civil judicial cases constitute the second largest category of environmental enforcement actions historically judicial actions focused on violation of single environmental statute in recent years epa and states have increased the frequency of reliance on multimedia multistatute approach and multimedia investigations the number of administrative and judicial enforcement actions and penalties often fluctuate significantly from year to year these fluctuations are generally reflection of combination of factors including statutory deadlines new or amended requirements in response to new scientific information or amended and new regulations increased or decreased resources environmental priority changes at the federal or state levels and increased or improved monitoringreporting for example epa reported that the number of administrative penalty order complaints issued by the agency more than doubled from 2229 complaints in fy2005 to 4647 in fy2006 then declined in fy2007 to 2237 and to 2056 in fy2008 61 additionally the total dollar amount of penalties collected in given year could reflect the completion of one or two large cases for example epa reported that single case accounted for 62 of the total civil penalties assessed for fy2004 illustrations of the frequency of enforcement actions by type over time are presented in the appendix this appendix also includes illustrations of administrative and judicial penalties assessed over time by statute

environmental laws include the compilation of monitoring data and inspection and evaluation of the activities of the regulated community to determine who is complying with applicable regulatory requirements and permit conditions and who is not compliance monitoring evaluations and investigations all serve to identify violations and provide insights into potential priority issue areas that may need to be addressed more broadly monitoring and reporting can be both media programbased eg air water waste and sectorbased eg industrial mobile source utilities and are often included in permit requirements data reported and obtained as well as observations and evidence collected by inspectors enable epa and states to identify specific environmental problems and determine whether facility is in compliance the information and evidence could eventually be used in an enforcement action the mere collection of information or threat of inspection itself often creates an awareness of the regulators interest and can encourage compliance 59 see the discussion later in this report on supplemental environmental projects seps 60 epaoeca epa fy2008 compliance and enforcement annual results

used differently by the agency and states depending upon the statute the nature of the pollutants and the types of facilities being regulated selfmonitoringreporting most environmental laws require typically through permitting regulated entitiesfacilities to monitor and record their own compliance status and report some or all of the tracking results to the responsible regulating authority in addition to informing the regulators selfmonitoring also allows company to measure its performance and evaluate its strategies for achieving or maintaining compliance review of records regulatory agencies review data and information reported or otherwise compiled and collected full and partial inspectionsevaluations 62 individual facility environmental inspections conducted by epa regional staff and the states are the primary tool used by regulators for initial assessment of compliance through sampling emissions testing and other measures inspections examine environmental conditions at facility to determine compliance or noncompliance with specific environmental requirements and to determine whether conditions present imminent and substantial endangerment to human health and the environment inspectionsevaluations can be conducted all at once or in series of partial inspections area monitoring area monitoring looks at environmental conditions in the vicinity of facility or across certain geographic area examples of methods used for area monitoring include ambient monitoring and remote sensing according to the epa s most recent reported trends data total of 20000 epa enforcement inspections and evaluations were conducted under the various statutes during fy2008 63 although most inspections are carried out by the states annual data for the total number of inspections conducted by states are not readily available due to datareporting variability and other limitations based on subset of states surveyed ecos reported that roughly 136000 compliance inspections were conducted by states in 2003 for the major federal environmental programsair drinking water surface and groundwater hazardous waste and solid waste64 the total number of inspections reported by ecos does not account for all inspections conducted by states under federal pollution control programsfor example inspections under fifra are not included in reports to epa by states under the pesticide enforcement grant program states tribes and territories reported between 90000 and 100000 fifra inspections each fiscal year for fy2006 and fy2007 these fifra activities typically administered by states departments of agriculture are not reflected in the epa or the ecos totals to put the ecos number of inspections into pe rspective in 2003 the ecos survey identified 440000 regulated facilities under these five major environmental programs epas facility 62 the cwa requires evaluations instead of investigations which include reviewing reports records and operating logs assessing air pollution control devices and operations and observing visible emissions or conducting stack tests 63 epaoeca epa fy2008 compliance and enforcement annual results report december 2008

majority of environmental pollution control violations are addressed and resolved administratively by states and epa wit hout involving judicial process epa or state environmental regulatory agency may informally communicate to regulated entity that there is an environmental problem or it may initiate formal administrative action in the form of notice of violation or an administrative order to obtain compliance an administrative order imposes legally enforceable requirements for achieving compliance generally within specified time frame and may or may not include sanctions and penalties an initial step in the enforcement process is often notice of violation or in some instances warning letter warning letters are issued mostly for firsttime violations that do not present an imminent hazard these notifications are intended to encourage regulated entities to correct existing problems themselves and come into compliance as quickly as possible according to epa in many cases these notices are not escalated to further formal enforcement action because facility corrects problems and returns to compliance in response to the notice through administrative enforcement actions the epa and states may 1 require that the violator take specific actions to comply with federal environmental standards 2 revoke the violators permit to discharge andor 3 assess penalty for noncompliance as indicated previously administrative actions frequently end in negotiated settlements these mutually agreedupon resolutions are typically in the form of consent agreement or final administrative orderpenalty according to epas fy2008 annual results during fy2008 epa initiated 1390 administrative compliance orders and 2056 administrative penalty order complaints epa imposed penalties in 2084

activities for environmental agencies and programs in the state and not always to fund the states general treasury in certain cases where the federal government has led the enforcement action state or states involved in the action may share resulting civil monetary penalties to the extent that the division is permitted by federal state and local law number of critical factors must be considered in accordance with epa guidance 84 when determining division of penalties including the states active participation in prosecuting the case and its authority to collect civil penalties epas guidance emphasizes that an agreement to include division of civil penalties with states must be completed prior to issuance of final settlement order or consent decree the several statutes establish various factors to be considered in determining penalties 1 the magnitude of environmental harm and the seriousness or gravity of violation 2 the economic benefit or gain to the violator as result of illegal activity noncompliance including the gaining of competitive advantage by the delaying or avoidance of pollution control expenditures that have been incurred by those in compliance 3 violation history of the violator and 4 in some circumstances the ability of the violator to pay other factors such as the degree of cooperation by the violator whether the violation is selfreported or the extent to which immediate action has been taken by the violator to mitigate potential harm may also be considered precedents in previous cases involving similar violations are also consideration when determining penalties the federal pollution control statutes include civil administrative and judicial penalty assessment authority and limits which are to be considered by aljs or the courts in determining the appropriate penalty figure a3 in the appendix presents examples of dollar amounts of civil administrative civil judicial and criminal penalties assessed by epa for the 20year period 80

afford compliance requirements and penalties the latter models vary depending on whether violator is an individual municipality individual facility or business entity small business large corporation or conglomerate partnership findings of limited ability or inability to pay are one factor under which an enforcement case may be settled for less than the economic benefit of noncompliance the models

refused to allow epa to enforce judicially against other federal agencies though case law has consistently been to the contrary in contrast with epa enforcement there is longer serious doubt that the

to achieve and maintain compliance and imposing appropriate sanctions and penalties enforcement settlements may also include supplement environmental projects seps91 seps are projects that provide environmental and human health benefits that violator may voluntarily agree to undertake in exchange for mitigation of penalties project must be related to the violation and cannot be an activity the violator is legally required to take to achieve compliance penalties are to be mitigated by sep only during settlement negotiation prior to imposition of the final penalty epa has established seps policy and developed guidance for their legal requirements and applicability and has specified eight categories of acceptable projects 92 these include pollution prevention public health and emergency and prep aredness planning epa reported that 188 civil settlement cases during fy2008 included seps at an estimated value of 390 million93 the incorporation of seps into enforcement actions has become more commonly used enforcement tool in recent years particularly by federal regulators because of the potential for direct environmental benefit from such projects versus the use of monetary fine or penalty alone some states with administrative penalty au thority are also employing the use of seps in their settlements94 although these projects are required to be supplemental to other requirements some contend that in practice inclusion of seps may result in lower monetary fines the extent to which specific seps may have resulted in reduced monetary fines and penalties is not easily calculable

the concept of environmental justice has been controversial topic of debate among industry and public interest groups and continues to be concern highlighted in legislation and congressional hearings during the 110th congress hearings have been held by committees in the house and the senate95 and legislation has been introduced including hr 1972 the community environmental equity act hr 4652 the environmental justice access and implementation act of 2007 companion bills hr 1103 and s 642 the environmental justice act of 2007 hr 5132 and s 2549 the environmental justice renewal act and hr 5896 and s 2918 the environmental justice enforcement act discussion of the full scope of issues and concerns regarding environmental justice is beyond the scope of this report however the following discussion briefly highlights environmental justice in the context of enforcement and compliance the terms environmental justice or injustice nd environmental equity or inequity may be interpreted broadly to describe the perceived level of fairness in the distribution of environmental quality across groups of people with different characteristics in this sense the environmental impact of any human activity might be evaluated to determine the distribution of environmental amenities and risks among people categorized according to any population characteristic including gender age race place of residence occupation income class or language in the political context however emphasis generally is more on the distribution of health risks resulting from exposure to toxic substances in residential or occupational environments of different racial ethnic or socioeconomic groups the 1994 executive order 12898 federal actions to address environmental justice in minority populations and lowincome populations directs each federal agency to make achieving environmental justice part of its mission 96 epa is the federal agency with lead responsibility for implementing the executive order

regarding implementation and enforcement of federal environmental requirements has been an emphasis historically on command and control approach in response to these criticisms since the 1990s epa and states have relied increasingly on compliance assistance to help the regulated community understand its obligations to prevent violations and reduce the need for enforcement actions as well as to assist violators in achieving compliance many states have advocated compliance assistance and developed assistance programs designed to address specific environmental issues at the local level 102 epas office of compliance oc within oeca has introduced number of compliance assistance programs many of them developed in conjunction with support from the regions states and tribes103 each epa region has designated compliance assistance coordinator who serves as an expert within the region on compliance assistance priorities strategies and performance measurement the coordinators work with subjectmatter experts in the regions and at headquarters in the development of compliance assistance guides and workshops and contribute to other assistance activities such as conducting compliance assistance visits 104 in addition to providing compliance assistance across the individual pollution control statutes sectorbased assistance is also provided developed and introduced in partnership between epa states academia environmental groups industry and other agencies the national compliance assistance centers provide sectorspecific assistance 105 there are currently 15 sectorspecific

incentive approaches has been evolving incentives generally are policies and programs that may reduce or waive penalties and sanctions under specific conditions for those who voluntarily take steps to evaluate disclose correct and prevent noncompliance examples include selfdisclosure programs and related tools such as environmental audit protocols environmental management systems and other innovation projects and programs designed to achieve environmental benefits one of the earliest formal epa incentive approaches is the epa audit policyincentives for selfpolicing discovery disclosure correction and prevention of violationsin effect since 1995107 under the policy certain violations are voluntarily reported after being discovered through selfaudit in many cases epa eliminates civil penalties and may offer not to refer certain violations for criminal prosecution in early 2007 epa solicited comments on the question of to what extent if any the agency should consider providing incentives to encourage new owners of recently acquired facilities to discover and disclose environmental violations and to correct or prevent their reoccurrence108 more recently to further promote compliance through the use of various incentive approaches epa has encouraged incentive approaches as part of its core program guidance included in the oeca fy2009 national program manager guidance

skepticism by those who favor more traditional enforcement critics are concerned that incentive and voluntary approaches subtract resources from an already limited pool of enforcement resources epa

additional resources through partnerships aspects of epas incentive approaches have been the subject of reviews by epaoig and gao 110

resources needed by epa doj and the states to effectively enforce the major federal environmental pollution control laws is often highlighted during congressional debate of fiscal year appropriations

mentioned provision included in the housepassed fy2008 interior and environmental agencies approp riations bill hr 2643 that would have required epa to hire criminal investigators to bring the total number of investigators up to the statutory requirement of 200 pursuant to the pollution prosecution act of 1990 111 the provision was not included in the fy2008 consolidated appropriations112 the

effectiveness of current and past enforcementcompliance activities can be quite complicated discussion throughout this report highlights the difficulties inherent in characterizing the many facets of environmental enforcement at macro level and identifies many of the factors that may contribute to its perceived successes and shortcomings however several indicators do provide insight into better understanding of the complexities associated with elements of enforcement such as the vastness and diversity of the regulated community the multiplicity of the activities and priorities across many regulating entities and variability across statutes since the establishment of epa in 1970 congress has been interested in number of crosscutting issues associated with the enforcement of pollution control statutes and regulations as reflected in provisions of enacted and amended environmental legislation over time congressional interest remains heightened particularly with regard to the substance of intergovernmental relations epastate relations and fiscal requirements congresss involvement with these issues could take several directions one likely result could be oversight hearings alternatively relevant appropriations legislation may contain provisions or language regarding funding for specific enforcement activities congressional interest might focus on statutory approaches to establish changes in the epastates partnership such as legislation similar to past proposals concerning refinement of the national environmental performance partnership system p erformance partnerships or nepps and the associated grants award process congress may also consider other statutespecific legislation to address other longstanding concerns that affect enforcementcompliance activities the regulated community public interest groups federal and state officials and congress are often divided on whether to pursue legislation that would further expand or constrain enforcementcompliance they are similarly divided with respect to proposals that would expand states authority for implementing and enforcing certain aspects of the major federal pollution control laws views and congressional involvement with respect to these issues are likely to evolve in the years ahead 115 all dollar amounts are adjusted to 2003 basis for inflation ecos budget survey b udgets are

monitoring data are used to manage the compliance and enforcement program and to inform the public of enforcement actions taken and penalties imposed epa and the states collect and maintain complianceenforcement data in many forms ecos reports that states collect about 94 of environmental quality data contained in epas databases primarily from stateissued permits and monitoring programs116 information is often entered into multiple databases or transferred from state databases historically the databases were often incompatible making cross mediastatute queries difficult in recent years epa has been working to integrate several of the individual databases to allow more cross referencing of compliance data by regulators and to provide querying capabilities to the public 117 epa compiles data from the various databases and provides various statistics in the form of annual accomplishment and multiyear trends reports118 reporting has traditionally focused on statutebystatute results including actions initiated and concluded and penalties and other sanctions assessed how effectively the reported information can be used as an indicator of environmental progress and the impacts of environmental enforcement has been an issue of some debate and questioned in review s conducted by epaoig and gao 119 critics contend and epa has long recognized that while somewhat indicative of the failure to comply with environmental requirements counting enforcement actions alone bean counting does not provide complete measure of the effectiveness of the national environmental enforcementcompliance program epa has initiated efforts to expand its reporting by including estimates of environmental benefits pollution reduction and impacts avoided additionally there have been efforts to account for states contributions the fy2006 oeca accomplishment report for the first time contained brief summary of states enforcement accomplishments as reported by ecos
