flights had become unnecessarily confrontational fco director general for defence and intelligence mariot leslie told acting us john rood may 16 after reiterating the political sensitivities surrounding the sovereign base areas sba on cyprus and the public and parliamentary pressure on hmg to maintain sovereign control of its territories refs c f leslie noted the usg use of akrotiri had gotten sloppy she reiterated the value hmg placed on usuk cooperation but noted hmg was now asking the usg to comply with the same clearance procedures hmg itself used for intel flights she made attempt to hide her annoyance that the fco working level had ratcheted up conditions as outlined in ref leslie distinguished between ordinary intel flights and those that were also operational such as cedar sweep but maintained hmg insistence that all intel flight clearances must be sought in govgov channels rather than the milmil channels used to date end summary 2 snf fco director general for defence and intelligence mariot leslie told acting us john rood may 16 that usuk talks on clearances for dod intel flights had become unnecessarily confrontational she noted that hmg desperately needs the sba for its own intelligence gathering and operations and was committed to keeping them available to the us and france however the cypriots are hypersensitive about the british presence there and she said could turn off the utilities at any time that combined with the toxic mix of the rendition flights through diego garcia has resulted in tremendous parliamentary public and media pressure on hmg to maintain sovereign control of its territories especially akrotiri leslie noted that on couple occasions recently the required process had not been followed process hmg requires of its own intel flights she explained that because cedar sweep was an operational flight as well as intelrelated all sorts of additional uk legal obligations come into play including the eu convention on human rights uk law mandates dualkey approach for approving intel flights requiring both mod and fco assent to ensure nothing unlawful is approved 3 snf leslie expressed annoyance at the additional conditions conveyed by the fco working level on may 14 ref noting she had not been aware beforehand that such message would be conveyed in fact she regretted the tenor of the discussions had turned prickly and underscored hmg appreciation for usuk military and intelligence cooperation to set the record straight she clarified that the followon letter from mod dated may 9 emailed to pmat action team may 19 was merely meant to lay out that the hmg approval for cedar sweep was based on the us assurance that the operation had been requested by the government of lebanon and was being conducted in permissive environment the letter was notnot intended to question whether the us had obtained full gol vice just mod approval for the operation or to put any additional conditions on it furthermore regarding the may 14 expectation that the us must follow up on all cases of alleged terrorists who were detained as result of cedar sweep intel leslie said that was not at all what hmg intended to convey to the usg in fact ministers had merely wanted to impress upon the usg that they take the human rights considerations seriously leslie said as long as the usg understood this the issue needed further discussion rood affirmed that the message was received 4 snf leslie however was very frank that hmg did object to some of what the usg does eg renditions and therefore does have some redlines primarily all requests for intel flights must come in writing from embassy london to mr will jessett at mod phone calls demarches and nonpapers will not suffice aus rood pushed hard to keep the process in milmil channels but leslie was insistent that foreign secretary miliband believed that policymakers needed to get control of the military leslie mandated that for ordinary intel flights the gridchart format that eucom previously used would be acceptable if another column was added on the right that offered very simple explanation andor justification for the flight eg in support of the camp david accords but leslie drew sharp distinction between ordinary intel flights and those from which the usg shares intel with third parties for the latter she said the more detailed submission discussed in ref will be required if short notice approval were required embassy london should submit it in writing and hmg would do its best to push it through 5 snf polmiloff followed up with mod contact steve gillard in will jessetts office may 19 to confirm mods understanding of leslies explanation gillard had not received readout of the leslierood meeting but confirmed that her instructions would be authoritative he committed to closing the loop with mod and fco working level contacts recognizing that dod had already done much of the work on the expanded submission that now seemed unnecessary for most of the flights gillard welcomed more rather than less information polmiloff expressed concern that submitting unnecessary information could set precedent and raise unrealistic expectations in hmg for what the usg would submit in the future gillard acknowledged this concern and noted he would welcome any additional information offered with letter caveating that in the spirit of cooperation additional information was being submitted that will not be included in future requests for ordinary intel flights comment 6 snf aus roods intervention has allowed us to obtain authoritative albeit belated guidance on hmgs requirements for dod flight clearances despite forceful arguments to keep the approvals process in milmil channels hmg was adamant that requests will have to come from embassy london either the political or defense attache sections to mr will jessett at mod for ordinary intel flights this will involve osd and statecleared instructions for embassy london to deliver to mod the grid normally constructed by eucom on trimester basis but with an additional column containing an explanationjustification for the operation embassy also recommends that another column be added explicitly stating whether the operation entails sharing intel with third parties ideally the answer should be for every operation on the grid but the column would allow embassy london to ensure only the ordinary intel flights are contained therein for flights that involve intel sharing with third parties more detailed submission as described in ref will be required we understand that dod has already compiled this additional information as result of the instructions we received at the working level we recommend proceeding with the more detailed submission for all flights but including cover letter noting that the additional information is provided as courtesy and does not set precedent for future submissions 7 u aus rood has not had the opportunity to clear this cable visit londons classified
