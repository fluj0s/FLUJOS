programs in haiti including communal kitchens and school feeding programs haiti however will have to compete for food aid allocations with other larger countries that also have pressing n eeds such as afghanistan and sudan while responding to haitis emergency f ood needs is the immediate priority some advocates have urged congress to consider funding programs to promote agricultural development in haiti as longterm solution to the countrys food insecurity they have recommended us support for new initiatives aimed at diversifyi ng food production and supporting agricultural conserva tion and infrastructure projects9 many analysts also point to the large haitian diaspora as possible avenue to promote rural development projects possibly through shortterm consultancies with the haitian government the hope act trade prefer ences for export promotion to assist haiti with rebuilding its econom by encouraging investment and job creation in the once vibrant apparel sector the 109th congress passed the haitian hemispheric opportunity thr ough partnership encouragem ent in december 2006 hope i the act provided dutyfree treatment for select apparel imports from haiti that are made in part from less expensive third country eg asian yarns and fabrics provided haiti meets eligibility criteria related to labor human rights and antipoverty policies early assessments of hope i were disappointed in the progress made to enhance the effectiveness of these provisions the 110th congress expanded them in june 2008 when it passed the food conservation and ener gy act of 2008 hr 6124pl 110246 the farm bill title xv of which includes the haitian hemispheric opportunity through partnership encouragement act of 2008 hope ii10 support for the duty preferences recognizes the dominant role of the us market as the main destination for haitian apparel exports apparel assembly is also haitis core export sector and essential for its economic wellbeing because it generates up to 80 of the countrys foreign exchange used to fina nce haitis large food import bill among other needs in 2007 apparel cons tituted over 80 of haitis tota l exports and 93 of exports to the united states 81 knit 12 woven ar ticles so the sector provides one potential avenue for employment growth the pref erences also support textile firms in the dominican republic which have an expandi ng coproduction arrangement with haiti the hope acts differ from other trade arrangements with the caribbean that emphasize apparel bene fits unlike apparel provisions in the caribbean basin trade partnership act cbtpa of which haiti is beneficiary country and the dominican republiccentral americaunited states free trade agreement caftadr which does not include haiti those in the hope acts permit duty free treatment for apparel imports in limited quantities ssembled or knittoshape in haiti with inputs from third party countries or those outside the region that are not in trade arrangement orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22879crs5 agreement with the united states the competitive advantage to haitian firms derives from their ability to use less expensive asia n inputs and still receive dutyfree treatment to the extent that this advantage is in pl ace for an extended period of time it is intended to encourage increased investment in the apparel assembly business in haiti contributing to growth in output employment and exports hope i provided three major tariff pref erences for limited amounts of articles imported directly from haiti 1 quotas for the dutyfree treatment of appa rel articles that meet the regional valueadded c ontent rule 50 rising to 60 effectively allowing the remaining portion of inputs to be sourced from outside the region 2 additional quotas for dutyfree treatment of limited amount of woven apparel that cannot meet the 50 60 valueadded rule allowing all inputs for these articles to be sourced from anywhere in the world and 3 single transformati on rule of origin that allows for dutyfree treatment of brassieres made from components sourced anywhere in the world provided the garments are cut and sewn or otherwise assembled completely in haiti the united states or both hope i however did not result in dramatic growth in haitian textile exports to the united states inhibited by the limited time frame and complicated rules of origin further us textile producers objected to the rules contending that because they permit use of thirdparty fabrics and other inputs they effectivel displace jobs in the united states and the caribbean with those in asia as an alternative the industry suggested allowing preferences only for goods longer produced in the western hemisphere us textile producers also found the ru of origin to be vague and difficult to enforce and raised concern that the tariff preferen ces could divert pparel production to iti from countries in the region that are partners to us reciprocal trade agreements proponents of the hope ii responded that it would clarify rules of origin and simplify other implementation problems they further argued that the preferences are quantitatively limited apply to very small portion of us apparel imports and are in place for only specified period of time presenting little threat to larger us and regional textile producers support for enhancements in hope ii rested on arguments that these benefits outweighed pot ential costs and therefore would be constructive part of an ongoing multifaceted response to haitis development needs the hope ii act enhances the tariff preferences by extending them for 10 years through september 30 2018 making the rules mo re flexible and simpler and expanding duty free treatment for us apparel imports wholly assembled or knittoshape in haiti specifically hope ii 1 maintains the valueadded rule in hope i freezing the cap on total apparel imports and keeping the original fiveyear sunset provision because the rule was little used and is highly complicated 2 increases the cap for select woven apparel imports 3 provides new cap for select im ports of knit apparel with significant exclusions 4 adds new uncapped 3 for 1 earned import allowance eia that allows dutyfree treatment of imports made from qualifying inputs eg fabrics made from us or countries party to us trade agr eements and articles ma from nonqualifying inputs eg from asian fabrics in 3 for 1 ratio 5 includes ne w uncapped benefit for apparel using nonus fabrics deemed to be in short s upply 6 expa nds the single transformation rule from br assieres to apparel artic covered under caftadr headgear and select sleepwear luggage and handbags and 7 allows for direct shipment of apparel articles sent from haiti to the dominican republic for finishinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22879crs6 11 for details on the hope acts see crs report rl34687 the haitian economy and the hope act by j f hornbeck 12 international monetary fund

hope ii also requires that haiti create new apparel sect or monitoring program labor ombudsman to ensure compliance with internationally recognized core labor standards11 debt relief some members of congress also pushed to provide immediate debt relief to haiti to help the préval government free up limited fi scal resources to address the food crisis according to the haitian central bank haiti s foreign public debt totals roughly 17 billion large portion of which is owed to multilateral institutions such as the world bank idb and international monetary f und imf march 2008 imf report projects that the haitian government will make debt service paym ents of roughly 717 million in 200812 on april 16 2008 the house unanimously passed an amendment to the jubilee act hamdt 993 to hr 2634 that r ecommends immediate cancellation of haitis outstanding debts to the international fina ncial institutions companion bill s 2166 has been introduced in the senate hearings were held but the bill is still in committee the jubilee act seeks to change multilateral lending practices and cancel debt for many lowincome countries critics charge that providing immediate cancellation of haitis debt is probably unnecessary because haiti is already advanc ing through the heavily indebted poor countries hipc debt relief process they assert that haiti similar to other heavily indebted countries should be encouraged to adopt sound reforms and policy changes that will hopefully help it avoid future excessive indebtedness providing iti with unconditional debt relief they argue would encourage the haitian government to increase borrowing in november 2007 the haitian government published poverty reduction strategy in line with imf and world bank recommendations many observers had predicted that haiti would be able to meet the socalled completion point required for debt relief by late 2008 or ear ly 2009 but the current crisis could delay this outcome proponents counter that give n haitis immediate food crisis the secretary of the treasury should urge the mu ltilateral donors to cancel haiti s foreign debt immediately because haitian public finances could be better used to subsidize food purchases that are desperately needed right away immediate assistance would also accelerate debt relief anticipated under the hipc program but which may not be forthcoming soon because haiti is unlikely to meet the remaining cond itions for debt relief in the near future
