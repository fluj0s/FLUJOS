resources and environmental policy resources science and industry division clean water act review of issues in the 109th congress summary legislative initiatives to comprehensively amend the clean water act cwa have stalled for some time as interested parties have debated whether and exactly how to change the law congress has instead focused legislative attention on narrow bills to extend or modify selected cwa programs but not any comprehensive proposals in the 109th congress two such bills were enacted bill extending authorizations for the long island sound program hr 3963 pl 109137 and another concerning the lake pontchartrain basin hr 6121 pl 109392 the house also passed hr 1721 bill to reauthorize coastal water quality programs and several other cwa bills were reported by house and senate committees including hr 4126 concerning the chesapeake bay and s 2781 concerning wastewater facility security freestanding bill intended to promote remediation of abandoned hardrock mines s 1848 which would have affected cwa requirements for such projects also was reported but not passed following gulf coast hurricanes in 2005 the senate passed legislation to streamline delivery of funds to repair stormdamaged sewage treatment plants s 1709 other bills intended to simplify environmental review of recovery and rebuilding projects also were introduced s 1711 s 1765s 1766 none of these was enacted for several years the most prominent legislative water quality issue has concerned financial assistance for municipal wastewater treatment projects at issue is how the federal government will assist states and cities in meeting needs to rebuild repair and upgrade wastewater treatment plants especially in light of capital costs that are projected to be as much as 390 billion over the next two decades in the 109th congress the senate environment and public works committee approved s 1400 bill authorizing 20 billion in federal grants to capitalize state clean water infrastructure loan programs house committee approved bills to reauthorize other clean water act programs hr 624 would have provided 15 billion in grants over six years for sewer overflow projects and hr 1359 would have extended pilot program for alternative water source projects none of these bills was passed other clean water act issues have received attention from numerous stakeholders but were not considered by the 109th congress in particular programs that regulate activities in wetlands especially cwa section 404 have been criticized by landowners for intruding on private landuse decisions and imposing excessive economic burdens environmentalists view these programs as essential for maintaining the health of wetland ecosystems these groups are concerned about 2001 supreme court decision the swancc case that narrowed regulatory protection of wetlands 2006 court ruling that also addressed the regulatory jurisdiction of section 404 and related administrative actions including 2003 policy guidance intended to interpret the swancc case legislation to reverse the swancc ruling hr 1356s 912 the clean water authority restoration act and another bill to narrow the governments regulatory jurisdiction

in the 109th congress most recent developments before adjourning sine die in december 2006 congress passed legislation to reauthorize the clean water acts lake pontchartrain basin program hr 6121 president bush signed this bill into law on december 12 pl 109392 house and senate committees reported several other bills near the end of the 109th congress but none of these was enacted the house transportation and infrastructure committee reported hr 4126 to reauthorize the acts chesapeake bay program two other bills reported by the senate environment and public works committee dealt with security of wastewater treatment facilities s 2781 and incentives to promote remediation of inactive and abandoned hardrock mines s 1848 background and analysis although much progress has been made in achieving the ambitious goals that congress established 30plus years ago to restore and maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity of the nations waters problems persist the types of remaining water quality problems are diverse ranging from pollution runoff from farms and ranches city streets and other diffuse or nonpoint sources to metals as well as organic and inorganic toxic substances discharged from factories and sewage treatment plants the principal law that deals with polluting activity in the nations streams lakes estuaries and coastal waters is the federal water pollution control act pl 92500 enacted in 1972 commonly known as the clean water act or cwa amended by pl 95217 in 1977 pl 97117 in 1981 and pl 1004 in 1987 it consists of two major parts regulatory provisions that impose progressively more stringent requirements on industries and cities to abate pollution and meet the statutory goal of zero discharge of pollutants and provisions that authorize federal financial assistance for municipal wastewater treatment plant construction both parts are supported by research activities plus permit and enforcement provisions programs at the federal level are administered by the environmental protection agency epa state and local governments have major responsibilities to implement cwa programs through standardsetting permitting and enforcement1 1 for further information see crs report rl30030 clean water act summary of the law by claudia copeland crs2 the objective declared in the 1972 act of restoring and maintaining the chemical physical and biological integrity of the nations waters was accompanied by statutory goals to eliminate the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters by 1985 and to attain wherever possible waters deemed fishable and swimmable by 1983 while those goals have not been fully achieved considerable progress has been made especially in controlling conventional pollutants suspended solids bacteria and oxygenconsuming materials discharged by industries and municipal sewage treatment plants progress has been mixed in controlling discharges of toxic pollutants heavy metals inorganic and organic chemicals which are more numerous and can harm human health and the environment even when present in minute amounts at the partsperbillion level moreover efforts to control pollution from diffuse sources termed nonpoint source pollution rainfall runoff from urban suburban and agricultural areas for example are more recent given the earlier emphasis on point source pollution discharges from industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants overall data reported by epa and states indicate that 39 of river and stream miles assessed by states and 45 of assessed lake acres do not meet applicable water quality standards and are impaired for one or more desired uses approximately 95000 lakes and 544000 river miles in the united states are under fishconsumption advisories including 100 of the great lakes and their connecting waters due to chemical contaminants in lakes rivers and coastal waters and one third of shellfishing beds are closed or restricted due to toxic pollutant contamination for mercury contaminant of growing concern as of 2003 45 states had issued partial or statewide fish or shellfish consumption advisories the most recent major amendments were enacted in 1987 pl 1004 this was the first comprehensive revision to the law in decade authorizations for some programs such as general grant assistance to states research and general epa support authorized in that law expired in fy1990 and fy1991 authorizations for wastewater treatment funding expired in fy1994 none of these programs has lapsed however as congress has continued to appropriate funds to implement the act2 the clean water act has been viewed as one of the most successful environmental laws in terms of achieving its statutory goals which have been widely supported by the public but lately some have questioned whether additional actions to achieve further benefits are worth the costs criticism has come from industry which has been the longstanding focus of the acts regulatory programs and often opposes imposition of new stringent and costly requirements criticism also has come from developers and property rights groups who contend that federal regulations particularly the acts wetlands permit program are costly intrusion on private landuse decisions states and cities have traditionally supported water quality programs and federal funding to assist them in carrying out the law but recently many have opposed cwa measures that they fear might impose new unfunded mandates many environmental groups believe that further finetuning to 2 for further information see crs report rl33466 water quality implementing the clean water act by claudia copeland crs3 strengthen the act is needed to maintain progress achieved to date and to address remaining water quality problems legislative activity since pl 1004 following enactment of amendments in 1987 major cwa legislative activity occurred until the 104th congress 1995 the house approved comprehensive reauthorization bill hr 961 that was opposed by environmentalists and the clinton administration critics said that the bill would undermine the existing framework for protecting us waters the senate did not take up hr 961 or other cwa legislation in the 105th and 106th congresses comprehensive reauthorization legislation was introduced but action occurred in the 106th congress on bills dealing with specific water quality issues congress passed bill to strengthen protection of coastal recreation waters through upgraded water quality standards and coastal waters monitoring programs pl 106284 congress also passed bill pl 106457 that reauthorized several existing cwa programs ie chesapeake bay cleanup clean lakes and the national estuary program and bill to authorize cwa grant funding for wet weather sewerage projects included as provision of the fy2001 consolidated appropriations bill pl 106554 during its tenure the clinton administration did not offer legislation to reauthorize the cwa but rather initiated number of agencywide and program specific reforms focusing on flexibility and what were termed common sense approaches to regulation the 107th congress focused legislative attention on one of the key programs of the act provisions concerning financial assistance for municipal wastewater treatment projects house subcommittee and senate committee approved bills to extend the acts state revolving fund srf program through fy2007 hr 3930 s 1961 neither bill received further action in large part due to controversies over application of the davisbacon act which requires that contractors engaging in certain federal contract construction pay workers on such projects not less than the locally prevailing wage for comparable work and over the formula for allocating srf grants among the states the single water quality measure enacted by the 107th congress was the great lakes legacy act pl 107303 it amended existing great lakes provisions of the cwa section 118 to authorize 50 million annually for fy2004fy2008 for epa to carry out projects to remediate sediment contamination in the great lakes the bill also reauthorized cwa provisions concerning the lake champlain basin program section 120 miscellaneous provisions revived number of cwa reports to congress that had been discontinued under previously passed sunset law pl 10466 and allowed states to use cwa section 319 grant funds for stormwater management projects in fy2003 in the 108th congress attention again focused on water infrastructure financing issues although bill was enacted see authorization of wastewater infrastructure below however there was some action on bills to reauthorize crs4 existing mostly geographicspecific programs in the clean water act before recessing for the 2004 election the house and senate passed hr 4731 to reauthorize the national estuary program through fy2010 the president signed this bill on october 30 2004 pl 108399 the national estuary program authorized by the 1987 cwa amendments is directed at improving the quality of estuaries of national importance also in september 2004 the house transportation and infrastructure committee reported three other bills they were 1 hr 784 to reauthorize section 221 of the act and provide 15 billion over six years for sewer overflow projects hrept 108675 2 hr 4470 to extend the lake pontchartrain basin restoration program in section 121 through fy2010 hrept 108676 and 3 hr 4688 to reauthorize the chesapeake bay program through fy2010 hrept 108677 the house passed hr 4470 on october 7 2004 but further action occurred also on october 7 the house passed hr 4794 to amend and reauthorize the tijuana river valley estuary and beach sewage cleanup act pl 106457 in order to address treatment of sewage from tijuana mexico that impacts the san diego border region the senate passed this bill on november 16 2004 and the president signed it on november 30 pl 108425 this law did not amend the cwa 109th congress wastewater infrastructure legislation again received attention in the 109th congress see further discussion below in july 2005 the senate environment and public works committee approved s 1400 srept 109 186 authorizing federal funds for water quality and drinking water state revolving fund programs in may 2005 the house transportation and infrastructure committee approved bills to reauthorize funding for two other related cwa programs the bills are 1 hr 624 hrept 109166 to reauthorize section 221 of the act and provide 15 billion over six years for sewer overflow projects identical to hr 784 from the 108th congress and 2 hr 1359 hrept 109167 to extend section 220 of the act authorizing pilot program for alternative water source projects the house did not take up either of these bills other bills concerned with specific cwa programs received attention two were enacted in december 2005 congress passed hr 3963 hrept 109293 authorizing 40 million per year to extend the long island sound program in section 119 of the act for six years through fy2010 president bush signed it on december 22 pl 109137 in november 2006 congress passed hr 6121 bill to reauthorize the lake pontchartrain basin program in section 121 of the act through fy2011 president bush signed it on december 12 pl 109392 other bills were considered but not enacted in december 2005 the house approved hr 1721 hrept 109292 to extend the coastal water quality program in section 406 of the act and to authorize 30 million over six years for coastal water quality monitoring in september 2006 the house transportation and infrastructure committee approved hr 4126 bill to improve and reauthorize the cwa chesapeake bay program in section 117 of the act report on this bill was filed also in september the senate environment and public works committee reported s 1848 srept 109351 bill intended to promote remediation of inactive and abandoned hardrock mines by modifying requirements of the clean water act and certain other environmental laws as an incentive to persons carrying out such projects see good samaritan legislation below crs5 recovery from 2005 hurricanes throughout the gulf coast region affected by hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 high winds and water damaged wide range of public service facilities including sewage treatment plants and restoring those facilities is part of the overall cleanup and restoration process damages at many facilities included loss of electric power after the storm to pump process and treat raw water supply and wastewater epa and the us army corps of engineers staff have assisted state and local government personnel to evaluate damages efforts continue throughout the region to assess facilities to determine their operating status including needs to repair or rebuild but epa reported that six weeks after hurricane katrina more than 95 of wastewater treatment facilities in the affected region were operational although many may require major repairs or rebuilding even more than year after the storms facilities in some cities serving parts of new orleans for example were not fully operational3 the 109th congress considered wide range of legislative proposals to aid generally in response and recovery in particular s 1709 passed by the senate on september 27 2005 would have modified the revolving loan provisions of the clean water act to provide favorable treatment such as forgiveness of loan principal and extended repayment for sewage treatment repair or rebuilding projects in alabama mississippi and louisiana it also would have permitted those states for two years to provide cwa assistance even for projects not included on states intended use plan since many of the systems affected by hurricane katrina are believed to not be included in the plans the house did not act on this legislation more generally some suggested that environmental review and permitting requirements of the clean water act and other federal environmental laws should be modified to enable swift recovery from the storms several bills with provisions intended to do so were introduced s 1711 s 1765s 1766 but received further congressional consideration4 wastewater security since the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states congressional attention has focused on security preparedness and emergency response issues among the topics of interest are protection of the nations water infrastructure facilities both drinking water and wastewater from possible physical damage biologicalchemical attacks and cyber disruption5 policymakers have examined number of legislative options in this area including enhanced physical security communication and coordination and research in october 2002 the house passed legislation to authorize 200 million in grants for security activities at wastewater treatment plants hr 5169 it also authorized 15 million in technical assistance for small treatment plant facilities and 5 million to epa for improved vulnerability assessment tools similar legislation was introduced 3 for information see crs report rs22285 hurricanedamaged drinking water and wastewater facilities impacts needs and response by claudia copeland 4 for additional discussion see crs report rl33107 emergency waiver of epa regulations authorities and legislative proposals in the aftermath of hurricane katrina by james mccarthy and claudia copeland 5 for information see crs report rl32189 terrorism and security issues facing the water infrastructure sector by claudia copeland and betsy cody crs6 in the senate s 3037 but further action occurred congress did enact legislation authorizing 160 million in grants for drinking water utilities to conduct vulnerability assessments pl 107188 in the 108th congress the house passed legislation similar to hr 5169 hr 866 hrept 10833 would have authorized 200 million in grants to wastewater utilities to conduct vulnerability assessments and an additional 20 million for technical assistance and improved assessment tools the senate environment and public works committee approved similar bill s 1039 srept 108149 in may 2003 further action occurred due in part to concerns expressed by some that the legislation would not mandate vulnerability assessments and would not require that they be submitted to epa as is the case with drinking water assessments required by pl 107188 wastewater security issues again received attention in the 109th congress in may 2006 the senate environment and public works committee approved s 2781 srept 109345 it was similar to s 1039 in the 108th congress in that it would encourage wastewater utilities to conduct vulnerability assessments and would authorize 220 million to assist utilities with assessments and preparation of site security plans it also included provisions responding to march 2006 gao report that found that utilities have made little effort to address vulnerabilities of collection systems which may be used by terrorists to introduce hazardous substances or as access points for underground travel to potential target6 s 2781 would have authorized epa to conduct research on this topic during committee consideration of the bill an amendment was rejected that would have required rather than encouraged treatment works to conduct vulnerability assessments and also would have required highrisk facilities to switch from using chlorine and similar hazardous substances to other chemicals that are often referred to as inherently safer technologies further action on this bill occurred legislative issues in the 109th congress the year 2002 marked the 30th anniversary of passage of the clean water act and 15 years since the last major amendments to the law while as noted there has been measurable clean water progress as result of the act observers and analysts agree that significant water pollution problems remain however there is less agreement about what solutions are needed and whether new legislation is required several key water quality issues exist evaluating actions to implement existing provisions of the law assessing whether additional steps are necessary to achieve overall goals of the act that have not yet been attained and defining the appropriate federal role in guiding and paying for clean water infrastructure and other activities for some time efforts to comprehensively amend the act have stalled as interests have debated whether and exactly how to change the law many issues that might be addressed involve making difficult tradeoffs between impacts on different sectors of 6 us government accountability office securing wastewater facilities utilities have made upgrades but further improvements to key system components may be limited by costs and other constraints gao06390 march 2006 64 p crs7 the economy taking action when there is technical or scientific uncertainty and allocating governmental responsibilities for implementing the law these factors partly explain why congress has recently favored focusing legislative attention on narrow bills to extend or modify selected cwa programs rather than taking up comprehensive proposals other factors also are at work these include general reluctance by most members of congress to address controversial environmental issues in view of the slim majorities held by political parties in the house and the senate lack of presidential initiatives on clean water issues neither the clinton nor the bush administration proposed cwa legislation and since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 more prominent congressional focus on security terrorism and iraq war issues than on many other topics including environmental protection authorization of water infrastructure funding the acts program of financial aid for municipal wastewater treatment plant construction is central feature of the law at issue today is how the federal government will assist states and cities especially in view of the high projected funding needs that exist it received attention in the 109th congress as it has for several years although controversies have stymied enactment of new legislation since 1972 congress has provided total of 765 billion to assist cities in constructing projects to achieve the acts requirements for secondary treatment of municipal sewage equivalent to 85 reduction of wastes or more stringent treatment where required by local water quality conditions the cwa does not authorize funds for operation or maintenance of completed projects state and local governments have spent more than 25 billion of their own funds for construction as well in addition to cwa programs other sources of federal funding are administered by the us department of agriculture and the department of housing and urban development7 nevertheless funding needs remain very high an additional 181 billion nationwide for all types of projects eligible for funding under the act according to the most recent needs survey estimate by epa and the states issued in august 20038 in september 2002 epa released study called the gap analysis that assessed the difference between current spending for wastewater infrastructure and total funding needs both capital and operation and maintenance9 in that report epa estimated that over the next two decades the united states needs to spend nearly 390 billion to replace existing wastewater infrastructure systems and to build new ones including for some projects not currently eligible for cwa funds such as system replacement which are not reflected in the epastate needs survey 7 for information see crs report rl30478 federally supported water supply and wastewater treatment programs 8 us environmental protection agency clean watersheds needs survey 2000 report to congress washington august 2003 epa 83203001 1 vol 9 us environmental protection agency the clean water and drinking water infrastructure gap analysis september 2002 epa 816r02020 50 p crs8 funding needs for operation and maintenance which are not currently eligible for federal aid are an additional 148 billion the agency estimates according to the gap analysis if there is increase in investment there will be about 6 billion gap between current annual capital expenditures for wastewater treatment 13 billion annually and projected spending needs the study also estimated that if wastewater spending increases by 3 annually the gap would shrink by nearly 90 to about 1 billion annually outside groups including coalition called the water infrastructure network have offered proposals that have attracted some congressional interest for multibillion dollar investment program in wastewater and drinking water infrastructure10 the 1987 amendments initiated program of grants to capitalize state water pollution control revolving funds srf or loan programs this program in title vi of the act replaced the previous categorical grants program under which the federal share was 55 of project costs and localities were not obligated to repay federal funds that they received under the revolving fund concept monies used for construction will be repaid by borrowing communities to the states to be recycled for future construction in other communities thus providing an ongoing source of financing states must provide 20 match of the federal amount the intent of the 1987 amendments was that federal contributions to srfs would assist in making transition to full state and local financing by fy1995 the essential tradeoff was that states would have greater flexibility to set priorities and administer funding in exchange for ending federal aid after fy199411 all states have established the mechanisms to administer the new loan programs and have been receiving srf capitalization funds under title vi for several years many have complained that the srf program is unduly complicated by federal rules even though congress had intended that states were to have greater flexibility congressional oversight has examined the progress toward reducing the backlog of wastewater treatment facilities needed to achieve the acts water quality objectives while newer estimates of future funding needs have drawn increased attention to the role of the srf program in meeting such needs small communities and states with large rural populations have experienced the largest share of problems with the srf program many small towns did not participate in the previous construction grants program and consequently are likely to require major projects to achieve compliance with the law yet these communities often lack an industrial tax base and thus face the prospect of very high per capita user fees if their citizens are required to repay the full capital cost of sewage treatment projects while the initial intent was to phase out federal support for this program congress has continued to appropriate srf capitalization grants to the states providing an average of 135 billion annually in recent years the srf provisions 10 for additional information see crs report rl31116 water infrastructure needs and investment review and analysis of key issues by claudia copeland and mary tiemann 11 for additional information see crs report 98323 wastewater treatment overview and background by claudia copeland crs9 have been less controversial than others in the act such as wetlands reform because of apparent general agreement on the need to provide funding assistance as reflected in continued appropriations the cwas srf provisions also were model for similar provisions added to the safe drinking water act sdwa in 1996 pl 104 182 however because remaining clean water funding needs are still so large at issue is whether and how to extend srf assistance to address those needs how to allocate srf funds among the states and how to prioritize projects and funding bush administration officials have said that infrastructure funding needs go beyond what the federal government can do on its own of particular concern is assisting small and economically disadvantaged communities that have had the most difficulty in adjusting from the acts previous categorical grants program to srf loans additionally there is concern about the adequacy of srf or other funding specifically for projects dealing with problems of overflows from municipal combined and separate sewers which can release partially treated or untreated wastewaters that harm public health and the environment epa estimates that the cost of projects to control sewer overflows from combined and separate sanitary sewer systems is nearly 140 billion nationwide and more recently wastewater utilities have sought assistance to assess operational vulnerabilities and upgrade physical protection of their facilities against possible terrorist attacks that could threaten water infrastructure systems12 legislative responses congress has actively considered water infrastructure funding issues since the 107th congress when house and senate committees approved bills to extend the acts srf program through fy2007 and increase federal assistance hr 3930 s 1961 srept 107228 report on hr 3930 was not filed neither bill received further action in large part due to controversies over application of prevailing wage requirements of the davisbacon act and over the formula for allocating srf grants among the states in the 108th congress four bills to reauthorize the clean water act srf program were introduced s 170 s 2550 hr 20 hr 1560 in addition separate bills to reauthorize funding for sewer overflow grants cwa section 221 were introduced hr 784 s 567 in october 2004 the senate environment and public works committee reported legislation authorizing 4125 billion over five years for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure programs including 20 billion for the clean water srf program s 2550 srept 108386 the bill included new formula for statebystate allocation of clean water srf grants renewal of the clean water acts sewer overflow grant program and provisions such as extended loan repayments and subsidies for disadvantaged communities prior to the senate committees action in july 2003 the house transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on water resources and environment approved 12 water infrastructure funding issues related to annual appropriations also are an issue of interest to congress for information see crs report rl33466 water quality implementing the clean water act by claudia copeland crs10 hr 1560 legislation similar to hr 3930 the bill approved by that committee in the 107th congress hr 1560 would have authorized 20 billion for the clean water srf program for fy2004fy2008 it included several provisions intended to benefit economically disadvantaged and small communities such as allowing extended loan repayments 30 years rather than 20 and additional subsidies eg principal forgiveness and negative interest loans for communities that meet states affordability criteria it included provisions to require communities to plan for capital replacement needs and to develop and implement an asset management plan for the repair and maintenance of infrastructure that is being financed13 further action occurred the issue of the applicability of the prevailing local wage requirements of the davisbacon act to srffunded projects has affected consideration of water infrastructure legislation for some time because that act has both strong supporters and critics in congress critics of davisbacon say that it unnecessarily increases public construction costs and hampers competition while supporters say that it helps stabilize the local construction industry by preventing competition that would undercut local wages and working conditions the bill approved by the house subcommittee in july 2003 hr 1560 did not include language specifying that the davisbacon act shall apply to srffunded projects while s 2550 did include such requirement other factors that clouded the bills were administration opposition to authorization levels in both bills and disputes over funding allocation formulas in the 109th congress the senate environment and public works committee approved s 1400 the water infrastructure financing act in july 2005 srept 109 186 the bill was similar to s 2550 in the 108th congress it would have authorized 20 billion for grants to capitalize the clean water act srf program and 15 billion for safe drinking water act srfs through fy2010 as approved by the committee s 1400 would have revised and updated the cwa formula for statebystate allocation of srf monies and also specified that the prevailing wage requirements of the davisbacon act shall apply to all projects financed from an srf as similarly provided in the committees bill in the 108th congress further action on this bill occurred for some time interest has been growing in identifying and developing new mechanisms to help localities pay for water infrastructure projects beyond federal grants or srfs which appear insufficient to fully meet funding needs in june 2005 the house transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on water resources and environment held hearings on alternative means to fund water infrastructure projects in the future at the first hearing witnesses focused on one way to increase funding for water infrastructure that has recently been advocated by some groups creating national clean water trust fund that would conceptually be similar to trust funds that exist for highway and aviation projects witnesses and subcommittee members discussed difficulties in identifying potential revenue sources that would be deemed fair and equitable the second hearing addressed other financing options such as expanded use of taxexempt private activity bonds and more efficient management 13 for information see crs report rl32503 water infrastructure financing legislation comparison of s 2550 and hr 1560 by claudia copeland and mary tiemann crs11 techniques such as asset management programs and sustainable infrastructure initiatives in december 2005 legislation was introduced to establish 75 billion federal trust fund for wastewater infrastructure improvements this bill hr 4560 proposed to use concept for funding such projects that has been promoted by wastewater treatment industry officials other stakeholders and some environmentalists who argue it could provide new source of money for necessary system upgrades amid dwindling federal funds the bill contemplated system of user fees to create the fund but the source of revenue was not specified in the bill congress did not act on this legislation other clean water act issues several other cwa issues have drawn some degree of congressional attention regulatory protection of wetlands how best to protect the nations remaining wetlands and regulate activities taking place in wetlands has become one of the most contentious environmental policy issues especially in the context of the cwa which contains key wetlands regulatory tool the permit program in section 404 it requires landowners or developers to obtain permits for disposal of dredged or fill material that is generated by construction or similar activity into navigable waters of the united states including wetlands section 404 has evolved through judicial interpretation and regulatory change to become one of the principal federal tools used to protect wetlands although that term appears only once in section 404 itself and is not defined there at the same time its implementation has come to be seen as intrusive and burdensome to those whose activities it regulates at issue today is how to address criticism of the section 404 regulatory program while achieving desired goals of wetlands protection14 unlike the rest of the act the permit aspects of section 404 are administered by the us army corps of engineers rather than epa although the corps uses epa environmental guidance other federal agencies including the us fish and wildlife service fws and natural resource conservation service nrcs have more limited roles in the corps permitting decisions tension has existed for many years between the regulation of activities in wetlands under section 404 and related laws on the one hand and the desire of landowners to develop property that may include wetlands on the other hand the conflicts over wetlands regulation have for the most part occurred in administrative proceedings as congress has not amended section 404 since 1977 when it provided exemptions for categories of routine activities such as normal farming and forestry controversy has grown over the extent of federal jurisdiction and impacts on private property burdens and delay of permit procedures and roles of federal agencies and states in issuing permits judicial proceedings involving section 404 one issue involving long standing controversy and litigation is whether isolated waters are properly within the jurisdiction of section 404 isolated waters that are wetlands which are not physically adjacent to navigable surface waters often appear to provide only some of 14 for additional information see crs report rl33483 wetlands an overview of issues by jeffrey zinn and claudia copeland crs12 the values for which wetlands are protected such as flood control or water purification even if they meet the technical definition of wetland on january 9 2001 the supreme court ruled on the question of whether the cwa provides the corps and epa with authority over isolated waters the courts 54 ruling in solid waste agency of northern cook county swancc v us army corps of engineers 531 us 159 2001 held that the corps denial of 404 permit for disposal site on isolated wetlands solely on the basis that migratory birds use the site exceeds the authority provided in the act the full extent of impacts on the regulatory program resulting from this decision remains unclear even five years after the ruling in part because of different interpretations of swancc reflected in subsequent federal court cases while it continues to be difficult to fully assess how regulatory protection of wetlands will be affected as result of the swancc decision and other possible changes the remaining responsibility to protect affected wetlands falls on states and localities16 environmentalists believe that the court misinterpreted congressional intent on the matter while industry and landowner groups welcomed the ruling policy implications of how much the decision restricts federal regulation depend on how broadly or narrowly the opinion is applied some federal courts have interpreted swancc narrowly thus limiting its effect on current permit rules while few read the decision more broadly the governments current view on this key question was expressed in epa corps guidance issued in january 2003 it provides legal interpretation essentially based on narrow reading of the courts decision thus allowing federal regulation of some isolated waters to continue but it calls for more headquarters review in disputed cases administration press releases say that the guidance demonstrates the governments commitment to nonetloss wetlands policy however it is apparent that the issues remain under discussion because at the same time the administration issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking anprm seeking comment on how to define waters that are under jurisdiction of the regulatory program17 the anprm did not actually propose rule changes but it indicated possible ways that clean water act rules might be modified to further limit federal jurisdiction building on swancc and some subsequent legal decisions the government received more than 133000 comments on the anprm most of them negative according to epa and the corps environmentalists and many states opposed changing any rules saying that the law and previous court rulings call for the broadest possible interpretation of the clean water act and thus narrow interpretation of swancc but developers sought changes to clarify interpretation of the swancc ruling in december 2003 epa and the corps announced that the 16 for additional information see crs report

federal register 19911998 jan 15 2003 crs13 administration would not pursue development of rule changes concerning federal regulatory jurisdiction over isolated wetlands the epa administrator said that the administration wanted to avoid contentious and lengthy rulemaking debate over the issue environmentalists and state representatives expressed relief at the announcement interest groups on all sides have been critical of confusion in implementing the 2003 guidance which constitutes the main tool for interpreting the reach of the swancc decision environmentalists remain concerned about diminished protection resulting from the guidance while developers said that without new regulations confusing and contradictory interpretations of wetland rules will continue federal courts continue to have key role in interpreting and clarifying the swancc decision on february 21 2006 the supreme court heard arguments in two cases brought by landowners rapanos v united states carabell v us army corps of engineers seeking to narrow the scope of the cwa permit program as it applies to development of wetlands the issue in both cases had to do with the reach of the cwa to cover waters that were not navigable waters in the traditional sense but were connected somehow to navigable waters or adjacent to those waters the act requires federal permit to discharge dredged or fill materials into navigable waters many legal and other observers hoped that the courts ruling in these cases would bring greater clarity about the scope of federal regulatory jurisdiction17 the courts ruling was issued on june 19 rapanos v united states 126 sct 2208 2006 in 54 decision plurality of the court led by justice scalia held that the lower court had applied an incorrect standard to determine whether the wetlands at issue are covered by the cwa justice kennedy joined this plurality to vacate the lower court decisions and remand the cases for further consideration but he took different positions on most of the substantive issues raised by the cases as did four other dissenting justices early judgments by legal observers suggest that the implications of the ruling both shortterm and longterm are far from clear because the several opinions written by the justices did not draw clear line regarding what wetlands and other waters are subject to federal jurisdiction one likely result is more casebycase determinations and continuing litigation there also could be renewed pressure on the corps and epa to clarify the issues through an administrative rulemaking congressional actions in september 2002 the house government reform subcommittee on energy policy natural resources and regulatory affairs held hearing on the governments response to the swancc decision and to press the government to clarify its interpretation of the court case committee members and public witnesses indicated that lack of guidance has led to inconsistent regulatory decisions by corps officials in individual regions of the country and subsequent judicial decisions by other federal and state court have been mixed at the hearing corps and epa officials testified on their efforts to develop guidance 17 for additional information see crs report rl33263 the wetlands coverage of the clean water act is revisited by the supreme court rapanos and carabell by robert meltz and claudia copeland crs14 which subsequently was released in january 2003 concern about lingering confusion over the swancc decision and its implementation by the corps was the topic of an oversight hearing by the senate environment and public works committee in june 2003 developers and others in the regulated community criticized the corps and epa saying that the january 2003 guidance document had not clarified the reach of federal jurisdiction house transportation and infrastructure subcommittee also held hearing on postswancc issues on march 30 2004 controversies about the swancc guidance issued by epa and the corps in 2003 persist in response on may 18 2006 the house adopted an amendment to bill providing fy2007 appropriations for epa hr 5386 the amendment passed by 222198 vote would bar epa from spending funds to implement the 2003 policy guidance supporters of the amendment said that the guidance goes beyond what the supreme court required in swancc has allowed many streams and wetlands to be unprotected from development and has been more confusing than helpful opponents of the amendment predicted that it would make epas and the corps regulatory job more difficult than it already is congress adjourned sine die in december without taking final action on hr 5386 thus delaying final action until the beginning of the 110th congress legislation to overturn the swancc decision by providing broad definition of waters of the united states was introduced in the 109th congress hr 1356s 912 the clean water authority restoration act of 2005 other legislation to narrow the definition of waters of the united states also was introduced hr 2658 the federal wetlands jurisdiction act of 200518 further action occurred on either bill for now it is unclear whether the more recent decision in the rapanos and carabell cases will accelerate congressional interest in these or other proposals to address uncertainties about federal jurisdiction over wetlands and other waters on august 1 senate environment and public works subcommittee held hearing on the courts june 19 rapanos decision while some witnesses urged congress to clarify the jurisdictional issues others urged epa and the corps to issue new guidance andor initiate rulemaking to change applicable regulations administration witnesses said that epa and the corps are working on new guidance for their regulatory staffs but have not yet decided whether rulemaking is needed tmdls and state water quality standards the cwa requires states to identify pollutionimpaired water segments and develop total maximum daily loads tmdl that set the maximum amount of pollution that water body can receive without violating water quality standards tmdl is essentially plan to allocate responsibility for implementing pollution control measures within an area or watershed in order to remedy water quality impairments until recently there had been little implementation of the tmdl provision section 303d which congress enacted in 1972 since the early 1990s environmental groups have filed lawsuits in 38 states to pressure epa and states to meet the laws requirements of the suits tried or settled to date more than half have resulted in court orders requiring 18 for additional information and discussion of similar legislation in the 108th congress see crs report rl33483 wetlands an overview of issues crs15 expeditious development of tmdls thus driving the program that had previously received little attention at issue today are controversies over implementation of the existing tmdl program and regulatory revisions that epa issued in july 2000 the 2000 revisions were issued partly in response to the lawsuits and were intended to strengthen the program that rule was highly controversial and never went into effect because of issues such as potential burdens on states industries cities and others to implement revised tmdl program and potential impacts on some agriculture and forestry sources which are not now directly subject to cwa regulations because of those controversies the clinton administration delayed the effective date of the 2000 rule until october 2001 in the fy2001 appropriations act funding epa pl 106377 congress requested study by the national academy of sciences nas on the scientific basis of the tmdl program the nas report was issued in june 200119 it did not specifically analyze the july 2000 revised regulations the nas panel concluded that scientific knowledge exists to move forward with the tmdl program and recommended that epa and states use adaptive implementation for tmdl development in many cases the report said water quality problems and solutions are obvious and should proceed without complex analysis in other cases solutions are more complex and require different level of understanding and something like phased implementation in addition the general accounting office now the government accountability office concluded in report that inconsistent monitoring data collection and listing procedures used by states to identify impaired waters have hindered efforts to develop effective tmdl programs20 in october 2001 the bush administration announced that it would delay the rule for 18 months until may 2003 to allow epa officials time to review the rule and the nas report this action came after federal court approved the administrations request for similar suspension of litigation that is challenging the regulation nearly dozen interest groups have sued epa over various parts of the tmdl rule in the interim and continuing for the present time existing rules and requirements and courtsanctioned tmdl schedules affecting approximately 22 states remain in place21 on march 19 2003 epa withdrew the july 2000 tmdl rule epa officials said that implementation of the existing tmdl program will continue in the meantime but that additional time is needed to decide whether and how to revise the current program epa is considering initiating an entirely new rule or other options but further timeframe or proposal has been announced recent congressional attention to these issues has been limited to oversight hearings held by the house 19

program effectiveness and efficiency good samaritan legislation in the 109th congress bills were introduced to address the legacy of pollution from inactive and abandoned hardrock mines iams that degrades the environment throughout the united states particularly in the west epa has estimated that 40 of headwaters in the west have been adversely impacted by acidic and other types of drainage from abandoned sites where gold silver copper lead and iron ore were mined the core concept underlying the bills is that in order to address the problem of pollution from iam sites it is appropriate to encourage cleanup by socalled good samaritan entities to do so the bills hr 1266 s 1848 and an administration proposal hr 5404 and s 2780 proposed to establish process for issuing permits to good samaritans and to provide incentives in the form of reduced liability from environmental laws and less stringent environmental cleanup standards proponents who include mining companies and industry associations maintain that any degree of cleanup is better than inaction or the status quo and they argue that if not addressed in this legislation the issues of liability exposure under environmental law and strict regulatory standards could stymie voluntary cleanups opponents especially many environmental and conservation advocates acknowledge that cleanup would benefit the environment but they expressed concern that exemptions and relief such as these bills proposed might be the first step in dismantling key environmental legislation because the bills were vague about standards that would apply to good samaritan cleanup22 in the 109th congress three house and senate committees held hearings on issues raised by the good samaritan legislation testimony was heard from witnesses representing epa states hardrock mining industry companies and associations and environmental groups on september 13 2006 the senate environment and public works committee approved s 1848 srept 109351 bill that would have allowed good samaritans to apply for an epa permit that relieves the cleanup party of liability and regulatory requirements under several environmental laws including the clean water act superfund the toxic substances control act the solid waste disposal act and the national environmental policy act it was freestanding bill and would not have amended any of these laws the legislation would have relieved potential good samaritan of the need to obtain cwa permits and of any requirement that discharges from the cleanup site must attain water quality standards further

district v miccosukee tribe of indians 124 s ct 1537 200423 the decision raised concerns in agricultural areas where such transfers often occur in supplying irrigation water presently without permit congress did not hold oversight hearings on impacts of the courts decision and legislation that might have addressed the ruling was not introduced decisions of federal courts in two cases have held that aerial application of pesticide over and into us waters requires cwa permit even when the pesticide use meets other requirements of federal law including the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra these and related decisions drew the attention of many pesticide applicators including public health entities such as mosquito control districts concerned with how the rulings might affect their need to control pests associated with diseases such as the west nile virus in november 2006 epa finalized rulemaking seeking to resolve the conflict over the regulatory scope of the cwa and fifra related to pesticide use in light of the recent litigation by promulgating regulations to clarify circumstances under which cwa permit is or is not required for activities carried out pursuant to fifra congress examined these issues in oversight hearings one by house transportation and infrastructure subcommittee in october 2002 and another by house government reform subcommittee
