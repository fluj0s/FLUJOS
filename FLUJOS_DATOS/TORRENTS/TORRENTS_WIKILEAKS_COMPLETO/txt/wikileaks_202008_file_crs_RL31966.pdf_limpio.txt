drug benefits the legislation specifies the requirements for qualified prescription drug c overage qualified covera ge is defined as either standard prescription drug coverage or alternative prescrip tion drug coverage with at least actuarially equivalent bene fits in both cases access would have to be provided to negotiated prices for covered drugs plans are permitted to provide supplemental prescription coverage consistin g of either certain reductions in cost sharing ie reduction in deductible reduction in coin surance percentage and increase in initial coverage limit or coverage of drug s which are excluded because of application of the medicaid definition of covered drugs pdp sponsor may not offer plan that provides supplemental bene fits unless it also offers basic plan in the area for 2006 standard prescription drug c overage is defined as having 250 deductible 25 coinsurance up to the initial coverage limit 2250 accounting for 750 in total outofpocket costs and 2250 in total spending then coverage until the beneficiary had outofpocket co sts of 3600 5100 total spending once the beneficiary reached th catastrophic stop loss limit the program would pay costs except for nominal costsharing the costsharing is equal to the greater of 1 copayment of 2 for generic drug or preferred multiple source and 5 for any other drug or 2 5 coinsurance nothin g is to be construed as preventing pdp sponsor or ma organization from reducing th costsharing for preferred or generic drugs beginning in 2007 the annual do llar amounts would be increased by the annual percentage increase in average per capita aggregate expenditures for covered outpatient drugs for medicare beneficiaries for the 12m onth period ending in july of the previous year plans will be permitted to substitute costsharing requirements for costs up to the initial coverage limit that were actuarially consistent with an average expected 25 coinsurance for costs up to the initial coverage limit they may also apply tiered copayments ie diffe rent levels depending on wh ether generic preferred multiple source or other drug is used provided such copayments were actuarially consistent with the average 25 costsharing requirements the act specifies incurred costs that count toward meeting the catastrophic limit costs are only considered incurred if they are incurred for the deductible cost sharing or benefits not paid because of application of the in itial cove rage limit incurred costs do not include amounts for wh ich benefits are provided because of the application of formulary costs can be treated as incurred costs only if they were paid by the individual or by another family member on behalf of the individual paid on behalf of lowincome individual under the subsidy provisions or under state pharmaceutical assistance program any costs for which the individual was reimbursed by insurance or otherwise will not count toward incurred costs coverage

outofpocket threshold pdp sponsors are required to permit the participa tion of any pharmacy that meets the plans terms and conditions pdp could reduce copayments for its enrolled beneficiaries below the otherwis applicable level for drugs dispensed through innetwork pharmacies in case could the reduction result in an increase in subsidy payments made by the secretary to the plan the pdp sponsor is required to secure participation in its network of sufficient number of pharmacies that dispense drugs directly to patients other than by mail order to assure convenient access the secretary will establish conve nient access rules that are less favorable to enrollees than rules for convenient access established for the tricare retail pharmacy program the rules are to include adequate emergency assess for enrolled beneficiaries sponsors will permit enrollees to receive benefits which may include 90day supply through community pha rmacy rather than through mailorder with any differential in charge paid by enrollees if pdp sponsor uses formulary it will have to meet certain requirements pharmaceutical and therapeutic committee must develop and review the formulary the committee w ill be required when developing and reviewing the formulary to base clinical decisions on the strength of scientific evidence and standards of practice the committee must also take in to account whether including particular covered drug in the formulary or in par ticular tier in formulary had therapeutic advantages in terms of safety and efficacy the formulary must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of cove red part d drugs although not necessarily all drugs within such categories or classes the secretary is required to request the united states pharmacopeia to develop in consultation with pharmaceutical benefit ma nagers and other interested parties list of categories and classes that may be used by plans the secretarys request must also include the revision of such classification from time to time to reflect changes in therapeutic uses of cove red drugs and the addition of new covered drugs the plan sponsor can not change therapeutic categor ies and classes in formulary other than at the beginning of plan year except as the secretary may permit to take into account new therapeutic uses and newly pproved covered drugs each sponsor is required

or has adverse effects for the enrollee pdp will be required to have an exceptions process consistent with guid elines established by the secretary in general pdp plan sponsors will be required to meet the requirements for independent review and appeal s of coverage denials and tiered costsharing in the same manner that such requirements applie d to ma organizations for feeforservice benefits

for treatment of the same condition would not be as effective for the individua l or would have adverse effects for the individual or both the pdp sponsor will be required to meet requirements related to confidentiality and accuracy of enroll ee records in the same manner that such requirements applied to ma organizations each pdp sponsor will provide that each pharmacy that dispenses covered drug shall inform enrolled beneficiaries at the time of purchase or at the time of delivery in the case of mail order drugs of any price differential between the price to the enrollee and the price of the lowest cost generic drug covered under the plan that is therapeutically equivalent and bi oequivalent and available at the pharmacy the secretary is permitted to waive this requirement pdp sponsors are required to issue and re issue as appropriate card or other technology that could be used by an enrolled beneficiary to assure access to negotiated prices for drugs the secretary will provide for the development adoption or recognition of st andards relating to standa rdized format for the card or other technology electronic prescription program the act requires the secretary to develop electronic prescription standards the standards apply to prescriptions for covered part d drugs and required information that are transmitted electronically under an electronic prescription drug

drugs any tiered formulary structure and prior authorization requirements information on the drug being prescribed and other drugs listed in the patients medication histor including drugdrug interactions and information on the availability of lowercost therapeutically appropriate alternative drugs additionally the program must pr ovide for the electronic transmittal of the patients medical history disclosure of information must meet the requirements of the hipaa privacy rule and to the extent feasible be on an in teractive realtime basis access to choice of qualified prescription drug coverage the secretary is required to assure that each beneficiary has available choice of enrollment in at least 2 qualifying plans in the area in which the beneficiary resides at least one plan has to be prescription drug plan the requirement is not satisfied for an area if only one pdp sponsor or one ma organization offering mapd plan offers all the qualifying plans for the area the act permits the secretary in orde r to assure access to approve limited risk contracts as discussed below only if access is still not provided will the secretary provide for the offering of fallback plan pdp regions the act provides for the blishment of pdp regions the service area for plan incl udes an entire pdp region the secretary shall establish and may revise pdp re gions in manner that is consistent with the requirements for establishment and revision of ma regions to the extent practicable pdp regions shall be the same as ma regions the secretary may establish different regions if the secretary determines that it would improve access to drug benefits plan can be offered in more than one pdp region including all pdp regions submission of bids each pdp sponsor is required to submit to the secretary specified information at the same time and in similar manner as such information is submitted by ma organizations the information to be submitted is 1 information

info rmation required by the secretary plan approval the secretary will review the submitted information for purposes of conducting negotiati ons with the plan the secretary has the authority to negotiate the terms and conditions of the plans the authority is similar to the authority the director of the office of personnel management has with respect to federal employee health benefits fehb plans the secretary may not interfere with the negotiations between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and pdp sponsors further the secretary may not require particular formulary or institute price structure for the reimbursement of covered part d drugshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31966crs7 after review and negotiation the secretar will approve or di sapprove the plan the secretary may only approve plan if certain requirements are met the plan must comply with part d requirements including those relating to beneficiary protections the secretary must deter mine that the plan and the sponsor meet requirements relating to actuarial determina tions further the secretary may not find that the design of the plan and its bene fits including any formulary and tiered formulary structure are likely to discourage enrollment by certain beneficiaries the secretary may not make finding with respect to design of categories and classes within formulary if such categories and classes are consistent with guidelines if any for such categories and classes established by the united states pharmacopeia the act provides that the secretary may only approve limited risk plan for pdp region if the access requirements for the region would otherwise not be met except for the approval of limited risk or fallback plan only the minimum number of limited risk plans necessary for region to meet access requirements may be approved the secretary shall pr ovide priority to those with the highest level of risk in case can the reduction of risk provide for or minimis level of financial risk there is limit on the number of full risk plans that may be approved fallback if required access is not provi ded including through limited risk plan the act establishes fallback process the secretary is required to establish separate process for the solicitation of bids from eligible fallback entities single fallback entity may not offer all fallback plans throughout the united states the secretary can only approve one fallback plan for all fallback service areas in any pdp region for contract period competitiv contracting provisions apply the secretary shall approve fallback plans so that if there are any fallback service areas in the region for the year they are offered at the same time as prescription drug plans would otherwise be offered fallback prescription drug plans are permitted to offer only standard prescription dr ug coverage and meet such other requirements specified by the secretary the fallback plan would not be permitted to engage in any marketing or branding of the contract under fallback contract the secretary would pay actual costs of part d covered drugs taking into account negotiated price conce ssions payment would also be made for prescripti on management fees tied to performance management requirements established by the secret ary beneficiary premiums under fallback plans would be uniform and equal to 26 of the secretarys estimate of the average monthly per capita actuarial cost including administrative costs to the entity offering the fallback plan the federa l government would pay the remainder in general contract requirements for fa llback plans would be the same as those established for prescription drug plans contract for fallback plan would be for three years and be renewable after subs equent bidding process however contract could not apply in an area in any year unless the area was fallback service area contract requirements the act establishes or ganizational requirements for pdp sponsors in general pdp spons or must be licensed under state law as risk bearing entity eligible to offer health insurance or health benefits coverage in each state in which it offers prescription drug plan alternatively it could meethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31966crs8 solvency standards established by the secretary for entities not licensed by the state to the extent an entity is at risk it must assume financial risk on prospective basis for covered benefits that are not covere d by direct subsidy payments pdp plan sponsors would be required to enter into contract with the secretary under which the sponsor agreed to comply both with the applicable require ments and standards and the terms and conditions of payment premiums the conferees have stated that the average monthly beneficiary premium in 2006 will be 35 nd represent on average 26 of the cost of the benefit provided the act specifies th calculation as follows the monthly beneficiary premium for prescription drug plan is defined as the base beneficiary premium as adjusted the base benefi ciary premium equals the product of the beneficiary premium percenta ge and the national averag monthly bid amount the beneficiary premium percenta ge is equal to 1 26 divided by 2100 minus percentage equal to total reinsurance payments divided by the sum of such reinsurance payments and total payments the secretary estimates will be paid to prescription drug plans in year that are attributable to the standardized bid amount taking into account amounts paid by the s ecretary and enrollees and the application of risk adjustment the national averag monthly bid amount is weighted average of standardized bid amounts for each pres cription drug plan and each mapd plan once the base beneficiary premium is calculated it is adjusted up or down as appropriate to reflect differences between it and the geographicallyadjusted national average monthly bid amount it is further increased for any supplemental benefits and decreased if the individual is entitled to lowincome subsidy the premium is uniform for all persons enrolled in the plan except for those receiving lowincome subsidies or those subject to late enrollment penalty late enrollment penalties would be applied to beneficiaries who failed to maintain creditable coverage for period of 63 days within continuous period of eligibility beginning on the day after the individuals initial enrollment period and ending on the date of enrollment in prescription drug plan or mapd plan beneficiary premium payments may be pa id directly to the pdp sponsor or ma organization alternatively the benefici ary has the option of having the amount withheld from his or her social security payment or having payment made through an electronic funds transfer m echanism payments withheld are to be paid to the pdp sponsor premium and costsharing subsid ies for lowincome individuals the act provides premium nd costsharing subsidies for lowincome subsidy eligible individuals there are two groups of subsidy eligible individuals the first group is composed of persons who 1 ar enrolled in prescription drug plan or mapd plan 2 have incomes below 135 of poverty and 3 have resources in 2006 below 6000 for an individual and 9000 for couple increased in future years by the percentage increase in the cp i also included in this group are persons who are dually eligible for medicare and dicaid regardless of whether or not they meet the other eligibility requirements the second group of subsidy eligible individuals are persons meeting the same requirements except that the income level is 150 of poverty and an alte rnative resources standard ma be used this alternativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31966crs9 standard in 2006 is 10000 for an indivi dual and 20000 for couple increased in future years by the percentage increase in the cpi individuals with incomes below 135 of poverty and resources meeting the requirement for the first group will have premium subsidy equal to 100 of the lowincome benchmark pre mium amount essentially weighted average for the region but in case higher than the actual premium amount for basic coverage under the plan other lowincome subsidy ligible persons will have sliding scale premium subsidy ranging from 100 of such value at 135 of poverty to 0 of such value at 150 of poverty persons below 135 of poverty will have premium subsidy for any late enrollment penalty equal to 80 for the first 60 months of delayed enrollment and 100 thereafter beneficiaries in both groups are entitled to costsharing subsidies individuals with incomes below 135 of poverty and re sources meeting the requirement for the first group will have deductib costsharing for all costs up to the outofpocket threshold of 2 for generic drug or preferred multiple source and 5 for any other drug institutionalized dual eligibles will have costsharing full benefit dual eligibles with incomes up to 100 of poverty will have co stsharing for all costs up to the outofpocket threshold of 1 for generic drug or preferred multiple source and 3 for any other drug other lowincome subsidy eligible persons will have 50 deductible 15 costsharing for all co sts up to the outofpocket limit and cost sharing for costs above the outofpocket threshold of 2 for generic drug or preferred multiple source and 5 for any other drug the deductible amounts are increased each year beginning in 2007 by th annual percentage increase in per capita beneficiary expenditures for part d covere d drugs the costsharing amounts are increased by the increase in the consumer price index eligibility determinations ar to be made under the st ate medicaid plan for the state or by the commissioner of social security the determinations shall remain effective for period determined by the secretary not to exceed one year full dual eligible persons are to be treated as subsidy eligible persons the secretary may provide that other medicaid beneficiaries be treated as subsidy eligible the secretary will provide process whereby the secretary will notify the pdp sponsor or ma organization that an individual is ligible for subsidy and the amount of the subsidy the sponsor or entity would redu ce the premiums or costsharing otherwise imposed by the amount of the subsidy the act specifies that medicare is the primary payer for covered drugs for dual eligibles medicaid coverage is not availa ble for such drugs or any costsharing for such drugs in 2006 states are liable for approximately 90 of the costs they would otherwise incur if drug coverage for dua l eligibles continued to be offered under medicaid by 2015 this percentage drops to 75 direct subsidies federal subsidy payments will be made to qualifying entities the stated purpose of such payments is to reduce premiums for all beneficiaries consistent w ith an overall subsidy level of 74 for basic coverage reduce adverse selection among plans and promote the participa tion of pdp sponsors and ma organizations such payments w ould be made as direct subsidies and through reinsurancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31966crs10 the act specifies formula for the calculation of the direct monthly per capita subsidy amount it is equal to the plans standardized bid amount adjusted for health status and risk and reduced by the base bene ficiary premium as adjusted to reflect the difference between the bid and the nationa l average bid reinsurance payments equal to 80 of allowable costs would so be provided for an enrollee whose costs exceeded the annual outofpoc ket threshold 3600 in 2006 risk corridors the act provides for the establishment of risk corridors which are defined as specified percentage s above and below target amount the target amount is defined as total payments paid to the plan taking into account the amount paid by the secretary and enroll ees based on the standardized bid amount risk adjusted and reduced by total administrative expenses assumed in the bid payment adjustments will be made if adjusted allowable costs for the plan are at least equal to the first threshold lower limit of the first risk corridor but not greater than the first threshold upper limit of the risk corri dor for the year ie if the plans are within the first risk corridor portion of any plan spending above or below these levels is subject to risk adjustment if adjusted allowable costs exceed the first threshold upper limit then payments are incr eased if adjusted allowable costs are below the first threshold lower limit then payments are reduced adjusted allowable costs are reduced by reinsurance and subs idy payments payment adjustments would not affect beneficiary premiums during 2006 and 2007 plans will be at full risk for adjusted allowable risk corridor costs within 25 above or below th target plans with adjusted allowable costs above this level will receive increased payments if their costs are between 25 of the target first threshold upper limit and 5 of the target second threshold upper limit they will be at risk for 25 of the increased amount that is their payments will equal 75 of adjusted allowable costs for spending in this range if their costs are above 5 of the target th ey will be at risk for 25 of the costs between the first and second threshold uppe r limits and 20 of the costs above that amount that is their payments will equa l 80 of the adjusted allowable costs over the second threshold upper limit conversely if plans fell below the target they will share the savings with the government th ey will have to refund 75 of the savings if costs fall between 25 nd 5 below

previous years payment rate as under current law or the previous years payment increased by the growth in overall medicare for the previous year beginning in 2005 the statute longer allows ma payments to be annually updated by the floor or blend thus only the minimum increase and in certain years4 100 of per capita ffs will be used to update payment rates additional changes to the ma program will be made beginning in 2006 the secretary will determine ma payment rates by comparing plan bids to benchmark plans will submit bids for providing required parts and b benefits the benchmark will be calculated by updating the previous years capitation ra by the annual increase in the minimum percentage increase for plans with bids below the benchmark the payment will equal the unadjusted ma st atutory nondrug monthly bid amount as adjusted and the rebate the rebate will equal 75 of any average per capita savings the amount by which the riskadjusted benchmark exceeds the risk adjusted bid the rebate may be us ed to provide additiona l benefits reduce cost sharing or may be applie d towards the monthly part b premium prescription drug premium or supplemental premium th remaining 25 of the average per capita savings will be retained by the federal government for plans with bids at or above the benchmark for which there are av erage per capita monthly savings the payment amount will

that cover both in and outofnetwork required services there will be at least 10 regions established and more than 50 regions each ma regional plan must offer maximum limit on outofpocket expenses and unified deductible each year an organization w ill submit separate monthly bid amount for each plan it intends to offer in region payments will be based on competitive bidding system so that the

stabilization fund to provide incentives for plans to enter into and to remain in the ma program there will be 10 billion initially provided to the stabilizati on fund and additional amounts will be added to the fund from portion of any average pe r capita monthly savings amounts5 the secretary will be responsible for determining the am ounts that may be given to ma plans from this fund based on statutory requirements for example the national bonus payment will be available to an ma organization that offers an ma regional plan in every ma region in the year but only if there was national plan
