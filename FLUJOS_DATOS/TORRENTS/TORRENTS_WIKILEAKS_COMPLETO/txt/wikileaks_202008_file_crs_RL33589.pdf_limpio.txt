for and response to public health emergencies are found principally in the public health service act phs act and are administered by the secretary of health and human services hhs three recent laws provided the core of these authorities pl 106505 the public health threats and emergencies act of 2000 title i of the public health improvement act established number of new programs and authorities including grants to states to build public health preparedness pl 107188 the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 was passed in the aftermath of the 2001 terror attacks it reauthorized several existing programs and established new ones including grants to states to build hospital and health system preparedness pl 108276 the project bioshield act of 2004 established authorities to encourage the development of specific countermeasures such as drugs and vaccines for bioterrorism agents that would not otherwise have commercial market the laws above built upon existing broad authorities allowing or requiring the secretary of hhs to prepare for or respond to outbreaks of infectious disease and other unanticipated health threats other lawssuch as pl 107296 creating new department of homeland security dhs have added to the slate of public health preparedness and response authorities as well further the robert t stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act the stafford act administered by dhs which authorizes federal assistance and other activities in response to presidentially declared emergencies and major disasters is also to some extent source of federal authority for the response to public health threats the 109 th congress passed pl 109417 the pandemic and allhazards preparedness act the act reauthorized number of expiring preparedness and response programs in the phs act and established some new authorities including the creation of biomedical advanced research and development authority barda new office in hhs to support coordinate and provide oversight of advanced development of vaccines and biodefense countermeasures the acts provisions reflected the concerns of members of the 109 th congress and others regarding the flawed response to hurricane katrina in 2005 and the threat of possible influenza pandemic comparison of provisions in pl 109417 with preexisting law is provided in table 1 later in this

2006 president george w bush signed s 3678 the pandemic and allhazards preparedness act pl 109417 which authorizes appropriations through fy2011 to improve bioterrorism and other public health emergency preparedness and response activities and establishes the biomedical advanced research and development authority barda within the department of health and human services hhs for the advanced research and development of medical countermeasures the pandemic and allhazards preparedness act effected the second comprehensive reauthorization of federal programs designed to improve the nations readiness for public health threats such as bioterrorism or pandemic influenza many of these authorities found principally in the public health service act and implemented by the secretary of health and human services hhs were first explicitly authorized in 2000 pl 106505 amid growing concerns about global terrorist activity and emerging infectious diseases congress reviewed extended and expanded many of these authorities following the terrorist attacks of 2001 pl 107188 the anthrax attacks in particular had put harsh spotlight on public health system that was poorly coordinated and otherwise unfit for 21 st century challenges as the 109th congress began its consideration of the pandemic and allhazards preparedness act in 2005 hurricane katrina slammed into the gulf coast while new strain of avian flu on steady march across europe and asia threatened global pandemic in this context members of congress considered the challenges of bolstering public health system that is based largely in state authority and healthcare system that is largely in private hands congress grappled on the federal level with integrating the new department of homeland security dhs into the nations preparedness and response activities the challenges of building effective coordinated systems across federal agencies with state and local govern ments with private industry with citizens and with foreign nations were formidable as well the 110 th congress will likely be interested in the implementation of provisions in pl 109417 and in the continued evolution of relationships between hhs dhs the states and others among whom coordination is essential in time of heightened concern about national security members of the 110 th congress may wish to consider legislation to address additional expiring public health authorities such as the select agent program to control access to pathogens that could be used for bioterrorism which expires at the end of fy2007 congress may also wish to examine certain permanent emergency response and funding authorities of the secretary of hhs1 this report discusses some key provisions in the pandemic and allhazards preparedness act pl 109417 and provides history of prior public health and medical preparedness and response legislation comparison of provisions in pl 109417 with preexisting law is provided in table 1 later in this report 1 for more information

3678 the pandemic and allhazards preparedness act this bill proposed comprehensive reauthorization of health preparedness and response programs in title i of pl 107188 the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 in addition several bills were introduced in the 109th congress to enhance project bioshield the hhs program to develop and procure specific countermeasures such as drugs and vaccines for victims of bioterrorism for the strategic national stockpile these included s 3 gregg s 975 lieberman s 1873 burr s 1880 kennedy s 2564 burr and hr 5533 rogers2 the two legislative initiatives proceeded along parallel tracks until december 2006 when bioshield provisions were attached to s 3678 as new title iv and the amended bill passed in both chambers the bill was signed by the president on december 19 2006 and became pl 109417 some key provisions of this law are discussed below comparison of provisions in pl 109417 with preexisting law is provided in table 1 later in this report one of the most difficult challenges faced by congress and other policymakers following the 2001 terror attacks was to envision those catastrophic threats for which the nation must be prepared define the capabilities needed to assure national preparedness and determine the appropriate federal activities and incentives needed to achieve these goals among federal state and local governments and the private sector both of the earlier bioterrorism laws pl 106505 and pl 107188 had called on the secretary of hhs in collaboration with other stakeholders to define core national capacities for preparedness and response for public health and medical emergencies the process has been challenge however recent efforts at dhs to develop national preparedness goals and target capabilities have helped to define certain largescale public health and medical capabilitiessuch as rapid disease detection mass prophylaxis and medical surgethat would be required for an effective response to mass casualty incidents and that would require substantial federal coordinating effort 3 the pandemic and allhazards preparedness act would require the secretary of hhs to prepare quadrennial national health security strategy and implementation plan to include preparedness goals for federal state and local governments in harmony with national preparedness and response efforts at dhs in october 2006 the president signed pl 109295 the postkatrina emergency management reform act of 2006 called the postkatrina act included in dhs appropriations for fy2007 the act reauthorized and reorganized programs in the federal emergency management agency fema in dhs 4 among other things the law also codified the position of chief medical officer cmo at dhs the indivi dual who coordinates all departmental activities regarding medical and public health aspects of disasters since the secretary of dhs serves as the federal lead for coordinated national response to disasters including terrorism members of congress 2 for more information seecrs report rs21507 project bioshield purposes and authorities by frank gottron 3 for more information see crs report rl32803

the secretary of hhs in disaster preparedness and response the postkatrina act provides that the cmo shall have the primary responsibility within the department for medical issues related to natural disasters acts of terrorism and other manmade disasters5 emphasis added the pandemic and allhazards preparedness act provides that the secretary of health and human services shall lead all federal public health and medical response to public health emergencies and incidents covered by the national response plan6 emphasis added members of congress will likely be interested in how this statutory division of au thority is implemented by the two departments the 109th congress considered several measures to improve project bioshield program to encourage the development of promising chemical biological radiological or nuclear countermeasures that the private sector might not otherwise develop the 108th congress launched the program in the project bioshield act of 2004 pl 108276 providing 56 billion for the program over 10 years project bioshield allows the government to guarantee market for specified amounts of particular countermeasures under this program hhs can solicit bids for specific countermeasures and execute contracts for the delivery of countermeasures at guaranteed prices even if the countermeasure has up to eight more years of development7 the government only pays for the countermeasure on delivery as time has passed with little perceived progress on some major identified countermeasure targets criticism of this program has mounted the cancellation of the nextgeneration anthrax vaccine contract the largest bioshield contract to date has highlighted these criticisms the 109 th congress considered several measures to improve project bioshield results including s 3 gregg s 975 lieberman s 1873 burr s 1880 kennedy s 2564 burr and hr 5533 rogers congress incorporated some of the proposals in these bills into the pandemic and allhazards preparedness act title iv this law requires the hhs secretary to develop and make public strategic plan to guide hhs research and development and procurement of countermeasures it also creates the biodefense advanced research and development authority barda in hhs this office is to help impl ement the strategic plan directly support countermeasure advanced development and facilitate communication between the government and countermeasure developers this law allows hhs to make milestonebased payments for project bioshield contracts which do not have to be repaid even if the product is never delivered it also permits the hhs secretary to hold meetings and execute specific agreements with multiple potential countermeasure developers that would ot herwise violate antitrust laws contingent on prior approval of the attorney general and the chairman of the federal trade commission since fy2002 congress has provided approximately 7 billion in grants to states to build public health and hospital preparedness for public health threats presumably due to national security concerns and other sensitivities hhs has not published comprehensive or statespecific information regarding states performance towa rd meeting the objectives for these grant programs congress has been keenly interested in the management of these grants on topics ranging from the relevance of broad program goals in

state funding shares to issues of program transparency the pandemic and allhazards preparedness act extended the programs adding certain new program elements in cluding federal authority to withhold funds for failure to meet program requirements state matching requirement and requirement that the secretary of hhs publish certain information about program activities and performance on federal internet website available to the public there was considerable discussion in the 109th congress regarding whether medical disaster response could function effectively when the national disaster medical system ndms key federal medical response asset was based at dhs rather than at hhs8 ndms had been transferred from hhs to dhs in pl 107296 the homeland security act effective when the new department was created in 2003 in studying the response to hurricane katrina congressional and white house investigators found that among other problems ndms deployments were made by fema without the k nowledge or involvement of personnel at hhs 9 the pandemic and allhazards preparedness act transferred ndms back to hhs effective january 1 200710 congress also made this transfer in the postkatrina act the transfer was supported by the administration11 key to the management of incidents of bioterrorism or emerging infectious disease threats is the ability to detect the incidents early and to distribute countermeasures to affected populations in time to prevent or cure illness an element of early detection are the information systems used to report and compare variety of types of relevant information in timely manner across jurisdictions the pandemic and allhazards preparedness act requires the secretary of hhs to establish national electronic network for sharing of public health surveillance information in nearreal time and authorizes grants to states to establish or operate systems in this network the act also requires the secretary to establish nationwide system to track influenza vaccine that may be used during pandemic and to identify ways to expand the use of telehealth capabilities in emergency response achieving nearrealtime national information systems for disease detection or resource tracking is complicated by the need to develop common set of data standards to serve multiple purposes at the same time the systems must address concerns about the privacy and security of personal health information as well as commercially sensitive information such as the health status of foodproducing animals or the quantities and distribution pathways of patented medicines 12 8 ndms consists of number of medical response teams that can deploy to scene rapidly and set up selfsustaining field operations for up to 72 hours until additional federal support arrives additional information about ndms is available in crs report rl33096 2005 gulf coast hurricanes the public health and medical response by sarah lister 9 see the us house of
