legislative attorney december 10 2008 abstract obscenity apparently is unique in being the only type of speech to which the supreme court has denied first amendment protection without regard to whether it can cause harm according to the court there is evidence that at the time of the adoption of the first amendment obscenity was outside the protection intended for speech and press consequently obscenity may be banned simply because legislature concludes that banning it protects the social interest in order and moralityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95804g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press in general the first amendment protects pornography with this term being used to mean any erotic material the supreme court however has held that the first amendment does not protect two types of pornography obscenity and child pornography consequently they may be banned on the basis of their content and federal law prohibits the mailing of obscenity as well as its transport or receipt in interstate or foreign commerce most pornography is not legally obscene to be obscene pornography must at minimum depict or describe patently offensive hard core sexual conduct the supreme court has created threepart test known as the miller test to determine whether work is obscene pornography that is not obscene may not be banned but may be regulated as to the time place and manner of its distribution particularly in order to keep it from children thus the courts have upheld the zoning and licensing of pornography dealers as well as restrictions on dialaporn nude dancing and indecent radio and television broadcasting federal statutes in addition to making it crime to mail obscenity or to transport or receive it in interstate or foreign commerce provide for crim inal and civil forfeiture of real and personal property used in making obscenity pornography and of the profits of obscenityin some instances even when they were already used to pay third party in addition obscenity crimes are included among the predicate offenses that may give rise to violation of the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico the internet has given rise to three federal statutes designed to protect minors from sexual material posted on it the communications decency act of 1996 makes it crime knowingly to use telecommunications device telephone fax or email to make an obscene or indecent communication to minor or knowingly to use an interactive computer service to transmit an obscene communication to anyone or an indecent communication to minor in 1997 however the supreme court held the inclusion of indecent communications in this statute unconstitutional in 1998 congress in response enacted the lessbroad child online protection act copa but it was also held unconstitutional and never took effect finally the childrens internet protection act cipa enacted in 2000 requires schools and libraries that accept federal funds to purchase computers or internet access to block or filter obscenity child pornography and with respect to minors material that is harmful to minors filters may be disabled however for bona fide research or other lawful purpose in 2003 the supreme court held cipa constitutional httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95804g17g139g156g140

congress enumerated in the constitution and must not contravene any provision of the constitution two powers enumerated in article i section 8 of th constitution give congress the power to enact statutes regulating or banning pornography the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states and the power to establish post offices and post roads thus congress may enact statutes provided they do not contravene any provision of the constitution that regulate pornography that crosses state or national boundaries is imported or exported or is mailed the provision of the constitution that federal stat utes regulating pornography are most likely to be in danger of contravening is the first amendments provision that congress shall make law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press 1 although pornography in general is protected by the first amendment two types of pornographyobscenity and child pornographyare not2 therefore pornography that does not constitute obscenity or child pornography may ordinarily be regulated only with respect to its time place and manner of distribution3 an outright ban on pornography other than obscenity or child pornography would violate the first amendment unless it served to promote compelling interest and was the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest4 obscenity and child pornography however being without first amendment protection may be totally banned on the basis of their content not only in the absence of compelling governmental interest but in the absence of any evidence of harm obscenity apparently is unique in being the only type of speech to which the supreme court has denied first amendment protection without regard to whether it can cause harm according to the court there is evidence that at the time of th adoption of the first amendment obscenity was outside the protection intended for speech and press 5 consequently obscenity may be banned simply because legislature concludes that banning it protects the social interest in order and morality6 1 despite its mentioning only congress the first amendment applies equally to all branches of the federal

pornography must at minimum depict or describe patently offensive hard core sexual conduct7 the supreme court has created threepart test known as the miller test to determine whether work is obscene the miller test asks whether the average person applying contemporary community standards would find that the work taken as whole appeals to the prurient interest b whether the work depicts or describes in patently offensive way sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law and c whether the work taken as whole lacks serious literary artistic political or scientific value 8 in pope v illinois the supreme court clarified that the first and second prongs of the miller testappeal to prurient interest and patent offensivenessare issues of fact for the jury to determine applying contemporary community standards9 however as for the third prong the proper inquiry is not whether an ordinary memb er of any given community would find serious literary artistic political or scientific value in allegedly obscene material but whether reasonable person would find such value in the material taken as whole10 when federal statute refers to obscenity it should be understood to refer only to pornography that is obscene under the miller standard as application of the statute to other material would ordinarily be unconstitutional however narrowly drawn statutes that serve compelling interest such as protecting minors may be permissible even if they restrict pornography that is not obscene under miller 11 in sable communications of california inc v federal communications commission the supreme court 7 miller v california 413 us 15 27 1973 8 id at 24 citation omitted in brockett v spokane arcades inc 472 us 491 498 1984 the court struck down state statute to the extent that it defined prurient as that which incites lasciviousness or lust the court held that publication was not obscene if it provoked only normal healthy sexual desires to be obscene it must appeal to shameful or morbid interest in nudity sex or excretion in manual enterprises v day 370 us 478 480 1962 the court indicated that photographs of nude male models although they appealed to the prurient interest and lacked literary scientific or other merit were not patently offe nsive merely because they we re aimed at homosexuals in jenkins v georgia 418 us 153 160 1974 the court held that the film carnal knowledge was not obscene writing even though questions of appeal to the prurient interest or of patent offensiveness are essentially questions of fact it would be serious misreading of miller to conclude that juries have unbridled discretion in determining what is patently offensive in jacobellis v ohio 378 us 184 197 1964 justice stewart concurring noted that criminal laws in this area are constitutionally limited to hardcore pornography which he would not attempt to define then followed his famous remark but i know it when i see it and the motion picture involved in this case is not that the motion picture was french film called amants the lovers 9 481 us 497 500 1987 in hamling v united states 418 us 87 105 1974 the court noted that community was not any precise geographic area and suggested that it might be less than an entire state in jenkins v georgia supra note 8 418 us at 157 1974 the court approved trial courts instructions directing jurors to apply community standards without specifying what community 10 justice scalia concurred in the result in pope v illinois but wrote in my view it is quite impossible to come to an objective assessment of at least literary or artistic value there being many accomplished people who have found literature in dada and art in the replica tion of soup can since ratiocination has little to do with esthetics the fabled reasonable man is of little help in the inquiry and would ve to be replaced with perhaps the man of tolerably good tastea description that betrays the lack of an ascertainable standard i think we would be better advised to adopt as legal maxim what has long been the wisdom of mankind gustibus non est disputandum just as there is arguing about taste there is use litigating about it id at 504505 11 in federal communications commission v pacifica foundation 438 us 726 749750 1978 the supreme court continued

physical and psychological wellbeing of minors this interest extends to shielding minors from the influence of literature that is not obscene by adult standards the government may serve this legitimate interest but to withstand constitutional scrutiny it must do so by narrowly drawn regulations without unnecessarily interfering with first amendment freedoms it is not enough to show that the governments ends are compelling the means must be carefully tailored to achieved those ends 12 in sable the supreme court applied these principles to the governments attempt to proscribe dialaporn see section ii b below the supreme court has allowed one exception to the rule that obscenity as defined by miller is not protected under the first amendment in stanley v georgia the court held that mere private possession of obscene material is protected the court wrote whatever may be the justifications for other statutes regulating obscenity we do not think they reach into the privacy of ones own home if the first amendment means anything it means that state has business telling man sitting alone in his house what books he may read or what films he may watch13 subsequently however the supreme c ourt rejected the claim that under stanley there is constitutional right to provide obscene material for private use14 or to acquire it for private use15 the right to possess obscene material does not imply the right to provide or acquire it because the right to possess it reflects more than the laws solicitude to protect the privacies of the life within the home 16 continued upholding the power of the federal communications commission to regulate radio broadcast that was indecent but not obscene wrotewe held in ginsberg v new york 390 us 629 that the governments interest in the wellbeing of its youth and in supporting parents claim to authority in their own household justified the regulation of otherwise protected expression id at 640 and 639 the ease with which children may obtain access to broadcast material coupled with the concerns recognized in ginsberg amply justify special treatment of indecent broadcastingin reno v american civil liberties union 521 us 844 878 1997 the supreme court suggested that the strength of the governments interest in protecting minors may vary depending upon the age of the minor the parental control and the artistic or educational value of the material in question 12 492 us 115 126 1989 citations omitted it might appear that regulations could be narrowly drawn or carefully tailored wit hout being the least restrictive means to further governmental interest but sable on the same page also uses the latter phrase quoted above in the text accompanying note 4 and the court has elsewhere made clear that the

american mini theatres inc the supreme court held that the mere fact that the commercial exploitation of material protected by the first amendment is subject to zoning and other licensing requirements is not sufficient reason for invalidating these ordinances17 in young the court upheld ordinances that required dispersal of adult establishments specifically the ordinances provided that an adult theater could not be located within 1000 feet of any two other regulated uses adult bookstores cabarets bars hotels etc or within 500 feet of residential area in renton v playtime theatres inc the court upheld an ordinance that required that adult theaters be concentrated in limited areas it prohibited adult theaters from locating within 1000 feet of any residential zone single or multiplefamily dwelling church park or school 18 in young the court reasoned that what is ultimately at stake is nothing more than limitation on the place where adult films may be exhibited even though the determination of whether particular film fits that characterization turns on the nature of its content the situation would be quite different if the ordinance had the effect of suppressing or greatly restricting access to lawful speech 19 in renton the court wrote the ordinance by its terms is designed to prevent crime protect the citys retail trade maintain property values and generally protect and preserve the quality of the citys neighborhoods commercial districts and the quality of urban life not to suppress the expression of unpopular views in short the renton ordinance is completely consistent with our definition of contentneutral speech regulations as those that are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech 20 in both young and renton the court found the ordinances in question to be narrow enough to affect only those theaters shown to produce the unwanted secondary effects such as crime21 in this respect they were unlike the regulations th court struck down as overbroad in two other cases in erznoznik v city of jacksonville the ordinance prohibited drivein theaters from showing films containing nudity when the screen was visible from public street22 in schad v mount ephraim the ordinance prohibited live entertainment from broad range of commercial uses permitted in commercial zone the ordinance in this case was used to prosecute an adult bookstore that featured coinoperated booths that permitted customers to watch nude dancing 23 in freedman v maryland the court struck down statute that required the owner or

constitutional the burden of proving that the film is unprotected expression must rest on the censor and the censor must within specified brief period either issue license or go to court to restrain showing the film any restraint imposed in advance of final judicial determination on the merits must similarly be limited to preservation of the status quo for the shortest fixed period compatible with sound judicial resolution the procedure must also assure prompt final judicial decision25 the court cited model for constitutional procedure in kingsley books inc v brown 354 us 436 we upheld new york injunctive procedure designed to prevent the sale of obscene books the statute provides for hearing one day after joinder of issue the judge must hand down his decision within two days after termination of the hearing26 in fwpbs inc v dallas the supreme court considered challenge to city ordinance that regulated sexually oriented businesses through scheme incorporating zoning licensing and inspections and prohibited individuals convicted of certain crimes from obtaining license to operate sexually oriented business for specified period of years27 the ordinance defined sexually oriented business as an adult arcade adult bookstore or adult video store adult cabaret adult motel adult motion picture theater escort agency nude model studio or sexual encounter center28 the court held that the licensing scheme does not provide for an effective limitation on the time within which the licensors decision must be made it also fails to provide an avenue for prompt judicial review so as to minimize suppression of the speech in the event of license denial we therefore hold that the failure to provide these essential safeguards renders the ordinances licensing requirement unconstitutional insofar as it is enforced against those businesses engaged in first amendment activity 29 in city of littleton v zj gifts d4 llc the court upheld citys adult business licensing ordinance30 the court first rejected the citys argument that because the court in fwpbs inc v dallas had used the phrase prompt judicial review rather than prompt final judicial decision which it had used in freedman the first amendment as applied to an adult business licensing scheme demands only an assurance of speedy access to the courts not an assurance of speedy court decision31 the court

citys ordinance satisfied the first amendments requirement of prompt judicial decision the court noted that in case such as freedman involving scheme with rather subjective standards and where denial likely meant complete censorship there was need for special procedural rules imposing special 2 or 3day decisionmaking time limits33 littleton however involved scheme that applies reasonably objective nondiscretionary criteria unrelated to the content of the expressive materials 34 but related instead to matters such as whether the applicant had had an adult business license revoked or suspended and had timely paid taxes fees fines or penalties where as here and as in fwpbs the regulation simply conditions the operation of an adult business on compliance with neutral and nondiscretionary criteria and does not seek to censor content an adult business is not entitled to an unusually speedy judicial decision of the freedman type of course those denied licenses in the future remain free to raise special problems of undue delay in individual cases as the ordinance is applied 35 in angeles v alameda books inc the supreme court reversed grant of summary judgment that had struck down municipal ordinance that prohibited the establishment or maintenance of more than one adult entertainment business in the same building structure or portion thereof36 federal district court had granted summary judgment and the court of appeals for the ninth circuit had affirmed on the ground that the city failed to present evidence upon which it could reasonably rely to demonstrate link between multipleuse adult establishments and negative secondary effects 37 the supreme court reversed finding that the city of angeles may reasonably rely on study it conducted some years before enacting the present version of 1270c to demonstrate that its ban on multipleuse adult establishments serves its interest in reducing crime38 it therefore remanded the case so that the city would have the opportunity to demonstrate this at trial the fourjudge plurality opinion in alameda books held that municipality may rely on any evidence that is reasonably believed to be relevant for demonstrating causal connection between speech and substantial independent governmental interest such as reducing crime or maintaining property values39 justice kennedy whose concurring opinion was necessary for majority added that not only must the city demonstrate that its ordinance has the purpose and effect of suppressing secondary effects it must also demonstrate that it will leave the quantity and accessibility of speech substantially intact40 the four dissenting justices found that the city has failed to show any causal relationship between the breakup policy and elimination or 32

entertainment establishments where the viewers are all consenting adults who have paid to see the dancers in barnes v glen theatre inc the supreme court held that the first amendment does not prevent the government from requiring that dancers wear pasties and gstring when they dance nonobscenely in such establishments42 indiana sought to enforce state statute prohibiting public nudity against two such establishments which asserted first amendment protection the court found that the statute proscribed public nudity across the board not nude dancing as such and therefor imposed only an incidental restriction on expression statute that is intended to suppress speech will be upheld only if it serves compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means to further that interest by contrast under united states v obrien statute that imposes an incidental restriction like one that imposes time place or manner restriction will be upheld if it is narrowly tailored to further substantial but not necessarily compelling governmental interest43 there was majority opinion in the case justice rehnquist joined by justices oconnor and kennedy found the statute more restrictive than necessary to further the governmental interest of protecting societal order and morality 44 justice souter found the relevant governmental interest to be combating the secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments such as prostitution sexual assaults and other criminal activity45 the fifth justice necessary to uphold the nude dancing prohibition justice scalia thought that the case raised first amendment issue at all because the incidental restriction was on conduct not speech and virtually every law restricts conduct and virtually any prohibited conduct can be performed for expressive purposes46 four justices dissented finding insufficient the plurality and justice scalias simple references to the states general interest in promoting societal order and morality the purpose of forbidding people to appear nude in parks beac hes hot dog stands and like public places is to protect others from offense but that could not possibly be the purpose of preventing nude dancing in theaters and barrooms since the viewers are exclusively consenting adults who paid money to see these dances the purpose of the proscription in these contexts is to protect the viewers from what the state believes is the harmful message that nude dancing communicates47 this purpose is impermissible under the first amendment in erie v pap s am the supreme court again upheld the application of statute prohibiting public nudity to an adult entertainment establishment48 although there was again only plurality opinion this time by justice oconnor parts i and ii of that opinion were joined by five 41 id at 460 42 501 us 560 1991 43 391 us 367 1968 44 barnes supra note 42 at 568 45 id at 582 46 id at 576 emphasis in original 47 id at 590591 white j dissenting

that the statute satisfied the obrien test because it was intended to combat harmful secondary effects such as prostitution and other criminal activity49 justice souter however though joining the plurality opinion also dissented in part in erie he continued to believe that secondary effects were an adequate justification for banning nude dancing but did not believe that the city has made sufficient evidentiary showing to sustain its regulation and therefore would have remanded the case for further proceedings 50 he acknowledged his mistake in barnes in failing to make the same demand for evidence51 the plurality opinion in erie found that the effect of eries public nudity ban on the erotic message is minimis because erie allows dancers to perform wearing only pasties and g strings52 it may follow that requiring dancers to wear pasties and gstrings may not greatly reduce secondary effects but obrien requires only that the regulation further the interest of combating such effects not that it further it to particular extent53 justice scalia this time joined by justice thomas again took the view that when conduct other than speech itself is regulated the first amendment is violated only where the government prohibits conduct precisely because of its communicative attributes54 he found therefore that the statute should be upheld without regard to secondary effects but simply as an attempt to foster good morals55 justice stevens dissenting in erie and joined by justice ginsburg wrote until now the secondary effects of commercial enterprises featuring indecent entertainment have justified only the regulation of their location for the first time the court has now held that such effects may justify the total suppression of protected spee ch indeed the plurality opinion concludes that admittedly trivial advancements of states interest may provide the basis for censorship56 it concludes that is that the obrien test can be satisfied by nothing more than the mere possibility of minimis effects on the neighborhood57 the plurality in erie did not address the question of whether statutes prohibiting public nudity could be applied to ban serious

from being sent to them section 3008 provides that person who receives in the mail any pandering advertisement which offers for sale matter which the addressee in his sole discretion believes to be erotically arousing or sexually provocative may request the postal service to issue an order directing the sender to refrain from further mailings to the addressee and the postal service must do so if the postal service believes that sender has violated such an order it may request the attorney general to apply to federal court for an order directing compliance the language of 39 usc 3008 is broad enough to apply to any unwanted advertisement regardless of content as the supreme court indi cated in upholding the constitutionality of the statute we categorically reject the court said the argument that vendor has right under the constitution or otherwise to send unwanted material into the home of another 59 section 3010 provides that any person may file with the postal service statement that he desires to receive sexually oriented advertisements through the mails the postal service shall make the list available and person shall mail or cause to be mailed any sexually oriented advertisement to any individual whose name and address has been on the list for more than 30 days section 3011 provides that if the postal service believes that any person is violating

constitutional in april 1988 however pl 100297 6101 amended section 223b to ban obscene and indecent dial aporn in interstate and foreign communications whether involving adults or children in june 1989 the supreme court declared section 223b unconstitutional insofar as it applies to indecent messages that are not obscene60 the court noted that while the government has legitimate interest in protecting children from exposure to indecent dialaporn messages 223b was not sufficiently narrowly drawn to serve that purpose and thus violated the first amendment 61 credit card access code and scrambling rules would have represented feasible and effective way to serve the governments compelling interest in protecting children62 the government argued that these methods would not be effective enough but the court found evidence in the record to that effect63 the court concluded because the statutes denial of adult access to telephone messages which are ind ecent but not obscene far exceeds that which is necessary to limit the access of minors to such messages we hold that the ban does not survive constitutional scrutiny 64 the upshot of sable was that congresss 1988 extension to adults of the ban on dialaporn that is indecent but not obscene resulted in federal laws t banning such dialaporn at all even if used by minors section 223b after the decision banned dialaporn only if it was obscene therefore in 1989 congress enacted pl 101166 known as the helms amendment which amended section 223b to ban indecent dialaporn if used by persons under 18 under the 1988 law section 223b applied in the district of columbia or in interstate or foreign communications under the helms amendment it applies to all calls within the united states the helms amendment also added section 223c which prohibits telephone companies to the extent technically feasible from providing access to any dialaporn from the telephone of any subscriber who has not previously requested it in writing in order to enable telephone companies to comply with this provision federal communications commission regulations require dialaporn providers to give written notice to the telephone company that they are providing indecent communications 47 cfr 64201 65 the helms amendment was challenged as unconstitutional but federal court of appeals upheld it and the supreme court declined to review the case66

profane language by means of radio communication shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years or both72 this statute unlike the others cited thus far may be applied to language that is not obscene under miller this is because broadcasting has more limited first amendment protection than other media as the supreme court explained in red lion broadcasting co v federal communications commission where there are substantially more individuals who want to broadcast than there are frequencies to allocate it is idle to posit an unabridgeable first amendment right to broadcast comparable to the right of every individual to speak write or publish73 in federal communications commission v pacifica foundation the fcc had taken action against radio station for broadcasting recording of george carlins filthy words monologue at 2 pm and the station had claimed first amendment protection74 the supreme court upheld the power of the fcc under 1464 to regulate radio broadcast that is indecent but not obscene75 the court cited two distinctions between broadcasting and other media first the broadcast media have established uniquely pervasive presence in the lives of all americans confronting the citizen not only in public but also in the privacy of the home and second broadcasting is uniquely accessible to children76 71 united states v keller 259 f2d 54 57 58 3d cir 1958 72 this statute dates back to section 326 of the communications act of 1934 48 stat 1091 which is why it refers only to language and not pictures and to radio and not television the term radio however today includes broadcast television ie television transmitted over radio waves in di ctum the supreme court quoted the fcc with approval as noting that the televising of nudes might well raise serious question of programming contrary to 18 usc 1464 federal communications commission v pacifica foundation 438 us 726 741 n16 1978 not addressing whether nudes are language under 1464

protection and the court emphasized the narrowness of its holding this case does not involve twoway radio conversation between cab driver and dispatcher or telecast of an elizabethan co medy we have not decided that an occasional expletive in either setting would justify any sanction the time of day was emphasized by the commission the content of the program in which the language is used will also affect the composition of the audience 77 section 1464 as quoted above refers to obscene indecent or profane language the court in pacifica noted that to be indecent broadcast need not have prurient appeal the normal definition of indecent merely refers to nonconformance with accepted standards of morality78 the fcc holds that the concept is intimately connected with the exposure of children to language that describes in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium sexual or excretory activities and organs at times of the day when there is reasonable risk that children may be in the audience 79 in 1988 congress enacted pl 100459 608 which required the fcc to promulgate regulations to ban indecent broadcasts 24 hours day the fcc did so but the regulations never took effect because the court of appeals declared the ban unconstitutional because the commission may not ban such broadcasts entirely80 in 1992 congress enacted pl 102356 16 of which required the fcc to promulgate regula tions that prohibit broadcasting of indecent programming on radio and television from 6 am to midnight except for public radio and television stations that go off the air at or before midnight which may broadcast such material beginning at 10 pm 47 usc 303 note in 1993 threejudge panel of the us court of appeals for the district of columbia held the law unconstitutional but on june 30 1995 the full court of appeals by 74 vote overturned the panel and upheld the statute except for its 10 pm tomidnight ban imposed on nonpublic stations 81 the court of appeals found that the government has compelling interest in supporting parental supervision of what children see and hear on the public airwaves82 and that the government has an independent and compelling interest in preventing minors from being exposed to indecent broadcasts83 the court found in addition that the statute used the least restrictive means to serve these interests84 however the court found that congress has failed to explain what if any 77 pacifica supra note 74 438 us at 750 federal court of appeals subsequently held unconstitutional federal statute

stations bears to the compelling government interestor to any other legislative valuethat congress sought to advance when it enacted section 16a85 the court therefore held that the section is unconstitutional insofar as it bars the broadcasting of indecent speech between the hours of 1000 pm and midnight86 in 2003 on the broadcast of the golden globe awards the singer bono said that his winning an award was fing bri lliant the fcc forcement bureau found that use of the word as an adjective or expletive to emphasize an exclamation did not fall within the definition of indecent the commission however overturned the bureau ruling that any use of that word or variation in any context inherently has sexual connotation th commission also found that bonos phrase was profane under 1464 defining profane as those personally reviling epithets naturally tending to provoke violent resentment or denoting language so grossly offensive to members of the public who actually hear it as to amount to nuisance 87 in 2006 the fcc took action against four other television broadcasts that contained fleeting expletives but in 2007 the us court of appeals for the second circuit found that the fccs new policy regarding fleeting expletives represents significant departure from positions previously taken by the agency and relied on by the broadcast industry we further find that the fcc has failed to articulate reasoned basis for this change in policy accordingly we hold that the fccs new policy regarding fleeting expletives is arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act 88 having overturned the fcc policy on statutory grounds the court had occasion to decide whether it also violated the first amendment it explained however why it was skeptical that the commission can provide reasonable explanation for its fleeting expletive regime that would pass constitutional muster89 the supreme court has agreed to hear the case in 2008 the us court of appeals for the third circuit issued unanimous decision invalidating the fccs fine against cbs broadcasting station affiliates for broadcasting janet jacksons exposure of her breast for ninesixteenths of second during superbowl halftime show90 the court found that the fcc had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in finding the incident indecent the court did not address the first amendment question

railroads even if such facility were used only intrastate the term means of interstate commerce would include motor vehicles boats and airplanes capable of carrying goods in interstate commerce the

transmitting obscenity from california over interstate phone lines through their membersonly computer bulletin board the sixth circuit affirmed holdi ng that 18 usc 1465 applies to computer transmissions93 the defendants had also raised first amendment issue arguing that they cannot select who gets the materials they make available on their bulletin boards therefore they contend bbs bulletin board service operators like defendants will be forced to censor their materials so as not to run afoul of the standards of the community with the most restrictive standards 94 the court did not decide the issue because it found that in this case the defendants had transmitted only to members whose addresses they knew so if defendants did not wish to subject themselves to liability in jurisdictions with less tolerant standards for determining obscenity they could have refused to give passwords to members in those districts thus precluding the risk of liability95 in 1996 pl 104104

has little to do with case that involves the effects of television viewing on children100 in part ii of the denver consortium opinion plurality four justices upheld 10a of the cable television consumer protection and competition act of 1992 47 usc 532h which permits cable operators to prohibit indecent material on leased access channels101 in upholding 10a the court citing pacifica noted that cable television is as accessible to children as overtheair broadcasting has also established uniquely pervasive presence in the lives of all americans and can also confront the citizen in the privacy of the home with little or prior warning102 applying something less than strict scrutiny the court concluded that 10a is sufficiently tailored response to an extraordinarily important problem103 it also found that the statute is not impermissibly vague104 in part iii of denver consortium majority six justices struck down 10b of the 1992 act 47 usc 532j which required cable operators if they do not prohibit such programming on leased access channels to segregate it on single channel and block that channel unless the subscriber requests access to it in writing in this part of the opinion the court appeared to apply strict scrutiny finding that protection of children is compelling interest but that not only is 10b not least restrictive alternative and is not narrowly tailored to meet its legitimate objective it also seems considerably more extensive than necessary105 in part iv which only three justices joined the court struck down 10c 42 usc 531 note which permitted cable operators to prohibit indecent material on public access channels without specifying the level of scrutiny they were applying the justices concluded that the government cannot sustain its burden of showing that 10c is necessary to protect children or that it is appropriately tailored to secure that end106 another relevant statute concerning cable televisi on is 47 usc 544d1 which provides that franchising authority and cable operator may specify in granting or renewing franchise that certain cable services shall not be provided or shall be provided subject to conditions if such cable services are obscene or are otherwise unprotected by the constitution of the united states in addition 47 usc 544d2a provides in order to restrict the viewing of programming which is obscene or indecent upon the request of subscriber cable operator shall provide by sale or lease device by which the subscriber can prohibit viewing of particular cable service during period selected by that subscriber the communications decency act of 1996 pl 104104 which is known primarily for its provisions regulating computertransmitted indecency also contained provisions concerning cable 100 518 us 727 748 1996 101 the cable communications policy act of 1984 pl 98549 had required cable operators to provide leased access and public access channels free of operator editorial control 47 usc 531e 532c2 these two provisions were amended in 1996 by 506 of the communications decency act to permit cable operators to refuse to transmit obscenity indecency or nudity 102 denver consortium supra

1934 47 usc 560 which provides upon request by cable service subscriber cable operator shall without charge fully scramble or otherwise fully block the audio and video programming of each channel carrying such programming so that one not subscriber does not receive it this section includes restriction on the type of material that subscriber may request to have blocked section 505 added 641 47 usc 561 which provides in providing sexually explicit adult programming or other programming that is indecent on any channel of its service primarily dedi cated to sexuallyoriented programming mul tichannel video programming distributor shall fully scramble or otherwise fully block the video and audio portion of such channel so that one not subscriber does not receive it b until multichannel video programming distributor complies with the requirement set forth in subsection the distributor shall limit the access of children to the programming referred to in that subsection by not providing such programming during the hours of the day as determined by the federal communications commission when significant number of children are likely to be viewing it in 2000 the supreme court declared 505 unconstitutional making clear as it had not in denver consortium that strict scrutiny applies to contentbased speech restrictions on cable television107 the court noted that the purpose of 505 is to shield children from hearing or seeing images resulting from signal bleed which refers to images or sounds that come through to non subscribers even though cable operators have used scrambling in the regular course of business so that only paying customers had access to certain programs108 section 505 requires cable operators to implement more effective scramblingto fully scramble or otherwise fully block programming so that nonsubscribers do not receive itor to time channel which under an fcc regulation meant to transmit the programming only from 10 pm to 6 am to comply with the statute the court noted the majority of cable operators adopted the second or time channeling approach109 the effect was to eliminate altogether the transmission of the targeted programming outside the safe harbor period 6 am to 10 pm in affected cable service areas in other words for twothirds of the day household in those service areas could receive the programming whether or not the household or the viewer wanted to do so110 the court also noted that the speech in question was not thought by congress to be so harmful that all channels were subject to 107 united states

channels primarily dedicated to sexuallyoriented programming111 since 505 is contentbased speech restriction the court wrote it can stand only if it satisfies strict scrutiny if statute regulates speech based on content it must be narrowing tailored to promote compelling government interest if less restrictive alternative would serve the governments purpose the legislature must use that alternative112 the court did not explicitly say in this case that protecting children from sexually oriented signal bleed is compelling interest but would not discount the possibility that graphic image could have negative impact on young child113 instead it addressed the question of whether 505 constituted the least restrictive means to advance that interest the court noted that there is key difference between cable television and the broadcasting media which is the point on which this case turns cable systems have the capacity to block unwanted channels on householdbyhousehold basis targeted blocking enables the government to support parental authority without affecting the first amendment interests of speakers and willing listeners114 furthermore targeted blocking is already requiredby 504 of the cda which as noted above requires cable operators upon request by cable service subscriber to without charge fully scramble or otherwise fully block audio and video programming that the subscriber does not wish to receive when plausible less restrictive alternative is offered to contentbased speech restriction it is the governments obligation to prove that the alternative will be ineffective to achieve its goal the government has not met that burden here 115 the court concluded therefore that 504 with adequate publicity to parents of their rights under it constituted less restrictive alternative to 505 one additional provision of the cda affected cable television 506 amended 47 usc 531e and 532c2 to permit cable operators to refuse to transmit obscenity indecency or nudity on public access and leased access channels116

plaintiffs request because it found that the provisions regulate only obscene communications the supreme court affirmed without written opinion the plaintiffs reportedly had appealed because they believed that the fact that the word indecent was in the statute could have chilling effect on indecent nonobscene expression even if the law was not enforceable against such expression 119 section 3

not propose commercial transaction to be deemed to be for commercial purposes requiring viewer to use credit card or to verify his age to gain access to material on the internet would constitute defense to prosecution in light of the supreme courts decision in reno is copa constitutional the fact that copa makes exceptions for messages with serious literary artistic political or scientific value for minors and that it applies only to commercial websites makes it more likely than the cda to be upheld nevertheless it may well like the cda be found to suppress large amount of speech that adults have constitutional right to receive and to address to one another 135 this is because website that is freely accessible but is deemed commercial because it seeks to make profit through advertisements would apparently have to stop making its website freely accessible or in the alternative would have to remove all words and pictures that might be deemed harmful to minors by the standards of the community most likely to be offended by the message136 copa was scheduled to take effect on november 20 1998 but coalition of 17 civil liberties groups filed suit challenging it and on november 19 judge reed of the federal district court in philadelphia finding that there was likelihood that the plaintiffs would prevail issued temporary restraining order against enforcement of the law on february 1 1999 he issued preliminary injunction against enforcement pending trial on the merits the preliminary injunction applies to all internet users not just the plaintiffs in this case and provides that even if the law is ultimately upheld the administration may not prosecute online speakers retroactively on june 22 2000 the us court of appeals for the third circuit upheld the preliminary injunction as it was confident that th aclus attack on copas constitutionality is likely to succeed on the merits 137 on may 13 2002 the supreme court vacated the third circuits opinion and remanded the case for further proceedings it did not however remove the preliminary injunction against enforcement of the statute on march 6 2003 the third circuit again affirmed the district courts preliminary injunction and on june 29 2004 the supreme court also affirmed the preliminary injunction and it remanded the case for trial on march 22 2007 federal district court found copa to be unconstitutional and issued permanent injunction against its enforcement on july 22 2008 the third circuit affirmed we now consider these seven opinions in turn in issuing the preliminary injunction the district court found that it is clear that congress has compelling interest in the protection of minors including shielding them from materials that are not obscene by adult standards 138 it also found however that it is not apparent to this court that the defendant can meet its burden to prove that copa is the least restrictive means available 134 despite the fact that only the first prong of this test refers to community standards community standards are also to be used in applying the second prong see the supreme courts first decision in ashcroft v aclu supra note 132 535 us at 576 n7

this material139 this is because the record before the court reveals that blocking or filtering technology may be at least as successful as copa would be in restricting minors access to harmful material online without imposing the burden on constitutionally protected speech that copa imposes on adult users or website operators140 in addition the sweeping category of forms of content that are prohibited any communication picture image graphic image file article recording writing or other matter of any kind emphasis added by the courtcould have been less restrictive of speech on the web and more narrowly tailored to congress goal of shielding minors from pornographic teasers if the prohibited forms of content had included for instances only pictures images or graphic image files which are typically employed by adult entertainment websites as teasers in addition perhaps the goals of congress could be served without the imposition of possibly excessive and serious criminal penalties including imprisonment and hefty fines for communicating speech that is protected as to adults or without exposing speakers to prosecution and placing the burden of establishing an affirmative defense on them instead of incorporating the substance of the affirmative defenses in the elements of the crime 141 on appeal the third circuit affirmed on different ground because the standard by which copa gauges whether material is harmful to minors is based on identifying contemporary community standards the inability of web publishers to restrict access to their websites based on the geographic locale of the site visitor in and of itself imposes an impermissible burden on constitutionally protected first amendment speech 142 this is because it results in communications available to nationwide audience being judged by the standards of the community most likely to be offended applying strict scrutiny the third circuit concluded that though it is undisputed that the government has compelling interest in protecting children from material that is harmful to them even if not obscene by adult standards 143 the government may not regulate at all if it turns out that even the least restrictive means of regulation is still unreasonable when its limitations on freedom of speech are balanced against the benefits gained from those limitations144 the supreme court held that copas use of community standards to identify material that is harmful to minors does not render the statute facially unconstitutionalit does not by itself render the statute substantially overbroad for purposes of the first amendment145 although there were five separate opinions in the case eight of the nine justices favored remanding the case to the third circuit to consider whether the act was nevertheless unconstitutional only justice stevens dissented as only he believed that the use of community standards was sufficient problem to warrant an affirmance of the third circuits opinion 139 id at 497 140

does not by itself render the statute unconstitutional implies that copa s use of community standards may nevertheless prove factor among others that renders the statute unconstitutional justice thomas however despite writing the opinion for the court including the by itself language quoted above wrote in section of the opinion joined only by chief justice rehnquist and justice scalia that any variance caused by the statutes reliance on community standards is not substantial enough to violate the first amendment 146 justice thomas also commented if publisher wishes for its material to be judged only by the standards of particular communities and not by the most puritanical community then it need only take the simple step of utilizing medium medium other than the internet that enables it to target the release of its materials into those communities147 justice stevens responded that the court should place the burden on parents to take the simple step of utilizing medium that enables them to avoid this material before requiring the speaker to find another forum148 justice kennedy in concurring opinion joined by justices souter and ginsburg found that we cannot know whether vari ation in community standards renders the act substantially overbroad without first assessing the extent of speech covered and the variations in community standards with respect to that speech149 justice kennedy believed that before an assessment could be made the third circuit should consider such questions as how much material copa prohibits how much the standard of the most puritanical community in the nation differ from standards of other communities what it means to evaluate internet material as whole and the number of venues in which the government could prosecute violations of the act 150 justices oconnor and breyer wrote separate conc urring opinions justice oconnor agreed with justice kennedy that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate substantial overbreadth due solely to the variation between local communities 151 and justice breyer to avoid first amendment problem would have construed the phrase community standard in the statute to mean national standard on remand the third circuit again affirmed the district courts preliminary injunction it held that the following provisions of copa are not narrowly tailored to achieve the governments compelling interest in protecting minors from harmful material and therefore fail the strict scrutiny test the definition of material that is harmful to minors b the definition of commercial purposes and c the affirmative defenses available to publishers which require the technological screening of users for the purpose of age verification152 as for the definition of material that is harmfu l to minors the court found that the requirement that material be judged as whole in determining whether it was designed to appeal to the prurient interests of minors and to lack serious value for minors meant that each individual communication picture image exhibit etc be deemed whole by itself rather than in 146 id 147 id at 583 148 id at 606 n2 149 id at 597 150 id at 600 151 id at 589 152 322 f3d 240 251 3d cir

harmful material might not be deemed to appeal to the prurient interest of minor s if it were to be viewed in the context of an entire collection of renaissance artwork154 the court also found the word minor in the definition of material that is harmful to minor s to be not narrowly drawn to achieve the statutes purpose because it precludes web publishers from knowing whether an infant five year old or person just shy of age seventeen should be considered in determining whether the content of their website has serious value for those minors or will trigger the prurient interest or be patently offensive with respect to those minors 155 as for the definition of commercial purposes the court was satisfied that copa is not narrowly tailored to proscribe commercial pornographers and their ilk as the government contends but instead prohibits wide range of protected expression156 as for the affirmative defense available to publishers the court found that it will likely deter many adults from accessing restricted content because many web users are simply unwilling to provide identification information in order to gain access to content157 the third circuit also found that voluntary blocking and filtering techniques may be substantially less restrictive than copa in achieving copas objective of preventing minors access to harmful material158 finally it held that the plaintiffs will more probably prove at trial that copa is substantially overbroad and therefore we will affirm the district court on this independent ground as well 159 in 2004 the supreme court by 54 vote affirmed the preliminary injunction and remanded the case for trial the court in an opinion by justice kennedy found that the district court had not abused its discretion in granting preliminary injunction because the government had failed to show that proposed alternatives to copa would not be as effective in accomplishing its goal the court did not address the third circuits conclusions that various terms used in copa rendered it unconstitutional the primary alternative to copa the court noted is blocking and filtering software filters are less restrictive than copa because they impose selective restrictions on speech at the receiving end not universal restriction at the source 160 in addition filters may be more effective than copa because filter can prevent minors from seeing all pornography not just the 60 of all internet pornography posted to the web from america and filters can be applied to all forms of internet communication including email not just communications available via the world wide web161 furthermore more and better filtering alternatives may exist than when the district court entered its findings and congressionally appointed

concluding upon proper showing by the government that meets the governments constitutional burden as defined in this opinion that copa is the least restrictive alternative available to accomplish congress goal163 justice breyer in his dissent found that copas burden on protected speech is more than modest as it would limit legally obscene material and very little more164 further copa does not censor the material it covers but merely requires providers of the harmful to minors material to restrict minors access to it by verifying age 165 justice breyer then wrote that blocking and filtering software is not less restrictive alternative because it is part of the status quo and it is always less restrictive to do nothing than to do something 166 in addition breyer asserted filtering software depends upon parents willing to decide where their children will surf the web and able to enforce that decision167 the majority opinion countered that congress may act to encourage the use of filters and the need for parental cooperation does not automatically disqualify proposed less restrictive alternative168 justice breyer also noted four serious inadequacies of filters and found that copas application to 60 percent of the internets commercial pornography is not insignificant169 justice breyers dissent was joined by two other justices and justice scalia wrote separate dissent claiming that harmfulto minors material is not protected by the first amendment upon remand the district court as noted above found copa to be unconstitutional170 the grounds for its decision were that copa is not narrowly tailored to congress compelling interest the attorney general failed to meet his burden of showing that copa is the least restrictive most effective alternative in achieving the compelling interest and copa is impermissibly vague and overbroad171 the court found copa to be overinclusive which means that it prohibited more speech than is necessary to further congress compelling interest as it covers more than just commercial pornographers and applies to speech that is obscene as to all minors from newborns to age sixteen and not just to speech that is obscene as to older minors 172 the court also found copa to be underinclusive as it does not apply to significant amount of sexually explicit material on the internet which originates from outside of the united states which is one reason the court found that copa would not be not as effective as alternatives such as filters would be in achieving its ends 173 in 2008 the third circuit affirmed finding that copa does not employ the least restrictive alternative to advance the governments compelling interest and is also vague and overbroad174 in 2009 the supreme court declined to review the case 163 id at

or to pay the direct costs of accessing the internet and may not receive universal service discounts other than for telecommunications services unless the school or library enforces policy that includes the operation of technology protection measure that blocks or filters minors internet access to visual depictions that are obscene child pornogra phy or harmful to minors and that blocks or filters adults internet access to visual depictions that are obscene or child pornography 175 the sections of cipa 1711 and 1712 that require schools and libraries to block or filter if they use federal funds for computers or for internet access provide that the blocking or filtering technology may be disabled to enable access for bona fide research or other lawful purpose the section of cipa 1721 that requires schools and libraries to block or filter if they receive universal service discounts provides that the blocking or filtering technology may be disabled during use by an adult to enable access for bona fide research or other lawful purpose sections 1711 1712 and 1721 all contain identical definitions of minor obscene child pornography and harmful to minors they define minor as person under 17 they define obscene to have the meaning given such term in18 usc 1460 but that section does not define obscene 176 in the absence of statutory definition the courts will doubt apply the miller test to define the word sections 1711 1712 and 1721 all define child pornography to have the meaning given such term in 18 usc 2256 that section defines chi ld pornography as any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct that is or appears to be of minor and defines sexually explicit conduct as various actual or simulated sexual acts or the lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person child pornography need not be obscene under the miller test it is unprotected by the first amendment even if it does not appeal to the prurient interest is not patently offensive and does not lack serious literary artistic scientific or political value sections 1711 1712 and 1721 define material that is harmful to minors as any communication that i taken as whole and with respect to minors appeals to prurient interest in nudity sex or excretion ii depicts describes or represents in patently offensive way with respect to what is suitable for minors an actual or simulated sexual act or sexual contact actual or simulated normal or perverted sexual acts or lewd exhibition of the genitals and 175 section 1711 amends title iii of the elementary and secondary

code except 20 usc 952 l which defines it for purposes of grants by the national endowment for the arts and does so in manner that parallels the miller test except that it does not apply community

or scientific value as to minors177 in united states v american library association threejudge federal district court unanimously declared cipa unconstitutional and enjoined its enforcement insofar as it applies to libraries178 cipa like the cda but unlike copa authorizes the government to appeal directly to the supreme court and the government did so in 2003 the supreme court reversed the district court finding cipa constitutional179 the decision included fourjustice plurality opinion by chief justice rehnquist concurring opinions by justices kennedy and breyer and diss enting opinions by justices stevens and souter the latter joined by justice ginsburg the pl urality noted that congress may not induce the recipient of federal funds to engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional180 the plurality therefore viewed the question before the court as whether public libraries would violate the first amendment by employing the filtering software that cipa requires181 does cipa in other words effectively violate library patrons rights the plurality concluded that it does not in so concluding the plurality found that internet access in public libraries is neither traditional or designated public forum182 and that therefore it would not be appropriate to apply strict scrutiny to determine whether the filtering requirements are constitutional183 this means that the government did not have to demonstrate that cipa serves compelling interest though justice kennedy in his concurrence noted that all members of the court appear to agree that it does184 or that cipa does so by the least restrictive means the district court had found that less restrictive alternatives to filtering software would suffice to meet congress goals 185 177 this threepart test is similar to that of the child onli ne protection act 47 usc 231e but three differences are that cipa applies only to visual depictions whereas copa applies also to words cipa does not like copa provide that the determinations of prurience and patent offensiveness see note 134 supra be made in accordance with the views of the average person applying contemporary community standards and cipa does not like copa allow visual depiction of postpubescent female breast to be found harmful to minors 178 201 f supp 2d 401 ed pa 2002 the district court struck down 1712a2 which concerns lsta funds and 1721b

content it disfavors 201 f supp 2d 401 457 460 ed pa 2002 183 the reason the plurality found that internet access in public libraries is not public forum is that public library does not acquire internet terminals in order to create public forum for web publishers to express themselves any more than it collects books in order to provide public forum for authors of books to speak it provides

to overblockthat is to erroneously block access to constitutionally protected speech that falls outside the categories that software users intend to block186 it found however that assuming that such erroneous blocking presents constitutional difficulties any such concerns are dispelled by the ease with which patrons may have the filtering software disabled187 the plurality also considered whether cipa imposes an unconstitutional condition on the receipt of federal assistancein other words does it violate public libraries rights by requiring them to limit their freedom of speech if they accept federal funds the plurality found that assuming that government entities have first amendment rights it did not decide the question cipa does not infringe them this is because cipa does not deny benefit to libraries that do not agree to use filters rather the statute simply insists that public funds be spent for the purposes for which they were authorized 188 cipa does not penalize libraries that choose not to install such software or deny them the right to provide their patrons with unfiltered internet access rather cipa simply reflects congress decision not to subsidize their doing so189 in effect then the plurality seemed to view cipa as raising first amendment issue other than the possible one of overblocking which it found the statute to deal with adequately by its disabling provisions justice kennedy concurring noted that if some libraries do not have the capacity to unblock specific websites or to disable the filter or if it is shown that an adult users election to view constitutionally protected internet material is burdened in some other substantial way that would be the subject for an asapplied challenge not the facial challenge made in this case 190 justice breyer would have applied form of heightened scrutiny greater than rational basis scrutiny but more flexible than strict scrutiny to assess cipas constitutionality191 he would ask whether the harm to speechrelated interests is disproportionate in light of both the justifications and the potential alternatives192 applying this test he concurred that cipa is constitutional justice stevens found cipa unconstitutional because of its vast amount of overblocking which he found not cured by the disabling provisions because until blocked site or group of sites is unblocked patron is unlikely to know what is being hidden and therefore whether there is any point in asking for the filter to be removed 193 186 id at 208 the threejudge court had found that at least tens of thousands of pages of the indexable web are overblocked by each of the filtering programs evaluated by experts in this case even when considered against the filtering companies own category definitions many errone ously blocked pages contain content that is completely innocuous for both adults and minors and that rational person could conclude matches the filtering companies category definitions such as pornography or sex 201 f supp 2d at 449 187 id at 209 188 id at 211 for additional information on the issue of unconstitutional conditions see crs report 95815 freedom of speech and press exceptions to the first

the majority of my colleagues that an adult library patron could consistently with the act obtain an unblocked terminal simply for the asking but the federal communications commission in its order implementing the act pointedly declined to set federal policy on when unblocking by local libraries would be appropriate under the statute moreover the district court expressly found that unblocking may take days and may be unavailable especially in branch libraries which are often less well staffed than main libraries 194 further the statute says only that library may unblock not that it must195

to add the obscenity crimes specified in 18 usc 14611465 to the definition of racketeering activity in 18 usc 19611b rico makes it crime for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce to participate in the affairs of the enterprise through pattern of racketeering activity 18 usc 1962c pattern of racketeering activity means at least two acts of racketeering activity within ten years excluding any period of impr isonment 18 usc 19615 thus if person engages in two such activities including the obscenity offenses specified he is subject to prosecution under rico in addition to or instead of prosecution for the particular activities rico also provides for criminal forfeiture 18 usc 1963 and its criminal forfeiture provision has been used in obscenity prosecutions see alexander v united states infra in fort wayne books inc v indiana the supreme court held that pretrial seizure under the indiana rico statute of books or other expressive materials was unconstitutional 199 although probable cause to believe that person has committed crime is sufficient to arrest him probable cause to believe that there are valid grounds for seizure is insufficient to interrupt the sale of presumptively protected books and films200 this presumption of first amendment protection is not rebutted until the claimed justification for seizing books or other publications is properly established in an adversary proceeding201 the federal rico statute in any event does not provide for pretrial seizure202 199 489 us 46 1989 200 id

constitutionality of including obscenity violations among the predicate offenses under rico statute the court rejected the argument that the potential punishments available under the rico law are so severe that the statute lacks necessary sensitivity to first amendment rights203 further the court held that such obscenity violations need not be affirmed convictions on successive dates in the same jurisdiction as that where the rico charge is brought204 the fact that the violations need not be affirmed convictions means that the obscenity violations may be proved as part of the rico prosecuti on warning shot in the form of prior conviction for obscenity is required as long as the standard of proof is the proper one with respect to all the elements of the rico allegationincluding proof beyond reasonable doubt of the requisite number of constitutionallyproscribable predicate actsall of the relevant constitutional requirements have been met 205 the fact that the predicate offenses need not be convictions in the same jurisdiction as that where the rico charge is brought means that the predicate offenses can be violations which were based on community standards different from those of the jurisdiction where the rico charge is brought206 but as long as for example each previous obscenity conviction was measured by the appropriate communitys standard we see reason why the rico prosecutionalleging pattern of such violationsmay take place only in jurisdiction where two or more such offenses have occurred 207 in alexander v united states the supreme court addressed question it had left open in fort wayne books whether there are first amendment limitations to rico forfeitures of assets that consist of expressive materials that are otherwise protected by the first amendment208 the defendant in the case had been found guilty of selling four magazines and three videotapes that were obscene and on that basis had been convicted under rico he was sentenced to six years in prison fined 100000 and ordered to pay the cost of prosecution incarceration and supervised release he was also ordered to forfeit all his wholesale and retail businesses including more than dozen stores and theaters dealing in sexually explicit material all the assets of these businesses ie expressive materials whether or not obscene and almost 9 million the government chose to destroy rather than sell the expressive material the supreme court rejected the argument that the forfeiture of expressive materials constitutes prior restraint as the forfeiture order does not forbid petitioner from engaging in any expressive activities in the future nor does it require him to obtain prior approval for any expressive 203 id at 57 204 id at 61 205 id 206 this could be the case even in rico prosecution based on predicate offenses in different part of the same state as the relevant community may be an area less than the entire state see hamling v united states 418 us 87 105 1974 207 489 us at 62 although the court uses the word conviction in this sentence there appears to be reason why rico prosecution could not be based on violation in another jurisdiction that had not previously been prosecuted in that jurisdiction in such case the prosecution would have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the laws including in an obscenity case the community standards of the state where the predicate offense occurred had been violated 208 509 us 544 1993 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95804g17g139g156g140

normal first amendment standards and could see reason why if incarceration for six years and fine of 100000 are permissible forms of punishment under the rico statute the challenged forfeiture of certain assets directly related to petitioners racketeering activity is not the first amendment does not prohibit either stringent criminal sanctions for obscenity offenses or forfeiture of expressive materials as punishment for criminal conduct210 the court did however remand the case to the court of appeals to decide whether the forfeiture constituted an excessive fine under the eighth amendment the same day in another case the court held that the excessive fines clause of the eighth amendment applies to forfeitures of property imposed by criminal statutes211
