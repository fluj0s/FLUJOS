period has generally shown steady increase as can be seen in table 1 and figure 1 the fy2007 budget authority in current dollars was 146 times the fy1940 budget authority reflecting an average annual growth rate for the period of 773 in constant 2007 dollars ie inflationadjusted the fy2007 budget authority is 99 times the fy1940 budget authority and reflects 34 av erage annual growth rate over the period4 world war ii large number of americans 161 million5 served in the military in world war ii wwii december 7 1941 through december 31 1946 making wwii the largest conflict to date in terms of the number of servicemembers because the servicemembers volunteer ed or were drafted for the duration large number of servicemembers were released in relatively short period of time at the end of the war before the end of the war the servicem ens readjustment act pl 346 of the 78th congress commonly known as the gi bill was signed into law in 1944 providing major change in benefits for veterans the gi bill introduced education and training benefits that enabled millions of servicemembers who may have otherwise been unable to attend college or training schools to receive college education or specific job skills training in addition the housing loan guaran tee benefits provided by the gi bill enabled wwii veterans to purchase homes for their families as shown in table 1 the combination of the large num ber of veterans being released in short period of time and the change in benefits resulted in the budget authority for veterans increasing from 5611 million before th war in fy1940 to peak in the post war period in fy1947 of 84 billion in current dollars the fy1947 budget authority was 149 times the prewar budget authority for veterans in constant 2007 do llars the fy1947 budget authority for veterans was 808 billion or 98 times the prewar budget authority for veterans httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22897crs3 6 department of veterans affairs annual be nefits report various years available at httpwwwvbavagovreportsindexhtmthe vietnam era the vietnam era february 28 1961 through may 7 1975 was significantly longer than wwii with to tal of 87 million americans who served in the military during the period until the end of 1972 military draft was in place the last drafted servicemembers began service in 1973 and drafted servicemembers were released through the period at the end of their military obligation also while benefit changes or expansions were made during th period new large be nefit programs were started during the period unlike the wwii peri od as result of the regular release of servicemembers from the military over the period and the relatively stable levels of veterans benefits and services the large peak in budget authority at the end of wwii was not repeated at the end of the vietnam era there was however smaller peak in budget authority for the fy1975fy1976 period that reflected an increase in the number of veterans at the end of the vietnam conflict while the current dollar budget authority for fy1975 and fy1976 was 20 and 23 times the fy1947 budget authority in constant 2007 dollars after adjusting for inflation the budget authority for fy1975 and fy1976 was below that of fy1947 this reflects in large part the differences between the two conflicts in terms of the timing for release of servicemembers nd veterans benefits and services compared to the pre conflict period current conflicts during the current conflic ts operation enduring freedom oef which began october 2001 and oper ation iraqi freedom oif which began march 2003 there is military draft in place servicemembers gene rally leave at the end of their obligation or at retirement the somewhat steady increase in budget authority for veterans benef its and administration each year since the late 1990s may reflect the impact of the aging of the vete ran population more than the impact of the returning oefoif veterans in fy1999 of the 87384 veterans who began receiving disability compensation that year 192 were over age 55 by fy2006 of the 162805 veterans who began receiving disability co mpensation that year 415 were over age 556 over time the increases in the budget aut hority for veterans be nefits and services have reflected the impact of increases in the number of veterans as the result of wars and other conflicts the aging of the veteran population and changes in the benefits and services provided for veterans the most dramatic impact of the combination of an increase in the number of veterans and changes in veterans benefits can be seen in the period shortly after world war iihttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22897crs4 table 1 historical budget authority for the department of veterans affairs va in current and constant 2007
