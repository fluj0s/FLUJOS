6309c17 shspec307 what you are auditing we are interested in the total concept of what you are processing the idea of oldtime psychotherapy is completely useless we have always gone along with the notion that the ideas of oldtime psychotherapies had some historical interest but they are worthless all we can say for the oldtime psychotherapists is that they tried and they did give people the idea that something could be done in dianetics we talked about the mental image picture this is handled today with r3r it is great that we can now get any pc to see facsimiles just by getting the date and duration but the therapeutic value of dianetics is limited since it handles free track which is relatively unaberrative the aberrative value of free track isnt enough to keep someone from being clear or ot you could run r3r for long time and never get there frequently you can of course heal psychosomatic illness with r3r unfortunately the wins you get with it are sporadic this makes it dangerous technology since you will keep going on hoping for repeat win it is an excellent piece of training technology however and it is very useful for an assist r3n handles implanted goals and materials see p 414 above people keep on worrying whether the fact that they have implants means that they were implanters what is the relative value of this implanting the value of it is that without knowledge of implant goals and implanting you can easily get pcs own actual track mixed up in then and you will always be confused on the subject an auditor would mess up the pc thoroughly if he ran an actual gpm as an implant gpm or vice versa r3n is very good as way of teaching the form of gpm it gives lots of practice getting rocket reads etc implant gpms have practically aberrative value compared to that of pcs own actual gpms what implanters did was to take the form of an actual gpm as made by thetan and mock up synthetic gpm with his own goal in some cases and implant it some implant gpms were given several times that was very confusing to thetans because it was parody and mockery of the thetans own actions implant gpms were intended to key in the thetans actual gpm they were somewhat successful at doing this but they didnt manage to scramble up the actual gpm undoubtedly implant gpms influenced the thetans postulate of his next goal or some of his ris however the implant gpm makes the thetan feel sad about the universe but the implanter did us favor in that he gave us training ground that can be used to gain familiarity with gpms without wrapping the pc around too many telephone poles the implant gpm has real impingement on the pc he has never been upset about its ris but when you get one of his own ris you will get charge off cognitions etc an actual gpm looks more like the gorilla gpm it is more natural ta action lies in the actual gpm because it is much much much more aberrative than an implant gpm it is difficult to get at the actual gpm finding the goal of the pc has always been struggle we have just speeded it up by using the service fac to find the goal the service fac is the top ri terminal of the pcs actual pt developing gpm the reason that the pcs goal was so hard to find was that pt bearing down hard on the goal the gpm all its ris and particularly the ris in pt kept the pc sufficiently overrestimulated that the ta was stuck and the rocket read is suppressed if you cant immediately find the pcs goal all the pt sources of restimulation are bearing down on the pt ri and oppterm the last two items of the goal that the pc has and is living with in pt this is all happening because of the pcs own postulate the service fac the mystery of stuck ta is the environment impinging on the pt ris which are held there by the pcs postulate so the pc is doing something there and we have the service fac when you find the service fac in its entirety you have the top or next to top pair of ris in the pcs actual gpm the pcs own gpm will now rr providing you unburden it here is the situation the pc is very overrestimulated by pt and he is keeping himself superaberrated with stable data like horses sleep in beds on the goal to ride the pt goal is so overburdened by pt that if you find goal at all you will find it way down the track at trillions 50 or trillions 30 if you try to run that one the pcs bank goes creak all the back track charge is smashing him forward towards pt his attention is pinned in pt and the goal you have found seems unreal to him it is probably dichotomy of his pt goal r3sc run successfully occasionally gives fall which you will see in the next session as accelerated falls on everything you are running in the next session as you are nulling list you start seeing rocket reads the bank has loosened up enough so that you are reaching locks as the pc differentiates soon you may get rocket reading goal showing up which keeps rocket reading now we have arrived among the last four or five gpms not necessarily at the most recent gpm as they approach pt the gpms are so restimulated and jammed up that it is hard to be sure that you have the most recent one when you get goal eg to hide test it to see if it is an implant goal if it isnt oppose it you want the pc in good shape before you do this since you are about to drag him through three or four actual gpms say you have the goal to have nothing worth taking this will seem to be the pt gpm check who or what would oppose _______ and get the next goal you may have to do this again by now the pc is very uncomfortable try to oppose whatever you get keep doing oppose lists until you get the pt goal test it out thoroughly and list for the latest terminal of the goal eg not to be so slimy when you get the latest terminal the similarity or connection to his service fac will be clear he could have gone over to the enemy camp where he is about to start new gpm the pc may in this case be feeling pretty awful and may start rejecting the goal he is dramatizing the ri terminal that he is in which may oppose his goal the way to run the gpm is as accurately as possible just keep listing your way down to the bottom of it not missing ris or getting off into other goals when you get to the bottom go around and run it back up to get the remaining 50 of the gpms ris that you missed on the way down implant gpms are all backwards but an actual gpm is laid in as it was lived so the bottom is earliest in an actual gpm dont go farther south than the bottom otherwise you might get into foreign gpm dont fool around too much at the bottom the goal throws the whole gpm into violent restimulation dont find ris for goals you dont have that is the only thing that turns off rocket read note that with r3sc you are looking for ris with goal so how long can you keep looking for service facs without finding the goal because you are shredding up rocket read chewing it up there is some danger in it although the way it works it is probably ok for 1550 hours the phenomenon of shredding up rocket reads doesnt start to appear until the pcs goal shows up when the goal does show up put it down prominently in box labelled as goal we havent yet seen r3sc turn off rocket reads but the rule is valid so some caution is in order using this analysis and program we have programmed ot well within reach by making goal finding easier we have also found method of straightening out pt which is useful any time we run into trouble with running an actual gpm the condition when this happens is that pt is now an overwhelm to the pc so if you are running an actual gpm and having trouble we now have handle 1 scout out the possibility that we have run bunch of ris without goals 2 do an arc break assessment 3 do case analysis checking for going into the next gpm b skipped gpms c listing backwards d implant goals etc 4 run r3sc assuming that the current ri is in restimulation clear would be attainable then r3sc is good way to end off an r3m2 intensive you can get the state of clear at any time with one proviso the most dangerous time to use r3sc is at the outset before finding the first actual gpm because you are finding ris for known goal yet this is also the easiest time to run r3sc so the auditor must be alert for any rocket reading goal if he finds one he must mark it clearly he has to find out what goal it is because you only want to run the last goal closest to pt the system that you know as the service facsimile is the system that applies to every ri in every gpm the pc has it is the system that has aberrated the pc all pcs have done this the service fac cum laude for every gpm is the goal as an ri it accumulates mass in the form of subsidiary ris the point where you look for the pcs goal is when using r3sc you have rehabilitated the pcs rr you should always run case on the latest point of his aberration that keeps his pt cleaned up it keeps his ruds in his skills as an ot will slowly be rehabilitated he advances as being in relation to pt therefore he advances smoothly and calmly with regard to pt you wont get flukey manics turning on and off rollercoastering because of dropping earlier on the track than is real to the pc this in fact is the cause of manic behavior the pcs arc is down because of unreality which occurs when he is run over his head so he cant cope with the aberration that is thrown at him it is actually doubtful that the pc could make it to ot unless you continually handled the aberrative factors of pt it is best to cut the case back from pt this gives better reality factor and smoother stabler gains running smoothly cutting back from pt cuts down the time you will require also the pc will be cogniting on pt having wins etc pc ever really progresses beyond his ptp that is the secret of processing at any given moment in auditing the pc is introverted at the level of what is now live in pt his thinking about pt is colored by and introverted into the ris that he is sitting in so they can discharge against pt therefore his power is consistently and continuously cut back to practically nothing we have to handle this the pcs perception of what actually is ptp improves with time so he is seeing bigger and bigger ptps as we go back along the actual gpm or as he progresses in auditing all progress is measured by the pcs ability to perceive ptp the measure of pcs power is the extent of his ptp it isnt how far he can reach it is how wide his ptp is in every case it is the pcs reaction to pt that is creating the problem beyond that there are problems as ris are peeled off the gpm and new ris come up into pt new problems appear to the pc the pc is being an ri and therefore it is his service fac underlying it is many more ris his current gpm etc fortunately there are only twenty or thirty actual gpms on the whole track this puts us on the sunny side of thousand hours to ot and perhaps even within 500 hours of ot
