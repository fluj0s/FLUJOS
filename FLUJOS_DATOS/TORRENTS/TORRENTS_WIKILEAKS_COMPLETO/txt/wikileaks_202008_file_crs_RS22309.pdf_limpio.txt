referred to committee pursuant to provisions of senate rules xiv xvii and xxv when the house informs the senate that it has passed bill or joint resolution that was introduced in the house the measure is also often similarly referred to senate committee senate rules contain procedures for processing concurrent and simple resolutions which are not covered in this report see especially rule xiv 6 senate rule xiv 2 requires that bills and resolutions have three readings before passage and that they be read twice before being referred to committee the third reading occurs before vote on final passage although senator may demand that the readings occur on three different legislative days under paragraph 2 bills and joint resolutions may be read twice on the same day for reference referral if there is objection rule xiv 3 most bills and resolutions are read twice understood in practice to occur by unanimous consent and referred to committee on the same day that they are introduced by senator or received from the house the senate may however use provisions of senate rule xiv to bypass potential referral of bill or joint resolution to senate committee and have the measure placed directly on the senate calendar of business the calendars general orders section lists measures eligible for senate floor consideration broadly the two purposes of preventing the referral of bill or joint resolution to committee and placing it directly on the calendar are 1 to facilitate the full senates opportunity to consider the measure or 2 to bypass committees potential inaction or to the sponsor potential hostile action while placing bill or joint resolution directly on the calendar does not guarantee that the full senate will ever consider it the measure is available for floor consideration and certain procedural steps such as committee reporting and procedural requirements such as the twoday availability of committee report may be obviated

senate rule xiv 4 states and every bill and joint resolution introduced on leave and every bill and joint resolution of the house of representatives which shall have received first and second reading without being referred to committee shall if objection be made to further proceeding thereon be placed on the calendar therefore through objection bill or joint resolution after two readings is prevented from being referred to committee and is placed directly on the calendar it is usually the majority leader or his designee acting on his own or at the request of any other senator who objects to further proceedingcommittee referralon the measure for example this procedure was used to place directly on the calendar s 287 on january 12 2007 while the senate was debating another measure the
