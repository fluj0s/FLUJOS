objectives this project will evaluate the reliability of stateoftheart coupled oceanatmosphere general circulation models gcms that are currently being used in anthropogenic climate change detection studies and for future climate predictions the overarching objective of the project is to establish the extent to which the latest gcms can realistically simulate the natural variability of climate and the climate variations associated with external forcing changes over the past centuries the project will accomplish this through unique combination of carefully prescribed climate model experiments and comparison with improved compilations of real world climate variability spanning the last 500 years in reaching this overall objective the project soap will achieve many individual measurable objectives the most important of these are the simulation of climate variations for the period ad 15002000 using two stateoftheart gcm climate models forced with the same natural forcing histories including volcanic aerosol loading total solar irradiance changes and orbital changes and separate simulations forced by combined natural and anthropogenic forcings greenhouse gases ozone and sulphate aerosols for the period ad 17502000 detailed statistical intercomparison of the simulations with one another and with already available millenniallength control simulations with constant external forcings to enable the identification of robust climate responses to external forcing on global and regional scales and the quantification of the relative importance of forced and internallygenerated climate variability the production of an enhanced and integrated database of annuallyresolved climate proxy records by assembling many existing records tree rings ice cores corals etc and lower resolution records such as those from ice cores lake sediment peat records and borehole temperature estimates the construction of homogeneous sets of climate data representing seasonal temperature precipitation and atmospheric circulation variability over the last 500 years involving the amalgamation via appropriate calibration of instrumental observations documentary climate archival data and existing and the newly amalgamated palaeoclimate proxy evidence to allow the improved definition of the characteristics and magnitude of natural climate variability during the last five centuries based on analysis of the newly compiled climate data evaluation of the simulated climate variability and the simulated climate response to external forcing by quantitative comparison with the extended observedreconstructed climate data the use of the model simulations to aid in the interpretation of the real world climate variability specifically the use of signal detection techniques to test the extent to which the model response to external forcings is detectable in the observedreconstructed climate data the generation of improved estimates of natural climate variability through synthesis of the simulated and observedreconstructed data the reassessment of climate change prediction uncertainties and climate change signal detection uncertainty in the light of these new estimates of natural variability comparison of estimates of sea level variation generated from the climate model simulations with synthesised history of north atlantic sea level changes based on combination of long tide gauge records and evidence from number of ongoing tidal marsh sampling studies b4 contribution to programme key action objectives the project we propose within the energy environment and sustainable development research programme comes under key action 2 global change climate and biodiversity the project is relevant to the main focus of this key action namely global environmental problems that have potentially significant impact on europe such as climate change the overarching objectives of our proposed project are to simulated climate variations over the past 500 years and to evaluate these simulations by comparison with improved palaeoclimate reconstructions for the same period the project will therefore achieve one of the objectives of rtd priority 213 climate change prediction and scenarios viz verification of model capability for simulation of climate changes over past decades and centuries the project will make use of two stateoftheart as reported in the forthcoming third assessment report of the ipcc coupled climate models that are used in the most recent simulations of future climate change thus our evaluation of these models over the past 500 years is highly relevant to assessing their reliability under future forcings through our assessment of model capability at simulating both internally generated climate variability and climate variations that are forced externally we will also contribute to the key action objective of modelling of climate variability most recent studies that have claimed to identify significant human influence on climate have relied on simulated estimates of climate variability thus as one of the largest sources of uncertainty in the key action objective detection and attribution of climate change is our incomplete knowledge of the magnitude and patterns of natural climate variability on decadal to century time scales the proposed project is directly relevant to that objective because it will improve existing knowledge of natural climate variability the proposed project will generate improved proxy and documentarybased reconstructions of climate over the past 500 years for comparisonevaluation of the climate model simulations these improved reconstructions will be obtained by synthesising existing diverse instrumental documentary and palaeoclimate data sets and by combining or comparing recent reconstructions of certain climate variables though the project will not involve the collection of new palaeodata it will nevertheless contribute to rtd priorities 214 climate dynamics and abrupt climate changes viz to better identify and model the important processes in the climate system including natural variability and 241 better exploitation of existing data the proposed project will also make relevant contribution to rtd priority 222 interactions between ecosystems and the carbon and nitrogen cycles one of the climate models that will be used incorporates dynamic vegetation model and will yield simulated responses of vegetation to internallygenerated and externallyforced climate variations over the past 500 years these simulated data will be of relevance to the objective better understanding of the spatial and temporal interannual variability of theterrestrial carbon sources and sinks the proposed project will not investigate this issue in detail but the simulated data together with treeringbased estimates of boreal forest productivity derived from our palaeodata collections will be made available to subsequent collaborative projects focussing on this research priority b5 innovation the overall concept of this proposal represents its major innovation namely to combine expertise in the latest general circulation models and different disciplines of observational historical and reconstructed climates specifically to design project in which carefully simulated climate of the last 500 years can be compared with the evidence of actually climate variability the project therefore offers real prospects of answering the critical question how realistically can the latest stateof theart gcms driven by the best estimates of natural forcings reproduce the character of natural climate variability the project will bring together the best evidence of realworld climate variability across the whole northern hemisphere and synthesise and analyse it in ways suitable for multiple comparison with the model simulations this will represent the first attempt to quantify the relative importance of internal climate variability and the influence of natural and anthropogenic forcings using the most sophisticated gcms there are also many aspects of innovation associated with the individual workpackages that constitute the overall project these may be summarised as follows simulation of climate variability workpackage 2 the proposed simulations of climate under estimated histories of natural and naturalplusanthropogenic external forcings will provide stateofthe art information about externallyforced climate variability and change they will be analysed in combination with millennial length control integrations of the same models that are already complete1 and provide information about climate variability generated by interactions within the climate system this will be the first time that an attempt has been made to simulate the last 500 years with coupled atmosphereocean general circulation models gcms intercomparison of results from two leading coupled gcms23 will allow an estimate to be made of how sensitive such conclusions are to model uncertainty two different models runs with the same forcings constitute good opportunity to separate the response of the climate system to the external forcing factors from the internally generated climate variability and to assess model uncertainties with respect to these responses one of the models has successfully simulated changes in surface temperature that have been observed over the last century4 both climate models represent the stateoftheart and are more advanced than any models that have previously been applied to the question of climate variability over the past 500 years importantly both models are those that are being used to predict possible scenarios of future climate change both have finer spatial resolution than those models typically used to investigate multicentury natural variability the model2 to be used by partner 2 has relatively highresolution ocean gcm 125º of latitude and longitude coupled without flux adjustments to slightly coarser resolution atmospheric gcm while the model3 to be used by partners 3 and 4 uses atmosphere and ocean gcms coupled with flux adjustment that have very fine ocean resolution in the equatorial region to resolve enso dynamics reconstruction of climate variability workpackage 3 the compilation of observational climate variability for the last 500 years will bring together many documentary and palaeoclimate records and archives that have not been synthesised until now similarly many different proxy records will be assimilated for the first time some emphasis will be placed on treeringbased records see below but the project will also incorporate many published reconstructions and reassessments of other palaeoclimate proxies including icecore derived series multiple proxy sources from lake sediments some speleothem data and the highest resolution palynological and peat data integrating the data or climate reconstructions from such diverse proxy sources is new and timely aspect of this work very extensive as yet unpublished network of treeringbased palmer drought indices5 that now extend back the full 500 years will be combined with numerous local drought sensitive series in the us and europe the mediterranean and n africa morocco several of which will be recalibrated as part of the project the temperaturesensitive treering network will also bring together for the first time several expansive networks of treering widths and densities6 separately constructed in different laboratories in the us europe and russia together these will provide virtually comprehensive extratropical land coverage and we will reprocess many of the data using very recently published7 technique that provides greater longtimescale variability in the calibrated reconstructions than has previously been preserved we will use spectral decomposition and timescaledependent calibration techniques to allow the variability expressed in different palaeoclimate proxies with different timescales of response or resolution to be combined and to provide appropriate timedependent estimates of reconstruction uncertainty the project will therefore provide stateoftheart homogeneous climate data set that is unrivalled in its representation of high seasonal resolution variability different variables temperature precipitation pressure and extensive spatial coverage analysis of these climate data will subsequently provide significant advance in our knowledge of regional and hemispheric temperature moisture and circulation changes over the last 500 years synthesis of palaeo and modelderived estimates of natural climate variability workpackage 4 the combined use of stateoftheart model simulations and palaeo reconstructions will further advance our understanding and knowledge of climate variability in particular likewithlike comparisons will be possible as the models will have been subject to the best available estimate to the same forcing that the climate proxies experienced the model simulations will aid in the interpretation of the palaeo data by estimating the signals that are due to external forcing and by providing the typical spatial patterns and coherence of climate variability on different time scales as well as between the different variables andor seasons that the proxy data represent the palaeo data will be used to evaluate the simulated magnitudes and patterns of climate variability and to draw conclusions about climate change detection studies that have used the modelbased estimates of natural variability the application of this approach is entirely original in comparing model and palaeo data we will apply innovative methods that take into account uncertainty in the climate reconstructions which will be carefully estimated for specific time scales and through time and also investigate the alternative approaches of subsampling the model data to match the palaeo records with the possibility of statistical downscaling to the proxy site or upscaling the palaeo records to scale where both model and palaeo data perform most reliably sea level variations over the past 500 years workpackage 5 the major components of soap focus on climate variations over recent centuries directed towards achieving the key action objectives nevertheless the particular climate model simulations to be undertaken provide unique opportunity to extend small part of the project to the investigation of sealevel variability this opportunity arises for two reasons firstly the coupled oceanatmosphere climate models used for simulations of the past 500 years wp2 also produce spatial estimates of sea level variation associated with thermal expansion of sea water and ocean circulation changes and secondly thanks to new methodology8 developed and tested in the past ten years ca ten highresolution 50200 year sealevel records for the past 5001000 years from sites around the north atlantic seaboards will become available our intention is to use this modest but valuable data base to make first attempt at providing quantitative estimates of the degree to which north atlantic sealevel variability is realistically hindcast by the current generation of coupled gcm climate models and icemelt models9 sea level change is forcing factor in coastal change and evolution since very little is known of sea level variability during the past 5001000 years this project will open new perspective on why coastal environments changed in the past and will continue to change in the future b6 project workplan b6a introduction rationale for our approach this project was specifically designed to address the widely recognised need to verify the capability of the latest general circulation models gcms to simulate climate changes over past centuries the project will explore the nature of model climate responses to historical natural forcing and establish the capability of climate models for predicting climate over the last 5 centuries this information will be used to quantify the uncertainty associated with the detection and attribution of climate change signals on hemispheric and regional spatial scales due to natural and anthropogenic forcing the majority of climate change signal detection and attribution studies to date assume modelbased estimate of natural climate variability10 this is major and virtually untested assumption and is potentially major source of criticism that could be used to detract from all such work this proposal has been devised to make an effective contribution towards improving our knowledge and understanding of interannual to multicentury time scale variability of the climate system and the degree to which this is realistically simulated by the best gcms climate models are clearly unrivalled in their ability to simulate broad suite of variables across the entire world but their reliability on decadal and longer time scales requires additional evaluation we propose to undertake new complementary simulations of historical climate variability involving long control integrations and both naturallyforced and anthropogenicallyforced experiments all of these will be run in parallel using two stateoftheart coupled atmosphereocean gcms23 both models will be forced with identical external forcings11 uniquely this will allow systematic isolation and comparison of the separate responses to the same natural and anthropogenic forcings and so will provide the basis for defining modeldependent and independent regional and globalscale sensitivity to natural ie nonanthropogenic climate variability this information will define the range of uncertainty associated with anthropogenic influence on 20th century and on 21st century climate the project will also produce stateofart highresolution climate data spanning the last five centuries by amalgamation of instrumental12 documentary13 and proxybased reconstructions614 these various data will be vigorously calibrated and furnished with realistic error estimates separately calculated for specific parameters regions times and time scales from these data the project will provide the best available information on characteristic modes and magnitudes of natural climate variability for comparison with the natural forcing histories and the outputs from the gcm simulations the important questions about the nature and the significance of recent climate change can be addressed in separate modelbased and observational domains and ultimately the issue of attribution can be explored using the combined information from both approaches the project is organised within five workpackages representing the optimum balance between efficient distribution of related separate tasks and the need to ensure good integration of effort within and between the subgroups of partners workpackage 1 is concerned with overall coordination of the project workpackage 2 groups together all of the work on climate simulations for the last 500 years undertaken by different european modelling groups workpackage 3 brings together all of the observational historical and palaeoclimatic data assembly and subsequent statistical comparisons of methods to integrate and calibrate them workpackage 4 addresses the synthesis and interpretation of both the 500years of observationalreconstructed climate records and the appropriate simulated data the fifth workpackage addresses the separate sealevelchange aspect of the project and includes both the reconstruction of historical changes and their interpretation and reconciliation with simulated changes we now describe the background and approach to each of the workpackages coordination and dissemination wp1 to ensure efficient collaboration communication and data exchange within the project consortium specific coordination tasks have been identified and form the basis of wp1 the wp1 table gives detailed information about these tasks and their associated deliverables the project website developed under wp1 will also be used for dissemination to the scientific community of all the model simulations and all the palaeoclimate reconstructions that will be produced for soap model simulations of the climate of the last 500 years wp2 internal climate variability that generated by interactions within the climate system simulated by coupled atmosphereocean general circulation models aogcms has been used in studies that have attempted to detect recent climate change and attribute it to human influences10 in studies of potentially predictable decadal climate variations15 and to investigate the mechanisms of climate variability16 however establishing the veracity of decadal to century timescale internal variability is difficult because the real climate system is also subject to external forcings and the instrumental record is too short to reliably estimate variability on these timescales over most of the world to estimate the contribution of natural and anthropogenic forcings to climate variability we propose to carry out simulations with stateofthe art aogcms using natural and anthropogenic forcings partners 2 3 and 4 will estimate changes in natural forcings orbital changes total solar irradiance changes and volcanic aerosol loading based on variety of proxy indicators required for the simulations note that large part of the work to estimate natural forcings has been done11 and the forcings applied to simple energy balance model11 existing data sets will be used to determine the anthropogenic forcings greenhouse gases sulphate and other aerosols ozone and landcover changes17 the simulations will be done with two different aogcms one uses flux adjustments model b while the other does not require any model and both are stable for multicentury integrations model a2 is notable for the relatively high resolution of its ocean component 125 of latitude and longitude and 20 vertical levels and radiation scheme that allows explicit representation of wellmixed greenhouse gases and aerosols model b3 is notable for the refined meridional resolution 05 of its ocean component around the equator in order to better resolve equatorial dynamics both models have ensolike behaviour and interannual variability that compares well with instrumental records on annual timescales partner 2 will carry out two simulations using model to complement the existing 1000year control integration1 one from 15002000 with natural forcings and another from 17502000 with both natural and anthropogenic all forcings 1000year control integration of model b is already complete this will be supplemented by 1000year natural forcings run being undertaken for separate already ongoing project and that will be available early in the soap project the additional integration of model b that will be undertaken by partner 3 for soap is that forced by combination of natural and anthropogenic forcings from 1750 onwards the four forced simulations will be compared with one another and with the two existing millenniallength control simulations we will examine the simulations to see on what time and space scales the variance of temperature and precipitation differs from that of the control in what epochs the forced simulations differ from the control and if various indices nao enso and statistics quantiles return periods linked to extreme events hotcold summers droughts differ the aim of these comparisons is to see what climate variables on what spatiotemporal scales are most sensitive to external forcings the results of these studies will be used to inform decisions about what should be compared between the forced simulations and proxy indicators of climate in workpackage 4 comparison of the naturally forced simulations with the control will allow us to estimate the contribution that natural forcings make to climate variability and relate that to internal climate variability by using two different models we can make some estimate of the role of model uncertainty in these comparisons and focus most of our attention on those features which are robust in the two simulations amalgamation and calibration of 500years of highresolution climate data wp3 this workpackage encompasses large amount of work and major input from four institutions and their collaborators however the necessity to work closely and to employ and compare different statistical approaches to the processing of various data sets requires that the work be grouped under one heading this part of the project will combine the most recent data from separate archives of instrumental12 and archival documentary material13 and very many palaeoclimate proxy614 data different statistical approaches will be used to regionalise the data and to calibrate the different records to provide homogeneous climate estimates with realistic confidenceerror estimates highresolution global terrestrial climate data set18 will be used as the 20th century component of the amalgamated data set and as the base from which all reconstructions will be calibrated in terms of anomalies on 5 latitude by 5 longitude grid reconstructions of atmospheric circulation will use ncep reanalysis data19 and instrumental circulation indices for calibration the directly observed climate data will also incorporate many long instrumental records assembled as part of previous european community funded work these data will be enhanced by the incorporation of data from different documentary archives in switzerland and the netherlands that are discontinuous but may be directly interpreted in terms of climate this project will not collect new palaeoclimate data rather it will bring together groups with access to and experience working with numerous published and new many unpublished data from variety of proxy sources with major focus on europe where excellent data from all sources are available for example early monthlymean instrumental data20 are available back to ad 1659 in combination with other ordinal scaled temperature precipitation ranging from 3 to 3 and other paleoenvironmental indices estimated from very highresolution documentary data such as observations of ice and snow features phenological and biological observations and other weather elements prior to ad 1659 reconstructed climatic indices mostly temperature and precipitation and the western baltic sea ice index on seasonal resolution are available to this can be added wealth of treering lacustrine and other palaeo records with various geographic distributions and climate sensitivities some have lower temporal resolution but may still provide useful longer timescale information spatial coverage and reconstruction accuracy will be better for some climate variables than for others over the last 500 years for example summer temperature variability over northern hemisphere land will be virtually complete because of the wide availability of several very large and previously unamalgamated temperaturesensitive tree ring networks plus other temperature sensitive data in contrast precipitation reconstructions will not be possible over the whole hemisphere but will be available for very large regions such as the coterminous united states5 and other large regions of europe importantly including some areas that show highsensitivity to variations in enso and the nao the overall regional coverage of multiple variables will however be easily sufficient to allow unique exploration of largescale and selected regionalised variability in range of parameters in the real world and as generated by the gcms the project will focus on highresolution seasonal data sets of temperature precipitation and precipitatedrelated variables such as palmer drought indices over much of the northern hemisphere in addition where the data permit seasonal sealevel pressure slp and geopotential height data will also be reconstructed preliminary analyses20 have already established the feasibility of skilful reconstruction of slp using principalcomponentrelated spatial regression techniques applied over the eastern north atlantic and western europe using relatively few long instrumental temperature pressure and precipitation records to estimate gridded slp fields similar techniques will be applied for reconstructing temperature and precipitation additional documentary data and high resolution proxy data will allow these grids to be extended back the full 500 years for the atlanticeuropean region and over considerable areas of the hemisphere for certain seasons besides concentrating on specific climate parameters as described this workpackage will provide these data sets in various forms selected to represent different degrees of spatial integration these include irregularly spaced at the local scale but calibrated against local station or grid box climate data in those areas from which the specific proxy records originate these will be calibrated in terms of the specific optimal climate response identified for that data eg 2month summer mean in north east siberian treerings or summer mean soil moisture deficit in an eastern mediterranean site optimally selected parameters expressed on large regular grids these will include eg summer halfyear mean temperature over the northern hemisphere land masses seasonal mean palmer drought severity indices across the united states seasonal mean sealevel pressure across the eastern north atlantic and all of western europe based on combined instrumental documentary and various proxy climate sources note that all of these data will be spatial detailed regional mean climate series reconstructed to represent largescale variability through robust averaging of the local data networks these will include subcontinentalscale averages eg n western canadian temperature western north american drought and hemispheric mean records eg n hemisphere annual temperature we will also archive analyse and where necessarypossible improve existing seasonal reconstructions and produce new syntheses of major climate indices that have been identified as important expressions of large scale circulation changes and are associated with largescale teleconnection patterns of temperature and rainfall these include the southern oscillation so the pacific decadal oscillation pdo the north atlantic oscillation nao the euro siberian oscillation careful consideration will be given to the appropriate seasonal representation of these data as the variability for several of them can only be captured with sufficient skill in specific seasons similarly proxy data differ in their ability to represent the full spectrum of climate variability eg treering data may not fully represent century or longer time scales of variability though major improvements will be made as part of this workpackage by reprocessing7 many of these data see wp3 table and ice core data or lake sediment data eg diatoms may not accurately resolve interannual variability for this reason the different proxies will be calibrated after bandpass filtering to isolate discrete period variability interannualdecadal decadalmultidecadal multidecadalcentury this will ensure appropriate calibration and error estimation at each time scale and allow subsequent recombination of reconstructed time scale series optimum climate sensitivity will be established and transfer functions calibrated using range of regressionbased techniques simple regression principal componentbased approaches neuralnetwork and established analogue methods it should be stressed that not all of the palaeoclimate information to be assembled will require processing or calibration we will build upon much existing data and many published reconstructions derived from various proxies with differing spatial and temporal representation however we will assimilate these data in systematic manner and employ various approaches to reconciling the information each provides and giving specific weight to different sources according to their optimal climate responses spatial representation time scale of response and timedependent uncertainties synthesis and interpretation of observedreconstructed and simulated climates wp4 all tasks that involve the combined use of palaeoclimate reconstructions and modelsimulated climate data will be undertaken as part of workpackage 4 it is this part of the project that provides the added value of bringing together expertise and data from the palaeoclimate and the climate modelling communities this workpackage is therefore of key importance comparisons between palaeo and model data are hindered by the different characteristics of each data set model output is less reliable at small spatial scales while some proxy data are representative of only single sites palaeo reconstructions are not exact and have quantifiable uncertainty range associated with them the first task in wp4 will be to develop and test using existing data sets methodologies for coping with these characteristics to allow subsequent unbiased comparisons between simulated and proxy data that explicitly take account of estimated error in the proxy reconstructions climate reconstruction uncertainty will be quantified in wp3 and expressed as residual climate variability not captured by the proxy data the variance of the residuals must be included as additional variance when evaluating the level of interannual climate variability at individual locations or regions21 explicit methods will be developed however to incorporate the effects of temporal andor spatial coherence in the residual variance effects which become important when aggregating over space or time note that the signal detection and attribution techniques22 that will be used for some tasks in this workpackage already provide framework for the inclusion of proxy uncertaintyerror in those particular analyses the incompatibility of the spatial scales of palaeo and model data can be dealt with in number of ways and these will be compared and evaluated for single sites gridbox model output can be extracted but may have unrealistic variance or spectral characteristics improvements obtained by applying statistical downscaling methods23 to obtain more reliable local information from the bettersimulated largescale climate variability will be assessed for multiple sites we will compare three approaches first the model output fields can be subsampled picking out data only from the locations and seasons for which the palaeo reconstructions exist24 second upscaling the palaeodata to the scales and variables considered to be reliably simulated can be achieved through multiple regression based techniques this second possibility also includes the reconstruction of indices of enso or of the atmospheric circulation such as the nao and then comparing these with the indices simulated by the climate models the third approach lies between the first two where there is sufficient density of coverage such as will be available from the treering network large regional averages can be formed and calibrated and compared with regional averages of subsampled model output the most suitable methods for the particular comparison or synthesis tasks will be identified and the necessary algorithms developed and applied the first comparison will be to quantitatively evaluate the model simulations of climate variability and of the simulated response to external forcing comparisons will be made between the variance on variety of space and time scales of temperature and to lesser extent precipitation or moisture between the statistics of extremes for warmcold summers and drought where suitable reconstructions exist and between climate indices eg enso and the nao using new or existing reconstructions comparison will be made with both the natural and the all forcings simulations to assess whether the additional forcings raise the levels of multidecadal variability to similar extent in both the simulated and reconstructed climates stateoftheart signal detection and attribution techniques22 will be applied to test whether the climate response to external forcings simulated by the models is detectable in the palaeoclimate reconstructions more specific comparisons will be undertaken for the periods and variables when the externallyforced signal was most statistically significant as identified in wp2 detection of 20th century climate change and attribution to specific external forcings will be attempted but using the pre1900 palaeobased estimates of natural climate variability and for the subset of locations and seasons with suitable reconstructions this will enable conclusions to be drawn about published studies that use modelbased estimates of natural climate variability and to demonstrate whether recent climate changes are outside the envelope of natural climate variability for the period 15001900 in addition to the palaeo evidence being used to evaluate model performance the model simulations will aid in the interpretation of the palaeodata the climate simulations enable separation of the externally forced climate signal from internal variability to the extent that the signal is distinguishable from the noise something that cannot be achieved using palaeodata alone the model signals will be used to interpret the palaeoclimate reconstructions in terms of the causes of the observed variations the main project results will be synthesised to provide overall assessments of the utility and veracity of the climate models and of the database of highresolution climate proxies quantitative synthesis of the palaeo and modelderived natural variability estimates will be undertaken using innovative methods to combine the data sets and obtain improved estimates of natural climate variability we will evaluate bayesian analysis methods where prior eg modelderived beliefs can be updated in the light of proxy data multiple regressionbased approaches that attempt to reconstruct spatiallyextensive climate fields from sparser network of climate proxies14 rely on the identification of distinct patterns of climate variability and their relationship with climate proxies at individual sitesseasons these patterns and relationships are typically identified at interannual to decadal timescales and then applied at all timescales from interannual to millennial25 and by necessity are based on instrumental observations from the 20th century that may be contaminated by an anthropogenic climate signal as part of the synthesis we will assess and improve upon such studies by deriving these patterns and relationships from the model simulations at various timescales and with and without external anthropogenic forcing of the climate system suitable relationships identified between simulated patterns of climate variability and appropriately subsampled model output will be applied to the palaeo records to obtain new estimates of natural climate variability for the last 500 years sea level changes over the last 500 years wp5 the particular climate model simulations to be undertaken within soap provide unique opportunity to extend small part of the project to the exploration of simulated and reconstructed sea level variability with view to assessing our capability of hindcasting sea level changes over the past 500 years and therefore providing guidance about future sea level predictions this opportunity arises because the coupled oceanatmosphere climate models23 used for simulations of the past 500 years wp2 also produce spatial estimates of sea level variation associated with thermal expansion of sea water and ocean circulation changes partner 2 also has access to glaciermelt model9 that can be run offline to obtain estimates of the simulated meltwater component of sea level rise during simulations with both model and model b note that the small fresh water flux variations driven by glacier change will not be able to influence ocean salinity and circulation because the glacier melt model will be run after the climate model simulations are complete this melt water component will be combined with similar global contribution from the gradual ongoing adjustment to the last glacialinterglacial transition of the greenland and antarctic ice sheets using an existing observational estimate plus deviations estimated by massbalance variability26 and will be added to the spatial sea level estimates obtained from the ocean component of the climate model simulations these estimates of sea level variability and change under natural and all forcings and from the control integrations with unchanging external forcing will allow certain questions to be addressed for example what proportion of sea level variations over past centuries might be attributed to naturally and anthropogenciallyforced climate changes and therefore what fraction of the rise observed during the 20th century is commitment delayed response to earlier naturallyforced climate variations such as the ending of the little ice age how large is the variability in global and regional sea level driven by natural external forcings comparison of the different simulated sea level estimates against observational evidence is necessary to give an indication of our confidence in the simulations this is limited by the length of tidegauge records and so it is fortuitous that the opportunity to assemble longer records is now becoming available method based on the interpretation of salt marsh foraminifera has been developed and successfully tested8 to generate palaeo sealevel records with resolution of 50200 year application of this method has resulted so far in six 8001800 yr long records of dm scale sealevel variations over periods of 50350 years for sites in connecticut and maine northeast usa8 preliminary comparisons with existing temperature proxy records for the past 1000 years suggests that regional north atlantic surface air temperature variations are more strongly correlated than hemispheric mean temperatuire variations specifically the records available suggest that the current high rates of relative sea level rise began before industrial times over the period 20022004 similar sealevel reconstructions will be produced by various nationally funded projects for sites in north carolina delaware nova scotia newfoundland the uk and northwest germany and for four more european sites under study in the eufunded holsmeer project these proxy records will be systematically evaluated for errors related to age elevation indicative meaning completeness and regional validity where necessary effects of sediment compaction will be accounted for by comparison with compactionfree relative sealevel data the influence of longterm crustal movements will be estimated using compactionfree relative sealevel records for the past 20004000 years to be compared with values obtained from isostatic earth models these proxy records to be integrated with existing long instrumental sea level records represent an important and growing database that renders possible for the first time comparison of observational with model generated sealevel variability in the north atlantic region during the past 5001000 years comparisons will use straightforward statistical techniques correlation etc given the limited resolution of the observational estimates and the limited regional focus of the study east usa and canada and north west europe comparisons with reconstructed climate variations from wp3 will also be undertaken the simulated sea level variations will be subject to various uncertainties including uncertainty related to initial conditions which will be maintained over period of time dependent upon the response time of oceans and glaciers and uncertainty related to glacier melt sensitivity the melt model is currently tuned to reproduce presentday shortterm responses of each glacier to temperature changes but will not necessarily exhibit the correct multicentury equilibirum sensitivity these two aspects will be assessed by partners 1 and 2 by using globally averaged simple climate and sea level model27

personmonths per participant 1 objectives to simulate climate variations from ad 1500 to 2000 using two stateoftheart coupled climate models under natural and combined natural and anthropogenic all forcing and make data available to partners to analyse and intercompare the new model simulations and the existing multicentury control integrations of the models to identify the climate response to external forcings and to quantify the effect on climate variability of external forcings relative to internallygenerated variability 2 methodology work description best available estimates of forcing histories will be compiled from recent published works for the natural orbital total solar irradiance volcanic aerosols and anthropogenic forcings greenhouse gas sulphate aerosols land cover changes and tropospheric and stratospheric ozone these will be used to force two stateoftheart coupled climate models both models already have at least millenniallength control integrations partner 2 will run model from ad 1500 to 2000 under natural forcings and then repeat the period from ad 1750 onwards with both natural and anthropogenic all forcings partners 3 and 4 will complete the natural simulation using model b for the extended period ad 1000 to 2000 with funding from current nationallyfunded project partner 3 will perform the all forcings run with funding from the proposed project as far as logistics and different model formulations allow the two models will perform identical experiments appropriate data and diagnostics will be converted to netcdf and transferred to the webbased project data bank for dissemination within the project and for public dissemination at the end of the project by partner 1 comparison of forced and control simulations and also intercomparison of the two models will be done using range of statistical approaches tailored to specific questions comparisons will be done on the means and variance of temperature precipitation and indices such as enso nao etc and on statistics quantiles return periods linked to extreme events hotcold summers droughts comparisons will be done using the whole of each simulation but also as function of time to identify periods and variables when the forced simulations are significantly different from the control simulations this will provide input to wp4 to look at proxy data during these identified periods comparisons will also take place over range of space and time scales this part of the study will answer the question how does external forcing alter the climate and its variability the natural simulations will be used to estimate the contribution of natural forcing to climate variability while the all experiments will be used to compare the simulations with proxy data in order to evaluate the veracity of the simulations this climate simulation workpackage will be lead by partner 2 with partners 2 and 3 undertaking new simulations specifically for the soap project partner 4 will

amalgamation of observed instrumental records documentary climate evidence and reconstructed climate estimates produced through rigorous calibration and validation of selected highquality palaeoclimate time series some specific variables and locations to be reconstructed are list in the work description below to provide explicit uncertainty error estimates appropriate for the specific space and time scale representation of each variable series constructed to identify through combination of principalcomponent type and time series analysis techniques the characteristic modes and magnitudes of spacetime variability in the climate records over the last 500 years representing multifaceted objective and quantitative summary for comparison with different natural forcing histories and the outputs from the climate model experiments 2 methodology work description the data sets to be constructed will comprise temperature precipitation and precipitationrelated variables such as drought indices atmospheric circulation sea level pressure and geopotential height fields and important atmospheric circulation indices eg the north atlantic oscillation the eurosiberian oscillation enso covering the last 500 years they will encompass range of spatial scales from local site through subcontinental averages and for temperature hemispheric mean and different temporal integration discrete representation of interannual decadal and century time scales there is wealth of long good quality instrumental climate records documentary data and highresolution and welldated palaeoclimate data in europe particularly but also recently produced in many other northern hemisphere locations because they derive from different research projects different laboratories and different disciplines very many of these have never been brought together the opportunity is now available to do this and provide major improvement over the last published compendium of similar data produced by mann et in 199814 this workpackage will provide major enhancement of our capability to explore and redefine the nature of natural climate variability for several centuries both before and during the period of extensive observational climate records we will assemble many published and many newunpublished documentary climate records and highquality palaeoclimate records from europe and across the northern hemisphere within timeframe of the last 500 years in specific cases eg for many treeringderived variables the palaeodata will be reprocessed so as to correct variance bias associated with timedependent sample replication at individual collection sites to decompose the data into selected spectral ie period bands with their associated statistical error and to extract longer time scale multidecadal to century variance based on recently published technique not as yet applied at the small regional scale or to the vast majority of the treering data these proxy data will be climatically screened by comparison with climate data to identify appropriate climate variables with which to calibrate the palaeorecords in order to provide optimal seasonal and annual mean climate estimates combination of different regression and neural network techniques will be used the derived prediction estimates will be rigorously validated using reserved independent predictand data and reconstruction uncertainty will be calculated and expressed with regard to changes in both time and timescale where necessary the calibration will be carried out at different timescales ie annualdecadal decadalmultidecadal multidecadalcentury in order to better exploit the various sensitivities of the records and to allow cross comparison and appropriate amalgamation of the resulting data very extensive collections of highresolution treering data annual ringwidth and ringdensity measurements will be amalgamated for the first time these include many data from northern europe the alps the pyrenees north africa spain italy north america russia and china in different regions these data provide very good evidence of different climate parameters summer temperature variability summer drought winter precipitation all continuous and seasonally resolved many additional treering data including numerous strongly drought sensitive chronologies from western and eastern north america and mexico will also be available to the project in addition to the highresolution treering data selected additional some published some uncalibrated records with lower resolution sensitivity will be used to derive corroborative evidence about multidecadal and longer time scale variability of climate these include icecore accumulation and chemical isotope series chironomid and diatom faunal records speleothem data and peat compositional and accumulation records and borehole temperatures we have assembled consortium with unique access to the latest climate data the necessary documentary archives and the full range of palaeoclimate proxies and with the methodological expertise to transform these data into homogeneous climate data sets that be compared with the different

variability and the simulated response to external forcing by quantitative comparison with palaeoclimate reconstructions to use model simulations to aid in the interpretation of the proxy data and for producing synthetic proxy data for use in evaluating the reliability of palaeoclimatic networks and statistical reconstruction methods to reassess climate change detection results using palaeo estimates of natural climate variability to synthesise the simulated and proxy data to improve our estimates of climate variability 2 methodology work description methodologies will be developed and tested on existing data by partners 1 3 4 and 6 to allow likewithlike comparison between palaeo and model data despite the different characteristics of each data type model output is often less reliable at small spatial scales while some proxy data are representative of only single sites palaeo reconstructions are not exact and have quantifiable uncertainty range associated with them and proxy data include noise with varying spatiotemporal characteristics due to processes unrelated to largescale climate the forced model response will be evaluated by comparing simulated and proxy variability for variety of diagnostics identified in workpackages 2 and 3 ie european and hemispheric temperature european and usa precipitation climate indices and statistics of eg atmospheric circulation patterns such as nao and coupled climate modes such as enso comparison of variance spectra spatial patterns as defined by principal component analysis etc will be undertaken by partners 1 5 and 6 applying the methods developed earlier to take into account scaleerrornoise characteristics of the data in addition signal detection and attribution techniques will be applied by partners 2 and 3 to attempt to detect in the proxy data the largescale simulated responses to external forcing comparison of simulated and reconstructed data will be twoway process with simulations also providing input into the critical assessment of the reconstructed climate data sets interpretation of the proxy data will be achieved by utilising the simulated patterns and timing of climate response to external forcing for the attribution of proxy variations to specific causes partners 4 5 and 6 model output will be sampled for specific locations seasons and variables and various statistical noise models added to yield synthetic climate proxy records reconstruction and calibration techniques will then be tested to try to capture the known simulated climate for various regions and variablesindices allowing an assessment of the suitability of various palaeodata networks with given uncertaintynoise levels for reconstructing past climate especially given the existence of forced climate changes during the 20th century calibration period partners 1 and 4 partner 3 will develop and apply innovative methods to merge the proxy and model data to obtain improved estimates of natural climate variability taking into account uncertainties in the palaeo data and the models for this purpose we will evaluate bayesian analysis methods where prior eg modelderived beliefs can be updated in the light of new proxy data and statistical reconstruction techniques that in previous studies rely on the covariance structure of climate estimated using the relatively short and possibly anthropogenciallycontaminated instrumental records of the 20th century these new estimates of natural variability as well as the separate estimates from the palaeo and model data will be used by partners 2 and 3 in detection and attribution framework to interpret proxy data in the light of simulated climate change and to see if recent climate changes are unusual for different variables and on different spatial and time scales as dictated by the availability of different proxies in the context of natural climate variability over the last 500 years these results will be compared to earlier detection and attribution studies which mostly derived natural variability from long unforced control integrations of climate models 3 deliverables including cost of deliverable as percentage of total

investigate the sensitivity of simulations to initial climate state and to evaluate the reliability of simple climate and sea level rise models over the past 500 years to evaluate existing tidegauge records of sea level that are 70 years in length and to integrate these with critically assessed proxy records of sea level for the past 500 years available for the north atlantic region to evaluate and compare simulated and reconstructed sea level variations and to identify contributions to sea level rise from natural and anthropogenic forcings 2 methodology work description spatiallyresolved sea level variations associated with oceanic temperature thermal expansion and circulation changes are simulated by model b and can be readily diagnosed from the model simulations globallydistributed reducedform glacier melt model will be run after the climate simulations have been completed taking temperature patterns simulated by the models as input to estimate mountain glacier mass balance change and hence glaciermelt contribution to sea level variations this glaciermelt term will be combined with the estimated range of background melting of the greenland and antarctic ice sheets and both will be distributed over the oceans this procedure will be applied by partner 2 to all model simulations usedgenerated by soap 1000year control integrations from models and b 15002000 and 10002000 ad natural forcing simulations with models and b respectively and 17502000 ad all forcing simulations with models and b the simulated sea level variations will be filtered to remove localscale variability and variations on time scales shorter than 50 years the various simulations will be utilised to assess how large regionalscale sea level variability is relative to globallyforced changes how similar the regional patterns are between the two models and to separate out the influence of natural and anthropogenic forcings and internallygenerated variability the simulated sea level variations will be subject to various uncertainties including uncertainty related to initial conditions which will be maintained over period of time dependent upon the response time of oceans and glaciers and uncertainty related to glacier melt sensitivity the melt model is currently tuned to reproduce presentday shortterm responses of each glacier to temperature changes but will not necessarily exhibit the correct multicentury equilibirum sensitivity these two aspects will be assessed by partners 1 and 2 by using globallyaveraged simple climate and sea level model integrated under 10002000 ad forcings with various initial conditions and with heuristic glaciermelt model that may more accurately capture the response to the more slowly varying natural forcings this simple climate model which is used to produce future climate change scenarios in the ipcc first second and third assessment reports can also be tested over the period 15002000 ad by comparison with the gcm climate model output when integrated using identical forcing time series palaeo sea level variations will be estimated by partner 7 for north west europe and east usa and canada with resolution of 50200 years tidal marsh cores from six existing usa sites augmented by more usa sites and uk and german sites by 2002 and further augmented by sites sampled during the current eufunded holsmeer project in iceland ireland denmark and portugal that will become available by 20034 will be critically assessed for age control completeness and geographical representativeness and combined to yield estimates of palaeo sea level for the two atlantic regions changes over the past 20004000 years will be used to identify background trends related to vertical land movement also simulated by existing isostatic earth models and thus obtain absolute sea level comparison and combination with tide gauge records of 70 or more years in length will be undertaken comparison of the palaeo and simulated sea level records will be carried out by partners 1 2 and 7 the focus will be on the past 500 years though the period 10001500 ad will also be considered in comparison with the longer natural forcings simulation of model b in the context of the forced climate and sea level changes the observed changes will be assessed to identify whether they are consistent with simulated changes given the amount of internallygenerated regional sea level variability present in the unforced control integrations of the climate models comparison will use fairly basic statistical methods given the 50200 year resolution of the palaeo records and the limited number of regions able to be considered 3 deliverables including cost of deliverable as percentage of total project cost d11 month 26
