risk insurance program the current terrorism risk insurance program as created by the terrorism risk insurance act of 20021 and modified by the terrorism risk insurance extension act of 20052 provides for transparent system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism3 the tria program is often described as reinsurance backstop it does not offer policies directly to in surance consumers but operates by sharing losses due to terrorist attack with the insurance companies which have sold policies to businesses after certa in thresholds are reached it steps in and pays insurers for portion of covere d losses due to terrorist act depending on the total size of the losses the federal payments made to individual insurers may or may not be recouped through assessments on all those covered by tria in the years following the attack tria is limited to c overing 100 billion in insured losses and relieves insurers of liability for losses over this amount what if anything that could be done in the event of losses exceeding 100 billion is question left to future congress tria thresholds tria applies only to an act of foreign terrorism as certified by the secretary of treasury in concurrence with the secretary of state and the attorney general tria applies only to commercial propertycasualty insuranceexcluding federal crop insurance private mortgage insurance title insurance financial guaranty insurance medical malpractice insurance health or life insurance flood insurance reinsurance commercial automobile insurance burglary and theft insurance surety insurance professional liability insurance except for directors and officers liability and farm owners multiple peril insurance aggregate industry insured losses in given year must exceed100 million the program trigger before payments are made to an individual insurer that entityslosses must exceed 20 of the value of its direct earned premiums from the previous year the insurer deductible once these thresholds are met tria cove rs 85 of the insured losses caused by terrorist attack if the total insured losses are under 275 billion the aggregate retention amount then all of the insure rs covered by tria would be assessed recoupment fee not to exceed 3 of premiu m until the federal share of the losses has been repaid the secretary of the treasury has the authority to set the exact recoupmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22671crs3 4 15 usc 103c 5 see terrorism risk and insurance insura nce information institute website available at http wwwiiiorgmedi ahottopicsinsuranceterrorismpercentage as well as the authority to ex tend the recoupment fee and require payment to the government beyond the 275 billion amount required by law unlike private reinsurance the tria program charges premiums for the reinsurance coverage provided by th program the law however does place requirements on insurers speci fically all insurers are requi red to offer coverage for terrorism risk that does not differ materially from the term s amounts and other coverage limitations applicable to losses arising from events other than acts of terrorism4 the policyholders however are not required to purchase this offered terrorism coverage background on terrorism insurance and tria prior to the september 2001 attacks on the united states insurers generally did not exclude or separately charge for terrorism risks the events of september 11 2001 however changed this as insurers realized the extent of possible losses from terrorism estimates of insured losses fro m the 911 attacks are around 36 billion in current dollars the largest manmade insu rance disaster on record5 the heaviest insured losses were absorbed by foreign and domestic reinsurers the insurers of insurance companies because of the lack of data on or modeling of terrorism risk reinsurers felt unable to price for such risks and they largely withdrew from the market for terrorism risk in surance once reinsurers stopped offering coverage for terrorism risk primary insurers who also ffered from lack of data and models also withdrew or tried to withdraw from the market in most states state regulators must approve policy form changes and state regula tors generally agreed to insurer requests to exclude terrorism risks from their commercial policies just as they had long excluded war risks terrorism risk insurance was soon unavailable or extremel expensive and many businesses were longer able to purchase in surance that would protect them in future terrorist attacks although most data were anecdotal this problem was widely thought to pose threat of serious harm to the real estate transpor tation construction energy and utility sectors in turn threatening the broader economy responding to the perceived problem congress passed tria in november 2002 trias stated goals were to 1 create temporary federal program of shared public and private compensation for insured losses to allow the private market to stabilize 2 protect consumers by ensuring the availability and affordability of insurance for terrorism risks and 3 preserve state regulation of insurance the acts initial structure is essentially still in place the federal governments liability in the event of terrorist attack however was higher at the beginning of the program and it has decreased through the life of the program this decrease in the federal liability and resulting increase in private liability was intentional it was hoped that this would spur the private market to develop the financial capacity and other in frastructure necessary to be gin insuring terrorism risk without government programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22671crs4 6 s 467 was first passed by the senate on vember 18 2005 the house replaced the text of s 467 with the large majority of the language from hr 4314 before passing s 467 on december 7 2005 the senate then responded by replacing the house text with samdt 2689 slightly modified version of s 467 as the senate had previously passed the bill this version of s 467 passed the senate on december 16 2005 and the house on december 17 2005the development of private market for terrorism risk did not proceed with the speed hoped for when tria was passed s oon after trias enactment the insurance industry and others worried bout possible absence of terro rism insurance and viewing terrorism risk as essentially uninsurable began calling for an extension of the program or some other longerterm so lution responding to concerns about continuing lack of private market in terrorism risk insurance congress passed twoyear extension bill triea near the end of 2005 this act conti nued the first acts trend of decreasing the federal governments liability in the case of terrorist attack not only were the monetary thresholds increased but additional lines of insurance were also excluded table 1 details the evolution of the various

significant policy differences between the house and the senate on how to deal with terrorism ri sk insurance the senate bill s 467 109th congress which was backed by the president and eventually enacted6 kept the same tria structure while further scaling back federal involvement the house bill hr 4314 109th congress was more varied hr 4314 would have extended tria and also would have revised the prog ram extensively changes that hr 4314 would have implemented included expanding the program to cover domestic terrorist events increasing the types of insurance covered to include group life and specific coverage for nuclear biological chemical and radiological nbcr events implementing different insurer deductible for different lines of insurance and creating tria capital reserve funds

marked up this original bill on october 17 2007 nd ordered it favorably reporte d to the senate by vote of 201 it was introduced by senator christopher dodd as s 2285 on november 1 2007 the senate inserted tripra s language plus additional language increasing and accelerating the recoupment provisions into hr 2761 on november 16 2007 and passed the bill by unanimous consent the same day tripra is relatively straightforward reauthorization of the existing tria program the two primary changes that it would make to the program are 1 extend the program for seven years until 2014 and 2 dd coverage for domestic terrorist attacks to the program in addition it would modify slightly the annual liability cap and require the secretary of the treasury to promulgate regulations on deter mining payments should losses exceed 100 billion rather than leaving this determination to future congress the bill would also call for reports from the government accountability office gao on the possibility of insurance coverage for ncbr events within one year and on the affordability and availability of terrorism insurance in speci fic markets within 180 days in addition the presidents working group on financial markets would be tasked to continue its analysis of the longer term availability and affordability of terrorism risk insurance and report on this subject in 2010 and 2013 hr 4299 introduced by representative barney frank on december 6 2007 this bill shares the tripra title with s 2285 nd hr 2761 as passed by the senate hr 4299 includes the senatepassed language plus provisions that would do the following add coverage of group life insura nce with separate deductible retention pool recoupment amount and policy surcharge amount decrease the individual insurer deduc tible in 2008 to 5 for terrorist attacks that exceed 1 billion and then increase this amount by 05 per year after 2008 reset after 1 billion attack the trigger to 5 million and the insurerdeductible to 5 with 05 increase per year thereafter restrict life insurers use of fore ign travel as an underwriting tool reduce the program trigger to 50 million administration reaction the office of

second dated december 11 threatened veto if the senatepassed version of hr 2761 were amended with the language that was passed by the house in hr 4299
