from jonathan overpeck jtouarizonaedu to keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk tosbornueaacuk subject first draft of fod figures date mon 27 jun 2005 154240 0600 cc eystein jansen eysteinjansengeouibno xflowed hi keith and tim eystein is going to chat with you tomorrow and my goal is to get as much as i can to you guys today and tomorrow first off the figures are great that was tough job and im very impressed of course i can already start to sense what the debates will be but we can address that in the text here are some comments with respect to the figures some are relevant to the text 1 they really are great 2 is the instrumental series on the first fig top and bottom the same as featured in chapter 3 need to say that 3 rather than clogging up the caption with all the notes on each curve how about table for each of the two figures then you can include some more info on each recon eg number of sites types of proxies im thinking mainly that the captions are not pretty but you may be able to include more summary info on each curve also 4 should we make all the series in their original and modified for the figure form available on www site so that reviewers can play with the data and make sure they get their two cents in before this thing is all said and published the wdca is ready to help w posting of data and figs see below 5 i like the expanding time axis but id be prepared to have second one with linear axis in fact id put it up on the www page at the same time with the data the more we do to help others understand the better 6 also it would be good to see both the data and the figure wo the gaussianweighted filtering what do doe these look like can we make them available as suggested above at the least id like to see the fig wo the filtering even though i know it will be mess how about series of time series plots same x and axes as the big fig 1 in each you show both the filtered and unfiltered series i know this is pain for tim but we really have to make sure were not missing anything in the data and also that we anticipate what others will do ask us to do or squawk about 7 on the forcing fig fig 2 why dont we see all the different experiment curves eg dotted red in the forcing plots b and c need to say why in the caption and if they have the same forcing so you cant see it on the plot need to say it this could be much easier in table that indicates same as x 8 on fig 2 does the recalulated envelop of reconstructed temps also include instrumental temps think so but you should say it in the caption why doesnt the envelop go up to present can it might look better and be more consistent w fig 1 if the envelop cant go to present then maybe include the instrumental curve as in fig 1 9 reminders for the text ill think about these as i read second time for editing 9a need to explain why the recons dont continue going up w instrumental data at the end post 1990 might what to mention something in caption if you can shift all the other stuff to table 9b there will be lots of discussion during and post ar4 drafting about what recon series fig 1 should or should not be believed thus i think it is critical for us to same more about each recon that is to include what you wrote in blue and perhaps to enhance need to really convince the reader that while not one recon is alone the truth and hence fig 1 they all have important strengths and weaknesses but the former outweigh the latter so weve included them 9c im sure you saw the recent to be infamous wall stree journal editorial they showed what i think was ipcc far curve with the good old mwp and lia etc lamb view i dont have the far w the way to handle the hocky stick might best be to put it in an historical perspective along with the older ipcc views first show your great figs discuss them and what went into them and then after showing the stateoftheart discuss how much our understanding and view have changed in this simply compare each of the historical views far sar tar to the current view and while doing so play down the controversy s especially the hockey stick the smart folks will realize that that the fluff in the news is just that but those with real stake in that debate will hopefully get the point that it doesnt matter 10 lastly almost im sorry to ask again but i still want to know what is wrong with tom crowleys latest plot with all the recons shown together back through the med w period i need to send you my edits on the mwp box but it seem to that toms fig could go in that box to help make the point that sorry guys the mwp wasnt much compared to the recent global warming 11 lastly promise dont foget that eystein and i think we can get page or two extra for your section in the end this means you can do all the above and i can help next with the modes and extremes sections and we can get it all in great job thanks peck jonathan t overpeck director institute for the study of planet earth professor department of geosciences professor
