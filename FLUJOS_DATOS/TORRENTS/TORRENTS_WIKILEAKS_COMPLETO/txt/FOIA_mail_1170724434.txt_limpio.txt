earth are you thinking youre not even remotely correct in your reading of the report first of all the ar4 came to stronger conclusions that ipcc2001 on the paleoclimate conclusions finding that the recent warmth is likely anomalous in the last 1300 years not just the last 1000 years the ar4 spm very much backed up the key findings of the tar the jones et reconstruction which you refer to actually looks very much like ours and the statement about more variability referred to the 3 reconstructions jones et mann et briffa et shown in the tar not just mann et the statement also does not commit to whether or not those that show more variability are correct or not some of those that do for example moberg et and esper et show similarity to each other i find it terribly irresponsible for you to be sending messages like this to singer and monckton you are speaking from ignorance here and you must further know how your statements are going to be used you could have sought some feedback from others who would have told you that you are speaking out of your depth on this by instead simply blurting all of this nonsense out in an email to these sorts charlatans youve done some

christopher and fred now that the latest ipcc wg1 spm is published i can venture more opinions on the abovereferenced subjects it is indeed striking that ipccs estimate of maximum plausible 21st century sealevel rise has decreased over time the latest estimate is 05 meters for the a2 emissions scenario not much higher from the 04 meter estimate for the a1b emissions scenario which the wall street journal editorial page has made much of on the other hand the ipcc seems to have taken pass on hansens argument the ipcc says their estimates are excluding future rapid dynamical changes in ice flow because basis in published literature is lacking in this one respect sea level rise i agree with todays journal editorial that the science is not yet settled unfortunately the editorial runs completely off the tracks thereafter by 1 comparing 2006 vs 2001 surface temperatures among all the 150 or so years on record and 2 asserting significant cooling the oceans have undergone since 2003 based apparently on one published dataset that contradicts all the others it is not appropriate to cherrypick data points this way its like trying to figure out longterm trends in the stock market by comparing todays value of the dow with last tuesdays value re highresolution paleodata i never liked it that the 2001 ipcc report pictured manns without showing alternates phils jones data was also available at the time focusing so exclusively on mann was unfair in particular to mann himself who thereby became the sole target of criticism in the wall street journal etc it now seems clear from looking at all the different analyses eg as summarized in last years nrc review by north et that mann is an outlier though not egregiously so of course like any good scientist mann argues that his methods get you closer to the truth than anyone else but the bottom line for is simply that all the different studies find that the rate of warming over the last 50100 years is unusually high compared with previous centuries summarizing all this the latest ipcc does back off bit from the previous one it says on page 8 some recent studies indicate greater variability than mann in preindustrial northern hemisphere temperatures than suggested in the tar the wording is perhaps insufficiently apologetic but i find it hard to object strenuously to it in light of the main point noted in the last paragraph if you want to discuss any of this further let know i attach my latest presentation and would appreciate seeing both christophers report mentioned in the journal editorial and freds comment on rahmstorfs article published in science last week best regards curt christopher monckton moncktonmailcom wrote dear mr covey many thanks for coming back to so quickly you mention hansens recent papers i have recently been looking at an attached earlier projection of his the projection of temperature increase which he made to the us congress in 1988 effectively starting the globalwarming scare updating his graph shows that annual global mean land and sea surface air temperature is not rising anything like as fast as his attentiongrabbing but now manifestlymisconceived scenario suggested indeed it is beginning to look as though temperature is beginning to fall below his estimate based on co2 having been stabilized in 1988 morner the worlds leading authority on sea level has been very clear in saying there is very little evidence to justify the ipccs sealevel projections the ipcc itself forecast up to 094m sea level rise in century in its 1996 report up to 088m in its 2001 report and now 043m in its 2007 report if one loosely defines whatever t he ipcc says as the consensus then not only does the consensus not agree with itself it is galloping in the direction of the formerlyderided sceptics as to future world population i did some research on this several years ago because the was making alarmist noises and this alerted to the likelihood that we were being fed political propaganda masquerading as science i learned that the prime determinant of dp in any population is the general level of prosperity in that population as prosperity increases dp tends to zero the prosperity factor is many times more potent as an influence on dp than even enforced artificial contraception or childkilling since i expect world prosperity to increase in the coming century i regard it as nearcertain that dp will tend to zero in the next halfcentury the reason for the plummet thereafter is the widespread availability and use of artificial methods of birthcontrol the combined effects of rising general prosperity and the general availability of artificial birthcontrol on depressing indigenous population are already discernible in all those western european populations not having to cope with mass immigration from poorer countries in russia the indigenous population is falling so fast that muslims will soon form more than half the population as to the hockeystick problem the nas report does state very clearly that though the conclusion of mann et is plausible evidence going back more than 400 years before the present is increasingly unreliable and that very few reliable conclusions can be drawn if one goes back more than 900 years this illustrates one of the problems bedevilling the climatechange question too much of the data and processes on the basis of which we are trying to draw conclusions are unreliable incomplete or very poorly understood this should not deter scientists from trying to make increasingly intelligent guesses but anyone with diplomatic knowledge of the fastemerging fastgrowing fastpolluters such as china india indonesia and brazil will tell you that the ruling regimes in these countries will not try to prevent their people from enjoying the fossilfuelled economic growth we have already enjoyed unless and until the science is honest the uncertainties are admitted and the case is strengthened by the accumulation of measurements and the improvement of analytical techniques in the coming years finally you are right to take to task for using words such as rubbish and useless i apologize that said validation skill not significantly different from zero indicates that valid scientific conclusion may be drawn from the hockeystick graph original message from curt covey to christopher monckton subject sea level rise hires paleodata etc date wed 27 dec 2006 150551 0800 pst dear dr monckton thanks for copying on your correspondence with fred and prompting to look again at ipcc sea level rise estimates for 2100 i agree you are comparing likeforlike the 2001 report has an upper limit of 07 meters for the a1b scenario if the 2007 report lowers this to 043 meters or if the number gets raised again before the report is made final it will certainly be appropriate to ask why after reading hansens recent papers i dont see how to justify such small upper limits it also seems obvious to and apparently to you but not to fred that the a2 scenario would entail more sea level rise than a1b regarding the relative likelihoods of scenarios i dont agree with you that its almost certain that world population will plummet in the second half of this century regarding the issue of recent vs earlier global warming when i look at the totality of data compiled by north et this year for their nas nrc report see attached graphic it seems clear that most of the warming since about 1850 or 1900 occurred in recent decades going farther back in time the data are of course more uncertain and estimates vary but it appears that the warming rate for the 20th century was unusually high compared with the past 2000 years this conclusion follows whether or not one includes mike manns data for the record i must add that i do not share your characterization of manns work as rubbish or useless nor do i see situation of flagrant dishonesty in which the and the scientific journals persist long after the falsity of their absurd and extreme claims has been properly demonstrated sincerely curt covey christopher monckton moncktonmailcom wrote dear fred many thanks for sending this exchange some comments temperature this question like so many others to do with supposed climate change is bedevilled by the recency of reliable instrumentbased observations nevertheless some conclusions can be attempted the dalton minimum is generally considered to have come to an end in 1910 the fiveyear mean global land and sea surface air temperature anomaly for 19081912 calculated from ncdc annual figures was 03579k by 1940 there had been rapid increase of 04700k to 1121k by 2004 again taking the fiveyear average including 2006 there had been further increase of 04413k to 05534 the mean annual increase in the 30 years 10101940 was thus 00157k more than two and quarter times greater than the 00069k mean annual increase in the 64 years to 2004 mean global temperature has hardly risen at all in the five years since the ipccs last report and the fact of the 20thcentury temperature increase tells us nothing of the cause it is interesting for instance that the polar icecaps on mars are receding inferentially in response to increased solar activity at any rate it is certain that anthropogenic planetary warming is not responsible it is possible therefore that most of the warming both before and after 1940 was heliogenic sea level your correspondent does not disagree with my statement that the ipcc has revised its upperbound estimate of sea level rise to 17 inches 043m he says however that this upper bound is based on the a1 scenario by which world population will peak in midcentury at 9bn and fall thereafter so was the 2001 reports upper bound of 088m i was correctly comparing like for like the sunday telegraph which reported these figures has been told that the revisions arise from better data now available to the ipcc supporting skeptics conclusions that the ipccs figures are little better than exaggerated guesses morner 2004 concludes firmly that there is little evidence for sea level rising any faster now than it has in geologicallyrecent times your correspondent says that the a2 scenario is businessasusual in fact it is an extreme scenario regarded by very nearly all serious demographers as absurdly unrealistic in that it posits an increase in world population to 15bn by 2100 when it is now almost certain that rising prosperity and the consequent decrease in birth rates will cause population to peak somewhere between 9bn and 10bn in midcentury and plummet thereafter reliability of the ipccs reports i understand that the ipccs 2007 draft does not contain an apology for the defective hockeystick graph which the us national academy of sciences has described as having validation skill not significantly different from zero in plain english this means the graph was rubbish it is difficult to have confidence in body which after its principal conclusion is demonstrated in the peerreviewed scientific literature and in numerous independent reports as having been useless fails to make the appropriate withdrawal and apology worse the continues to use the defective graph this failure of basic academic honesty on the ipccs part was the main reason why i began my investigation of the supposed climatechange consensus the supposed scientific consensus your correspondent seems unaware of the letter written by 61 canadian and other scientists in climate and related fields to the canadian prime minister at the end of the attached commentary on gores recent attempt to rebut my articles on climate change in the sunday telegraph beneath the references i have appended the full text of the letter and the names qualifications and thencurrent affiliations of all 61 scientists gore and others tend to lean rather more heavily than is wise upon single rather bad onepage essay in science for their contention that there is scientific consensus to the effect that most of the warming in the past halfcentury was anthropogenic the essay was by oreskes 2004 who said that she had analyzed 928 abstracts mentioning climate change published in peerreviewed journals on the thomson isi database between 1993 and 2003 and that none of the 928 had expressed dissent from the consensus dr benny peiser of liverpool john moores university subsequently made more careful enquiry science had been compelled to publish an erratum to the effect that the search term used by oreskes had not been the neutral climate change which returned some 12000 articles but the more loaded global climate change which returned 1117 articles of these dr peiser found that only 1 had explicitly endorsed the consensus as defined by oreskes that almost three times as many had explicitly expressed doubt or outright disagreement and that less than onethird had expressed explicit or implicit agreement with the consensus he wrote paper for science pointing out these serious defects which pointed to conclusion diametrically opposite to that of oreskes science at first asked him to shorten his paper and then said that because conclusions like his had been widely reported on the internet his paper would not be published as far as i can discover science has not published any corrigendum to this day providing further confirmation of what i have long suspected that the leading peerreviewed journals having unwisely taken stronglypolitical editorial positions on the question of climate change are longer objective the need for honest science it was only after years of increasinglypublic pressure that nature was induced to oblige mann et the authors of the useless hockeystick graph that starred in the ipccs 2001 report to publish mealymouthed partial and unsatisfactory corrigendum in such an environment of flagrant dishonesty in which the and the scientific journals persist long after the falsity of their absurd and extreme claims has been properly demonstrated it is in my view unreasonable to expect china india indonesia brazil and other fastpolluting countries to deny to themselves the fossilfuelled economic growth which we in the west have been fortunate enough to enjoy until there is honest science one will believe either the or the journals to the extent of adopting the expensive and on my calculations probably futile remedial measures which they and their supporters so stridently advocate christopher original message from s fred singer to curt covey subject re belated response to say youre sorry

showmanship hyperbole and conjecture for substantial discussion the following recent quips from their letters to the editor may interest you fred singers claim 13 december that more than 70 of the warming observed since the end of the little ice age in 1850 occurred before 1940 and thus before much humanemitted co2 fred has been saying this for long time i think it was true 20 years ago uptodate records eg this years nas report from north et show that much more than half the warming since c1850 has occurred after 1940 dear curt i am sure you are aware of the fact that such ratios depend entirely on the choice of time intervals i dont want to quibble but surely the relevant fact is that most agree incl ipcc but not tom wigley that the pre1940 warming was mostly due to natural causes lord moncktons claim 13 december that the presumably ipcc is about to cut its highend estimate of sealevel rise in 2100 from three feet to just 17 inches we are not supposed to discuss ipcc reports before they become final but the last draft i saw does indeed project 17 inches 043 meters of sealevel rise as the highend climate model estimate from emissions scenario a1b the scenario itself however is one in which to quote ipcc global population peaks in midcentury and declines thereafter and the rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies has atmospheric co2 leveling off by the end of the century businessasusual scenario like a2 would give much higher sealevel rise by 2100 i dont think so but you will have to read my forthcoming response to rahmstorf in sciencexpress meanwhile peruse the attached senator inhofes comment today 18 december that 60 scientists together with claude allegre leading french scientist who is member of both the us and french national academies of sciences have concluded that agreements like kyoto are unnecessary because the cause of global warming is unknown presumably true but so what allegre is an awardwinning geochemist the other 60 scientists are unidentified there are tens of thousands of members of the american geophysical union alone many of whom are petroleum geologists im sure you can find few
