investment in the united states major federal statutory restrictions summary foreign investment in the united states is matter of congressional concern it is believed by some that the united st ates has an unusually liberal policy which allows foreigners to invest in virtually all american businesses and real estate and that these foreign investments undermin the american economy by making it vulnerable to foreign influence and dominati on these critics argue that there is even foreign domination of some ke defenserelated i ndustries and that the ability of the country to protect itself in time of nati onal emergency could greatly suffer these critics further argue that extensive foreign i nvestment in this country drives up prices which americans have to pay for investme nts and even more importantly for houses and farmland in areas where there is significant amount of foreign ownership however others argue that the ited states should welcome foreign investment because the influx of foreign money contributes to the creation of jobs in this country some also believe that the united states should be kind of sanctuary for foreign money because of the po litical and economic instability which characterizes much of the rest of the world it is also argued that in this age of globalization of the worlds economy ited states restrictions on foreign investment will only impair this nations ec onomy and cause us to appear isolationist this report takes look at some of th major federal statutes which presently restrict investment by fore igners the report first give s brief history of foreign investment in the united states it then reviews constitutional justifications and constitutional limitations which exist concerning federal statutory restrictions on foreign

under united states law by the committee to study foreign investment in the united states of the section of co rporation banking and business law of the american bar association new york 1979foreign investment in the united states major federal statutory restrictions history of foreign investment in the united states traditionally accepted principles of international law state that the sovereign powers of nation include the power to exclude alien persons and property1 however in most cases so as to be mutually beneficial to commerce nations usually do not fully exercise this power of excl usion sometimes nation writes the restraints into its domestic law for example clause xxx of the magna carta has the following provision all merchants if they were not openly prohibited before shall have their safe and sure conduct to depart out of england to come into england to tarry in and go through england as well by land as by water to buy and sell without any manner of evil tolts2 by the old and rightful cust omers except in time of war and if they be of land making war against us and be found in our realm at the beginning of the wars they shall be attached without harm of body or goods until it be known unto us or our chief justice how our merchants be entered therein the land making war against us and if our merchants be well entreated there theirs shall be likewise with us treaties and other forms of bilateral and multicultural agreements have also restricted foreign persons and property for example the greek citystates formed agreements which allowed the reciprocal entry of and ownership of property of foreigners from other contracting states3 the united states has through the years accepted both kinds of restraint4 the american colonies were formed to realize profits for their english and continental investors after the war of independen ce the new government moved quickly to resolve the outstanding foreign claims so as to assure creditwor thiness and to provide favorable climate for foreign investment the jay treaty for example stated thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33103crs2 5 3 annals of congress 994 1791 6 boorstin foreign investments in america 2

any property which had been seized or destroyed and for unpaid debts caused by the revolution in his report on manufactures in 1791 alexander hamilton urged the new nation to keep investme nt open to foreigners it is not impossible that there may be pers ons disposed to look with jealous eye on the introduction of foreign capital as if it were an instrument to deprive our own citizens of the profits of our own i ndustry but perhaps there never could be more unreasonable jealousy instead of being viewed as rival it ought to be considered as most valuable auxiliary conducing to put in motion greater quantity of productive labor and greate r portion of useful enterprise than could exist without it5 hamiltons ideas prevailed during the 18th and 19th centuries foreign capital contributed enormously to the nations development as the nation grew its roads bridges canals banks and finally railroads were largely financed by state bonds sold overs eas the erie canal the first american canal to achieve commercial success was made possible by the first state bonds to be quoted on the london market in 1817 europe was eager for investments such as these and group of angloamerican banking houses were established in london led by baring brothers wh ich specialized in american finance they bought up entire issues for resale in england in their eagerness for foreign capital american states and private ente rprises sent their agents to europe generals and congressmen turned to bond selling6 by the middle of the 19th century foreigners held lf of the federal and state and onequarter of the muni cipal debts the 1849 california gold rush sparked even more foreign investment it is also interesting to note that am erican real estate was quite popular with foreign investors europeans acquired subs tantial holdings in such states as new york maine florida west virginia and iowa the state of texas granted an english company 3 million acres in payment for building the state capitol building in austin some of the titled europeans including the german baron von richthofen and the british earl of dunraven attempted to create baronial estates in the west at the turn of the century with the invention of the automobile and the increasing importance of oil foreign oil companies such as royal dutch shell began buying american properties howe ver world war i made drastic change in the influx of foreign capital into the united states the creditor countries of europe sold many of their american holdi ngs in order to supply their wartime needs in just few years the united states sh ifted from debtor to creditor nation position which it retained for number of years7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33103crs3 7 continued nation imports more than it exports creditor

march 3 1887 ch 340 1 24 stat 476 9 art i 8 cl 4 10 art i 8 cl 3 11 art i 8 cl 12throughout the nations history there s been criticism of foreign investment in the united states when the first nd second banks of the united states were created in 1791 and 1816 their organic stat utes barred the election of aliens as directors the knownothing party advo cated discriminatory taxation of foreign capital as early as the 1850s the alie n land law of 1887 prohibited aliens from owning land in federal territories8 during the 20th century congress passed number of statutes aimed at restricting foreign investment in certain industries such as shipping aviation and communications nevertheless by the early 1970s foreign investment in the united states began to ri dramatically and since then there has been frequent congressional deba as to whether there s hould be more restriction on investment by foreign citizens in american businesses constitutional justifications and limitations federal constitutional provisions may be interpreted as legal validation of federal statutes restricting investments by foreigners other constitutional provisions have to be adhered to by the states in imposing additional restrictions on foreign investment the federal government is government of limited powers there is express constitutional provision permitting the regulation of foreign investment in the united states thus other federa l powers mentioned in the c onstitution must be looked at to justify such regu lation three constituti onal bases for such legislation are the federal powers over immigration and naturalization9 the federal power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce10 and the power to provide for the national defense11 congress has the exclusive power to tablish naturalization and citizenship requirements and to admit and expel aliens that the government of the united states through the action of the legislative department can exclude aliens from its territory is proposition which we do not think open to controversy jurisdiction over its own territory to that extent is an incident of every independent nation it is part of its independence if it could not exclude aliens it would be to that ex tent subject to the control of another power the united states in their re lation to foreign countries and their subjects or citizens are one nation invested with powers which belong tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33103crs4 12 chinese exclusion case chae chan ping v united states 130 us 581 603604 1889 13 see fiallo v bell 430 us 787 1977 14 art i 8

434independent nations the exercise of which can be invoked for the maintenance of its absolute independence and security throughout its entire territory12 congress has also been held to have th power to regulate the conduct of alien residents and to prescribe the conditi ons for their admission and residency13 thus it is arguable that congress can condition entry and residency of an alien upon his or her not acquiring investments in the united st ates although this might be an extreme condition to apply federal case appears to suggest limits to congresss ability to place substantive conditions upon try and residenc of aliens congress also has the exclusive power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states14 the commerce clause would appear to give congress the power to restrict the use of instrumentalities of interstate commerce to transact the sale or exchange of property to foreign citizen or to the representative of foreign citizen15 finally congresss power to raise nd support armies would also appear to be constitutional basis for restricting foreign investment in the united states if it is determined that foreign investments impair national preparedness in the event of an emergency it appears that prohibition of foreign investments could on this basis be construed as constitutional further it should be noted that the fe deral government has exclusive authority over foreign relations in the case zschernig v miller 16 the supreme court held unconstitutional an oregon statute which provided for the escheat to the state of property which would otherwise pass to nonresident alien unless the laws of the foreign nation had reciprocal rights for united states citizens the oregon statute required the local probate courts to inquire into the type of governments that obtain in pa rticular foreign nations whether aliens under their law have enforceable rights whether the socalled rights are merely dispensations turning upon the whim or capr ice of government officials whether the representation of consuls ambassadors and other representatives of foreign nations is credible or made in good faith whether there is the actual administration in the particular foreign system of law any element of confiscation17httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33103crs5 18 note united states regulation of foreign direct investment current developments and the congressional response 15 v j intl l 611 621 1975 19 see plyler v doe 457 us 202 1982 20 403 us 365 1971the court found the oregon statute to be unconstitutional because it infringed upon the exclusively federal aut hority over foreign relations on the other hand it has been stated that the imposition of any significant investme nt controls would likely violate both the spirit and the letter of more than fo rty bilateral treaties regulating trade and investment relations many of which laws have been signed within the last ten years as well as derogating our commitmen t to the oecd code of liberalization of capital movements18 the treaties mentioned in the above quotation are trea ties of friendship commerce and navigation which grant foreign countries the right to enter trade invest or establish and operate busine sses in the other signatory country thus any foreign investment statute would need to take into account those friendship commerce and navigation treaties to which the united states is signatory further treaties such as the north american free trade agreement nafta among the united states canada and xico provide for foreign investment opportunities chapter 11 of nafta require s each party to accord to investors of another party treatment less favorable than it accords in like circumstances to its own investors with respect to the estab lishment acquisition expansion management conduct operation and sa or other dispositi on of investments other constitutional provisions may be interpreted to protect foreigners from certain acts of state and local governments because the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution apply to persons instead of to citizens these provisions guarantee that states cannot abridge the rights of foreign nationals within the united states19 the supreme court has in the past voided state laws which blish classifications in government actions solely on the basis of citizenship in doing so the court has stated that classification based solely upon citizenship or nationality is inherently suspect and subject to strict scrutiny for example in graham v richardson20 the court held that state laws which denied welfare benefits to resident aliens who had not resided in the united states for required number of years we re unconstitutional because they deprived these persons of equal protection of the laws under traditional equal protection principl state retains broad discretion to classify as long as its classification has reasonable basis citations omitted this is so in the area of economics nd social welfare citations omitted but the courts decisions have established th at classifications based on alienage like those based on nationality or race are inherently suspect and subject to close judicial scrutiny aliens as class are prime example of discrete and insular minority citations omitted for whom such heightened judicial solicitude is appropriate accordingly it was said in takahashi 334 us at 420 that thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33103crs6 21 id at 371 22 takahashi v fish and game

1979 28 it is also possible that nonresident aliens ch as japanese bank doing business in the united states are entitled to the same degree of equal protection under the fourteenth amendment as resident aliens but this is an issue which appears not to have been settled by the courts with respect however to acti ons by the federal government it appears clear that congress can discriminate against nonresident aliens so long as the restriction is reasonable and does not violate their procedural rights see eg statutes discussed later in this report major cases challenging their constitutionality were foundpower of state to apply its laws exclusiv ely to its alien inhabitants as class is confined within narrow limits21 as mentioned in the takahashi case22 in the above quota tion state must be careful in applying state laws exclusively to aliens this case challenged california statute which barred the issuance of commercial fishing licenses to persons ineligible for citizenship the supreme court held that this statute violated the fourteenth amendments equal protection clause and the federal laws concerning citizenship citizenship has also been rejected as legitimate classification concerning membership in state bar23 complete bans on employment of aliens in the state civil service system24 and the granting of educational benefits to aliens25 yet the supreme court has limited the application of these protections in other cases one concerning new york statute limiting appointment to the state police for ce to united states citizens26 and another concerning new york statute forbidding certification of noncitizen as public school teacher unl ess the person had evidenced intent to become citizen27 therefore there appears to be an exception to the general rule that classification based on citizenship is subject to strict judicial scrutiny in situations where the classification relates to an essential governmental political or constitutional function in such situations the less strict rational basis test may be applied from this discussi on it may be concluded that state laws restricting investments by at least re sident aliens may come unde r strict judicial scrutiny28 yet it must be remembered that in contrast to the states the federal government has broad authority over naturalization and immigration for reasons long recognized as valid the responsibility for regulating the relationship between the united states and our alien visitors has been committed to the political branches of the federal government since decisions in these matters may implicate our relations with foreign powers and since wide variety of classifications must be defined in the light of changing political and economichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33103crs7 29 mathews v diaz 426 us 67 81 1975 30 id 31 kleindienst v mandel 408 us 753 1972 32 see chinese exclusion case chae chan ping v united states 130 us 581

attribute of the sovereignty of the united states32 present federal restrictions on foreign investment four major federal statutes which have an impact upon fo reign investment in the united states are informationgathering and disclosure statutes instead of actual restriction statutes one of these statutes is the international investment and trade in services survey act of 197633 congress intended this act to provide clear and unambiguous authority for the president to collect information on international investment and united states foreign trade in services whether directly or by affiliate s including related information necessary for assessing the impact of such investme nt and trade to authorize the collection and use of information on direct invest ments owned or controlled directly or indirectly by foreign governments or persons and to provide analyses of such information to the congress the exec utive agencies and the general public34 the president by executive order delegate d responsibility under this act for studying direct investment to the commerce depar tment and portfolio investment to the treasury department35 the act directs the presiden t to conduct benchmark survey of foreign direct investment in the united states every five years36 amendments to the act in 1990 direct the president to pub lish for the use of the general public and federal agencies periodic information co ncerning foreign investment including information on ownership by foreign governments of united states affiliates of business enterprises the owners hip or control of

bureau of economic analysis bea of the department of commerce of the best available information on the extent of foreign direct investment in given industry38 another federal statute having an impact upon foreign investment in the united states is the foreign direct investment nd international financ ial data improvements act of 199039 the purpose of this act is to allow the department of commerce s bureau of economic analysis bea access to information collected by the bur eau of the census census this access will improve the accuracy and analysis of beas reports to the public and to congress on foreign direct investment in the united states40 this act among other requirements adds chapter 10 to title 13 of the united states code to provide that the bureau of the census shall exchange with the bureau of economic analysis of the department of commerce any information that is collected under the census provisions and under the in ternational inves tment and trade in services survey act that pertains to business enterprise operating in the united states if the secretary of commerce determin that the information is appropriate to augment and improve the quality of the data collected under the survey act the data improvements act of 1990 also requires that other reports be prepared by the secretary of commerce and the comptroller general and submitted to congressional committees41 the bureau of the census may pr ovide business data to the bureau of economic analysis and the bureau of labor statistics bls if the information is required for an authorized statistical pur pose and the provision is the subject of written agreement with that designated statistical agency or its successors42 the third of these informationgathering and disclosure statutes is the agricultural
