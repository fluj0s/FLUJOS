2008 pervaze sheikh analyst in natural resources policy resources science and industry division debtfornature initiatives and the tropical forest conservation act status and implementation summary in the late 1980s extensive foreign debt and degraded natural resources in developing nations led to the creation of debtfornature initiatives that reduced debt obligations allowed for debt repayments in local currency as opposed to hard currency and generated funds for the environment these initiatives called debtfor nature swaps typically involved restructuring reducing or buying portion of developing countrys outstanding debt with percentage of proceeds in local currency being used to support conservation programs within the debtor country most early transactions involved debt owed to commercial banks and were administered by nongovernmental conservation organizations and referred to as threeparty swaps since 1987 threeparty transactions have generated more than an estimated 117 million in local currency for conservation projects as result of the purchase of approximately 168 million in debt face value for 49 million other debtfornature initiatives involved official public debt and were administered by creditor governments directly with debtor governments termed bilateral swaps in the early 1990s the united states restructured and in one case sold debt equivalent to face value of nearly 1 billion owed by latin american countries these transactions were authorized by congress as part of the enterprise for the americas initiative eai which broadened the scope of debt swaps to include number of social goals nearly 178 million in local currency for environmental natural resource health protection and child development projects within debtor countries was generated from these swaps the model for debtfornature initiatives outlined in the eai was expanded in the tropical forest conservation act tfca to include countries around the world with tropical forests under this program debt can be restructured in eligible countries and funds generated from the transactions are used to support programs to conserve tropical forests within the debtor country since 1998 952 million has been used under the tfca to restructure loan agreements in 12 countries and nearly 1625 million in local currency will be generated in the next 1226 years for tropical forest conservation projects the tfca was authorized for appropriations under pl 108323 until fy2007 the tfca is being considered for reauthorization under hr 2185 and s 2020 in the 110th congress debtfornature transactions are generally viewed as success by conservation organizations and debtor governments because of the funds generated for conservation efforts the appeal of debtfornature transactions has been tempered in recent years however by higher debt prices on secondary markets and lower appropriations as result fewer transactions have taken place this report provides

transactions 19872007 14 debtfornature initiatives and the tropical forest conservation act status and implementation background information debtfornature initiatives were conceived to address the rapid loss of resources and biodiversity in developing countries that were heavily indebted to foreign creditors conservationists had noted that the pressure to pay off foreign debts in hard currency was leading to increased levels of natural resource exports ie timber cattle minerals and agricultural products at the expense of the environment in many cases indebted developing countries had difficulty meeting their hard currency debt obligations and defaulted reducing foreign debt and allowing for portions of it to be paid with local currency while increasing funds for the environment was thought to improve environmental conditions in developing countries and had the advantage of relieving the debtor countrys difficulties in procuring sufficient hard currency to pay off its debts1 money generated from debtfornature transactions has been used to fund variety of projects ranging from national park protection in costa rica to supporting ecotourism in ghana and conserving tropical forests in bangladesh since 1993 there has been declining trend in the number of debtfornature transactions involving official public and private funds accounting changes requiring new appropriations to support official public debt transactions in creditor countries such as the united states and higher price of commercial debt on secondary markets are two reasons suggested for the decline of debtfornature transactions while congress has periodically authorized us participation in three party debtfornature swaps and has supported two bilateral debtfornature initiatives appropriations to support these types of efforts have generally diminished over the years debtfornature initiatives and their mechanisms threeparty swaps threeparty debtfornature swaps involving nongovernmental organizations such as the nature conservancy and conservation international were the first debt fornature agreements to be formed in threeparty swap conservation group purchases hard currency debt owed to commercial banks on the secondary market 1 thomas lovejoy iii aid debtor nations ecology new york times oct 4 1984 sec p 31 crs2 or in some cases public official debt owed to creditor government at discounted rate compared to the face value of the debt and then renegotiates the debt obligation with the debtor country2 the debt is generally sold back to the debtor country for more than it was purchased for by the ngo yet less than what it was on the secondary market the proceeds generated from the renegotiated debt to be repaid in local currency are typically put into fund that often allocates grants to local environmental organizations for conservation projects see figure 1 in these cases the fund is administered by the conservation organization representatives from local environmental groups and the debtor government money to buy the debt initially may come from the nongovernmental organization governments banks or other private organizations figure 1 an illustrative example of threeparty debtfornature swap agreement step 1 200000 to purchase debt bank or creditor government nongovernmental organization 1 million of debt step 2 1 million of debt is restructured local conservation groups debtor government 300000 in local currency step 3 step 1 an outstanding debt is sold to ngo at discounted rate eg 20 of face value of 1 million which is 200000 step 2 the debt is cancelled by the ngo as part of an agreement that requires the debtor country to provide funds in local currency equivalents for local conservation groups eg 30 of the original face value which is 300000 step 3 the debtor country provides the agreed to funds to local conservation groups in 1989 congress authorized the united states agency for international development usaid to provide assistance to nongovernmental organizations to purchase the commercial debt of foreign countries as part of debtfornature agreement pl 101240 22 usc 22822286 several nongovernmental organizations participated in debtfornature swaps with financial assistance from 2 sometimes debt is donated to the ngo in the threeparty swap crs3 usaid however specific information on funds given by usaid to support three party debtfornature swaps is not available while debt initiatives conducted with threeparty swaps are numerous they have resulted in less reduction in total debt than the debts swapped under bilateral agreements governmenttogovernment and slightly less in conservation funds generated in total 168 million in debt face value has been reduced restructured or swapped using this

governments the creditor government determines the criteria for eligibility which usually involve the existence of certain financial and political conditions in the debtor country debt agreements are usually cancelled and then restructured to extend payback periods or in some cases debt is bought back by the debtor country for discounted price money for the environment can be generated through interest payments from the debtor country if the debt is restructured or from percentage of the buyback price see figure 2 multilateral debtfornature agreements have also been conducted between more than one creditor country and debtor country see table 2 poland for example benefitted from multilateral debtfornature agreement from 1991 to 1997 during this time five countries restructured debt obligations with poland generating over 473 million in local currency for environmental projects the united states was the primary participant in this deal swapping 10 of polands debt to generate 367

disbursements out of the fund10 funds can be used to support environmental natural resource health protection and child development programs within the debtor country debt swaps buybacks and restructuring are three mechanisms used to conduct debtfornature transactions under the eai seven of the eight countries that have participated in debtfornature transactions under the eai used the debtrestructuring mechanism to generate environmental funds see table 3 only peru took advantage of the debt buyback option in debtrestructuring agreement the original debt agreement is cancelled ie

the united states under three other programs 1 commodity credit corporation programs 2 exportimport bank loans and 3 foreign aid loans administered by usaid 10 the americas trust fund can be either an endowed fund or sinking fund depending on the agreement reached by the united states and the debtor country interest payments made by debtor countries on their new restructured loans are deposited into the fund these payments form the principal of the fund and interest earned on this principal and the principal itself can be used to fund environmental community development and child survival and development programs crs8 currency to be deposited into an environmental fund in 1992 for example the united states reduced 10 of 310 million face value debt owed by colombia in return for the deposit of 416 million in local currency into an environmental fund by the colombian government over 10 years11 in debt buyback the debtor country purchases its debt at reduced price the lesser of either 40 of the repurchase price or the difference between the face value of the debt and the repurchase price is deposited in local currency into an environmental trust to support environmental and child support programs in the debtor country pl 104107 title v sec 574 for example in 1998 peru took advantage of this program and bought back 177 million in debt for 57 million generating nearly 23

be eligible for this program developing country must contain at least one tropical forest with unique biodiversity or tropical forest tract that is representative of larger tropical forest on global continental or regional scale14 political and macroeconomic criteria for eligibility are almost identical to those used for participation under the eai15 conservation funds in local currency from these transactions are deposited in tropical forest fund for each country the fund is overseen by an administrating body composed of one or more appointees chosen by the us government and the government of the beneficiary country and individuals who represent broad range of environmental academic and scientific organizations in the beneficiary country the majority of the board is represented by these individuals this fund operates in the same manner as the americas fund local currency payments of interest accrued on restructured loans are deposited into tropical forest fund and serve as the principal interest earned from this principal balance and the principal itself is usually given in the form of grants to fund tropical forest conservation projects eligible conservation projects include 1 the establishment maintenance and restoration of parks protected reserves and natural areas and the plant and animal life within them 2 training programs to increase the capacity of personnel to manage parks 3 development and support for communities residing near or within tropical forests 4 development of sustainable ecosystem and land management systems and 5 research to identify the medicinal uses of tropical forest plants and their products the tfca was reauthorized for appropriations in 2004 including 20 million for fy2005 25 million for fy2006 and 30 million for fy2007 this law also authorizes funds to conduct audits and evaluations of debtfornature programs tfca evaluation sheet has been created to evaluate the performance of tfca country

debtfornature initiatives authority for debtfornature initiatives early debtfornature legislation concentrated on understanding and promoting thirdparty debtfornature swaps see appendix for legislation summaries and united states code citations congress in 1989 directed the secretary of the treasury to ask the us executive director of the world bank to develop pilot debtfornature program and other ways of reducing debt owed by foreign countries while generating funds for the environment subsequent law the international development and finance act of 1989 authorizes usaid to make

american and caribbean countries pl104107 in 1998 the tropical forest conservation act tfca was passed allowing debt swaps buybacks and restructuring to generate funds for tropical forest conservation worldwide funding for the tfca was reauthorized by congress in 2004 pl 108 223 and is currently being considered for authorization in the 110th congress in the house hr 2185 and senate s 2020 the reauthorization bills being considered would both expand the tfca to include coral reefs hr 2185 further expands the tfca by including all forest types as eligible for conservation activities s 2020 would maintain activities only to tropical forests hr 2185 would authorize 30 million annually in appropriations for the tfca from fy2007 through fy2010 s 2020 would reportedly authorize 20 million in fy2008 25 million in fy2009 and 30 million in fy2010 rationale for and criticism of debtfornature initiatives advocates of debtfornature initiatives argue that reducing debt in developing countries will help create freemarket systems as part of the reforms required for eligibility stimulate economic growth and trade liberalization provide incentives for foreign investment and help protect the environment converting hard currency debts to local currency debts advocates argue will lower debt burdens on developing countries and in the long run may reduce resource extraction at the expense of the crs12 environment critics of debtfornature initiatives argue that only small percentage of debt is reduced thereby minimizing the positive benefits of debt reduction in developing countries for example in some transactions under the tfca the interest paid for the debt is used for conservation projects while the principle of the debt remains supporters point out that while the percentage of debt reduced by debt fornature transactions is small conservation funds generated for debtor countries are generally significant relative to what the country would have originally spent on conservation16 the relationship between debt reduction and lower resource extraction rates is controversial some analysts suggest that debt reduction has direct relationship to lower extraction rates of minerals or timber in developing countries with foreign debt17 advocates of debtfornature initiatives note that the united states has history of supporting debt reduction initiatives in developing countries and appropriating funds for environmental causes recent appropriations by the united states to support the heavily indebted poor countries hipc initiative 22 usc 262p6 support the claim for reducing debt in developing countries18 hipc was created by international creditors the world bank and imf to reduce debt of poor countries that have demonstrated social and economic policy reforms that enable fluid export revenues and capital inflows19 funds generated for the environment in developing countries are argued to improve local environmental conditions promote sustainable resource use and help to preserve global biodiversity and ecosystem services advocates also suggest that debtfornature transactions that generate funds to support tropical forest conservation are especially appropriate most tropical countries with high levels of total debt owed to the united states also have some of the largest areas of tropical forest cover for example brazil and peru have debts to the united states totaling over 1 billion each and have two of the largest areas of tropical forest cover in the world20 other countries such as the democratic republic 16 for example ecuador reduced its external debt of 83 billion by only 1 million from debtfornature swap yet doubled its budget for parks and reserves with money received from the resulting conservation fund 17 dal didia debtfornature

congo and sudan also fit this pattern however these countries may be ineligible for debtfornature transactions under the tfca due to political and economic eligibility requirements21 those who oppose debtfornature transactions often argue that they are not adequately enforced by debtor countries generate insufficient funds to improve environmental problems and may infringe on national sovereignty22 threeparty debt swaps have historically had weak enforcement mechanisms however bilateral debt swaps such as those conducted under the eai generally include safeguards and default provisions to protect the us government from losing funds national sovereignty became an issue in bolivia when conservation organization was reported to have obtained title to forested lands there was public outcry and ensuing political crisis when the bolivian people thought large part of their country had been given to foreign organization consequently conservation organizations involved in recent threeparty swaps have generally refrained from directly buying land in debtor countries with conservation funds earned from swaps decline of debtfornature transactions the number of debtfornature transactions has declined in recent years perhaps due to accounting changes that require greater appropriations to fund debtfornature transactions with official public debt and higher price of commercial debt on the secondary market see figure 3 before 1991 appropriations were required for debt cancellations and the united states cancelled between 11 and 12 billion in debt between 1988 and 1991 this changed with the federal credit reform act of 1990 2 usc 661a et seq this law requires that the net present value npv to the united states of debts of foreign countries be used to report the cost of debt restructuring buybacks swaps and cancellations to the us government the npv of the cash flow of the loan is calculated often giving consideration to projected default losses fees and interest subsidies therefore appropriated funds for these programs must be used to cover the interest fee longer coming to the united states in the case of funds set up under eai and tfca and the difference in the npv of the loan that may result from restructuring23 decline in threeparty commercial debtfornature swaps may also be due to the conclusion of brady plan operations by latin american countries the brady 20 continued 2001 21 participation in threeparty debtfornature swaps through usaid is not subject to the same economic and political criteria required for participation in tfca and eai debtfor nature transactions an eligible country must be committed to plan for and have government or local nongovernmental organization responsible for the longterm viability of the programs under the swap agreement 22 r t deacon and p murphy the structure of an environmental transaction the debt fornature swap land economics 1997 pp 124 23 stacy warden the tropical forest conservation act powerpoint presentation us department of treasury washington dc 2001 crs14 plan allowed for partial debt forgiveness with restructuring of the remaining debt into bonds that could be traded on the securities markets when this program was concluded the price of debt on the secondary market increased and financing leverage decreased making it difficult and less attractive for environmental organizations to acquire debt for resale24 further debt relief for developing countries is available through other programs that allow for relatively greater amounts of debt to be cancelled eg hipc these programs may be more desirable to developing countries with debt than debtfornature initiatives under the eai or tfca under the tfca there was an 18month period from 2004 to 2006 when transactions were made lastly the political and economic requirements needed to be eligible for debtfornature transactions make it difficult for several countries to participate in eai or

debtfornature transactions is referred to as subsidized debt swap in subsidized debt swap an ngo generally matches 20 of the us government contribution toward debtfor nature transaction for example in recent transaction with panama in 2003 the 24 the world bank world debt tables 1996 washington dc 1996 crs15 us government provided 56 million and the the nature conservancy provided 12 million to reduce panamas debt by 10 million and generate 10 million in conservation funds the transaction is completed when three agreements are signed 1 the us government and the beneficiary country sign debt restructuring agreement 2 the us government and the ngo sign an agreement to transfer ngo funds and 3 the ngo and the beneficiary country sign forest conservation agreement25 in subsidized swap the us

implemented by the us government have been supported with appropriations eg under the eai and now the tfca authorization for 7 of the last 10 years debtfornature transactions administered by the united states have focused on transactions under the tfca since most of the transactions are relatively new there have been comprehensive analyses of their effectiveness in preventing the destruction of tropical forests some contend that fair analysis might not be possible until 10 years after the implementation of transaction nevertheless many conservation organizations support the framework of the tfca and suggest that it should serve as model for conserving other ecosystems such as coral reefs and grasslands transactions under the tfca are expected to continue since it is included in the administrations strategy to address global climate change28 tropical forests make up the largest proportion of carbon stored in terrestrial land masses and are thought to be carbon sink despite uncertainties on the part of some it is generally thought that maintaining existing tropical forests will store carbon and that preventing deforestation will reduce the entry of carbon into the atmosphere29 indeed pending debtfornature swap with indonesia under the tfca has been billed as cooperative effort to deal with climate change by the indonesian president30 28 see
