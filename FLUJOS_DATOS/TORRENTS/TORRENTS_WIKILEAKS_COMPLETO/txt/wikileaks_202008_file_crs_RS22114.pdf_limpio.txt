unanimous c onsent it on march 9 2006 president bush signed it pl 109 205 on march 23 2006 this report will be updated as events warrant permanent normal trade relations pntr status has been an issue in usukrainian relations since the country obtained its full sovereignty with the collapse of the soviet union in december 1991 legislation to gran t pntr to ukraine had been introduced in previous congresses but received further ac tion as critics raised concerns about some ukrainian trade practices among other issues recently the significance of the issue has been elevated in the wake of the orange revolution in ukraine that led to the election of president viktor yushchenko at the end of 2004 at his april 4 2005 washington summit meeting with president yushchenko pr esident bush pledged to work towards securing pntr for ukraine in his april 6 2005 address to joint meeting of the us congress president yushchenko urged memb ers of congress to grant ukraine pntr while ostensibly trade issue granting pntr is seen by many as also foreign policy instrument to convey us support fo r democraticallyelected leader who has indicated his intention to strengthen ties with the united states and western europe and reduce dependence on russia yushchenko s made pntr top priority in ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22114crs2 1 see crs report rl32845 ukraines orange revolution and us policy by steven woehrelukrainian relations1 at the same time some view debate on pntr as an opportunity for the congress to weigh in on us policy toward ukraine and to make sure that us economic interests as well as foreign policy interests are considered granting ukraine pntr status requires change in law because ukraine is denied unconditional and permanent ntr under title iv of the trade act of 1974 which includes the socalled j acksonvanik amendment what is ntr status and the jacksonvanik amendment normal trade relations ntr or most favorednation mfn trade status is used to denote nondiscriminatory tr eatment of trading partner compared to that of other countries only few countries do not have ntr status in trade with the united states in practice duties on the imports from count ry which has been granted ntr status are set at lower concessional rates than those from countri that do not receive such treatment thus imports from nonntr count ry can be at large price disadvantage compared with imports from ntrstatus countries section 401 of title iv of the trade act of 1974 requires the president to continue to deny nondiscriminatory status to any count ry that was not receiving such treatment at the time of the laws enactment on january 3 1975 in effect this meant all communist countries except poland and yugoslavia sec tion 402 of title iv the socalled jackson vanik amendment denies the countries elig ibility for ntr status as well as access to us government financial facilities such as the exportimport bank or the overseas private investment corporation opic as long as the country denies its citizens the right of freedom of emigration thes restrictions can be removed if the president determines that the country is in full compliance with the freedomofemig ration conditions set out under the jacksonvanik amendment for country to maintain that status the president must reconfirm his termination of full compliance in semiannual reports due by june 30 and december 31 to congress his deter mination can be overturned by the enactment of joint resolution of disapproval c oncerning the december 31st report the jacksonvanik amendment also permits the president to waive full compliance with the freedomofemigration requirements if he determines that such waiver would promote the objectives of the am endment that is encourage freedom of emigration this waiver authority is subject to annual rene wal by the president and to its possible congressional disapproval via joint resolution before country can receive ntr treatment under either the presidential deter mination of full compliance or the presidential waiver it must have conclude d bilateral agreement that provides for among other things reciprocal extension of ntr or mfn treatment the agreement and presidential proclamation extending ntr st atus cannot go into effect unless joint resolution approving the agreement is enactedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22114crs3 2 economist intelligence unit country risk service ukraine march 2005 p 17the united states extended ntr treatment to ukraine under the presidential waiver authority beginning in june 1992 after the two countries signed and entered into force bilateral agreement as required under title iv of the trade act of 1974 since june 1997 ukraine has received ntr status under the full complianc provision presidential extensions of ntr status to ukraine have met with virtually congressional opposition thus for ukraine permanent normal trade relations pntr status is mostly symbolic because its tariff status would not change while ukraine remains subject to the jack sonvanik amendment some of the other former soviet republics have been granted pntr by the united states for example kyrgyzstan and georgia received pntr in 2000 most recently armenia received pntr in january 2005 usukrainian economic ties during the cold war ussoviet economic ties were very limited they were constrained by national secur ity and foreign policy restrictions including the jackson vanik amendment they were also limite d by soviet economic policies of central planning that prohibited foreign investme nt and tightly controlled foreign trade since the collapse of the soviet union uk raine has struggled with shedding the structures of planned economy and build ing market economy these problems hampered ukraines economic growth early in the transition period in the last few years ukraines gross domestic product gdp has grown at fairly ra pid rates but many observers contend that ukraine needs to address problems with contradictory and excessive government regulati ons and corruption if it is to reach its economic potential ukraine remains heavily tied economically to russia it is highly dependent on russia for energy and russia accounts for ar ound 18 of ukraines exports and 40 of ukraines imports however ukraine has been diversifying its trading partners the eu has become an important trading partner2 the united states has encouraged closer economic ties with ukraine since the collapse of the soviet union along with granting conditional ntr status the united states has made government loan guarant ees from the us exportimport bank available to us exporters to ukraine and has ma insurance and credit programs from the governmentoperated overseas private investment corporati on opic available to us investors in the ukraine although increasing usukrainian trade remains very small in 2005 ukraine was the 78th export market for the united states and the 75th source of imports it accounted for about 05 of total us exports and 07 of total us imports in 2005 in 2004 the united states accounted for about 3 of ukra inian exports and 2 of ukrainian imports in 2005 over half of us imports from ukrain consisted of steel and steel products plus coke that is used in making steel shar p increase in us imports from ukraine in 2004httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22114crs4 3

from the us perspective one of the most serious i ssues is the lack of ukrainian enforcement of intellectual property rights ipr the united states trade representative ustr identified ukraine as priority foreig n country in 2002 2003 and 2004 under the section 182 of the trade act of 1974 as amended also called special 301 at this time ukraine is the only country that the ustr has so identified although othe r countries have been identified as potentially problematic5 the ustr took this action because of ukraines failure to adequately prevent the production and distribution of pirated optical disks cds and cdroms as result the united states withdrew gsp benefits for ukraine in august 2001 benefit that the united states had extended to promote trade and economic development in ukraine in january 2002 the united states also imposed 100 tariffs under 23 tariff items with an annual value of around 75 million6 on august 31 2005 the united states announced that it was going to lift the tariffsanctions in recognition of steps ukraine had taken to imp rove its ipr laws the office of the ustr announced on january 23 2006 that it has restor ed ukraines gsp benefits 7 us exporters and investors have cited other problems that plague the business environment in ukraine for example the ukrainian government prevents foreign banking and insurance providers from establis hing branches in addition us exporters consider some ukrainian government health and safety regulations and certification procedures to be unnecessarily burdensome and government procedures for

application of the jacksonvanik amendment ukrainian officials have raised other issues in its trade relations with the united states foremost among them is the application of nonm arket economy nme status by the us department of commerce to trade with ukra ine under us antidumping laws fair prices for imports from nonmarket economies ar calculated differently then prices on imports from market economies the methodolog used to make these calculations leads to higher antidumping margins and ther efore places imports from ukraine at competitive disadvantage visavis other impor ts or us domestic production in august 2002 the department of commer ce indefinitely deferred its final decision on whether to eliminate the nme design ation for ukraine and told ukraine it needed to resubmit its request for such status the ukrainian government did so in march 2005 and the commerce department granted ukra ine nme status on february 17 2006 prospects implications and legislation although pntr has been an issue in usu krainian relations for many years trade issues and political issues such as allegati ons of official ukrainian involvement in the september 2000 murder of uk rainian investigative journa list georgy gongadze had caused us political leaders to distance themselves from the regime of thenukrainian president kuchma the election of president viktor yushchenko has elevated the priority of pntr for the bush administration and th congress support for pntr for ukraine appears strong nevertheless concerns about ipr protecti on in ukraine and other trade issues are likely to arise during debate on pntr some nontrade issues may arise as well for example while the representa tives of the jewish community acknowledge improvement in the lives of ukrainian jews they have expressed concerns about what they consider to be the slow pace at which jewish community property seized during the holocaust and the soviet period is being re turned its owners granting ukraine pntr status will have little direct impact on usukrainian trade ukrainian imports have entered the unite d states on an ntr or mostfavorednation mfn basis since 1992 however ukraine is negotiating with the united states and other members of the world trade organization to enter the wto wto members must extend reciprocal mfn pntr treatment to one another if ukraine becomes wto members and the united states does not grant ukraine pntr it would force the united states to invoke the nonapplication article x iii of the wto agreement which would prevent the application of the entire wto agreement including all of ukraines concessions between the united states and ukraine pntr has considerable political importance to ukraine it would signify ukraines treatment as norma l country by the united states the timing of extending pntr could have political implications as well especially relating to russia russian president putin has been pressing the united states to grant it pntr

and 108th congresses to do so recei ved further congressional action because of concerns regarding russian ipr and other trade practices the russian political leadership would likely be upset if ukraine received pntr from the united states before russia the house passed 4172 hr 1053 gerl ach on march 8 2006 the senate passed unanimous consent it on march 9 2006 th president signed the bill
