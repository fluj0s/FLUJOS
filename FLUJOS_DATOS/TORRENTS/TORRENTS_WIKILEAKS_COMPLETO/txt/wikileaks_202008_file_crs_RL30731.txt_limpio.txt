at 233 billion in fy2008 see table 5 the bush administration request for fy2009 is 241 billion of the total amount spent by the federal government on hivaids in fy2008 the majority 63 of funding is

programs table 2 provides history of hhs discretionary funding for hivaids from the beginning of the epidemic in fy1981 to the present funding for hivaids programs within hhs has increased markedly over the past 15 years as measured in constant 2000 dollars shown in figure 4 near the end of this report even though hhs has revised its estimates of spending by medicaid for fy2007 through fy2009 figure 4 still shows that most of the overall rise can be attributed to increased spending on medicaid medicare and treatment programs in the discretionary budget largely through the ryan white program administered by the health resources and services administration hrsa the increase in hivaids research and prevention programs has been much less pronounced and their portion of the total amount spent by hhs on hivaids has declined over the past 15 years see figure 5 for example in fy1992 hivaids research and prevention programs at hhs accounted for 51 of the total amount spent by hhs on hivaids by fy2008 such programs were about 27 of the total amount spent by hhs on hivaids reflecting the growing amounts spent on treatment services under medicaid and medicare crs3 figure 2

persons and families and certain aged disabled and medically needy individuals in order to obtain medicaid coverage persons must belong to one of the categories of persons who can qualify for coverage such as families with children and disabled persons and have low income or deplete their income on the cost of their care medicaid has played an important role in needed health care for persons with hiv and aids because of its coverage of prescription drugs within broad federal guidelines each state designs and administers its own medicaid program resulting in wide variations among the states in coverage benefits offered and payment for services the portion of states medicaid budget provided by the federal government varies from 50 in relatively affluent states to 80 in poorer states medicaid is one of the largest source of federal funding for aids treatment and health care services see figure 3 for fy2008 the federal share of medicaid spending on aids treatment is estimated at 41 billion and for fy2009 the federal share estimate is 44 billion total fy2008 federal and state medicaid spending for aids treatment will be an estimated 72 billion 41 billion federal and 31 billion state5 cms

improved drug therapies the life expectancy of individuals with hiv has increased and it is expected that the number able to qualify for medicare coverage will continue to rise11 the medicare
