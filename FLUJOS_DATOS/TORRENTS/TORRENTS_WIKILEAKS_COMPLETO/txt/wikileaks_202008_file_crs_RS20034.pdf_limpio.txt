rs20034 updated may 8 2002 proposed and actual budget totals for the fiscal years 1980 through 2001 philip d winters analyst in government finance government and finance division summary the federal government rarely forecas ts its budget accurately the complicated combination of factors underlying the pr esidents and congress budget proposals almost ensures some difference with the eventual outcome the underlying assumptions include future economic cond itions and technical compone nts of the budget models some of the factors in this process ar themselves volatile and susceptible to change contributing to the ongoing evolu tion of budget proposals and estimates the original proposals are necessary and useful indicators of the policy choices proposed by the president and congress as well as indicat ors of the general ma gnitude and direction expected from the federal budget for the upcoming fiscal year this report contains table of proposed estimated and actual budget totals for the fiscal years 1980 through 2001 the totals used in the report are based on total receipts and total outlays not on propos ed or approved nnual appropriations which provide only portion of the government s annual spending budget this document is updated as ne w budget data become available it is not designed to track specific budget legislation federal budget totals the data table 1

publication the economic and budget outlook fiscal years 19891993 data in the table including the congre ssional budget resolution were adjusted by crs to reflect unified budget totals rather th an the several definiti ons of budget totals that were in use in various years during this period the information necessary to consolidate the budget data was not available in each instance and is so noted in the table see for example 1980 1982 and 1984 among others in most years the adjustments were relatively small compared to the size of the totals these adjusted totals provide relatively consistent and comprehensive measures of budget data within each year and across time they eliminate as much as possible the differences in the numbers resulting from periodic adjustments in budget accounting practices also note that the adoption of annual ppropriations provides only portion of each years budget authority and subsequent outlays appropriations are not addressed in this report why budget estimates change aside from policy changes by congress nd the president between the initial budget proposals and the end of the fiscal year two factors produce changes in the budget totals first forecasting future economic conditions is an inexact process and the economic conditions that actually occur should be expect ed to differ from those originally forecast second modeling the federal budget is inherently difficult and imprecise the errors in the budget numbers that flow from the probl ems with modeling are largely unavoidable both types of errors tend to be larger with longerrange budg et estimates such as the 5 year or 10year budget outlook currently in cluded in many official budget reports although the errors are generally smaller wh made only 15 to 20 months ahead of the end of the fiscal year they still contribute to some of the differences between the initial budget proposals and the final budget outcome each year most often in late january or early february the administration submits an annual federal budget to congress for the fis cal year that begins the following october the budget documents contain what the admin istration expects the budget incorporating the effects of the presidents policy choices will look like during the next fiscal year and in subsequent years the administration and congress must base its proposed budget on uncertain underlying assumpti ons made 20 to 21 months in advance of the end of the next fiscal year this generally results in the final budget numbers that are different from those originally proposed even when c ongress and the president are in complete agreement on the new years policies cbo releases an analysis of the pres idents budgetary proposals usually within several months of the presidents budget s ubmission these are th reestimates in the table the cbo report recasts the admin istrations policy pr oposals using cbos economic forecast and technical estimating ssumptions this annual report is one of several sources that highlight the significant effects that economic and technical assumptions can have on the budget estimates the choice of economic forecast can havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20034crs3 2 for thorough exploration of the congressiona l as well as the federal budget process see manual on the federal budget process crs report 98720 gov 3 cbo economic and budget outlook an update aug 1987 p 64 4 the budget resolution does not n eed the presidents approvalvery noticeable effects on the budget estimates differences in th technical assumptions underlying budget estimates also may cause significant differences among the various budget estimates following the presidents budget propos congress produces its annual budget resolution as part of the congressional budget process2 the congressional budget resolution is plan for guiding subs equent tax and spending decisions3 in this instance proposed policy differences as well as po ssible differences in underlying economic assumptions and budget estimating models may result in differences between the congressional and presidents budg et plan congress may want more or less spending or higher or lower revenues than the president or different mix of either and congress may have different view of how the econom will perform during the ensuing fiscal year congress often uses cbos ec onomic and technical assump tions in constructing the annual budget resolution the result is that congress is likely to develop budget plan that differs from what the president proposed4 implementing the budget resolution require s legislation conditions can change between the adoption of the budget resoluti on and the implementing legislation the changes economic natural disasters war or others may lead congress and the president to adopt legisla tion that does not follow the outline in the budget resolution thus between the passage of budget reso lution and the adoption of implementing legislation some differences in budg et totals are likely to arise as the fiscal year passes the economic nd technical assumptions that underlay the original budget estimates from the president and congress often differ from the actual results changes in the underlying assumptions will change budget numbers pushing the budget totals away from earlier estimates and proposals in addition legislation may be adopted such as supplemental appropriations that further lters the budget totals from what was originally envisioned we should not be surprised then that the final budget numbers differ by various amounts from the original proposals from the president and congress the budget process itself has at times in cluded requirements th at have contributed to the differences between the original administration and congressional budget proposals and the final totals in fy1990 and fy1991 th budget rules in place set specific deficit targets for budget proposals targets that were viewed by many as unrealistic and unattainable the actual deficits for those two years were indeed two to four times larger than the original administra tion and congressional proposals the

year 1999 the presidents budget documents incl ude chapter in the volume called analytical perspectives that provides explanations for the changes in the budget that occurred between the initial administration proposal and the actual budget outcome the causes of the differences between the original proposals and actual budget outcomes are generally divided into the three categories policy economic and technical the fy2003 budget document uses the original clinton administration fy2001 budget proposals from february 2000 the results show that differences between the original policy proposals and the actual policies implement ed decreased the rplus by 129 billion differences between assumed and actual econo mic conditions increased the surplus by 32 billion and changes in technical assumptions increased the surplus by 40 billion the combined effect reduced the initial 184 billi on clinton administration surplus to the actual surplus of 127 billion even the final budget figures are not immune from change although changes are almost always relatively small errors may be made in co mpiling the final budget figures for the year but these are usually minor and corrected quickly of more importance are the revisions that may occur if changes ar made in budget accounting practices in each new budget omb generally revi ses historic budget data to conform to current budget accounting practices the effect of chan ges in budget accounting can be to change apparently true historic budget numbers from one set of historical data to the next this may confuse the unwary and may complicat budget comparisons when using budget documents from several different years conclusion it is not surprising that final budget tota ls for the federal g overnment do not match those originally proposed by the administra tion or congress the assumptions policy economic and technical on which the budget proposals or estimates are based are likely to change over time the essentially unavoidable changes in these underlying assumptions almost guarantee that the actua l outcome for the budget will differ from the original proposals and estimates
