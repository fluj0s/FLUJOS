travel free meals and entertainment by lobbyists to members of congress congressional staff and some executive branch officials have focused broad public and congressional attention on the interactions between government officials and lobbyists the first amendment to the constitution provides opportunity for interest groups to participate in public policy making by prohibiting laws abridging freedom of speech while guaranteeing the right of the people to peaceably assemble and to petition the government for redress of grievances but lobbying is controversial any consideration of current law related to lobbying will likely involve discussing the balance between open transparent and accountable governance through thorough public disclosure of activities carried out by lobbyists and the rights of lobbyists on their own or on behalf of client to exercise constitutionally guaranteed rights the attention of policy makers has in the past focused in two general areas 1 the efficacy of current lobbying disclosure requirements and 2 congressional rules governing interactions between lobbyists members of congress and their staffs and statutes governing similar relationships between lobbyists and executive branch officials this report focuses primarily on issues related to lobbying disclosure procedures and their potential amendment the regulation of lobbying disclosure is governed by the lobbying disclosure act of 1995 lda as amended during the early organizational period prior to the 110th congress it was reported that leaders of the new incoming majorities in both chambers indicated that lobbying disclosure procedures are likely to be considered as part of broader package of ethics and procedural initiatives related to lobbying activities some of that consideration might include the following issues related to lobbying disclosure 1 defining clients under lda to incorporate coalitions and grassroots lobbying 2 frequency and

introduction some of the areas widely believed to be influenced by lobbyists include general legislation and administrative rulemaking the inclusion of earmarks in appropriations legislation that benefit narrow interests1 and campaign finance practices2 recent incidents concerning convicted lobbyist and the provision of privately funded travel free meals and entertainment3 by lobbyists to members of congress congressional staff and some executive branch officials have focused broad public and congressional attention on the interactions between government officials and lobbyists the first amendment to the constitution provides opportunity for interest groups which might lobby either in their own behalf or through paid lobbyists to participate in public policy making by prohibiting laws that unduly abridge freedom of speech the right of the people to peaceably assemble and to petition the government for redress of grievances4 any consideration of current law related to lobbying will likely reconsider the balance between open transparent and accountable governance through thorough public disclosure of activities carried out by lobbyists and the rights of lobbyists

political system the pursuit of private interests through adoption and amendment of public policy dates from the founding of the republic writing in support of the new as yet unratified constitution in 1787 james madison identified interest groups or factions groups of citizens united by common impulse of passion or of interest as cornerstone of the american regime but one that had potentially negative connotations5 in 1830 alexis tocqueville observed that in country in the world has the principle of association been more successfully applied than in america and that the inclination to association was positive benefit for american society6 more than two centuries after madisons writings appeared the role of interest groups and lobbyists in contemporary policy making is still controversial in the past 40 years observers have noted steady increase in the number of organized interest groups including associations public interest groups and professional organizations many of these groups lobby in their own behalf or retain the services of lobbyists additionally these observers note change in the types of activities lobbyists employ to influence policymaking longstanding lobbying techniques of establishing personal ties with members of congress their staffs and executive branch officials testifying at congressional and administrative hearings and supporting public officials in their reelection efforts have been supplemented by marketing techniques some of these techniques include direct mail public relations newspaper advertisement and other approaches to generate attention and interest in public policies and programs in an effort to influence the decisions of policy makers one consequence of this growth is an increase in the costs of lobbying some observers assert that money plays critical role in gaining access to policy makers and thus desired policy outcomes for those who commit such resources these observers assert that lobbyists might use money to gain favor and influence 5 see federalist number 10 in the federalist by alexander hamilton james madison and john jay edited by benjamin fletcher wright cambridge ma the belknap press of

campaign contributions hosting fundraising events or raising and bundling contributions to members of congress or their leadership political action committees pac 2 arranging trips for members or other government officials paid for by their clients or employers 3 arranging privately owned aircraft for travel at below market costs 4 paying for parties or meals and tickets to sporting and entertainment events making contributions to foundations established or controlled by public officials and 5 financing retreats and conferences held by members or other public officials those observers assert that because such funds are intended to help influence the decisions of members they must be subject to appropriate controls to protect the integrity of congressional decisions7 others counter that the primary activity of lobbying is communication process regarding issues that may effect firms organizations and citizens and that such communications are legitimate and necessary part of the american political process proponents of this view assert that lobbyists representing broad range of interested parties help members and their staffs both to sort through the large volume of legislative initiatives that are typically introduced in each congress and make informed decisions regarding those initiatives for them effective lobbying is not about access or money but organizing and providing information to congressional and executive branch officials regarding the necessity and potential consequences of various legislative or regulatory initiatives from variety of viewpoints from their perspective enforcement of current rules and regulations regarding disclosure and interactions between government officials and lobbyists such as those cases recently adjudicated8 and enhanced education about those rules are preferable to enacting more rigorous disclosure regimes9 since the interactions between lobbyist and policy makers are protected under the first amendment there is likely way to prohibit those interactions in manner consonant with the constitution instead activities of individuals and firms that are compensated as lobbyists are tracked through system of direct and indirect disclosure of contact and other interactions but not the content of those interactions direct disclosure of lobbying activities is required under the lobbying and

achieved through disclosures by federal candidates of the sources of their funding required under the federal elections and campaigns act feca10 as amended but the correlation of the activities of lobbyists and any contributions they might make to candidates is not the intended focus of that law generally concern has been expressed that current lobbying disclosure requirements may be inadequate to track all the activities of lobbyists in manner that assures level of transparency sufficient to allow broad understanding of the influences and motivations that animate public policy making some observers believe that one solution to this purported problem is to link data collected under lobbying disclosure and campaign finance disclosure laws to achieve clearer understanding of the roles lobbyists play in addition to the constitutional challenges there are practical limitations to identifying the consequences of lobbying activity it is unclear for example how effective lobbyists are at advancing the interests of their clients in policy environment characterized by many lobbyists offering many points of view relatively few policy makers and the simultaneous demands of constituents vying for consideration some argue that money buys access and lots of money buys lots of access11 and that preferred policy outcomes could follow12 on the other hand some observers suggest that constituents get the attention of member of congress faster than lobbyist due to members perception of representational duty and perceived electoral pressures13 the difference of interpretation is due in part to the difficulties inherent in efforts to quantify lobbying interactions or in developing qualitative evaluations that capture lobbying activities14 nevertheless this paucity 10 2 usc 431 11

grassroots lobbying lobbyists firms or activities are not specified or considered in lda concern has been expressed that entities that use anonymous lobbying activities and public relations campaigns might circumvent the process of public consideration of lawmaking and regulatory activities observers suggest that the current lda definition of client might allow interested entities to shield their lobbying activities through the use of ostensibly separate independent coalitions and associations24 some of these coalitions and associations sometimes referred to as stealth groups form alliances with other groups or serve as groups that exist solely to advance campaign for or against specific policy action25 political scientists darrell west and burdett loomis assert that anonymous campaigns are carried out in voter education efforts and electoral legislative and rulemaking settings and that the key in each of these efforts is that the actual sponsor is masked by front organizations that make it difficult for the public to see who really is funding the activity stealth campaigns are consciously designed to fly under the radar of press and public oversight26 in addition to concerns regarding stealth lobbying observers have noted steady increase in the number of interest groups using direct mail public relations newspaper advertisement and other marketing techniques to generate public interest these activities can include engaging citizens to lobby on their behalf to persuade government official regarding legislation or executive agency action some of these organized efforts which are not currently subject to disclosure under lda are also accompanied by sophisticated media campaigns to advance the causes of group27 widespread lobbying campaigns may be targeted to citizens journalists lawmakers executive agency personnel and other groups with interests similar to those of the organization on whose behalf the campaign is mounted28 this practice is sometimes referred to as grassroots advocacy to identify its appeal to the general public some observers noting the use of marketing techniques and alleging that bona fide 23 office of the clerk of the house of

anonymous or otherwise are not new writing series of articles that became known generally as the federalist papers alexander hamilton james madison and john jay30 sought to persuade the general public in the 13 united states and new york residents in particular to press their leaders for ratification of the us constitution in 1787 and 1788 85 articles authored by the trio appeared in newspapers throughout the country under the pseudonym publius as part of what has been described as the most significant publicrelations campaign in history31 in the articles the three authors made mention of their close association with the constitutional convention that drafted and approved the document currently however concern has been expressed that entities that use anonymous lobbying activities and public relations campaigns to mobilize the public or sway public policy makers might circumvent the process of public consideration of lawmaking and regulatory activities those supporting more detailed disclosure through more frequent or detailed disclosure or the inclusion of grassroots lobbying efforts under lda might argue that such efforts could afford greater transparency and broader understanding of who supports or opposes particular policy initiative and why from their perspective such an initiative could lead to both better understanding within congress the lobbying communities and the general public of how lobbying activities affect the public policy making process and greater understanding and acceptance of the resulting outcomes critics could argue that expanding disclosure of the activities of coalitions and associations might have potential adverse impact on constitutionally protected rights of assembly association and to petition the government as well as the longstanding tradition of carrying out these activities without the necessity of selfidentification those critics are likely to argue that such changes could have chilling effect on expressing those views or the presentation of critical but politically sensitive matters to lawmakers from their perspective more rigorous disclosure of coalition and association membership could deny policy makers crucial source of information from parties directly affected by pending legislation or regulatory decisions critics of increased disclosure might argue that this could deter members of congress and executive branch decision makers from making broadly informed decisions in their deliberations and could reduce the effectiveness of policy making in general32 29 nicholas confessore meet the

requirements as described above changes could include shorter period between initial lobbying contact and registration narrower ranges of estimated expenditures and more frequent disclosure in addition coalitions and grassroots entities might also be required to disclose their activities those supporting changes to disclosure benchmarks might argue that more detailed disclosure process could afford more openness of government activity and greater accountability on the part of government officials lobbyists and lobbying clients those opposing changes to the current statute might maintain that filing increasingly detailed disclosure reports at more frequent intervals could obligate the registrant to spend increased time and money to comply with the law this could have the effect of further raising the costs associated with lobbying and might restrict the lobbying activities of some groups as consequence revolving door provisions lda requires registrants to disclose whether they have served as covered legislative branch or executive branch official in the two years preceding their registration relatedly 18 usc 207 requires that member of congress may not

official action on behalf of anyone else for period of one year after terminating congressional employment similar prohibitions apply to officials and senior level employees of the executive branch34 house and senate rules lda disclosure requirements and the cooling off prohibitions mandated by 18 usc 207 were designed to bring attention to and reduce the effect of what some called the revolving door through which legislators 32 continued requirements by jack maskell 33 under 18 usc 207 an employee is subject to post employment restrictions if for at least 60 days during the oneyear period

leave positions of authority and influence in government only to return shortly thereafter to the same circles as lobbyists or other representatives seeking favorable action on behalf of private interests efforts to curb the effects of lobbying by former public officials appear to grow out of widespread belief that lobbying activities advance special interests at the expense of the more general public interest lobbying activities carried out by individuals with special access to government decision makers due to previous professional interaction are sometimes said to exacerbate this perceived problem proponents of lobbying activities counter that lobbying is legitimate activity protected by the first amendment to the constitution and that all interests are represented35 some maintain that further efforts to extend the duration of the lobbying ban could have the effect of keeping individuals who might wish to pursue lobbying as career from entering public service and may deprive the public as well as congress of access to and the availability of the particular expertise of former legislators and staff disclosure of lobbyist contributions and payments the disclosure of campaign contributions is governed by feca the acceptance of gifts travel or other considerations by members of congress are governed by house rule xxv limitations on outside earned income and acceptance of gifts and senate rule xxxv gifts as well as criminal laws on bribery and fraud as part of broader consideration of lobbying related laws and rules congress might choose to consider changes to existing policies that clarify current practice or proscribe the acceptance of gifts meals or travel from lobbyists some of those proposals could amend lda to require the disclosure of campaign contributions and other payments by lobbyists proposals to link campaign finance and lobbying activities and to enhance current rules regarding the interactions between members of congress and lobbyists could serve to provide clearer picture of who participates in public affairs and the scope of the activities that characterize that participation proponents of such efforts might argue that such efforts could afford greater transparency and broader understanding of the effects of private interests in the public policy making process from their perspective such change might also instill greater government accountability and help to maintain the integrity and legitimacy of the broader political system those opposing changes to current lobbying disclosure practices might maintain that expanding lobbying disclosure to include those who make campaign contributions but who may not have any direct participation in lobbying activities could have an adverse effect on the accuracy of lda disclosure data due to potential increase in registrants who conduct lobbying but who must register due to affiliations with entities that retain lobbying services additionally opponents might assert that such change could increase the administrative burden associated with reporting on their activities under lda or curb rights of participation through 35 website of the

makes lda registration and disclosure reports available through the internet at httpsoprsenategov neither lda nor the federal election campaign act of 1971 feca require the linking of information collected under either law under lda registrants must register and files reports with the secretary and the clerk who maintain independent parallel intake procedures and separate electronic databases the linking of information maintained by fec and the clerk and secretary could raise data administrative and data management concerns these concerns might include consideration of the relative costs and benefits of linking parallel databases containing essentially similar information with another database system or the technical challenges of linking potentially incompatible datasets concerns might also arise regarding the merging of data maintained by legislative branch and executive branch entities regarding custody and management of commingled records lda enforcement whoever knowingly

institute criminal penalties for violations of lda the clerk and the secretary must refer alleged incidents of noncompliance to the united states attorney for the district of columbia the number of such referrals made since lda became effective on january 1 1996 is not publicly available during 2006 hearing held by the senate committee on rules and administration to examine procedures to make the legislative process more transparent however senator christopher dodd stated that since 2003 the senate office of public records has referred over 2000 cases to the department of justice and nothings been heard from them again40 the department of justice has reportedly claimed that between september 2003 and september 2005 it has received around 200 referrals involving possible lda violations and has pursued 13 of those cases for further enforcement action of that total media accounts have claimed that seven were still open as of february 2006 three had been closed without further action by the department and three were settled public announcements by the department regarding the settlements have been identified but it was reported that the three cases were settled for fines totaling 47000 and other considerations including periods during which some registrants were prohibited from conducting federal lobbying it is not known whether these cases comprise the total lda enforcement effort attorneys for the department of justice reportedly contend that the details of any settlements of violations under lda are protected from public disclosure by the privacy act41 an increase in potential penalties for noncompliance with lda arguably could increase the level of compliance but it may not be possible to assess those potential benefits given the lack of broadly accepted understanding of previous enforcement efforts those supporting the approach might argue that more comprehensive and detailed disclosure process could afford more openness of government activity and greater accountability those opposing changes to the current statute might maintain that there could be negative impact on constitutionally protected rights of assembly association and petition of the government additionally opponents might assert 39 for further discussion of lda and other laws rules and regulations affecting those who lobby congress see crs report rl31126 lobbying

whether individuals firms or coalitions withhold information lda administration and oversight lda is administered in the house by the clerk of the house through the legislative resources center and in the senate by the secretary of the senate through the senate office of public records there are explicit oversight requirements in lda the committee on house administration and the senate committee on rules and administration have jurisdiction over the clerk of the house and the secretary of the senate respectively and may have some oversight authority of lda provisions the clerk and the secretary must implement ethics in congress are overseen by the house committee on standards of official conduct and the senate committee on ethics congress might choose to consider range of options regarding the administration and oversight of lda these could include creation of an independent ethics commission within the legislative branch with authority to receive lda registration and reports lda administration could be transferred from chamber officers to the ethics committees in each chamber another option is the creation of an office of public integrity this office which could be created in the legislative branch or within each chamber could receive lda registrations and disclosure reports and conduct audits and investigations necessary to ensure compliance with lda any entity empowered to administer lda could also be vested with authority to refer violations of the act to doj for further investigation or prosecution in the event that criminal penalties are enacted the creation of new lda administration and oversight processes could require the transfer of previously filed disclosure data to the new entity in addition the creation of an office of public integrity ethics commission or transfer of lda responsibility to the chamber ethics committee could necessitate increased staff levels in the legislative branch and concomitant increases in costs to administer those programs finally any reassignment of lda administration might raise questions regarding the status of staff and offices that are currently responsible for administering lda the potential consequences of reorganizing lda administration are unclear for example it is arguable that vesting administration oversight in the chamber ethics committees might provide the opportunity to monitor the interactions between lobbyists and members of congress because those panels already have jurisdiction over congressional ethics rules governing members interactions with lobbyists on the other hand it is not clear how those panels might oversee the disclosure of lobbying interactions with executive branch officials similar concerns might affect ethics commissions or public integrity offices based in the legislative branch in addition to those concerns creation of integrity offices or commission in the legislative branch might raise constitutional questions regarding the house and crs16 senates authority to punish their members for disorderly behavior42 if those offices are vested with authority to investigate members of congress regarding potential ethics violations or prescribe discipline in the event that violation is determined to have occurred43 42 article i section 5 43 for further analysis of these issues see crs report rl33790 independent legislative commission or office for
