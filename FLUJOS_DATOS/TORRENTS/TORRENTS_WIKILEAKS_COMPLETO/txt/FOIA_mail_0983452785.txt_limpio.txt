from thomas l delworth tdgfdlnoaagov to michael mann mannmultiproxyevscvirginiaedu subject re letter to science date thu 01 mar 2001 081945 0500 cc tomoceantamuedu hpollackgeolsaumichedu mhughesltrrarizonaedu rbradleygeoumassedu pjonesueaacuk kbriffaueaacuk dear mike et i offer the following comments on your letter for your consideration it seems to there are 2 primary issues to address what does proxy evidence say about whether the medieval warm period was global b what do we know about potential mechanisms for the medieval warm period i evidence for forced phenomenon ii evidence for internal variability issue is currently dealt with in your sections 1 and 2 one point that could be perhaps conveyed more clearly is the necessity of using the spatial information conveyed in multi proxy reconstructions rather than overly interpreting sets of local proxy evidence i felt this point could have been stressed more and is one which the casual reader may not appreciate issue b bi is in your section 3 i suggest more explicit mention of conclusions with regard to the medieval warm period in recent work on this topic the first statement in this section doesnt provide i dont think explicit evidence to back itself up the sentence starting these results could be more explicit about what those studies show with respect to the medieval warm period in addition to the more general statement about the partitionng between forced and internal variability reader could ask ok if 50 of the variability is explained by volcanic and solar forcing that doesnt exclude the other 50 playing strong role for events such as the medieval warming such question could be dealt with in advance by stating what role these studies suggest for radiative forcing in the medieval warm period for issue bii i would suggest being explicit that it is incumbent upon authors to provide some evidence to support their speculation what evidence can the author provide to support his speculation concerning the role of the thc in the medieval warm period rather than explicitly stating this is not likely mechanism i would contrast the speculation he has offered on this topic to the stronger in my opinion evidence provided by modeling studies to support the idea of the importance of radiative forcing few more minor comments 1 i agree with the overall message you are conveying but might choose somewhat differing wording in place or two the statement is made 1 it cannot reasonably be argued that the middle ages were as warm as the 20th century at global or hemispheric scales this might be bit strong i would think one can have reasoned discussion on this topic perhaps something like we strongly disagree with the assertion that the middle ages were as warm as the 20th century at global or hemispheric scales 2 in the second to last sentence i would add the qualifying phrase on planetary scales after the text responsible for centennialmillenial changes regards tom delworth ps the central issue is one that i have not been heavily involved in and thus dont think its appropriate for to sign on as an author good luck and please send copy of your final submission pps i previously provided to tom correlations between the thc and globalhemispheric temperature based on 900 year run of our r30 coupled model these correlations were relatively low 027 but probably significant the applicability of those correlations to the issue of the medieval warming may not be strong if the medieval warming is multicentury event then i should really be looking at the correlations of low frequency 50 years filtered model output from run of several millenia duration thus the 900 year run may not be applicable i will revisit this topic using multimillenial r15 coupled run but probably wont have any results today i dont think that would change the essential conclusions however i recall that experiments with the r15 model in which the thc was substantially weakened through the addition of fresh water to the north atlantic provided strong regional temperature anomalies but their global expression was small these experiments are being repeated with the higher resolution model in light of these issues i suggest that the focus be not so much on saying the thc cannot be responsible for the medieval warming but rather on saying 1 there is strong evidence for substantial role of radiative forcing and 2 the burden is on the author to provide evidence for the role of the thc michael mann wrote dear colleagues below is draft of short letter to science that tom crowley and i have put together after discussing w phil ray and malcolm we feel that reply to broeckers recent perspectives piece is warranted to correct several misconceptions that wally unfortunately chose to perpetuate attached as an html file fyi we have been given encouragement to submit this by julia uppenbrink at science we are working under very tight timeline owing to toms travel schedule leaves on an extended travel on friday so we would greatly appreciate it if you could respond asap w comments suggestions etc please note that we are currently near the length limitations and probably shouldnt include more than 15 references so were looking to sharpen and hone but not lengthen the piece at this point thanks in advance for your feedback mike _________________________________________ medieval warming redux in recent perspectives opinion piece w broecker suggests that the hockey stick reconstruction of climate change over the past 1000 years with extreme warming only in the late 20th century is incorrect and that the socalled medieval warm period was at least as warm as the 20th century and due to oscillations in the thermohaline circulation to reach this conclusion dr broecker rejects traditional empirical proxy climate indicators of past climate eg tree ring ice core coral and long historical documentary records that are the foundation of number of hemispheric reconstructions as well as our current best physical understanding of the factors controlling climate at centurytomillennial timescales we disagree with broecker on several major points 1 it cannot reasonably be argued that the middle ages were as warm as the 20th century at global or hemispheric scales although regional warmth during the middle ages may have sometimes been significantly greater than present four different hemisphericscale reconstructions jones mann briffa crowley have been completed for the last 1000 years all of them showing warmth in the middle ages that is either warmer or significantly less than mid20th century warmth this is because it has been known for quarter of century that the timing of warmth during the middle ages was significantly different in different regions lamb dansgaard hughes failure to take this observation into account can lead to serious errors in the inference of hemispheric temperature trends although one analysis of heat flow measurements suggests warmer temperatures than the surface proxies during the middle ages huang and pollack grl 1997 the considerable sensitivity of the resulting trends to priori statistical assumptions has lead borehole researchers to restrict their attention to the more reliably interpretable temperature fluctuations during the past five centuries huang and pollack nature our conclusion is also supported by measurements from tropical glaciers indicating an unprecedented level of recent warming with respect to the last 10002000 years thompson 2 highresolution proxy climate records which form the foundation of recent hemispheric temperature reconstructions are far more reliable indicators of centurytomillennial scale climate variability than is implied by broecker the potential limitations in interpreting longterm climate change from proxy indicators such as tree rings have been long recognized by dendroclimatologists eg cook segment curse paper and are almost always taken into account in framing interpretations of longterm trends for example mann et 1999 verified that significant subset of multiplemillennial length tree ring and ice core proxy climate indicators used to reconstruct the trend over the past millennium passed rigorous statistical tests for fidelity at the millennial timescale and that the basic attributes of the hemispheric reconstruction using more recent nontree ring proxies available over the past few centuries yielded essentially the same result as that based on both tree ring and nontree ring based information mann et earth interactions 2000 several independent reconstructions jones et and crowley and lowery using wide variety of proxy climate indicators and different statistical approaches yield similar hemispheric temperature trends even the centennialscale changes within the socalled little ice age of the 15th19th centuries are largely in agreement furthermore these centennial changes have been shown to be in agreement rather than in opposition as argued by broecker with evidence from alpine glacial advances raper reference 3 physical considerations show that external forcing not internal variability played the dominant role in the transition from the medieval warm period to little ice age these terms are used loosely and are in fact ill advised in the context of hemispheric or global temperature changes see eg bradley and jones 1993 hughes and diaz 1994 one of the major points of broeckers argument is that changes in the thermohaline circulation are primary driver of climate change on this time scale these results do not consider recent modeling studies free crowley that demonstrate at high significance level 99 that about 50 of the preanthropogenic pre1850 variance can be explained by changes in volcanism and low frequency solar irradiance although the latter term is still not well constrained from observational studies there are number of independent lines of evidence suggesting such changes hoyt lean lockwood 4 it is not justifiable to argue that changes in the thermohaline circulation cause significant hemispheric or global changes in temperature although changes in the conveyor play major role in the atlantic basin to first approximation changes in ocean circulation simply redistribute heat on the planet without significantly raising global temperature or even hemispheric temperature this conclusion is born out by very low correlations between warmth in the greenland sector and the hemispheric indices over the last 1000 years crowley footnote ref low correlation that is shared by coupled model experiments delworth citation in fact sediment core data from the subtropical north atlantic often cited as indicative of distinct medieval warm period and little ice age keigwin sargasso sea has recently been shown to be more consistent with changes in the north atlantic oscillation keigwin and pickart implying zero sum pattern of regionally alternating warm and cold superimposed on far more modest hemispheric variations over the past 1000 years this pattern itself may be forced rather than internal in nature and would explain the limited evidence for more dramatic cold and warm periods in regions such as europe see mann sci perspective 2000 the above arguments lead us to conclude that although the conveyor may be changing radiative forcing perturbations were primarily responsible for centennialmillennial changes in the last 1000 years with attendant implications for interpretation of earlier holocene oscillations eg denton and karlen furthermore the weight of evidence indicates that the late 20th century hemispheric warming is significantly greater than the middle ages michael mann thomas j crowley who else
