dont have an adequat explanation as to how jack cooked up that figure i do not believe it was purely out of thin air look at the attached which i used in the crowleylowery composite just because it was out there i made claim that it was the record of record but just that it had been used beforer the lamb ref is his book dated 1966 i will have to dig up the page ref later dansgaard et 1975 nature paper on norsemenetc used that figure when comparing what must have been their camp century record have to check that too where the main point of that paper was that the timing of medieval warmth was different in greenlandn and england 25 years later my provocation for writing the cl paper came from strong statement on the mwp by claus hammer that the canonical idea of the mwp being warming than the present was correct and that the 1999 mann et was wrong he kept going on like that i reminded him that he was coauthor on the 1975 paper that is also what motivated to do my bonehead sampling of whatever was out there just to see what happened when you added them all together the amazing result was that it looked pretty much like mann et ther rest is history much ignored and forgotten i might also pointn out that in 1996 consequences article i wrote and that fred singer loves to cite jack who was the editor of the journal basically shoehorned into rereproducing that figure even though i didnt like it there was not an alternative in the figure caption it has similar one to zielinski except that it states compiled by rs bradley and ja eddy based on jt houghtonso that puts further twist on this because it point to houghton not bradleyeddy as the source jack must have written that part of the figure caption because i dont think i knew those details but we still dont know where the details of the figure came from the mwp is clearly more schematic than the lia actually the detailsl about timing of the samll wiggles in the lia are pretty good maybe there was meshing of the greenland and the england records to do the mwp part note that the english part gets cooler they may also have thrown in the old lamarche record which i also have maybe i can schlep something together using only those old three records tom michael mann wrote ray happy holidays and thanks for the quite fascinating background on this it would be good material for realclimate article would be even better if someone could get chris on record confirming that this is indeed the history of this graphic mike raymond s bradley wrote i believe this graph originated in literally grey piece of literature that jack eddy used to publish called earth quest it was designed for and distributed to high school teachers in one issue he had foldout that showed different timelines cenozoic quaternary last 100ka holocene last millennium last century etc the idea was to give nonspecialists perspective on the earths climate history i think this idea evolved from the old nrc publication edited by l gates then further elaborated on by tom webb in the book i edited for ucar global changes of the past this was an outcome of the wonderful snowmass meeting jack masterminded around 1990 i may have inadvertently had hand in this millennium graph i recall getting fax from jack with handdrawn graph that he asked to review where he got his version from i dont know i think i scribbled out part of the line and amended it in some way but have recollection of exactly what i did to it and whether he edited it further i dont know but as it was purely schematic appears to go through 1950 perhaps its not so bad i note however that in the more colourful version of the much embellished graph that stefan circulated 1 httpwwwpoliticallyincorrectde200611klimakatastrophe_was_ist_wirkl_1html the endpoint has been changed to 2000 which puts quite different spin on things they also seem to have fabricated scale for the purported temperature changes in any case the graph has objective basis whatsoever it is purely visual guess at what happened like something we might sketch on napkin at party for some overly persistent inquisitor so make sure you dont leave such things on the table what made the last millennium graph famous notorious was that chris folland must have seen it and reproduced it in the 1995 ipcc chapter he was editing i dont think he gave citation and it thus appeared to have the imprimatur of the ipcc having submitted great deal of text for that chapter i remember being really pissed off that chris essentially ignored all the input and wrote his own version of the paleoclimate record in that volume there are other examples of how jack eddys grey literature publication was misused in paper in science by zielinski et 1994 v264 p448452attached they reproduced in figure 1c similarly schematic version of holocene temperatures giving the following citation taken from j eddy and r s bradley earthquest 5 insert 1991 as modified from j t houghton g j jenkins j j ephraums climate change the ipcc scientific assessment cambridge univ press cambridge 1990 but i had nothing to do with that one so thats how crude fax from jack eddy became the definitive ipcc record
