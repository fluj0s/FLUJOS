public elementary and secondary schools grades prek12 in 20081 according to ed data 48 billion was spent on public school renovation and construction in 20062 school construction and renovation has traditionally been considered largely state and local responsibility the federal government has played relatively small role in financing school construction and renovation the federal government provides both indirect support for school construction mainly by exempting the interest on state and local governmental bonds used for school construction and renovation from federal income taxation and direct support via federal education programs such as impact aid this report discusses the federal role in financing k12 public school infrastructure examines estimates of the unmet need for infrastructure and summarizes potential legislative activity in the 111 th congress as well as legislation passed by the 110th congress

when the works progress administration financed 4383 new schools and renovated thousands of additional schools between 1935 and 1940 subsequently there were many proposals to provide aid for school construction andor school renovation however major general school construction legislation was enacted until 1994 3 the education infrastructure act of 1994 title xii of the elementary and secondary education act as amended by the improving americas schools act of 1994 pl 103382 was passed to provide direct federal assistance for the renovation and construction of public elementary and secondary schools among other things however the program never received funding attempts to increase federal assistance for needed improvements to school infrastructure continued in the 1990s and in 2001 the last general federal school renovation and repair legisl ation was passed as part of pl 106554 the consolidated appropriations act for fy2001 th is legislation appropriated 12 billion in funding for school renovation and repair in fy 2001 among other purposes the program did not receive funding in subsequent years

revenue attributable to the exemption of the interest on state and local governmental bonds used for school construction modernization renovation and repair from federal income taxation this exemption allows these bonds to be issued at lower interest rates but still provide competitive returns 4 additionally the federal government provides tax credits via qualified zone academy debt 1 the condition

data collected by ed of 903 public elementary and secondary schools weighted to provide national estimate these data are based on surveys of school officials rather that on direct independent data collection ed estimated the costs to bring school facilities into good condition10 in 1999 at 127 billion11 ed found that although most public schools in 1999 were in adequate or better condition significant number were not the ed survey found that approximately 25 of schools indicated that at least one type of onsite building was in less than adequate condition 12 50 indicated that 1 or more building features was not in adequate condition13 and 40 indicated that 1 or more environmental conditions was unsatisfactory14 there is not more recent government study of the physical condition of schools with an estimate of future school infrastructure needs however in january of 2007 ed issued report on the state of school facilities based on survey of school principals regarding whether various environmental factors at their schools were interfering with classroom instruction 15 threefourths of the principals responding to the survey indicated that they needed to spend funds on modernization renovation or repair of their schools the majority 56 of principals did not believe that environmental factors overall interfered with instruction the remainder reported that one or more environment factors did interfere with instruction although only 1 percent reported that these factors were major interference school infrastructure needs are affected not only by the age and physical condition of school but also by shifts in the student population or changes in school policies for example implementing smaller class size policies and by changes in technology and school instructional practices according to eds january 2007 study on the state of school facilities there continues to be discrepancy between school capacity and enrollment however eds data indicate that concerns about enrollment exceeding school capacity appear to have diminished since its previous study of these issues in 1999 eds 2007 study reported that the percentage of schools that were underenrolled by 6 to 25 increased from 33 to 38 between 1999 and 2005 and continued hereinafter referred to as condition of americas public school facilities 10 ed defined good condition to mean that
