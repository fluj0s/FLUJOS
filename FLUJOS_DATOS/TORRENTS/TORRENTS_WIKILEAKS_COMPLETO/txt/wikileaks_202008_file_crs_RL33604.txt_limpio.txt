macroeconomics government and finance division wayne m morrison specialist in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division is china threat to the us economy summary the rise of china from poor stagnant country to major economic power within time span of only 28 years is often described by analysts as one of the greatest economic success stories in modern times from 1979 when economic reforms were first introduced to 2006 chinas real gross domestic product gdp grew at an average annual rate of 97 the size of its economy increased over 11 fold its real per capita gdp grew over 8fold and its world ranking for total trade rose from 27th to 3rd by some measurements china has become the worlds second largest economy and it could be the largest within decade chinas economic rise has led to substantial growth in uschina economic relations total trade between the two countries has surged from 49 billion in 1980 to an estimated 343 billion in 2006 for the united states china is now its second largest trading partner its fourthlargest export market and its secondlargest source of imports inexpensive chinese imports have increased the purchasing power of us consumers many us companies have extensive manufacturing operations in china in order to sell their products in the booming chinese market and to take advantage of lowcost labor for exported goods chinas purchases of us treasury securities have funded federal deficits and helped keep us interest rates relatively low despite the perceived threat from china the us economy has recently maintained full employment and robust economic growth to date the growth in chinese exports appears to have come partly at the expense of asian competitors however the emergence of china as major economic superpower has raised concern among many us policymakers some express concern that china will overtake the united states as the worlds largest trade economy in few years and as the worlds largest economy within the next two decades in this context chinas rise is viewed as americas relative decline another concern are the large and growing us trade deficits with china which have risen from 104 billion in 1990 to an estimated 232 billion in 2006 and are viewed by many members as an indicator that china uses unfair trade practices such as an undervalued currency and subsidies to domestic producers to flood us markets with lowcost goods and to restrict us exports and that such practices threaten american jobs wages and living standards many warn that this situation will get worse as china increasingly moves toward production and export of more highvalue products such as cars and computers more recent concern has been efforts by chinese stateowned firms to acquire us companies and chinas accumulation of us treasury securities negative congressional perceptions of chinas economic practices have led to the introduction of numerous bills including some that would impose sanctions against china unless it reforms its currency policy and others that would apply us countervailing laws on chinese products this report examines the implications both challenges and opportunities for the us economy from chinas rapid economic growth and its emergence as major economic power it also describes congressional approaches for dealing with various chinese economic policies deemed damaging

rise of china from poor stagnant country to major economic power within time span of only 28 years is often described by analysts as one of the greatest economic success stories in modern times prior to 1979 china maintained sovietstyle command economy under which the state controlled most aspects of the economy these policies kept the economy relatively stagnant and living standards quite low however beginning in 1979 the government began series of free market reforms and began opening up to the world in terms of trade and investment these reforms have produced dramatic results from 1979 to 2005 chinas real gross domestic product gdp grew at an average annual rate of 97 the size of its economy increased over 11fold its real per capita gdp grew over 8 fold and its world ranking for total trade rose from 27th to 3rd chinas economic reforms and growth have benefitted or could benefit the us economy in number of ways over the past few years china has been the fastest growing us export market among its major trading partners for example us exports to china in 2006 increased by an estimated 33 chinas ranking as us export market rose from 11th in 2000 to 4th in 2006 and may overtake japan in 2007 to become 3rd chinas rapid economic growth coupled with its large population and development needs makes it potentially huge market for the united states china has become the secondlargest source for us imports in many instances china has replaced other east asian nations as source for many manufactured products imported by the united states lowcost imports from china have helped restrain inflation and increased the purchasing power of us consumers and boosted demand for other products this has helped us production to shift into areas where the united states has comparative advantage china has become the secondlargest purchaser of us treasury securities these purchases have helped to fund the us federal budget deficit and keep interest rates relatively low at the same time however chinas emergence as an economic power has raised number of concerns among some members of congress who perceive china as threat or potential threat to the us economy as one member stated chinas competitive challenge makes americans nervous from wall street to main street crs2 americans are nervous about chinas effect on the american economy american jobs on the american way of life1 areas of concern include the following issues analysts project that in the near future china will replace the united states as the worlds largest economy and exporter in this context chinas economic rise is viewed as americas decline the surge in us imports from china is viewed by many as threat to various us economic sectors particularly in manufacturing chinas nearly unlimited pool of lowcost labor is viewed by some as serious competitive threat to us manufacturing and is blamed for bankruptcies andor plant relocation to china job losses and stagnant us wages this process could get worse as china begins to manufacture more advanced products that compete directly with those made by us domestic firms many are concerned that china employs number of unfair economic policies intended to benefit its economy at the expense of its trading partners such as the united states many policymakers view the large and growing trade imbalance with china as proof that china does not trade fairly they contend for example that chinas policy of pegging its currency to the us dollar is deliberate policy meant to make chinese exports relatively cheap in world markets while discouraging imports they also contend that china uses industrial policies such as subsidies and other unfair trade practices such as dumping to promote the development of various industries such as autos and steel deemed important to national development which undermines the ability of us firms in these sectors to compete in global markets including the domestic us market in many respects the rise of china as global economic power is subject to the same interpretation as the economic rise of japan during the 1970s and 1980s and the impact that rise was thought to have on the us economy2 analysts describe number of negative consequences of chinas rapid economic growth such as increasing demand for oil and raw materials which drives up their prices and growing pollution which could have global implications in addition the lack of an effective intellectual property rights ipr enforcement regime and limited market access for iprrelated products has led to widespread ipr piracy in china not only does such piracy greatly 1 statement of senator max baucus during the senate committee on finance hearing on uschina relations june 23 2005 2 during the 1980s members complained of growing usjapan trade imbalance japans growing trade surplus and accumulation of foreign exchange reserves japanese trade and investment barriers government industrial policies intended to promote the development of targeted industries and japanese purchases of us assets in the united states government securities land and companies crs3 diminish china as market for iprrelated industries such as music and software such industries are further harmed by chinas export of pirated products some analysts have raised concern over the possible consequences if china decided to reduce its large holdings of us treasury securities others worry about the potential effect of chinese state owned companies attempts to purchase us firms this report examines the implications for the us economy of chinas rapid economic growth and its emergence as major economic power3 it addresses various contentions that have been put forth that certain aspects of chinas economic growth policies and practices pose threat to the us economy it also addresses several questions including the following why is chinas economy growing so fast will china overtake the united states as the worlds largest exporter or largest economy if so what are the implications for the us economy what are the causes of the large and increasing trade deficits with china have these resulted from chinas economic and assessment practices or other global forces do they negatively affect the us economy how do allegedly unfair chinese trade practices such as trade barriers industrial policies and failure to adequately protect us intellectual property rights affect the us economy how does the high level of lowcost imports from china affect us employment wages and terms of trade is chinese ownership of us firms and us public debt securities good or bad for the us economy what legislation has been proposed in congress to respond to unfair chinese trade practices what other options might be available to us policymakers the report concludes that although china will likely become the worlds largest economy within the next decade or two provided it can continue to deepen economic 3 the rise of china as an economic power has number of important political military and strategic implications for the united states that are not addressed in this report for an examination of these issues see crs report rl32882 the rise of china and its effect on taiwan japan and south korea us policy choices by dick k nanto and emma chanlettavery crs report rl32688 chinasoutheast asia relations trends issues and implications for the united states by bruce vaughn and wayne m morrison crs report rl33055 china and subsaharan africa by kerry dumbaugh and mark p sullivan and crs report rs22119 chinas growing interest in latin america by raymond w copson kerry dumbaugh and michelle lau crs4 reforms its living standards as measured by per capita gdp will remain substantially below those in the united states for several decades to come the assessment presented in this report suggests that chinas economic ascendancy will not in and of itself undermine or lower us living standards these will be largely determined by us economic policies in addition although various chinese economic policies may have negative effects on certain us economic sectors and there are valid economic reasons why many of these should be addressed other us sectors as well as consumers have benefitted and thus far the overall impact of chinas economic growth and opening up to the world appears to have been positive for both the us and chinese economies from an economic perspective describing chinas economic rise or its economic policies as an economic threat to the united states fails to reflect the complex nature of the economic relationship and growing economic integration that is taking place hence it may be more accurate to say that chinas economic growth poses both challenges and opportunities for the united states chinas economic growth causes and prospects historical perspective on chinas economic miracle prior to 1979 china maintained centrally planned or command economy large share of the countrys economic output was directed and controlled by the state which set production goals controlled prices and allocated resources throughout most of the economy during the 1950s chinas individual household farms were collectivized into large communes to support rapid industrialization the central government undertook largescale investments in physical and human capital during the 1960s and 1970s as result by 1978 nearly threefourths of industrial production was produced by centrally controlled stateowned enterprises subject to centrally planned output targets private enterprises and foreign investment were nearly nonexistent central goal of the chinese government was to make chinas economy relatively selfsufficient foreign trade was generally limited to obtaining only those goods that could not be made in china although some growth occurred these policies kept the chinese economy relatively stagnant and inefficient mainly because there were few profit incentives for firms and farmers competition was virtually nonexistent and price and production controls caused widespread distortions in the economy chinese living standards were substantially lower than those of many other developing countries the introduction of economic reforms beginning in 1979 the chinese government reversed course and launched several economic reforms in the hope that they would significantly increase economic growth and raise living standards the central government initiated price and ownership incentives for farmers which enabled them to sell portion of their crops on the free market in addition the government established four special economic zones along the coast for the purpose of attracting foreign investment boosting exports and importing hightechnology products into china additional reforms crs5 which followed in stages sought to decentralize economic policymaking in several sectors especially trade economic control of various enterprises was given to provincial and local governments which were generally allowed to operate and compete on free market principles rather than under the direction and guidance of state planning additional coastal regions and cities were designated as open cities and development zones which allowed them to experiment with free market reforms and to offer tax and trade incentives to attract foreign investment in addition state price controls on wide range of products were gradually eliminated results of economic reforms since the introduction of economic reforms chinas economy has grown substantially faster than during the prereform period see table 1 and has been one of the worlds fastest growing economies from 1960 to 1978 annual real gdp growth averaged 534 however in the postreform period from 1979 to 2006 growth averaged 97 it grew by 105 in 2006

major trading power chinese exports rose from 18 billion in 1980 to 969 billion in 2006 while imports over this 4 many analysts contend that chinese government economic data prior to reforms may have been exaggerated for propaganda purposes especially during periods of economic upheaval that took place during the great leap forward 19581972 and the cultural revolution 19661976 similar doubts remain about the quality of current data crs6 period grew from 20 billion to 791 billion see table 2 trade has constituted an important source of chinas economic growth and efficiency gains in 2004 china surpassed japan as the worlds thirdlargest trading economy after the european union and the united states chinas trade continues to grow dramatically in just three years 2003 to 2006 the size of chinas trade doubled in 2006 chinas exports and imports rose by 26 and 20 respectively over 2005 levels chinas trade surplus has risen sharply in recent years going from 24 billion in 2004 to 102

above some highlights of chinas rapid economic rise and current level of economic development are reflected in the following data chinas gdp as percentage of world gdp rose from 45 in 1984 to 163 in 20065 foreign direct investment in china rose from 109 million in 1979 to over 72 billion 2005 making it the largest destination for fdi among developing countries and the thirdlargest overall fdi

internet user after the united states with 136 million users in 2006 up from 225 million in 20009 according to the world bank from 1981 to 2001 economic reforms helped raise more than 400 million people out of extreme poverty10 chinas foreign exchange reserves rose from 25 billion at the end of 1980 to 819 billion at the end of 2005 in february 2006 china overtook japan to become the worlds largest holder of foreign exchange reserves at 854 billion and by the end of 2006 the chinese government estimated that reserves had topped 1 trillion why is china growing so fast table 1 indicates that chinas real gdp in the reform period has grown nearly twice as fast as before the reform period what factors have caused this to occur economic theory holds that economic output can be boosted by increasing inputs of physical and human capital eg investment in plant and equipment education infrastructure andor labor ie growth in the labor force at some point however barring technical advances increases in capital and labor eventually produce diminishing returns to output and hence the accelerated economic growth is unlikely to be sustained however output can also be boosted by productivity gains ie improvements in the efficiency with which inputs are used productivity gains can be obtained for example by adopting technological advances or improving managerial practices as result greater output can be achieved using the same level of capital and labor inputs high savings and investment several economists have attributed chinas rapid economic growth since 1979 to large accumulation of capital and to vast improvements in productivity that have resulted from economic reforms these two factors generally went hand in hand improved productivity increased growth and 7 merrill lynch capgemini 2005 world wealth report 2004 p 29 8 peoples daily jan 22 2003 9 this accounted for only 100 of the chinese population compared with 70 in the united states see internet world stats

success crs8 generated funds used for new investment china also benefitted from having very large pool of domestic savings to draw from to finance investment when reforms were begun when reforms were initiated in 1979 domestic savings as percentage of gdp stood at 32 however most chinese savings during this period were generated by the profits of stateowned enterprises soes which were used by the central government for domestic investment economic reforms which included the decentralization of economic production led to substantial growth in chinese household savings these now account for half of chinese domestic savings as result savings as percentage of gdp has steadily risen it reached 511 in 2006 among the highest savings rates in the world11 foreign direct investment chinas trade and investment reforms and incentives led to surge in foreign direct investment fdi which has been major source of chinas capital growth annual fdi in china showed the fastest growth in the 1990s when it grew from 35 billion in 1990 to 375 billion in 1995 more than 10fold increase from 1995 to 2005 the level of annual fdi more than doubled to 724 billion12 although small relative to domestic saving it is argued that this capital is used much more efficiently much domestic saving flows to state owned enterprises and thus makes an outsized contribution to economic growth the cumulative level of fdi in china at the end of 2005 stood at about 633 billion see table 3 table 3 foreign direct investment in china selected years year fdi millions 1979 109 1985 1658 1990 3487 1995 37521 2000 40714 2005

comparison the us savings rate was 102 savings defined as aggregate national savings by the public and private sector as percentage of nominal gdp economist intelligence unit database 12 chinese

were not made for previous years crs9 much of the fdi going into china has gone into exportoriented manufactured goods such as consumer electronics the level of both chinese imports and exports attributed to foreign invested enterprises fies in china has risen dramatically as shown in table 4 in 1986 only 19 of chinas exports were from fies but by 2005 this share had risen to 583 similar pattern can be seen with imports fies accounted for only 56 of chinas imports in 1986 but rose to 587 in 2005 table 4 exports and imports by foreigninvested enterprises in china 19862005 exports by

587 source chinese ministry of commerce productivity increases several studies have shown that productivity gains have been major cause of chinas rapid economic growth since reforms were implemented for example an international monetary fund imf study concluded that productivity growth was significant cause of chinas economic growth during its reform period the study estimated that from 1952 to 1978 capital accumulation accounted for 65 of chinas output growth with productivity and labor input growth accounting for 18 and 17 respectively in contrast between 1979 and 1994 during chinas economic reform period productivity growth accounted for nearly 42 of its economic output growth while increases in capital and labor inputs accounted for 5813 the imf study concluded that although growth rates in both capital and labor inputs rose significantly in 19791994 the productivity growth differential appears to explain the bulk of the difference in output growth between prereform and reform periods14 13 hu zuliu f and khan mohsin s why is china growing so fast international monetary fund staff paper vol 44 1 march 1997 p 116 14 ibid p 117 crs10 world bank study reached similar conclusions estimating that total factor productivity grew by more than 3 annually from 1985 to1994 rate the world bank describes as exceptional by international standards and that onethird of the increase in chinas output was the result of increased productivity15 goldman sachs estimates that chinas total factor productivity grew at an estimated 34 per annum between 1979 and 2004 accounting for 36 of chinas growth16 according to goldman sachs the productivity gains were the result of chinas extremely low starting point of economic development when reforms began and profound evolution of government policies that have gradually but consistently reduced inefficiencies in the system17 economists note that chinas economic reforms have led to reallocation of resources to more productive uses especially in sectors that were formerly controlled by the central government such as agriculture trade and services agricultural reforms boosted production and freed workers to pursue employment in activities where their marginal product was higher from 1978 to 1994 the proportion of the workforce engaged in agricultural production dropped from 71 to 54 large share of these workers found employment in locally controlled enterprises or foreign joint ventures in addition greater share of investment was being made by the non state sector such as privately owned firms whose output tended to grow more rapidly than soes the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd found that market reforms which led to significant decline in the role of the state sector in the economy and sharp increase in the role of the nonstate sector were major contributor to chinas rapid productivity gains and economic growth the oecd estimated that the private sector was responsible for as much as 57 of the valueadded produced by the nonfarm business sector up from 43 in 1998 and threefourths of chinas exports in 2003 it also found that the growth of the private sector including the role of foreign invested firms in china was major cause of chinas productivity gains and that private firms enjoy significantly higher rate of return on their assets than soes 150 versus 10218 chinas opening up to trade and investment has contributed to chinas productivity gains an important result of foreign investment in china and increased trade has been significant spillovers in technology and managerial knowhow to chinese firms 15 world bank world development report 1996 p 25 16 other contributors to growth included capital stock 36 educational attainment 15 and labor 13 17 goldman sachs chinas ascent can the middle kingdom meet its dreams global economics paper 133 november 11 2005 p 8 18 organization for economic cooperation and development economic survey of china september 2005 crs11 can china continue to grow at rapid rates over the long term growth theory holds that countries can increase their level of economic growth by boosting their savingsinvestment levels and by increasing productivity over time adding more capital per worker has diminishing rate of return therefore economic growth is equal to the growth in the work force the so called steady state rate of growth the only way to increase the steady state rate of growth is to increase productivity thus countries such as china with very high savings and investment rates and improvements to productivity through acquisition of foreign knowhow and reforms to their economy can obtain very high rates of growth in the short run over time the level of growth will likely slow as capital produces diminishing rates of return and productivity gains slow because the benefits of copying and catching up diminish at that point it is expected that chinas growth rate would slow to rate comparable to the united states or japan but with per capita income equal to only oneseventh that of the united states at purchasing power parity china still has plenty of room for rapid catchup growth in the near term at the same time however china maintains number of inefficient and potentially harmful policies that could significantly limit future economic development if not addressed some of these include support for inefficient firms soes which account for about one third of chinese industrial production put heavy strain on chinas economy it is estimated that between third and one half of all soes are unprofitable and must be supported by subsidies mainly through loans by governmentcontrolled banks many soes do not repay these loans and as result the banks have accumulated substantial level of nonperforming loans government support of unprofitable soes diverts resources away from potentially more efficient and profitable enterprises especially in the private sector and puts the banking system at risk to future financial crises public unrest the chinese government reported that there were more than 87000 protestspublic disturbances in 2005 up from 53000 protests reported in 2003 involving millions of people sources of these protests have reportedly included issues such as pollution government corruption resentment over growing income disparities layoffs from soes and government land seizures19 growing unrest could threaten political stability and hence undermine future growth growing pollution pollution poses serious health risks to the population and this could undermine worker productivity according to the world bank 20 out of the worlds most polluted 19 see crs report rl33416 social unrest in china by thoms lum crs12 cities are in china20 according to zhu guangyao deputy chief of the state environmental protection agency environmental damage costs the country 226 billion or 10 percent of the countrys gdp each year21 the chinese government estimates that there are more than 300 million people living in rural areas that drink unsafe water affected by chemicals and other contaminants22 toxic spills in china over the past few years threatened the water supply of millions of people the lack of the rule of law in china has led to widespread government corruption financial speculation and misallocation of investment funds in many cases government connections not market forces are the main determinant of commercial success in china the lack of the rule of law in china limits competition and undermines the efficient allocation of resources in the economy these problems may undermine chinas attempts to promote the development of its own globally competitive firms projections of chinas future economic growth the economic projections of

1973 the size of its economy relative to that of the united states and the world as whole changed little however this trend reversed significantly after china began to reform its economy by 1998

states and china the actual size of chinas economy has been subject of extensive debate among economists measured in us dollars using nominal exchange rates chinas gdp in 2006 was estimated about 27 trillion its per capita gdp commonly used measure of living standards was 2040 us gdp and per 23 oecd angus maddison the world economy millennial perspective 2001 crs14 capita gdp were estimated at 132 trillion and 44140 respectively japans nominal gdp and per capita gdp were 44 trillion and 34290 respectively these data could suggest that chinas economy was substantially smaller than those of the united states and japan many economists however contend that using nominal exchange rates to convert chinese data into us dollars substantially underestimates the size of chinas economy this is because prices in china for many goods and services are significantly lower than those in the united states and other developed countries economists have attempted to factor in these price differentials by using purchasing power parity ppp measurement which attempts to convert foreign currencies into us dollars on the basis of the actual purchasing power of such currency based on surveys of the prices of various goods and services in each respective country this ppp exchange rate is then used to convert foreign economic data in national currencies into us dollars comparison of economic data using nominal exchange rates and ppp for china japan and the united states for 2006 appears in table 7 because prices for many goods and services are significantly lower in china than in the united states and other developed countries while prices in japan are higher the ppp exchange rate raises the estimated size of chinese economy from 27 trillion nominal dollars to 99 trillion ppp dollars significantly larger than japans gdp in ppps 41 trillion and nearly threefourths the size of the us economy ppp data also raise chinas per capita gdp from 2040 nominal to 7500 the ppp figures indicate that while the size of chinas economy is substantial its living standards fall far below those of the us and japan chinas per capita gdp on ppp basis is only 17 of us levels thus even if chinas gdp were to overtake that of the united states in the next few decades its living standards would remain substantially below those of the united states for many years to come table 7 estimates

from those made by the economist intelligence unit in table 7 although chinas rise to the worlds largest economy may shock and alarm some in the united states who might view it as reflective of poor us economic performance it is hardly surprising to most economists given that chinas population is 44 times larger and that chinas economy continues to grow rapidly from improvements to productivity

eius forecasts of the us and chinese economies predict that china will not overtake the united states as the worlds largest economy until 2018 crs16 consume it would also consume more goods that american workers might produce as discussed below the longrun net effect of chinas growth on american well being will depend on how it affects the terms of trade by which american goods are exchanged for chinese goods chinas future growth will also increase the demands on the worlds natural resources and commodities see below which may affect americas terms of trade as well likewise there is particular advantage to being the worlds largest economy from the perspective of living standards for example the three countries in the world with higher per capita income than the united states luxembourg norway and switzerland are hardly known for their size trade takes place not between countries but between millions of individual economic agents within countries so country size does not confer any market power that allows country to negotiate favorable market price size may afford greater bargaining power in trade negotiations and international organizations however china as the

other asian countries to china that is various exports that used to be made in japan taiwan hong kong for example are now being made in china in many cases by foreign firms in china and exported to the united states this trend is reflected in table 12 which lists data on us imports from asia as whole and from china for 19962005 the share of us imports from asia to total imports decreased from

hightechnology firms for example the uschina economic and security review commission warned in its 2005 annual report to congress that the technology that china is developing and producing is increasing in sophistication at an unexpectedly fast pace advances in chinas technological infrastructure and industries along with similar advances in other developing countries pose significant competitive challenge that is eroding us technology leadership34 on the other hand joint study by the center for strategic and international studies and the institute for international economics concluded that data on chinas high technology trade is misleading noting for example that more than 90 of chinas exports of electronic and information technology are produced by foreign firms in china using imported components35 and that china adds relatively little value to products such as computers and mobile phones before export for example assembly may take place in china but research and development takes place elsewhere the study concluded that census data on us atp trade with china hardly reflect dramatic deterioration in us competitiveness rather they reflect 34 uschina economic

us imports of chinese goods relative to us exports to china that deficit rose from 30 billion in 1994 to an estimated 232 billion in 2006 see table 10 the us trade deficit with china is now larger than that of any other us trading partner some analysts contend that the large us trade imbalance with china is an indicator that china maintains number of unfair trade practices that seek to restrict imports of us goods and services while boosting chinese exports to the united states according to chinas critics these include currency manipulation trade and investment barriers industrial policies failure to protect intellectual property dumping and low labor and environmental standards the next section discusses the costs and benefits of trade with china in general and evaluates some of the specific complaints made by critics the report then considers the effects of chinas trade deficit and currency regime crs25 trade and jobs imports from china and other countries can destroy jobs in the parts of the us economy that produce the same products but economic analysis indicates that due to offsetting job creation in other parts of the economy the inflow of imports is unlikely to cause net loss of jobs economywide there are two complementary reasons for the relative steadiness of total employment and output in the face of rising level of imports or other disruptive market forces first the federal reserve using monetary policy works to set the overall level of spending in the economy to level generally consistent with full employment44 although deviations from full employment can occur wellrun monetary policy can minimize the incidence and duration of such episodes and help keep the total level of employment high in most years despite outsourcing trade deficits or trade in general to give some perspective on the typical magnitude of job loss and its relationship to total employment consider that in any quarter of 2000 at the peak of the last economic expansion with total us employment at about 137 million gross job losses tallied between 85 million and 90 million and some fraction of those job losses were likely the consequence of foreign trade nevertheless the economy at this time was operating at the lowest rate of unemployment in 40 years in fact over the whole course of that expansion the gross number of jobs lost actually rose as the unemployment rate steadily fell this was possible because with strong economy wide spending it was possible to create job gains including jobs created by foreign trade that more than offset losses similarly in the far weaker labor market of 2004 gross job losses per quarter measured about 74 million but gross job gains in the same time period were about 78 million per quarter leading to rise in total employment over the year in either time period gross job losses occurred on scale well beyond what is currently attributed to foreign trade suggesting that on an economywide basis job loss due to foreign trade may be relatively minor occurrence even though particular industries may be hit hard45 second against the economic backdrop of adequate aggregate spending any increase in the purchase of imports will tend to generate an equal increase in the sale of the countrys exports of goods or assets this outcome follows from the fundamental economic requirement that imports must be paid for and exports are the 44 economies always have some amount of unemployment each economy will tend to have natural rate of unemployment around which the actual unemployment rate fluctuates this natural rate will also represent the rate at which the economy is effectively at full employment because lower rate of unemployment would not be sustainable due to the inducement of higher rate of inflation the natural rate is not zero because at any point in time there will be some people who are changing jobs and other people whom normal market forces have temporarily displaced the more fluid the economys labor markets the lower its natural rate of unemployment is likely to be for most of the last 30 years the us economys natural rate was judged to be in the 55 to 60 range since the mid1990s the natural rate has likely fallen to the 45 to 50 range most often an appropriate level of aggregate spending is that consistent with employment at the natural rate 45 us department of labor bureau of labor statistics business employment dynamics various issues crs26 only means for making that payment the export sold can be domestically produced good or service or it can also be the sale to foreigner of an asset such as deposit in bank account shares of stock bonds or real property therefore when tallied across transactions in goods and assets nations trade is always in balance in the sense that any imbalance in goods trade must be offset by compensating imbalance in asset trade moreover both types of exports have positive effect on domestic employment46 consider for example situation where good once produced domestically is now imported from china because foreign suppliers do not spend dollars the us importer will have to buy the foreign currency needed from the foreign exchange market or pay in dollars and let the foreign supplier buy local currency from its foreign exchange market either way to generate the foreign exchange the united states must export something it can sell us goods or services or it can sell us assets eg bank deposits stocks bonds real property the positive stimulus to employment from increased export of goods is direct when foreigners increase their purchases of us goods domestic output and employment rise this will counter the loss of jobs caused by the increase of imports if us exports of goods increase less than the increase of imports the united states then must in effect borrow to fully pay for the increased imports through the sale of an asset the positive stimulus to domestic employment from an increased export of assets is indirect however because the sale of an asset is equivalent to an increase in the flow of saving available to the united states it exerts downward push on domestic interest rates stimulating interestsensitive activities such as spending on consumer durables and residential construction and raising output and employment in these sectors47 therefore the negative effects that increased imports have on output48 and employment in one part of the economy are offset by the positive economic effects of increased exports of goods or assets in other parts of the 46 the official data on us international transactions are presented in two sections the current account that tallies flows of goods and services and the financial account that tallies flows of assets the two accounts must be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign 47 of course asset sales represent borrowing to sustain current domestic spending by transferring to foreigners claim on some amount of the future output of the united states the repayment of the loan will manifest as future trade surplus and net outflow of us exports of goods and services and thereby lead to reduction of future domestic spending below what it otherwise would be 48 the focus of this discussion is the circumstance when an import is direct substitute for domestic output imports however are not always substitutes for domestic output an import can be seen by consumers as distinct product and primarily generate an increase in total demand rather than substitute for some domestic product an imported good can be an essential component necessary for the expansion of domestic output an import can satisfy domestic demand that can not be readily supplied by domestic producers due to capacity constraints imports from one country can be substitute for imports formerly obtained from another country crs27 economy49 the composition of output and employment will change in response to these changed demands but as long as the federal reserve can maintain aggregate spending at the an appropriate level total output and employment will not change this scenario is discussed in greater detail below bureau of labor statistics bls data on job loss can also provide some perspective on the possible employment effects of trade with china beginning in 2004 the bls has collected data on job loss due to transfer of work outside of the united states these data are measure of gross job loss and show that through 2005 such layoffs occurred on small scale between 3000 and 5000 workers per quarter or 12000 to 20000 per year that represents about 20 of the total layoffs in each quarter and an extremely small share of the us total labor force of more than 149 million workers50 although these data do not tell to which country work was transferred one would have to conclude that even if all of the reported layoffs were the result of production being shifted to china the impact is small moreover the overall effect of trade on jobs is net effect reflecting the jobs that are created by international trade in general or with china in particular unfortunately there are public data series that allow ready tallying of the net impact of trade on employment however given the very small size of gross job loss observed in the bls data it is reasonable to believe that the impact is either very small net job loss or net job gain sectoral employment effects the impact of increased trade with low wage economies such as chinas might not have net negative effect on overall employment but it likely does have some negative effect on employment in particular tradesensitive sectors of the economy the employment problems of the us manufacturing sector are often cited as consequence of in part the rising tide of imports from china manufactured goods are far more important in us international trade than in the overall economy making up about 80 of international trade in goods but only 18 of us gdp therefore the expectation is that factors that affect international trade will be more strongly felt in the manufacturing sector than in the wider economy in the context of balanced goods trade an increase in imports will be paid for with an equal valued increase of exports although the increase of imports can destroy jobs in manufacturing the increase of exports tends to create jobs in that 49 export related jobs generally pay on average 7 to 13 higher wages than jobs in import competing industries so most often better jobs are being created than those that are being destroyed however the new jobs are not necessarily going to be filled by those whose jobs were destroyed see andrew b bernard and j bradford jensen exporters jobs and wages in us manufacturing brookings papers on economic activity microeconomics 47 1995 pp 67112 50 for these data see united states department of labor bureau of labor statistics extended mass layoffs various issues for further discussion of layoffs see crs report rl30799 unemployment through layoffs what are the underlying reasons by linda levine crs28 sector in the context of unbalanced trade an economy such as the united states that is inclined by macroeconomic forces largely separate from trade activity to run trade deficits can result in net negative effect on employment in manufacturing51 however depending on the rate of capacity utilization in the sector the structure of final demand and the degree of indirect demand for domestic manufactured goods stimulated by the capital inflow that finances the trade deficit the negative employment effect on manufacturing can be significantly smaller than the size of the deficit suggests an accurate assessment of trades possible negative impact on employment in the us manufacturing sector however requires consideration of factors other than trade that also affect employment these include the existing stage of the business cycle changes in the underlying demand for manufactured goods in general and the impact of increased productivity in manufacturing analyzing the large decline in manufacturing employment since 2000 2004 crs report found that as much as 60 of the job losses between 2000 and 2002 were the result of strong increases in productivity in the manufacturing sector about 20 of the lost jobs were found to be the result of recession and slow recovery and about 20 were considered to be the result of large and rising trade deficit52 again none of these negative impacts are necessary consequence of rising level of trade with china and other lowwage economies because of their sizeable presence in domestic production and even greater presence in international trade some sense of the magnitude of the impact of increased trade with china on us jobs can be gleaned from any changes in the distribution of employment between home and foreign locations by us multinational companies mnc53 thus if rising level of international trade were diverting large number of domestic jobs overseas it would be evident in the changing distribution of employment between mnc domestic parents and foreign affiliates also changes in the distribution of employment across countries would give some indication of whether there has been shift of jobs towards lowwage economies particularly if there has been substantial shifting by multinationals of employment from the united states to china the usparent share of total mnc employment decreased from 78 in 1977 to 72 in 2003 the most recent year for which data are available this decrease is part of decline that began in 1987 well before trade with china was significant economic force employment by foreign affiliates continues to be concentrated in highwage countries however with share of about 65 but employment in foreignaffiliates in highwage countries has grown more slowly than that in low wage countries pushing the share of highwage countries down from high of about 70 in 1991 in the 20002003 period when large increase of imports from china 51 see the discussion of trade deficits below 52 see crs report rl32350 deindustrialization of the us economy by craig elwell 53 in 2001 the mncs domestic parents produced about 25 of us gross domestic product gdp and employed more than 23 million workers or about 20 of the nonbank work force mncs are even more important in us international trade being involved in nearly 60 of total goods exports and about 40 of total goods imports crs29 is suspected of causing large loss of domestic jobs the domestic parents of us multinational companies decreased employment by 165000 jobs at the same time employment in chinese affiliates of us mncs increased by 95000 jobs but employment in relatively highwage european affiliates increased by 98000 jobs as well what is also interesting is that there are also some significant decreases in employment by affiliates in other lowwage economies for example mexico had decrease of 21000 jobs and the whole south and central american region had decrease of 52000 similarly affiliates in some countries in asia have had decreases in employment this has occurred to varying degrees in taiwan thailand malaysia and the philippines for combined loss of about 60000 jobs54 this pattern of change in employment by us multinationals could indicate that domestic jobs were shifted to china but it is also consistent with pattern of jobs in china being shifted from other lowwage countries the changing national composition of us imports gives support to the latter scenario as discussed above the increase in share of total us imports coming from china has been largely matched by decrease in the share of goods imported from other pacific rim countries one reason offered for this changed pattern of trade is that china has increasingly taken over the role as the final assembly and shipping point for many exports that would previously have been exported from other lowwage economies on the pacific rim and elsewhere so us trade with lowwage economies is not necessarily rising to the degree widely believed rather it is shifting location see table 13 furthermore this implies that the negative employment effects of this change fell more heavily on workers in pacific rim countries and lowwage countries in other regions economies rather than on workers in the united states55 the natural twoway nature of trade suggests that for complete view of trades employment effects we also consider the behavior of foreign mncs in the united states us company can destroy jobs by diverting production abroad but foreign company can create jobs by diverting production to the united states economic reasoning tells us that if it is more efficient to produce some products abroad it is also likely that it is more efficient to produce other products in the united states therefore we might expect there to be outsourcing into and out of the us economy during the 19772001 period employment in the united states by foreign mncs grew by 47 million exceeding the 28 million increase in employment in the foreign affiliates of us mncs56 these data could indicate that 54 raymond j mataloni jr note on patterns of production and employment by us multinational companies survey of current business vol 84 3 march 2004 pp 5256 55 this also suggests that any restriction placed on chinas imports to the united states would not increase domestic output but would increase the output of the pacific rim economies whose exports to the united states would increase as they become replacement for restricted chinese goods for discussion of this and other aspects of trade with china see the economic report of the president washington gpo 2004 pp 6568 and crs report rl32165 chinas currency economic issues and options for us trade policy by wayne m morrison and marc labonte 56 see mataloni op cit for closer look at the nature and extent of outsourcing see crs continued crs30 considering inflows and outflows the united states was overall more likely to be the destination than the departure point for foreign outsourcing trade and wages another common concern with rising level of trade with china and other low wage economies is that it puts downward pressure on the wages of domestic workers foreign trade is commonly seen as process driven by the search by american companies for lowwage environments which ultimately places american workers in effective competition with vast pool of lowerwage foreign labor and exerts downward pressure on the wages of domestic workers this competition it is argued will result in the socalled race to the bottom between domestic and foreign workers the reality of the supposed deleterious effect of increased trade with lowwage economies on wages of american workers was given apparent credence for many people by the observed concurrence over 20 year period beginning in the mid 1970s of slower growth of the average real wage and widening gap between the wages of skilled and lessskilled workers with the steady increase in the us economys level of trade the growth of real wages accelerated in the booming 1990s deflecting some of the concerns about the effect of rising globalization on worker compensation although inequality continued to widen but since the 2001 recession real wages have been flat while the level of trade with china and other lowwage economies has increased generating renewed concern about the adverse effects of that trade on worker wages in thinking about relative wages levels international cost competition and trade between the united states and china economic theory leads to two general conclusions relevant to the impact of trade on the wages of american workers first differences in the level of wages between countries are most often reflection of differences in worker productivity wages in the us economy are high because worker productivity is high wages in the chinese and other emerging economies are low because worker productivity is commensurately low therefore comparison more telling of the true differences in production cost between highwage and low wage economies is differences in unit labor costs the wage per hour divided by output per hour because of the substantial concordance of wages and productivity differences in unit labor costs across countries tend to be much smaller than differences in money wage rates for example one would expect that if lowwage economys average wage is only 10 of the average american wage but its workers productivity is also only 10 of the american workers productivity there would be difference in unit labor costs and labor cost advantage because there is seldom perfect concordance between countrys wage level and productivity estimates of actual unit labor costs will not always just compensate for the money wage difference in most cases however unit labor costs in lowwage countries are substantial percentage of us unit labor costs and in some cases actually exceed 56 continued report rl32292 offshoring aka offshore outsourcing and job insecurity among us workers by linda levine crs31 the us level for example one study found that korea mexico brazil and thailand had average unit labor costs 70 to 80 of that of the united states whereas malaysia philippines and india had average unit labor costs above that of the united states57 other studies that have looked at the chinese economy have also found unit labor costs there to be 75 to 80 of the us level58 if we then consider that the other elements needed for production such as capital raw materials energy and infrastructure are relatively more costly in most emerging economies any absolute cost advantage over the united states may be nil if there is large absolute cost advantage to production in lowwage economies why does the united states buy imports from them answering this question leads to the second general conclusion of economic theory on trades effect on wages economic theory tells us that differences in the absolute cost of production do not determine whether it is more beneficial to trade for good or to produce it domestically the potential for mutually beneficial trade is determined by differences in relative cost or what economists term the presence of comparative advantage in the production of good the essential condition for comparative advantage to exist is that for each trading country there be difference in the rate at which the production of one tradable good must be decreased in order to increase production of another good in other words what matters is the existence of differences in opportunity cost not absolute cost regardless of differences between countries in absolute production costs if these relative opportunity costs are different then each country has comparative advantage in the production of one of the tradable goods and by specializing in the production of this good and trading for importing the other the country expands its consumption possibilities of both goods and thereby raises its overall economic wellbeing differences in comparative advantage will arise between countries because of differences in the relative abundance or scarcity of the factors of production comparative advantage will be found in those activities that make intensive use of the abundant productive resource for example the united states with relative abundance of highskilled labor compared with many other countries will find that specialization in the production of goods that use highskilled labor intensively will with trade raise national income by contrast china which has relative abundance of lowskilled labor and relative scarcity of highskilled labor would find that specialization in the production of goods that use lowskilled workers intensively would with trade raise that countrys real income such specialization and trade would be expected to raise overall economic well being but it also could have disparate effect on the wages of american workers of 57 stephen golub does trade with lowwage countries hurt american workers federal reserve bank of philadelphia1998 58 sebastian dullien chinas changing competitive position lessons from unit labor cost based feer economics working papers archive 2005 and chi hung kwan the myth of chinese competitiveness are lowwages chinas strength or weakness research institute of economy trade and industry 2002 crs32 different skill levels when trade with china expands there is an increase in the demand for highskilled american workers tending to raise their wage but there is decrease in the demand for lessskilled workers tending to decrease their wages meanwhile china experiences the opposite effect the average level of wages does not change as the result of trade being determined by the average level of labor productivity but the distribution of wages between skilled and lessskilled has become less equal and the absolute level of economic wellbeing of lessskilled workers would also fall the actual effect of trade on wages in the us economy has been the focus of numerous empirical studies over the last 15 years and the conclusions that may be drawn from these efforts are as follows as regards the slow growth of the average real wage from the mid 1970s to the late 1990s increased trade is not seen as being the cause of that sluggish performance rather the identified reason was slow productivity growth labors share of the economic pie was not getting smaller the economic pie just was not growing as fast59 that the level of wages is most often reflective of the level of worker productivity also explains why higherwage american workers are not necessarily at disadvantage to lowerwage foreign workers as regards trade and increased wage inequality the research indicates that trade was contributing factor but minor one accounting for perhaps 10 to 20 of the observed increase in wage inequality between skilled and lessskilled workers60 the principal contributing force causing the rise in wage inequality is thought to most likely be the character of recent technological change to generally raise the demand for higherskilled workers it would seem then that from the standpoint of the economy as whole trade with lowwage economies has so far not triggered race to the bottom why has the impact of trade on wages been so modest one reason is probably matter of scale trade with lowwage countries has been relatively small amounting to less than 5 of gdp in 2005 in fact among us trade partners the average wage level in manufacturing relative to the us manufacturing wage level 59 this conclusion is also confirmed by the absence of any sustained deterioration in labors share of national income which has remained at about 70 throughout the postworld war ii era 60 see cline william r trade and wage inequality institute for international economics washington dc 1997 and borjas george and richard b freeman lawrence f katz how much do immigration and trade affect labor market outcomes brookings papers on economic activity 1997 pp 190 susan collins trade and the american worker brookings institution washington dc 1997 and lawrence and litan op cit crs33 grew from 60 in 1975 to 76 of the us level in 200061 this has occurred because many trading partners that were once lowwage economies with open trade and steady economic growth have now become highwage economies chinas scale of trade with the united states has increased greatly but relative to the us economy it stills remains small in 2005 the us trade deficit with china was 202 billion size equivalent to less than 2 of us gdp and not large enough to have major effect on overall wages in the united states the scale of impact is also related to the overall size of the us sectors producing tradeable goods keep in mind that the us economy is still largely domestic in orientation with perhaps as much as twothirds of the labor force including large numbers of lowskilled workers working and having wages determined in activities largely unaffected by trade sector like manufacturing which produces large share of us tradable goods employs only about 14 million workers out of total labor force of nearly 140 million in contrast the service sector which produces largely nontradeable output employs nearly 110 million workers rising income in the world is also likely to raise the demand for the products whose production uses lowskilled labor intensively once lowwage economies transform to highwage economies two events occur 1 they tend to produce fewer of the goods typically produced by lowwage workers and 2 they tend to increase their absolute demand for the products produced by lowwage workers the two effects exert upward pressure on the wages of these workers including any producing similar products in the united states this outcome is consistent with the evidence that for the united states the relative price of unskilled laborintensive import competing goods rose in the 1980s and 1990s62 this shifting of the location of production for products made by lowskill workers is particularly relevant for understanding the probable impact on the us economy of sharply rising imports from china in recent years china has picked up the role of producer of these types of products as other east asian economies have withdrawn from that type of production as these economies did when japan shifted away from lowwage based production reviewing the period 1994 through 2003 the council of economic advisors concluded that for the united states the increase in share of total us imports accounted for by imports of goods from china has been largely offset by decrease in the share of goods imported from other pacific rim countries the value of imports from both sources has increased considerably still many of the export jobs in nonchina asia are migrating to china so the 61 us department of

workers in china and the pacific rim economies rather than on workers in the united states63 economies of scale are also factor that likely helps hold up industrial wages in the face of lowwage foreign competition the beneficial effects on cost from largerscale production are thought to be significant in many industries in highwage countries tending to increase worker productivity and decrease unit labor costs it is also possible that the increase of competition itself spurs companies to higher levels of efficiency which lowers unit labor costs and helps preserve higher wages of course it cannot be ruled out that if trade with relatively lowwage economies such as china continues to grow in importance the negative effects on us worker wages of such trade would grow in significance yet there is probably an upper bound to this effect for it is possible that in the future with only relatively moderate differences between home and foreign production costs complete specialization could occur that is the united states would longer produce much of what is imported from lowwage foreign economies there would be shortrun transition costs for those displaced from lowwage jobs at that time but since the united states would then longer have industries that use lowwage labor intensively there would be downward pressure on domestic wages caused by such trade from that point forward to the extent that this pattern of trade allows for fuller realization of economies of scale and lowers product prices the real wage of the average domestic worker could be increased unfair trade practices and the gains from trade some critics argue that fair trade with country that plays by the rules would be beneficial to the united states but that china employs many unfair trading practices that make trade with it not in americas selfinterest major issues of concern include wide assortment of tariff and nontariff barriers chinas currency policy addressed below industrial policies to promote domestic industries selling goods below cost dumping low wages and poor environmental practices and failure to protect us intellectual property rights ipr trade and investment barriers critics charge that although china has significantly liberalized its trade regime since joining the wto in 2001 such as lowering tariff and removing number of nontariff barriers implementation of its wto commitments has been uneven and incomplete and has prevented us firms from enjoying the level of market access they expected to obtain on february 14 2006 thenus trade representative ustr rob portman complained 63 this also suggests any restriction placed on chinas imports to the united states would not increase domestic output rather it would increase the output of

overall our uschina trade relationship today lacks equity durability and balance in the opportunities it provides64 industrial policies the ustr noted in its 2006 china wto compliance report that many of the shortcomings in chinas implementation of its wto obligations stemmed from its incomplete transition to free market economy65 many us policymakers have raised concerns over chinas policies to promote the development of mainly stateowned industries often referred to as pillar industries deemed by the government to be critical to future development and growth such as autos steel energy electronics and information technology for example in july 2005 the chinese government issued new guidelines on steel production which included provisions for the preferential use of domestically produced steelmanufacturing equipment and domestic technologies extensive government involvement in determining the number size location and production quantities of steel producers in china technology transfer requirements on foreign investment and restrictions on foreign majority ownership other us complaints include the issuance of regulations on auto parts tariffs that discourage the use of imported parts attempts to develop unique national standards in number of high technology areas that could lead to the extraction of technology or intellectual property from foreign rightsholders and draft government procurement regulations mandating purchases of chineseproduced software66 many us policymakers contend that chinas industrial policies violate its wto commitments67 china is hoping to move from an export platform of foreign multinational companies invested in china to major exporter of advanced chinese designed and made products for example two chinese auto companies have announced plans to begin exporting cars to the united states by 2007 dumping number of groups have charged that china often sells its products to the united states at less than fair market value and that chinas low wages and poor labor conditions give chinese products an unfair advantage in the united states and third markets they charge that these practices have damaged several us industries such as textiles and the loss of millions of us 64 remarks by ambassador rob portman press conference on uschina trade relations toptobottom review feb 14 2006 65 ustr 2006 report to

policies that discriminate against foreign products have been the target of two us cases against china in the wto involving semiconductors and auto parts crs36 manufacturing jobs see below as result china has been the biggest target of us antidumping measures low labor and environmental standards chinese firms have been widely criticized for environmental practices that would not be allowed in the united states us firms argue that this confers cost advantage against which they with their cost of environmental compliance cannot compete similarly us firms argue that they cannot compete with chinese firms because of the cost of complying with the workplace protections afforded to us but not chinese workers this dynamic is often referred to as race to the bottom as the united states will purportedly be forced to eventually lower its labor and environmental standards to developing country levels in order to compete with developing countries international property rights ipr us ipr industry officials estimate that ipr piracy in china cost us copyright firms 24 billion in lost sales in 2005 and that the piracy rate for iprrelated products in china is among the highest in the world68 us firms contend that ipr piracy in china has worsened in recent years in addition china accounts for significant share of imported counterfeit products seized by us customs and border protection 64 million or 69 of total goods seized in fy2005 although it is beyond the scope of this report to evaluate all of the specific claims that have been made about china it is perhaps useful as first step to consider some general observations regarding unfair trade this will help clarify the economic reality of this issue and suggest economically efficient policy responses virtually all economists argue that free trade leads to more efficient allocation of worldwide productive resources that result in higher real income and economic wellbeing for each trading partner critics maintain however that unless such trade is also fair in the sense that each trading partner has the same rules and regulations governing its trading practices then the gains from trade will not occur or be much smaller than they otherwise would be the metaphor most often invoked by the proponents of fair trade is the need for level playing field if us trading partners abide by the same rules and regulations governing business and trade practices the playing field will longer be tilted to the disadvantage of the united states undercutting its ability to compete in trade with these nations the problem with such sports metaphors is that they do not give an accurate characterization of the true nature of trade in sports games are zerosum activity where there is winner and loser trade however is positivesum activity where both parties benefit so long as the foreign producer 68 the international intellectual property alliance iipa estimated chinas piracy rates in 2005 in the following areas motion pictures 93 records and music 85 business software 88 and entertainment software 92 see httpwwwiipacom crs37 sells the good to you at relative cost below that of producing the good at home it can be said that there is an economic gain to the united states regardless of whether the foreign producers trade practices are unfair more fundamentally as indicated by the economic theory of comparative advantage the cost advantage results from there being significant economic difference between trading countries in other words it is the tilted playing field that creates the possibility for mutual gains from trade the difference could be in the relative abundance of productive resources like land capital and labor or the level of technology or in climate but it could also be the result of differences in governmentinitiated rules and regulations governing business and trade practices nor is it necessarily unreasonable for countries to have significantly different rules and regulations governing economic activity as they will often reflect legitimate differences in social preferences as well as the realistic choices of countries with vastly lower levels of national income that are trying to pull themselves up out of poverty although labor and environmental standards may be low now the higher income that trade brings might be an important force for the eventual elevation of wage and environmental standards in these countries individual industries in the united states may be harmed by the trade that emerges as result of these differences in rules and regulations but policy by the united states such as tariff on imported products that leads to level playing field would also erase the gains from trade the tariff may help those individual industries but its overall effect could be to turn positivesum activity into negativesum activity in which both countries are net losers that it is possible to have gains from trade in the presence of various unfair trade practices does not mean that better outcomes are not possible despite substantial reduction in the postworld war ii era significant tariff barriers continue to exist in rich and poor countries alike removing the tariff barriers that remain would raise the level of world trade and increase the mutual gains from trade the steady reductions of tariffs and other trade barriers by the worlds economies over the last 60 years was largely achieved by successive rounds of multilateral reductions since wwii there have been eight major multilateral trade agreements the most recent being the uruguay round which was completed in 1994 from public policy perspective the use of unfair trade practices can undermine public support especially by representatives of domestic firms and workers that are hurt by these practices for bilateral regional and multilateral trade agreements that might further liberalize trade rules and thus boost economic growth other alleged unfair trade practices are likely to be more difficult to resolve for to an important degree the unfairness is in the eye of the beholder for example the dumping of exports is seen by the united states as an unfair trade practice it is illegal under us law and the government has actively used the law to impose antidumping duties on the imports of offending countries yet determining whether dumping has occurred is often far from straightforward and the process is seen by many to be biased against the foreign producer more important economists place little economic merit in most claims of dumping seeing price cutting as useful element of competition that is widely practiced by domestic firms and it leads to greater efficiency and economic benefit to consumers because they crs38 are being sanctioned for actions that would not be illegal for us firm domestically it is natural for exporters to the us market to see the ready use or threat of use of the antidumping levy as the unfair trade practice being in their eyes thinly veiled protectionism this same inversion of perspective can also arise when rich countries in an attempt to level the playing field push for higher labor and environmental standards in poor countries as countries with low standards might see it standards in the united states and other rich countries have been set too high and are being used to create trade barrier it is seen as trade barrier because to conform to the higher standards foreign rivals would incur increased production costs and become unable to maintain competitive position in the us market this is an example of what is called export protectionism meaning rather than use tariff to deter imports the cost of the product is forced to rise accomplishing the same result as tariff in other instances the unfair trade practice may be more costly than beneficial to the country that pursues it this is probably true of subsidies to promote exporting industries if the subsidy lowers the price of goods the us imports there would be favorable terms of trade effect that causes shifting of the division of the overall gains from trade from the exporting country to the importing country if the subsidy lowers the price of good that competes with us exports there would be an unfavorable shift in the us terms of trade and reduction in the us gains from trade however based on the experience of japan in the 1970s and 1980s and of south korea thailand and indonesia in the 1980s and 1990s it is more likely that the subsidy policy will fail overall not being successful at establishing any form of competitive exporting industry while imposing significant costs on the overall economy by diverting scarce resources from more efficient uses there are also arguments that certain unfair trade practices could threaten to undermine socalled strategic industries these are generally considered to be hightechnology sectors that are deemed critical to future economic development because of the important spillover effects they have over other parts of the economy and therefore warrant strong government action including trade protection69 sometimes this is called the infant industry rationale for protectionism because it suggests that these strategic industries need government assistance to become commercially viable although they may eventually be able to compete on their own the problem with this argument is that it suggests that the government can pick winners more effectively than markets perhaps because it has longer time horizon on the contrary private investors are often willing to take losses on new companies particularly in hightech industries for several years if they believe they will ultimately be profitable moreover governments may have other motives besides profit maximization behind the winners that they back 69 such spillovers could include the development and diffusion of new technology throughout the economy an improvement in nations term of trade growth in other related industries an increase in productivity and the creation of highpaying jobs crs39 closely related argument is that certain us industries are critical to us national security and must be defended against unfair trade practices for example some analysts contend that national security needs require the united states to maintain an independent supply of steel china is the worlds largest steel producer accounting for 31 of the worlds steel production its production levels in 2005 rose by 25 over the previous year the us steel industry has expressed growing fears that overinvestment and overcapacity will lead china to flood world markets with cheap steel70 the problem with these arguments is how to identify such industries and to prevent trade policies from being used mainly to protect firms from foreign competition for political reasons finally ipr piracy is an issue that most economists would agree has economic costs that outweigh any benefits there are number of costs to consider first the distribution of pirated products can lower the sales of legitimate products thus undermining the attainment of greater economies of scale by us firms making them less competitive second many firms expend significant level of resources on research and development rd to create develop new products such as medicines with the expectation that these costs will later be recovered through sale of the product however widespread piracy of that product undermines the ability to recover rd costs and thus may discourage innovation likewise creators of intellectual property are responding to the financial incentives that copyrights and trademarks provide if piracy undermines those incentives the economic benefits to creation of intellectual property could decline third pirated products that use false labels to pass as legitimate brand name products are generally inferior in quality and thus can undermine companys reputation and reduce its legitimate sales another concern is over the health of consumers such as when pirated drugs and medicines that lack effectiveness are sold and safety such as when pirated brake pads are used to replace old pads on car finally the prevalence of pirated lowcost products in china makes it substantially more difficult for us firms to sell their products in the chinese market piracy also poses challenges to chinas economy the chinese government estimated that in 2001 1924 billion worth of counterfeit goods were sold in china study by the motion picture association of america estimated that chinas domestic film industry lost about 15 billion in revenue to piracy in 200571 chinese press reports indicate number of health and safety problems resulting from counterfeit products in china72 this indicates that ipr piracy has had significant negative impact on various chinese economic sectors as well without solid ipr enforcement regime innovation and growth of iprrelated industries in china will likely be greatly retarded 70 according to us officials chinas excess steel capacity in 2006 could be larger than total us steel production such concerns have led the united states to begin steel dialogue with china

china reportedly died and hundreds were sickened from drinking fake baby formula see new york times china prison for two in baby formula scandal aug 6 2004 p a4 crs40 effects of the bilateral trade deficit and the exchange rate policy on the us economy some argue that trade with china is not necessarily harmful to the us economy per but becomes harmful because imports to the united states are matched by trade deficit rather than by exports to china as noted earlier both imports from china and the trade deficit have grown rapidly us exports to china have also grown rapidly but remain small compared with imports many us policymakers have expressed concern that the trade deficit is reducing economic output and employment in the united states particularly in the manufacturing sector they believe that chinas exchange rate policy is at the root of the trade imbalance from 1994 to july 21 2005 china kept its exchange rate fixed to the us dollar at rate of 83 yuan to the dollar the operation of the peg is discussed below although it is difficult to estimate how much the yuan might have appreciated in the absence of government intervention many us critics claimed that the undervaluation was large the chinese government modified its currency policy on july 21 2005 it announced that the yuans exchange rate would become adjustable based on market supply and demand with reference to exchange rate movements of currencies in basket73 it was later announced that the composition of the basket includes the dollar the yen the euro and few other currencies further it announced that the exchange rate of the us dollar against the yuan would be immediately adjusted from 828 to 811 an appreciation of about 21 unlike true floating exchange rate the yuan would according to the chinese government be allowed to fluctuate by more than 03 on daily basis against the basket since july 2005 china has allowed the yuan to appreciate steadily but very slowly it has continued to accumulate foreign reserves at rapid pace which suggests that if the yuan were allowed to freely float it would appreciate much more rapidly the current situation might be best described as managed float market forces are determining the general direction of the yuans movement but the government is retarding its rate of appreciation through market intervention although an undervalued yuan does depress the output of the us trade sector the overall effect on the us economy is more complex as discussed below effect on exporters and importcompetitors when chinas exchange rate policy causes the yuan to be less expensive than it would be if it were floating it causes chinese exports to the united states to be relatively inexpensive and us exports to china to be relatively expensive as result us exports and the production of us goods and services that compete with chinese imports fall in the short run this causes the us trade deficit to rise and reduces aggregate demand in the short run all else equal 73 fixing the yuan to basket of currencies does not rule out the possibility that the yuan could depreciate or appreciate against the dollar when the other currencies in the basket depreciate against the dollar so will the yuan but to lesser extent how closely the yuan moves with the dollar against other currencies will depend on how large weight the dollar has in the basket crs41 china has become the united states secondlargest supplier of imports 2006 data large share of chinas exports to the united states are laborintensive consumer goods such as toys and games textiles and apparel shoes and consumer electronics many of these products do not compete directly with us domestic producers the manufacture of many such products shifted overseas several years ago however there are number of us industries many of which are small and mediumsized firms including makers of machine tools hardware plastics furniture and tool and die equipment that are expressing concern over the growing competitive challenge posed by china74 an undervalued chinese currency may contribute to reduction in the output of such industries75 on the other hand us producers also import capital equipment and inputs to final products from china for example us computer firms use significant level of imported computer parts in their production and china was the largest foreign supplier of computer equipment to the united states in 2005 an undervalued yuan lowers the price of these us products increasing their output and competitiveness in world markets and many imports from china are produced by usinvested enterprises as discussed above which benefit from an undervalued currency effect on us borrowers an undervalued yuan also has an effect on us borrowers when the united states runs current account deficit with china an equivalent amount of capital flows from china to the united states as can be seen in the us balance of payments accounts this occurs because the chinese central bank or private chinese citizens are investing in us assets which allows more us capital investment in plant and equipment to take place than would otherwise occur capital investment increases because the greater demand for us assets puts downward pressure on us interest rates and firms are now willing to make investments that were previously unprofitable this increases aggregate spending in the short run all else equal and increases the size of the economy in the long run by increasing the capital stock private firms are not the only beneficiaries of the lower interest rates caused by the capital inflow trade deficit from china interestsensitive household spending on goods such as consumer durables and housing is also higher than it would be if capital from china did not flow into the united states consumer durables and residential investment have been two of the strongest sectors of the economy in the current expansion in addition large proportion of the us assets bought by the chinese particularly by the central bank are us treasury securities which fund us federal 74 testimony of franklin j vargo national association of manufacturers before the house committee on financial services subcommittee on domestic and international monetary trade and technology policy hearing chinas exchange rate regime and its effects on the us economy oct 1 2003 75 as discussed above us manufacturing has been particularly affected by trade with china the bilateral trade deficit likely attenuates the effect of trade on manufacturing because many services are nontradeable as result manufacturing bears disproportionate burden of any trade deficit crs42 budget deficits according to the us treasury department china as of november 2006 held 347 billion in us treasury securities making china the secondlargest foreign holder of such securities after japan if the us trade deficit with china were eliminated chinese capital would longer flow into this country on net and the government would have to find other buyers of its us treasuries this would increase the governments interest payments increasing the budget deficit all else equal effect on us consumers societys economic wellbeing is usually measured not by how much it can produce but by how much it can consume an undervalued yuan that lowers the price of imports from china allows the united states to increase its consumption of both imported and domestically produced goods through an improvement in the termsoftrade the termsoftrade measures the terms on which us labor and capital can be exchanged for foreign labor and capital because changes in aggregate spending are only temporary from longterm perspective the lasting effect of an undervalued yuan is to increase the purchasing power of us consumers76 net effect on the us economy in the medium run an undervalued yuan neither increases nor decreases aggregate demand in the united states rather it leads to compositional shift in us production away from us exporters and importcompeting firms toward the firms that benefit from the lower interest rates caused by chinese capital inflows in particular capitalintensive firms and firms that produce consumer durables would be expected to benefit from lower interest rates thus it is expected to have medium or longrun effect on aggregate us employment or unemployment as evidence one can consider that the united states had historically large and growing trade deficit throughout the 1990s at time when unemployment reached threedecade low and there was decline in manufacturing employment however the gains and losses in employment and production caused by the trade deficit will not be dispersed evenly across regions and sectors of the economy on balance some areas will gain while others will lose although the compositional shift in output has negative effect on aggregate us output and employment in the long run there may be adverse shortrun consequences if output in the trade sector falls more quickly than the output of us recipients of chinese capital rises aggregate spending and employment could temporarily fall if this occurs then there is likely to be decline in the inflation rate as well which could be beneficial or harmful depending on whether inflation is high or low at the time fall in aggregate spending is more likely to be concern if the economy is already sluggish than if it is at full employment otherwise it is likely that government macroeconomic policy adjustment and market forces can quickly compensate for any decline of output in the trade sector by expanding other elements 76 some commentators have compared the undervalued exchange rate to chinese tariff on us imports one major difference between tariff and the peg is that tariff does not result in any benefit to us consumers as the peg did more appropriate comparison might be an export subsidy which benefits consumers who purchase the subsidized product at lower cost but may harm some domestic firms that must compete against the subsidized product crs43 of aggregate demand the deficit with china has not prevented the us economy from registering high rates of growth since 2003 by shifting the composition of us output to higher capital base the size of the economy would be larger in the long run as result of the capital inflowtrade deficit us citizens would not enjoy the returns to chineseowned capital in the united states us workers employing that chineseowned capital would enjoy higher productivity however and correspondingly higher wages the uschina trade deficit in the context of the overall us trade deficit although china is large trading partner it accounted for only about 154 of us imports in 2006 and 260 of the sum of the bilateral trade deficits77 over span of several years country with floating exchange rate like the united states can run an ongoing overall trade deficit for only one reason domestic imbalance between saving and investment this has been the case for the united states over the past two decades where saving as share of gross domestic product gdp has been in gradual decline78 on the one hand the united states has high rates of productivity growth and strong economic fundamentals that are conducive to high rates of capital investment on the other hand it has chronically low household saving rate and recently negative government saving rate as result of the budget deficit as long as americans save little and foreigners use their saving to finance profitable investment opportunities in the united states the trade deficit is the result79 the returns to foreignowned capital will flow to foreigners instead of americans but the returns to us labor utilizing foreignowned capital will flow to us labor for this reason economists generally are more concerned with the overall trade deficit than bilateral trade balances because of comparative advantage and other forces that shape the structure of trade it is natural that country will have some trading partners from which it imports more and some trading partners to which it exports more for example the united states has trade deficit with austria and trade surplus with the netherlands even though both countries use the euro which floats against the dollar of concern to the united states from an economic perspective is that its low saving rate makes it so reliant on foreigners to finance its investment opportunities and not the fact that much of the capital comes from 77 estimated based on januarynovember 2006 data 78 see congressional budget office causes and consequences of the trade deficit march 2000 79 nations that fail to save enough to meet their investment needs must obtain savings from other countries with high savings rates by obtaining resources from foreign investors for its investment needs the united states is able to enjoy higher rate of consumption than it would if investment were funded by domestic savings alone although many analysts warn that americas low savings rate could be risky to the us economy in the long run the inflow of foreign capital to the united states is equivalent to the united states borrowing from the rest of the world the only way the united states can borrow from the rest of the world is by importing more than it exports running trade deficit crs44 china80 if the united states did not borrow from china as result of the exchange rate peg it would still have to borrow from other countries81 purchase of us treasuries to maintain the peg the chinese central bank maintained the exchange rate peg to the dollar from 1994 to july 2005 by buying or selling as many dollardenominated assets referred to as foreign exchange reserves in exchange for newly printed yuan as needed to eliminate excess demand supply for the yuan82 as result the exchange rate between the yuan and the dollar basically stayed the same despite changing economic factors that could have otherwise caused the yuan to either appreciate or depreciate relative to the dollar under floating exchange rate system such as the arrangement between the dollar and the euro the relative demand for the two countries goods and assets would determine the exchange rate of the yuan to the dollar and the central bank would not systematically intervene in currency markets to influence its value many economists contend that for the first several years of the peg the fixed value was likely close to the market value but in the past few years economic conditions have changed such that the yuan would likely have appreciated if it had been floating the main evidence that the yuan was undervalued was the rapid increase in chinas foreign exchange reserves as seen in table 16 comparing the increase in chinese ownership of us treasuries to the increase in foreign reserves one can see that us treasuries made up only portion of the foreign reserves accumulated by china the remainder were securities of other foreign countries and perhaps us agency securities eg the debt obligations of fannie mae and freddie mac not all of the us treasuries were bought by the chinese central bank some were likely bought by private chinese firms and citizens 80 from political perspective some us policymakers have expressed concern over the high level of us government debt owed to the chinese government 81 for more information see crs report rl30534 americas growing current account deficit its cause and what it means for the economy by marc labonte and gail makinen 82 china may have been able to partially offset the inflationary effects of this policy because it maintains capital controls this may have allowed the central bank to remove some of the newly printed yuan from circulation without attracting capital inflows crs45 table 16 chinas foreign exchange reserves and chinese ownership of us treasuries chinese central banks chinese ownership of year foreign exchange us treasuries reserves 2000 603

discussed in the previous section the purchase of us treasuries by the chinese central bank resulted in greater demand for and therefore lower interest rates on the us governments debt this reduces interest rates and increases interestsensitive spending throughout the us economy as long as the peg was maintained the chinese central bank was obliged to buy as many us treasuries as necessary to maintain the peg now its obligations are somewhat different to limit the yuans daily fluctuation to 03 it is likely the chinese central bank will still actively buy and sell foreign reserves because the exchange rate is longer exclusively tied to the dollar smaller proportion of their future foreign reserve transactions may be in dollardenominated assets to date the new arrangement and its effect on the us economy has not produced significantly different results than the previous fixed exchange rate regime the current situation might be best described as managed float market forces are determining the general direction of the yuans movement but the government is still accumulating foreign reserves to retard its rate of appreciation this exchange rate policy is similar to many of its neighbors which are also major us trading partners if the chinese moved to freely floating exchange rates as many us policymakers have requested then it would longer be necessary for the chinese central bank to maintain large holdings of us treasuries some have feared that the chinese might then dump their holding of us treasuries on the market disrupting us financial markets and thereby damaging the overall economy while there is legitimate concern that financial markets would be disrupted in this scenario it is unclear why this action would be in chinas self interest were the chinese central bank to dump enough treasuries on the market to push down their price it would be crs46 forced to take capital losses on the sale depreciation of the dollar would also reduce the yuan value of chinas holdings of us securities if the losses were great enough it could cause the chinese central banks liabilities to exceed its assets even if china longer needs us treasuries to maintain the peg it would still want to hold treasuries to maintain wellbalanced portfolio of foreign reserves given chinas focus on maintaining exchange rate stability and discouraging currency speculation it is unlikely to wish to reduce its overall foreign reserve holdings either finally it would not be in chinas selfinterest to reduce growth in its largest export market it is possible however that the move could be made for geopolitical rather than economic reasons some commentators have referred to the maintenance of the peg as new form of mercantilism mercantilism is school of thought originating in the 17th century that held that the goal of nations trade policy should be to maximize the accumulation of gold and silver reserves through large trade surpluses in this case it is argued china is trying to maximize its foreign reserve holdings mainly us treasuries and other foreign debt instead of gold and silver david humes forceful rejection of the mercantilists logic applies to the current situation as well economic welfare is measured by total consumption over ones lifetime not by the hoarding of foreign exchange reserves those foreign exchange reserves could be sold at some point to finance future consumption but if the earnings on those reserves are relatively low as is the case with us treasuries future consumption will be worth less than the consumption forgone today to accumulate them furthermore any attempt to accumulate unlimited reserves will automatically be thwarted by the inflationary effects of such policy which will reduce the trade surplus ultimately nations wealth lies in its productive capacity rather than its reserve holdings what will happen to the terms of trade in economics the central economic question to be answered in regard to increased international trade is not its particular effect on employment or wages those effects are not to be ignored but they are symptoms of larger process the answer economic analysis attempts to provide is whether that larger process ultimately makes the united states richer or poorer as economic growth abroad expands the number of competitive sources of production will substituting foreign for domestic output generate gains from trade and raise overall economic wellbeing in the united states as examined above there will likely be negative effects from trade but in most circumstances including increased trade with china and other low wage economies the strong expectation of economists is that gains outweigh losses and that trades disruptive reshuffling of the economys productive resources does crs47 ultimately result in an increase in overall economic wellbeing83 this expectation is confirmed by the preponderance of evidence84 the gains from trade are not static phenomenon however at any point in time trade increases economic wellbeing over what it otherwise would be however over time the size of the gain that accrues to an economy from given volume of trade could rise or fall as the relative economic circumstances of trading partners change such changes in circumstance could arise from changes in consumer tastes resource endowments or technology trade can continue to be positivesum process of mutual gain in that an economy would be worse off by not trading but the apportionment of total gains among trading partners can be altered causing either an enhancement or an erosion of particular economys share of the total gains from trade therefore it can be telling of the economys international trade performance and its view of how it is faring from increased trade to also consider whether there has been any longterm trend in the nations share of the gains from trade more specifically this is question of whether over time the us economys terms of trade defined as the ratio of the economys average export price to its average import price has tended to rise or fall as the industrial output and export sales of china and other lowwage economies has grown this expansion of world output may not only put downward pressure on the price of us imports but may also have an impact on the price of us exports through at once rising demand for us goods and rising supply of goods competitive with us exports at home and in the wider world market the terms of trade can be understood as measure of the export cost of acquiring imports an increase in this ratio an improving terms of trade means that any given volume of export sales will now exchange for larger volume of imports indicating an increase in the gains from trade rising trend would indicate that countrys trade performance has improved relative to other trading countries reaping an increasing share of the gains from trade and real income benefits for the economy similarly decrease in the ratio of export prices to import prices deteriorating terms of trade raises the export cost of acquiring imports and reduces the gains from trade falling trend would be indicative of deteriorating trade performance decreasing share of the gains from trade and decrements to real income deterioration in the terms of trade does not necessarily mean that trade overall is not beneficial and that we would be better off without trade it merely has become less beneficial in circumstances where the volume of trade is rising 83 the gains from trade can emerge from comparative advantage economies of scale and inducements to innovation and the generation of faster economic growth see for example max w corden the normative theory of international trade in the handbook of international economics vol1 amsterdam north holland 1984 84 see for example edward leamer and james levinsohninternational trade theory the evidence in the handbook of international economics vol 3 amsterdam north holland 1995 and jeffery frankel and david romer does trade cause growth national bureau of economic research working paper 5476 june 1999 crs48 there may not be an absolute decline in real income rather the rate of growth of income will be slower than it otherwise would be85 over time it is possible that economic growth in the rest of the world will tend to show bias either towards production of goods country exports or towards production of the goods country imports if exportbiased the economic growth abroad will cause more than proportionate increase in the worldwide supply of goods that compete with us exports tending to reduce the price of our exports inducing deterioration of the us terms of trade that deterioration is decrement to our economic welfare and an increase to that of our trading partners in contrast if economic growth in the rest of the world is importbiased there is more than proportionate increase in the worldwide supply of the goods the us imports pushing down import prices and inducing an improvement in the us terms of trade over time that improvement translates into gain in us economic welfare to the detriment of our trading partners rising level of trade is clearly manifestation of economic growth in the rest of the world and in recent years this has included the expanded participation of low wage developing economies such as china in the internationally fragmented production processes in which an import has value added in several locations during production that now propels large and growing share of international trade has the increase in such trade adversely affected the us economys terms of trade relative to its peak in the mid1960s the us economys terms of trade has certainly declined but the period of trendlike decline stops around 1980 the deterioration in this period was at about 10 per year the impact however of this fall of the terms of trade on us economic welfare would be proportional to the share of imports in gdp which in this period was about 10 this would then translate into an annual real income loss of about 01 this deterioration is moderate but significant particularly if judged by its cumulative impact this deterioration most likely reflects the recovery and return to competitive posture of the many highincome economies from the devastation of world war ii these were largely economies that had resource endowments similar to that of the united states and who with economic recovery could be expected to increasingly compete against us exports in global markets in this period growth in the rest of the world was exportbiased and accordingly pushed down the average price of us exports 85 also the terms of trade will not fully reflect the gains from trade that come from the realization of economies of scale this is of some significance for trade between mature economies that have similar factor proportions ie the united states europe japan and canada and has most likely steadily risen in importance for such economies this can be taken as at least partial offset to any loss in the gains from trade indicated by falling terms of trade nevertheless movement in the terms of trade would still be indicative of changes in the gains from trade coming from rising trade with low wage economies that would still have very different resource endowments ie relatively large supplies of low skill labor and relatively small supplies of capital and high skill labor nor will the terms of trade fully reflect the benefit to consumers that come from access to not just more goods but wider variety of goods crs49 since the 1980s the us terms of trade has fluctuated but has not shown sustained track up or down it rose in the early 1980s fell in the late 1980s and early 1990s and then moved up again through the late 1990s to the present it is likely that this undulating but trendless path was mostly reflection of the effect of relatively shortterm movements of the dollars exchange rate on export and import prices suggesting that there were enduring forces up or down being generated by the underlying demand and supply conditions in the global economy that would most often cause enduring trends in export and import prices it is of course in this recent trendless period that trade by lowwage economies with the united states and other advanced industrial economies grew in importance so whatever impact this growth had on the us terms of trade was not strong enough by itself to induce an upward or downward trend in that measure it would seem then that growth in the rest of the world in this period was on balance without bias towards either the goods the united states exports or imports although there is precise way to isolate the impact of economic growth in china on the us terms of trade some qualitative observations may be informative first it has certainly been the case that recent economic growth in china has been rich in the production and export of many laborintensive goods that the united states imports and it seems likely this production if anything has exerted downward push on the price of us imports and an upward pull on the terms of trade second economic growth in china in contrast to the prior experience with japan and other east asian economies at similar stage of development has occurred with relatively open trade leading to strong demand for imports particularly of hightech capital goods from the united states and other advanced economies us exports to china more than doubled between 2001 to 2005 rising from about 19 billion to 42 billion this rising demand likely exerted an upward pull on the price of us exports and the us terms of trade third it seems unlikely that there has been strong largescale headtohead competition between us and chinese exports in global markets the greater part of us merchandise exports are in relatively hightech goods such as computer accessories semiconductors and telecommunications equipment in sophisticated industrial machinery such as electrical apparatus industrial engines and measuring testing and control instruments in transportation equipment such as aircraft aircraft parts and aircraft engines and in medical related goods such medical equipment and pharmaceuticals in contrast large portion of chinese exports are in relatively low tech consumer goods such furniture toys footwear and apparel china also exports rising volume of electrical machinery and equipment that might be seen to be in more direct competition with some us exports but these exports primarily reflect china steadily becoming the location for final assembly of many consumer electronics computers and information technology goods sophisticated components used in this assembly process are likely to be an export from the high wage economies therefore despite the hightech nature of the components and the final good this assembly process is relatively lowtech undertaking that lends itself to the intensive use of lowskilled labor and is not in competition with us exports crs50 another major difference in the composition of us and chinese exports is the importance of services in 2004 the united states exported 350 billion in services representing nearly 40 of all us exports the largest type of services export was in the category called other private services which includes business services financial services insurance services telecommunication services and engineering services in comparison chinas services exports in 2004 were only about 60 billion and heavily composed of travel and tourism services services exports are growing rapidly in china up 34 in 2004 and growth over the last decade averaged 14 annual rate however chinas demand for services imports is equally strong totaling nearly 72 billion and growing 31 in 2004 with decade annual average pace of 13 this pattern of trade in services suggests that whatever impact chinas increased services exports are having on the price of service exports of the united states and other advanced industrial nations may well be offset by the opposite impact from chinas growing demand for services at this point there does not seem to be strong reason to believe that the recent economic growth of china has had an eroding effect on the us terms of trade of course future economic growth could have more adverse outcome for the us gains from trade if the path of economic development china and other lowwage economies follows is also linked to change in their resource endowments to the capital and skill abundant form characteristic of advanced economies making it more likely that rising proportion of their expanding output will consist of goods and services in direct competition with the exports of the advanced economies however there are also several reasons that suggest there may not be significant deterioration of the us terms of trade associated with future economic growth in china first the chinese economy is far more open to imports than japan and other east asian economies were at this stage of their development and the openness of the domestic chinese market seems likely to increase this would likely increase the probability that already strong chinese demand for us exports will grow stronger as their economic growth proceeds of particular importance in this regard is the ongoing chinese liberalization of trade in services an area where the us economy has significant comparative advantage and good prospect of generating substantial gains from trade second given that many production processes will continue to be geographically fragmented and large share of the final value of this type of chinese exports will be derived from imported components large share of the gains from trade associated with the sale of this type of chinese export will accrue to the workers and inventors outside of china who produce these components including many in the united states it seems reasonable to expect sizable portion of any future growth of such gains would also accrue to the us economy third also unlike other trading partners in asia 58 of chinese exports are produced by foreignowned firms therefore even if china accounts for the bulk of valueadded on the products produced and exported by such enterprises with economic growth relatively larger share of the gains from trade would accrue to foreign investors like the united states through repatriated earnings from the foreign affiliate to the domestic parent than was true of the growth of japan and other east asian countries at this stage of their economic development crs51 fourth for china to compete in the future on large scale against us exports in world markets it would have to have command of the same scope and level industrial technology as the united states this would likely require that china not only effectively absorb existing technology but also be able to regularly generate new technology as the us does some argue that the current structure of the chinese economy raises some doubts about this occurring again unlike what occurred in japan and other east asian economies technological transfer and diffusion in china has so far been relatively limited recent analysis by george gilboy points to possible reasons why the chinese economy is unlikely any time soon to challenge the technological leadership of the united states europe and japan86 first as noted earlier foreignfunded enterprises produce nearly 60 of chinas exports and the share of hightech exports may be near 90 moreover beginning in the 1990s the chinese government allowed foreign enterprises to move away from joint ventures and establish wholly owned foreign enterprises and this form now accounts for 65 of recent foreign investment in china such enterprises are much less inclined to share their technical knowledge for doing so would give up their competitive advantage over both indigenous chinese companies and other foreign enterprises in expanding their market share of the domestic chinese market second chinas unreformed political system suppresses the development of the horizontal networks that establish fruitful linkages of the firm to research institutions investors suppliers customers as well as for collaborations with other chinese firms the importance of such horizontal networks is that they are often thought to be the means by which new technical knowledge is nurtured and spread through the economy third most chinese firms have not invested strongly in the creation of new technologies with economywide rd spending as share of gdp falling well below the average share devoted to rd by the advanced industrial economies however this optimistic outlook is certainly conditional on the united states continuing to do those things that have made it economically dynamic and innovative and steadily able to offer the world economy wide array of new and desirable goods and services how can this be ensured the terms of trade is unlikely to be at the center of most discussions of trade policy or macroeconomic policy because it is not variable that is easy to influence directly because your gain is going to be at their expense other nations are likely to try to counter such policies this is situation that could all too easily devolve into vicious cycle of retaliation and counterretaliation shrinking the volume of world trade and leaving all parties worse off nevertheless economic policy may be able to indirectly influence the economys terms of trade in favorable manner this can occur as beneficial by product of an array of policies that support an infrastructure that furthers the goal of vigorous economic growth these policies will raise the probability but certainly not assure favorable terms of trade effect relevant policies would likely include macroeconomic policies that minimize economic instability and raise the incentive 86 george gilboy the myth behind chinas miracle foreign affairs julyaugust 2004 pp8897 crs52 for economic agents to undertake the forward looking activities of investment and innovation policies that give focused public support of knowledge producing activities such as education and scientific research that are very likely undervalued and underproduced by the private market and continued initiatives toward the lowering of trade barriers at home and abroad in this way terms of trade gains would likely be seen as emerging from process that has probably increased the gains to each trading partner although not necessarily equally and thereby not seen by other nations as zerosum game where our gain is their loss chinese takeovers of us companies with few exceptions mainly dealing with national security concerns the united states has maintained relatively liberal and open policy regarding foreign investment in the united states because it is believed that such investment benefits the us economy through increased production job creation increased competition expansion of trade and improvements to productivity chinas rise as an economic power has raised number of concerns among us policymakers including recent efforts by chinese companies with substantial state ownership to take over major us companies many members believe these takeovers could pose risks to us economic as well as national security interests some of these major takeover bids include on december 8 2004 lenovo group limited computer company primarily owned by the chinese government signed an agreement with ibm corporation to purchase ibms personal computer division for 175 billion on april 30 2005 the acquisition was completed on june 20 2005 haier group major chinese home appliances manufacturer made 128 billion bid to take over maytag corporation the bid was withdrawn on july 19 2005 after whirlpool made higher bid on june 23 2005 the china national offshore oil corporation cnooc through its hong kong subsidiary cnooc ltd made bid to buy us energy company unocal for 185 billion on august 2 2005 cnooc withdrew its bid congressional concern over the cnooc bid cnoocs bid to take over unocal was particularly troublesome to many members of congress on june 27 2005 representative joe barton chairman of the house energy and commerce committee and representative ralph hall chairman of the house energy and commerce subcommittee on energy and air quality sent letter to president bush expressing deep concern over cnoocs bid to take over unocal describing it clear threat to the energy and national security of the united states in the senate letters written by senators conrad and grassley expressed concerns that cnoocs crs53 bid to take over unocal would be heavily subsidized by the chinese government and urged the administration to determine whether the cnooc bid would be violation of chinas wto commitments several bills were introduced in the 109th congress on cnoocs bid including some that would have blocked the sale had it gone through cnooc made number of pledges to allay concerns including promising that most of the oil and gas produced by unocal in the united states would still be sold in the united states and that most unocal jobs in the united states would be retained the chairman of cnooc stated that his companys main interest in unocal was its large holdings of oil and gas in asia not the united states however on august 2 2005 cnooc announced it was withdrawing its bid citing significant political opposition to the sale in the united states which the company termed as regrettable and unjustified87 despite these highprofile cases chinese foreign direct investment in the united states remains small enough that the bureau of economic analysis bea does not provide data for it in its quarterly and annual reports on fdi in the united states88 however it does list such data from time to time in various issues of the beas survey of current business89 chinas total fdi in the united states on historical cost position basis grew from 277 million in 2000 to 490 million in 2004 in comparison taiwans fdi in the united states was 32 billion chinas fdi in the united states accounted for 03 of total fdi in the united states90 the united states by contrast held 511 billion of fdi in china in 2005 according to chinese data91 congressional concern over chinese efforts to purchase us firms appears to be driven in part by the perception that china does not play by the rules in international trade policy for example most of chinas major companies are wholly or partially owned by the state cnooc for example is 70 owned by the chinese government these firms are believed to be heavily subsidized by the government primarily through the banking system where loans often go unpaid some analysts contend that the chinese government has plan to direct companies under its control to purchase major international companies to obtain their brand names and thus become global companies some analysts believe that the chinese government may also be involved in financing takeover bids finally many 87 for an overview of this issue see crs report rl33093 china and the cnooc bid

lenovo deal is included in the data 91 us data as reported by bea on its fdi in china differ significantly from chinas data on us fdi in china according to the bea us fdi on historical cost basis stood at 154 billion at end of 2004 crs54 members contend that chinese firms should not be allowed to take over us firms because in most cases china does not allow foreign firms to take over major chinese companies rather it sometimes permits minority ownership in some companies some analysts contend that given us complaints over the size of the us china trade imbalance the united states should be encouraging china to invest in the united states92 they suggest that in some cases chinese fdi in the united states might help revitalize through an infusion of capital some manufacturing companies that otherwise might be forced to close down or relocate outside the united states93 according to the state department japanese fdi among others in the united states during the 1980s provided critical support for change which increased us competitiveness employment and productivity94 others contend that efforts to block chinese fdi in the united states might be viewed by other foreign investors as sign of growing protectionism in the united states against fdi which could affect future fdi decisions while others warn that singling out china for fdi restrictions could affect chinese policy on us fdi in china rising chinese demand for commodities demand for commodities and natural resources is another channel through which chinas economic development might affect the us economy in particular many commentators have looked to chinas growing economy as the explanation for why world oil prices have risen so precipitously in recent years as chinas demand for commodities rises some argue that world commodity prices will rise making the us as net commodity importer worse off although by the same logic us producers of commodities would be better off if this occurred it would lower us welfare through deterioration in the termsoftrade see the section above the deterioration would occur however visavis commodityexporting countries not china the first question to consider is why chinas commodity demand would suddenly become factor today observers point to chinas high rates of gdp growth but chinas gdp growth has actually slowed slightly in recent years in the 1980s and 1990s its economy grew by 98 annually in this decade it grew by 92 during the 1980s japanese companies such as auto and electronic firms boosted investment in the united states as way to respond us criticism over the growing trade imbalance and to discourage the use of trade restrictions by the united states see crs report rl32649 usjapan economic relations significance prospects and policy options by

plants because most such fdi is in large scale plants see crs report rs21857 foreign direct investment in the united states an economic analysis by james k jackson 94 us department of state usjapan economic partnership for growth usjapan investment initiative 2004 report at httpwwwstategovpeaprlsrpt33295htm crs55 85 on the other hand chinas economy now produces bigger share of world output as measured by purchasing power parity china now accounts for 14 of world gdp compared with 3 in 1980 and 6 in 1990 so even at lower growth rates chinas output is increasing by more in dollar terms each year today although its share of world gdp is growing its share of world gdp growth in any given year is still relatively small averaging about 6 over the past three years chinas role in the world economy is clearly not yet as great as conventional wisdom holds95 one important commodity whose price has risen sharply in recent years is oil in real terms real prices have risen from 13 barrel in 1998 to 23 in 2002 to 45 in 2005 all prices in 2000 dollars although the effects of this price spike on the us economy have been muted thus far oil price spikes are concern as they have preceded eight of the past nine us recessions energy analysts see rising world demand as major contributor to the recent price spike and point to china as major source of rising world demand96 in 2005 china accounted for 85 of the worlds oil consumption which is the second highest in the world after the united states 25 chinas share of world oil consumption has more than doubled since 1990 when it accounted for 3 of world consumption since 1998 chinese oil consumption has increased by 28 million barrels day or 65 over the same period us oil consumption has increased by 17 million barrels day or 9 and european union oil consumption has increased only 2 chinese oil consumption has grown particularly rapidly recently rising 16 in 2004 alone fastest among all of the worlds major economies if chinese consumption continues to rise so rapidly world supply will also have to rise rapidly or prices will rise further however it would be mistake to extrapolate past growth rates into the future precisely because rising prices put curb on future demand growth by encouraging energy efficiency for example and induce supply increases for example chinese annual oil consumption growth slowed to 3 in 200597 chinas consumption of other energy commodities has also shown sharp increase since 1998 its consumption of natural gas has increased by 137 and its consumption of coal has increased by 66 prices in these markets are more regionally determined than oil however so the effect of chinese consumption on us prices would be more limited similar growth in chinese consumption has been seen in other commodity markets as well according to the economist china is the worlds largest consumer of aluminum steel copper and coal98 in 1998 china produced 12 million metric tons of copper about enough to meet its consumption needs in 2005 chinese consumption had risen to 36 million tons but production had only risen to 2 million tons chinas demand for steel has risen from 140 million metric tons in 2000 to 300 95 chinas share of world growth is smaller than its share of world output in part because its share of world growth is measured at current exchange rates not purchasing power parity 96 see crs report rl32530 world oil demand and its effect on oil prices by robert pirog 97 all oil data come from british petroleum statistical review of world energy june 2006 98 from tshirts to tbonds the economist july 30 2005 p 61 crs56 million metric tons in 2005 between 2003 and 2004 the world price of steel has risen about 50 chinese aluminum consumption has risen from 38 million metric tons in 2001 to 59 million in 2005 chinese imports of iron ore have risen from 55 million metric tons in 1999 to 150 million in 2003 making it the worlds largest importer between 2002 and 2004 world iron prices more than doubled99 some observers have been concerned that china will gain control of commodity supplies and that this would boost prices for us consumers for example they point to the chinese company cnoocs failed bid to take over the us oil company unocal see previous section what these observers fail to take into account is that national ownership does not affect the price of commodity whose price is determined in an international market for example oil prices have risen internationally and countries such as great britain are not sheltered from this increase just because they are net exporters if china purchased oil companies or oil supplies and then directed those companies to only serve the chinese market the result would be that other companies who now supply china would reduce their supplies to china 1to1 and redirect their supplies to other countries thus there would be effect on the price or supply of oil to the rest of the world it is not given that rising commodity demand will lead to higher prices it depends on whether the growth in the supply of commodities can keep pace100 indeed most commodities have fallen in value in the long run despite the steady increase in world economic output the economists commodity price index has fallen about 60 in real terms since 1950 even though it has risen about 75 since its trough in 2001101 using data from the bureau of labor statistics crude commodity prices have fallen 32 in real terms since 1974102 and there are already signs that commodity demand growth may be falling in china in response to higher prices103 growing concern over chinas energy use and rising demand is the possible global environmental consequences according to one estimate onethird of the air pollution in the west coast of the united states comes from china104 chinas 99 all data from david menzie et chinas growing appetite for minerals us geological survey open report 20041374 100 it is also possible that part of the increase in chinese demand for some commodities could be offset by lower demand elsewhere for example it has been welldocumented that the production of some goods has shifted from other parts of east asia to china in recent years it is possible that consumption of the commodities used in the production of those goods would as result be greater in china but lower in the country that used to produce the goods 101 160 years on the economist feb 12 2005 p 76 their index consists of 25 commodities and excludes oil and precious metals part of the rise since 2001 is because the index is measured in dollar terms and the dollar has depreciated 102 calculated by crs using crude commodities divided by the consumer price index 103 from accelerator to brake the economist oct 8 2005 104 the aspen institute uschina relations eight conference april 915 2006 china continued crs57 pollution levels are expected to worsen for example according to the us energy information administration eia china in 2003 was the worlds secondlargest emitter of dioxide emissions at 35 billion metric tons after the united states but by the year 2030 it will be the largest emitter at 107 billion metric tons three times the level in 2003 with much of these emissions 78 coming from coal use105 conclusion chinas economic ascendency over the past 28 years has been described by some as an economic miracle china has gone from poor backward economy to the worlds secondlargest economy on ppp basis although many have welcomed chinas prosperity and integration into the world economy others have viewed it with alarm contending that chinas rise as an economic superpower threatens to undermine the us economy for example some contend that chinas rise must indicate decline in us economic power others contend that chinas economic policies such as subsidies to its state sector an undervalued currency and low wages threaten us jobs wages technological edge and living standards chinas economic growth has resulted in substantial increase in commercial ties between it and the united states china is now the thirdlargest us trading partner its secondlargest source of imports and its fourthlargest export market over the past five years china has been the fastest growing us export market continued economic growth and growing middle class will likely make china an enormous market for us goods and services provided that trade and investment barriers continue to fall within decade or two it is projected that china will surpass the united states and become the worlds largest economy there is little reason to believe that chinas rise will be matched by any fall in us living standards however the high level of relatively lowcost imports from china have benefitted the united states in number of ways first lowercost imports have helped keep inflation down second lowcost imports have increased overall consumer welfare enabling consumers to purchase other goods and services and hence stimulating growth in other sectors of the economy finally lowcost imports have benefitted us firms that use them as inputs for the production of other goods thus making those firms more competitive although trade is often seen as threat economists point to comparative advantage and maintain that trade is mutually beneficial on the other hand lowcost imports from china have adversely affected number of firms and workers in the manufacturing sector such as textiles diminishing their output employment and wages nevertheless they assert that chinese economic and trade policies are not the cause of the bilateral trade imbalance or net job loss in the manufacturing sector most economists contend than an appreciation of chinas currency would not have significant impact on creating jobs in the us 104 continued energy issues by hal harvey ms p 15 105 eia international energy outlook 2006 p 93 crs58 manufacturing sector they maintain that appreciation would largely shift manufacturing production to other lowwage countries not to the united states in general trade and the trade deficit with china has not prevented the united states from achieving full employment in recent years china maintains number of inefficient and distortionary policies such as government financial support of soes industrial policies intended to promote the development of pillar industries and an undervalued currency facto export subsidy economists note that although subsidies on exports can negatively affect importcompeting domestic firms and workers they also benefit consumers and users of imported inputs who can obtain such goods at lower prices than under the conditions of free trade in effect this improves the us terms of trade because it means given level of us exports can obtain more imports on the other hand the use of subsidies by china lowers its terms of trade and promotes inefficiencies in the economy even if chinese subsidies produce net benefits to the us economy many us policymakers oppose their use because they do cause some us firms and workers to suffer public perceptions that some countries are not playing by the rules of trade may impact their support and that of their government representatives for further trade liberalization on bilateral on multilateral basis some trade practices such failure to protect ipr hurt both the us and chinese economies china traditionally has focused on lowend laborintensive manufacturing much of which did not compete directly with us firms however china is attempting to move into more advanced production and hopes to become globally competitive in number of industries such as autos and information technology this has raised concerns that china may pose the kind of competitive challenge to major us industries that japan posed during the 1980s although it is difficult to accurately predict how advanced chinas economy will become it currently lags significantly behind the united states the divergent experience of the us and japanese economies since the 1990s suggests that the competitive threat from china is questionable especially considering the extensive economic challenges china faces in the years ahead chinese purchases of us treasury securities have helped the federal government fund its budget deficits and therefore have helped keep us interest rates down at the same time china has become the secondlargest foreign holder of these securities and some analysts contend that this status gives china economic leverage over the united states but any attempt to harm the us economy by unloading these holdings would likely cause comparable harm to the chinese economy similar arguments are made regarding chinas attempts to purchase us companies however analysts contend that it would not be in chinas economic interest to purchase us companies if it did not intend to operate them profitably in general given the growing importance of the us economy to chinas economic growth policies to destabilize the us economy would destabilize chinas economy as well china has become one of the most polluted countries in the world and this poses problem for the united states to the extent that environmental degradation is global problem many analysts contend that chinas massive energy needs and challenging pollution problems offer significant opportunities for us companies crs59 similarly the recent rise in price of many commodities has been attributed in part to chinas rapid growth while this helps us commodity producers on balance it may reduce americas terms of trade with commodityexporting nations in the long run whether chinas growth is good or bad for the us economy will ultimately depend on its effect on the terms of trade whether chinas growth raises relative prices for us exports or imports this is an open question since the 1980s the us terms of trade have shown upward nor downward trend but even if chinas growth did lead to decline in the us terms of trade the gains of continued trade would still exceed welfare levels attainable under scenario where the united states withdrew from world trade thus from an economic perspective describing chinas economic rise or its economic policies as an economic threat to the united states fails to reflect that chinas growth poses both challenges and opportunities for the united states as one us trade official recently put it as chinas economy and our bilateral trade grow our trade relationship has become enormously complex and does not lend itself to either simplistic characterization or simple policy prescriptions106 the main challenge for us policymakers is to press china to quicken economic and trade reforms and to fully transform itself into marketbased economy the united states on number of occasions has provided technical support to china on such areas as rule of law ipr protection pollution control and banking and currency reforms the expansion of such programs into other areas could help induce china to quicken economic reforms especially if chinese officials believe that doing so will not lead to political upheaval the united states can also use the dispute resolution mechanism in the wto to ensure that china fully implements its wto commitments the united states used this process to resolve case with china over its discriminatory tax polices favoring domesticallymade semiconductors it recently brought similar case involving auto parts it is currently considering bringing wto case against china over its failure to protect ipr 106 statement of
