the protect act amends the sentencing procedures used in federal cases particularly those i nvolving sex offenses and other crimes against children sentencing within the federal criminal justice system is governed to large extent by united states sentencing commissions sent encing guidelines congress authorizedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21522crs2 the commission to construe and maintain the guideline system in order to eliminate the disparity that unguided judici sentencing discretion might produce the guidelines establish series of steps calibrated accordin g to the seriousness of the violation beneath the statutory maximum provided for par ticular offense and above any applicable mandatory minimum sentence the guidelines process is essentially sc ore card process mo st federal crimes have been assigned to an individual guideline that provides base offense level and that adds or subtracts offense levels to account for the presence of any of list of identified aggravating or mitigating circumstances the final offense level score requires sentence within one of six relatively narrow sentencing ranges the six ranges vary in severity according to the extent of the offenders crimin record heretofore sentencing court might depart either upward impose more severe penalty or dow nward impose less severe penalty from the appli cable guideline sentencing range if it found that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstan ce of kind or to degree not adequately taken into consideration by the sentencing commission in formulating the guidelines 28 usc 3553b the acts amendments to the guideline process added during debate in the house 149 cong rec h2420437 daily ed mar 27 2003 ppeared to have been the product of department of justice c oncerns over the extent of downward departures the house judiciary committee hearings on the amber alert proposal hr 1104 were held in conjunction with consideration of proposal that included change in the standard of appellate review in sentenci ng guideline cases hr 1161 during those hearings the department of justice recommended changes in the structure of the guidelines to reduce the number of downward depart ures found in federal case law hr 1161 contains certain add itional provisions not found in the senate bill in particular section 12 of the bill would enact longoverdue reforms to address the growing frequency of downward departures from the sentencing guidelines this is especially problem in child pornography cases much of the damage is traceable to the supreme courts decision in koon v united states 518 us 81 1996 in koon the court interpreted the sentencing reform act to require appellate courts to apply highly deferential standard of review to departure determinations by sentencing judges the court also disapproved the practice whereby ppellate courts had previously determined that certain grounds of departure were impermissible instead the court held that any factor not explicitly disapproved by the sentencing commission or by stat ute could serve as ground for departure in an appropriate case as determined by the district court in its discretion under koon judges who dislike the sentencing reform act and the sentencing guidelines have significant discretion to avoid applying sentence within the range established by the commission and it is difficult for the government effectively to appeal in such cases consequently the rates of downward departure have steadily accelerated since koon moreover koon s expansion of the permissible grounds of departures had led to growing trend of increasingly vague grounds of downward departure section 12 of hr 1161 would provide muchneeded and longoverdue reform by establishing that decisions to depart from the godliness are to be reviewed under novo standard of review to that extent koon would be explicitly overruled while we enthusiastically support this measure we do not believe it goes far enough we strongly urge the subcommittee to include appropriate language that would overrule both of the key holdings in koon specifically the bill should include language that would prohibit departures on any ground that the sentencing commission has not affirmatively specified as permissible ground for downward departure in doing so the bill would effectively overrule koon on this point as well hr1104 the child abduction prevention act and hr 1161 the child obscenity and pornography prevention act of 2003 hearing before the subcomm on crime terrorism and homeland security of the house comm on the judiciary

language addressing the justice depa rtments concern over downwar d departures hrept 10847 2003 during debate however represen tative feeney offered an amendment that incorporated sentencing guideline modifi cations into the bill and that echoed the sentiments of the justice department mr chairman this amendment addresses longstanding and increasing problems of downward departures form the federal sentencing guidelines according to the testimony of the department of justice this is especially problem in child pornography cases although the guidelines continue to state that departures should be very rare occurrences they have in fact proved to be anything but increasingly the exceptions are overriding the rule the department of justice believes that much of this damage is traceable to the supreme courts 1996 decision in koon versus the united states in the koon case the court held that any factor not explicitly disapproved by the sentencing commission or by statute could serve as grounds for departure so judges can make up exceptions as they go along this has led to an accelerated rate of downward departures judges who dislike the sentencing reform and the sentencing guidelines now have significant discretion to avoid applying sentence within the range established by the commission and it is difficult for government to effectively appeal such cases the amendment i offer today contains number of provisions designed to ensure more faithful adherence to the guidelines so defendants in cases involving child pornography and sexual abuse receive the sentences that congress intended 149 congrec h2422423 daily ed mar 27 2003 the amendment passed and the language of hr 1104 was substituted for that of its senatepassed count erpart s 151 149 congrec h2436443 daily ed mar 27 2003 the senate version of s 151 had language comparable to the feeney amendment but the conferees accepted revised version of the amendment hrepno 10866 2003 the bill with the revised amendment passed both houses 149 congrec h307576 s5156157 daily ed apr 10 2003 and was sent to the president who signed it on april 30 2003 117 stat 650 2003 composition of the sentencing commission the sentencing commission consists of seven members 28 usc 991 five of its current members are federal judges the act provides that hereafter more than three members of the commission may be federal judges althoug h the limitation does not apply to any of the judges serving on or nominated to the commission at the time of enactment 28 usc 991 991 note 117 stat 675 2003 the limitation of judicial service presumably opens the commission to broader representation from the academic and prof essional communities opponents of the provision lamented the prospective loss of judi cial expertise although not mentioned in debate judges would appear to enjoy th additional advantage of already having successfully undergone the examinations associ ated with the confirmation process yet perhaps the provision should be attributed in large measure to apprehensions over possible judicial hostility towards the guidelines downward departures in certain child abuse and sex offense cases earlier law permitted federal courts to impose sentence outside the applicable sentencing guideline range if the court finds that there exists an aggravating orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21522crs4 mitigating circumstance of kind or to degree not adequately take n into consideration by the sentencing commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in sentence different from that described 18 u sc 3553b the court might also depart from the guideline range based upon the ffenders substantial assistance to the government ussg 5k11 the act changes the rules in the case of certain child abuse and sex offenses ie cases following convicti on for violation of 18 usc 1201 nonparental kidnapi ng involving minor victim 18 usc 1591 sex trafficking of children or by force fraud or coercion 18 usc ch71 obscenity 18 usc ch 109a sexual abuse 18 usc ch 110 sexual exploitation and other abuse of children or 18 usc ch 117 transportation for illegal sexual activ ity and related crimes in such cases the courts may depart upward based on in adequate commission consideration of circumstance presented by the case or depart downward on the basis of government recommendation for substa ntial assistance or otherwise depart downward only with the support of specific authority in the guidelines to do so the subject matter of the legislation and the source of the concerns seem to have dictated the selection of the crimes in the list the conference report observed that those convicted of sexual abuse received downward depa rture in over 16 percent of the cases and trial courts granted reduc tions below the guideline range of those convicted of sexual abuse by an astonishin g 63 percent from the guideline range for those convicted of pornography andor prostitu tion related offenses trial courts departed from the recommended guidelines over 18 percent of the time reducing these defendants sentences by staggering 66 per cent hrepno 10866 at 589 2003 explicit grounds for downward parture in child abuse and sex offense cases by limiting the grounds of downward departure in child abuse and sex offense cases except as explicitly authorized congress raises the question of which downward departures are explicitly author ized the guidelines authorize limited downward departures for assistance to th prosecution old age coercion and duress voluntary disclosure of an offense and physical impairment to lessen the possibility of inappropriate downward depart ures in the case of disqualifying child abuse and sex offenses however the act for ecloses otherwise authorized downward departures based on family ties and responsibilitie s or community ties diminished capacity or aberrant behavior acceptance of responsibility in the calculation of the final offense level and applicable sentencing range and before th question of departure arises defendantshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21522crs5 offense level may be reduced if he accepts responsibility for his offense ussg 3e11 the guideline governing the possible reduction has two parts the first allows all defendants 2 leve l reduction if they clearly dem onstrate acceptance of responsibility for their offense ussg 3e11a the second allows an additional 1 level reduction from an offense level of 16 or high er if the defendant announces his intent to plead guilty and fully disclose s his involvement in the crime notifies ussg 3e11b the act amends this second part it permits the 1 level reduction upon announcement of an intent to plead guilty without insisting upon full disclosure but insists upon the motion of the prosecution to trigger the reduction neither the debate nor the conference report explain the reason for the change perhaps because an accompanying change in the commentary was thought sufficient because the government is in the best pos ition to determine whet her the defendant has assisted authorities in manne r that avoids preparing for trial an adjustment under subsection b may only be granted upon form motion by the government at the time of sentencing ussg 3e11 appn 6 specific written reasons for departure prior to the act federal courts were required to explain the reasons for sentence outside the applicable guideline range 18 usc 3553c the act makes it clear that th explanation must be specific in writing and provided to the sentencing commission standards for review before the sentencing guidelines sentence within the statutory maximum imposed by federal cour t was essentially bey ond appellate review dorszynski v united states 418 us 424 431 1974 with the creation of the guidelines process congress gave both fendants and the government the opportunity to appeal sentencing decision 18 usc 3742 it in structed the appellate courts however to give due regard to the opportunity of the district court to judge the credibility of the witnesses and to accept the findings of fact of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous and to give due deference to the district courts application of the guidelines to the facts 18 usc 3742e this led the supreme court in koon v united states 518 us 81 1996 to conclude that congress intended court reviewing the decision to grant downward departure to afford the lower courts decisi on due deference in the absence of an abuse of discretion rather than to make its ow n determination of wh ether departure was appropriate novo review district courts decision to depart from the guidelines by contrast will in most cases be due substantial deference for it embodies the traditional exercise of discretion by sentencing court before departure is permitted certain aspects of the case must be found unusual enough for it to fall outside the heartland of cases in the guideline to resolve this question the district court must make refined assessment of the many facts bearing on the outcome informed by its vantage point and daytoday experience in criminal sentencing whether given factor is present to degree not adequately considered by the commission or whet her discouraged factor nonetheless justifies departure because it is present in some unusual or exceptional way are matters determined in large part by comparison with facts of other guidelin cases district courts have an institutional advantage over appellate courts in making these sorts of determinations especially as they see so many more guidelines cases that appellate courts do 518 us at 98 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21522crs6 the act establishes novo review as the st andard for review of whether departure is justified by the facts of case change it was felt that would be more effective to review illegal and in appropriate downwar d departures 149 congrec h2423 daily ed mar 27 2003remarks of rep feeney the ne w standard applies to review of upward and downward departures in all federal criminal cases resentencing after remand the act creates specific provision covering trial courts resentencing in case returned to it after its original sentencing decision has been overturned on appeal 18 usc 3742g the provision is designed to prevent sentencing courts upon re mand from imposing the same illegal departure on some different theory 149 congrec h2423 daily ed mar 27 2003remarks of rep feeney it applies in all criminal cases and to cases involving either upward or downward departures implementing studies and reports the act mandates number of reports and studies to ensure effective implementati on of its provisions it requires the chief judge of each federal judicial district to report the specifics of individual sentencing decisions handed down within the district the reports are forwarded to the sentencing commission and available to the justice department and the judiciary committees the attorney general must report all cases of downward departure other than those granted for substantial assistance as well as any determination to appeal the departure to the judiciary committees and the sentencing commission is to study the practice of downward departures and ma ke appropriate alterations in the guidelines adjustments to substantive sex offense guidelines title iv of the act also modifies the guideline for specific substantive sex ffenses section 4b15 of the guidelines provides series of minimum ffense levels for conviction of second or subsequent sex offense it also prescribes imposition of an additi onal 5 offense levels if the defendant has engaged in pattern of x offenses ussg 4b15b it defines pattern as the commission two or more sex offenses committed against two or more minor victims the act redefines pattern simply as the commission of two or more sex offenses committed against minor eliminating the requirement of multiple victims ussg 4b15 appn 4bi in addition the act amends the guidelin applicable to possession of material depicting child engaged in sexually explicit conduct adding offense vel increases if the offense involves portrayals of sadistic or masoch istic conduct add 4 ffense levels or if the offense involves possession of multiple ima ges add 2 to 5 levels depending on the number of images ussg 2g24 the act supplies similar treatment for the guideline that applies to trafficking such material except that an addition for sadistic or masochistic conduct is unnecessary because th guideline already accounts for it ussg 2g22
