country or region in the case of the first goal activities might focus on enhancing the foreign governments decisionmaking based on science and engineering information or pr oviding financial or technical aid to countrys science and engineering efforts in the case of the second goal activities might focus on challenge more visible to the public such as increasing access to water enhancing
