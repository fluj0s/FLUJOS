trade longerterm perspective summary the north american free trade agreement nafta has been in place for over three years and congress continues to evaluate it as part of the trade policy process free trade is contentious debate and has become even more complicated in the nafta context because of mexicos 1995 economic crisis many critics consider the sudden shift from surplus to deficit in the us trade balance with mexico clear indication of naftas failure others see nafta as positive force supporting us exports to sort out the effects of trade agreements this report evaluates the usmexico trade relationship over the past two decades to place recent events and nafta in broader economic context over time usmexico trade has grown and diversified as the two economies have become increasingly integrated yet trade patterns have been volatile at times for many reasons including economic downturns in mexico to understand the role of trade policy and agreements on trade flows it is instructive to compare mexicos 1982 and 1995 economic crises because in the first mexico operated under closed trade policy and in the second it had recently acceded to nafta as part of long term transition to an open trade policy both downturns had similar antecedents an overvalued peso balance of payments crisis large capital outflows and currency devaluation both were also severe but the trade effects on the united states proved much worse in the first instance with mexicos 1995 balance of payments crisis the united states saw its bilateral trade balance fall into large deficit position as it did in 1982 however us exports to mexico declined by only 11 in 1995 compared to 34 in 1982 and 23 in 1983 yet in 1995 mexicos economy had contracted more severely than earlier with gdp falling 62 compared to 06 and 43 in 1982 and 1983 critical difference in the trade effects between the two periods was mexicos change in trade policy particularly adopting nafta which kept mexico from raising barriers to us trade in response to the crisis the 1995 decline in us exports to mexico was due to the recessioninduced fall in demand and the price effects of the peso devaluation what the decline does not reflect is trade policy bent to restricting the flow of imports from the united states which was in place in 1982 but absent in 1995 nafta solidified mexican commitments to an open trade policy and actually cushioned us exports from more serious fall further the trade deficit with mexico has not been major economic problem for the united states as whole given its global trading position finally under freer trade conditions economists generally have expected us exports to mexico to recover more quickly from the 1995 decline than they did from the 1982 crisis under closed

mexican trade policy andusmexico trade longerterm perspective the north american free trade agreement nafta has been operating for over three years and congress continues to evaluate its effec ts as part of the trade policy process many hold nafta responsible for the dramatic events that unfolded in 199495 the peso devaluation mexicos economic collapse and shift from surplus to deficit in the us balance of trade with mexico on the other hand others cite nafta as major factor in opening mexican markets to us goods thereby contributing significantly to continued growth and prosperity of the us economy as is frequently the case in polarized debates neither extreme is fully vindicated by economic theory or evidence in evaluating extreme changes in trade balances between two countries it is important to understand the fundamental economic forces at work in the case of the most recent us trade deficit with mexi co two major economic questions are frequently posed first what role did trade policy and particularly nafta play in causing the sudden shift in the us trade balance with mexico second does bilateral trade deficit with mexico present major economic problem for the united states this report considers trends in usmexico merchandise trade over two decades to evaluate how nafta may have affected the economic situation in mexico and us trade to gauge the effects of the agreement it is instructive to revisit the debt crisis period of 198283 when mexico had closed trade policy and contrast it with the repercussions of the 1994 peso devaluation when mexico operated under more open trade policy what shall be seen is that trade agreements can affect the long term level of trade but do not cause sharp fluctuations in the balance of trade which are largely defined by domestic economic conditions and policies1 finally it is worth repeating that the benefits of freer trade are not measured in terms of annual trade balances but by broader economic changes that unfold over longer periods of time2httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97811crs2 3 international monetary fund direction of trade statistics june 1997 p 135 and us department of commerce trade datafigure 1 usmexico merchandise trade 19771996united statesmexico trade 19771996 the united states and mexico have had long and sometimes stormy economic relationship and so the movement toward freer trade with mexico continues to raise concerns in the united states mexicans also have expressed reservations about being overwhelmed by the economic colossus to their north because trade occurs between comparatively large and small economy there is disproportional aspect to the relationship that should be recognized the united states is by far mexicos most important trading partner accounting for approximately 83 percent of mexicos exports and 77 percent of its imports in 1996 by contrast mexico is the united states third largest trading partner but accounted for only 9 percent of us exports and imports in 19963 this is an important distinction because despite ongoing interest in the level of us exports to mexico the us economy is not greatly affected overall by the economic fortunes of mexico to the contrary because mexico is dependent on the large us economy as its primary export market it is far more vulnerable to changes in us economic trends despite this discrepancy in relative trade importance bilateral trade for the most part expanded evenly if not briskly at times over the past two decades between 1977 and 1996 trade turnover exports plus imports between the united states and mexico grew from 95 billion to 130 billion see figure 1 and appendix 1 the us balance of trade shifted back and forth from surplus to deficit reflecting changing economic fundamentals in both

frontier continuedat least four distinct periods can be seen in figure 1 first the late seventies show pattern of balanced trade growth supported in mexico by the oil boom second period followed in the 1980s characterized by decline and stagnation of trade following the global recession collapse of world oil prices and increase in world interest rates that triggered mexicos 1982 debt crisis us exports fell substantially after 1981 requiring seven years to recover beginning in 1986 third period of nearly balanced trade growth resumed largely as shall be seen because of mexicos trade reforms finally 199596 reflect mexicos most recent recession and incipient recovery although us exports to mexico plunged in 1995 they actually grew faster than us imports from mexico in 1996 and the first half of 1997 in addition to the shifting fortunes in usmexico trade over the past two decades the composition of trade between the two countries has changed rather dramatically particularly for mexican exports in the early 1980s mexico was above all else an oil exporter with oil accounting for nearly 60 percent of total export revenue see table 1 half of all oil exports went to the united states at that time major goal of mexicos trade liberalization was to diversify production and exports away from such heavy dependence on oil by 1996 although still an important sector oil production had not increased much from 1984 levels and accounted for only 12 percent of total mexican exports and 9 percent of exports to the united states see appendix 24 table 1 structural changes in mexican

mexico the mexican economy 1997 table 47 interestingly despite mexicos once heavy dependence on oil exports to the unite d states as it diversified its export base away from petroleum toward manufacturing the united states became an even more important trading partner in the early 1980s the united states accounted for 55 percent of mexicos exports this ratio rose to 65 percent in 1987 and 83 percent by 1996 some 84 percent of mexicos exports are now manufactured goods 70 percent of which end up in the united states5httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97811crs4 5 continued issue 4 1996 federal reserve bank of dallas paso branch 6 ibid 7 banco mexico the mexican economy 1997 table 47maquiladoras through joint production operations play an important role in this trade with half of all mexican manufacturing exports coming from these firms maquiladoras are domestic or foreignowned assembly plants in mexico which produce for export mostly to the united states us and mexican trade laws provided preferential treatment for imported inputs and capital goods related to maquiladora production even prior to nafta the three largest maquiladora industry sectors are electric and electronics equipment transportation equipment and textilesapparel6 on mexicos import side between 70 and 80 percent tend to be intermediate goods or goods that are further processed capital goods used to manufacture other goods account for approximately 1525 percent of mexicos imports with consumer goods ranging from 5 percent during recessions to 1520 percent during periods of economi c growth7 the dominance of intermediate goods again points to the importance of the intraindustry maquiladora relationship as partially manufactured goods are sent across the border for further assembly and then returned to the united states intermediate goods support nonmaquiladora manufacturing as well the largest categories of imports from the united states are various types of tractorautomotive and electrical parts imports from the united states are highly diversified with the top 25 import commodity groups accounting for only onethird of the total see appendix 3 economic factors affecting trade as seen above usmexico trade changed considerably over the past two decades the longterm trend has been one of growth and diversification as the two economies have become increasingly integrated yet trade has not always expanded in smooth upward direction and to discern naftas possible role in mexicos recent economic problems it is essential to understand some of the factors that affect shortterm fluctuations in trade including economic growth exchange rate policy and capital flows because events causing the collapse of the 1994 peso are reminiscent of those in 1982 and because mexico was operating under different trade policies the two periods are contrasted macroeconomic performance trade between two countries can fluctuate over the shortterm as their economies move through their respective business cycles which is particularly evident among major trading partners where economies are more highly integrated such as the united states and mexico when economies are growing demand increases including the demand for imports when economies enter recessions demand fallshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97811crs5 figure 2 real growth in mexican gdp and us exports to mexico 19781996often abruptly which also diminishes demand for imports these shortterm swings can affect trade balances irrespective of trade policy or agreements to highlight the relationship between trade and short term economic performance figure 2 contrasts real annual growth of mexicos gross domestic product gdp with real annual growth of us exports to mexico from 1978 to 1996 figure 2 shows the potential for volatility in annual bilateral trade balances based on the vagaries of the mexican business cycle in particular growth in us exports to mexico was highest in the late 1970s during period of strong economic growth 89 percent annually and decidedly negative when the economy fell on hard times in 198283 1986 and 1995 the 1996 recovery shows expected return to growth of us exports to mexico sudden declines in us exports to mexico are clearly evident for the 198283 and 1995 recessions in 1982 and 1983 mexicos gdp dipped by 06 and 42 percent respectively for total fall in gdp of nearly 5 percent over the two years at the same time us exports to mexico fell by 34 and 23 percent for total decline of approximately 50 percent in the wake of the 1994 peso devaluation mexican gdp fell 62 percent in 1995 alone the largest single year decline since the great depression and 50 percent more than in 1983 yet us exports to mexico fell only 11 percent in 1995 or about half of the decline witnessed in 1983 this suggests that in both cases the recession was an important factor affecting usmexico trade but raises an interesting question to be explored in the next section of why us exports to mexico declined much less in 1995 than might have been expected given such sharp contraction in the mexican economy and the previous experience of 198283httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97811crs6 8 because of the similarities between 1982 and 1994 emphasis is placed on the latter period prior to 1982 mexico had fixed exchange rate compared to crawling peg used prior to the 1994 devaluation for all practical purposes the crawling peg became fixed exchange rate by 1994 if not earlier so these technical differences did not affect the final outcome which was devaluation in both cases 9 not adjusting fully for the inflation difference was matter of broader and deliberate mexican policy involving wage and price controls on the pitfalls see dornbusch rudiger and alejandro werner mexico stabilization reform and growth brookings papers on economic activity 1 1994 p 27176 and dornbusch rudiger ilan goldfajn and rodrigo valdes currency crises and collapses brookings papers on economic activity 2 1995 p 25053exchange rate policy and capital flows exchange rate policy and capital flows can exert major influence on trade balances over the long run stable and predictable exchange rates promote confidence in the future value of countrys currency which in turn encourages trade and investment and discourages speculation and the potential for sudden large shifts in the flow of capital exchange rate stability however is not always easy to achieve in floating exchange rate system market forces determine the exchange rate in fixed exchange rate system policy sets the value of countrys currency in keeping with broader economic goals both can generate stability but in mexicos case its fixed exchange rate policy became suspect in 1994 when very large inflows of foreign capital caused the peso to become overvalued and mexican economic policy did not make the necessary adjustments8 in 1987 as part of longterm antiinflation policy mexico pegged the nominal or current market value of the peso to the dollar and then in 1989 adopted crawling peg exchange rate the crawling aspect of this concept refers to what amounts to constant nominal minidevaluation of the currency ideally at rate that would be equal to the inflation differential with the country to which the peso is pegged the united states in 1991 mexico employed band or defined trading range within which the peso could be traded while continuing the regular mini devaluation by widening the band when country pegs its currency exchange rate credibility rests on adopting macroeconomic policies similar to those of the country to which the currency is pegged the united states to avoid currency misalignments policy coordination is all the more critical in mexicos case because the united states is both its primary trading partner and much larger economy two problems often emerge when country adopts fixed exchange rate both of which can raise the specter of devaluation first when the difference in inflation rates is not fully closed the real value adjusted for inflation of the pegged currency tends to appreciate as the real value of the peso appreciates the nominal value becomes increasingly less credible raising concerns about possible devaluation9httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97811crs7 10 dornbusch goldfajn and valdes ibid p 240 it has been argued that had mexico been able to retain international credibility in its antiinflationary policy it might have avoided this latest crisis see obstfeld maurice and kenneth rogoff the mirage of fixed exchange rates journal of economic perspectives v 9 fall 1995 p 84 11 1994 was the turnaround year the 76 billion in portfolio capital is deceptive because it reflects an inflow of capital at the beginning of the year followed by large capital outflow the rest of the yearthe second and related problem arises when domestic economic policy diverges from that of the country to which the peso is pegged which as mentioned above raises questions about the credibility of maintaining the fixed nominal exchange rate in 1982 mexicos economic policies were overtly expansionary contributing to inflation the peso appreciation and impending crisis similarly in mid1994 the mexican government adopted looser fiscal and monetary policies albeit rather subtly as matter of presidential politics if macroeconomic policy becomes expansionary and relatively more expansionary than in the united state s which was actually moving in the opposite direction with the federal reserve raising interest rates throughout 1994 then the inflationary gap between the united states and mexico discussed above grows and the nominal fixed exchange rate becomes suspect10 capital flows into mexico were also driving force that led to the overvalued currency rising current account deficit and mexicos financial problems within the context of pegged exchange rate system as mexico recovered from the debt crisis of the 1980s and adopted marketbased economic reforms investors came to believe that longterm stable growth might once again be possible with rising interest in the potential for large returns in socalled emerging markets investors committed capital generously capital investment began to trickle into mexico in 1989 and as documented in table 2 rushed in thereafter until 199411 table 2 net capital flows into mexico 198995 billions invest type 1989 1990 1991 1992

474 other currency and deposits loans and trade credits when capital moves into country that maintains fixed exchange rates the domestic money supply increases prices tend to rise and the exchange rate tends to appreciate the real appreciation of the peso lowered the price of imports and raised the price of exports so mexico began to run large trade and current account deficits that matched the capital inflows when circumstances change capital flows can suddenly slow or reverse themselves particularly portfolio capital stocks and bondshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97811crs8 12 one view argues that an extremely high level of capital inflows particularly in small economy is simply not realistic equilibrium level over the long run and should be treated as shortterm phenomenon at the outset see edwards sebastian comments and discussion brookings papers on economic activity 2 1995 p 277 13 for summary of events see us library of congress congressional research service mexico chronology of

foreign investment plant and equipment the sudden reversal of capital flows in 1994 presented serious problems for mexico because it then had large current account deficit an overvalued exchange rate and insufficient foreign exchange reserves to defend the exchange rate which was under downward pressure from the massive capital outflows12 in addition to exchange rate policy and capital flows noneconomic factors sparked capital flight from mexico concern over political stability was key issue leading to investor uneasiness in january 1994 peasant revolt occurred in the state of chiapas march proved to be an even more unsteady month with the assassination of presidential candidate these events triggered major speculative attack on the peso in late march which mexico defended by selling its foreign exchange reserves further political turmoil led to final run on the peso in november 1994 as the fear of devaluation spread13 economic policy although changing economic and political events shocks encouraged capital flight it was mexicos economic policy that doomed the peso to devaluation rising us interest rates were responsible in part for the initial decline in capital inflows mexico would have had to tighten its monetary policy in like manner to continue to attract capital but during an election year mexico found it difficult to raise interest rates to maintain its relative competitiveness in the international capital market in effect it longer subordinated domestic monetary and fiscal policy to the maintenanc of fixed exchange rate with the united states14 this decision was tantamount to allowing higher inflation relative to the united states which with pegged exchange rate meant that the real appreciation of the peso would accelerate to potentially untenable levels further exacerbating the current account deficit at this point mexico faced three unattractive options 1 raise interest rates to match us policy and continue to attract or slow the retreat of foreign capital 2 devalue the peso or 3 do nothing to buy time but risk more severe financial difficulty in the future option one proved unacceptable because it risked almost sure recession prior to presidential election option two was apparently debated but discarded because mexico staked its economic reputation on defending the peso15 option three unfolded by defaulthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97811crs9 16 tesobonos grew from 6 percent of total public sector internal debt in april 1994 to 55 percent by the time the peso was devalued in december they proved to be only stopgap measure in the attempt to halt capital flight 17 anticipation of nafta however may have contributed to the high expectations that drove large capital flows into mexico after 1989 18 us library of congress congressional research service mexican financial crises 1982 and 1995 similarities and differences report 95239 by patricia wertman 6 pinvestors both foreign and domestic actually realized the tenuous nature of the peso in 1994 and began abandoning it when given the opportunity to move toward shortterm dollarindexed investment instrument known as the tesobono 16 this amounted to currency flight prior to the final capital flight that occurred in november and december when investors finally fled in late 1994 mexico defended its currency with foreign reserves as long as it could before devaluing and eventually floating the peso mexicos refusal to face the inconsistency of its macroeconomic and exchange rate policies helped cause the pesos undoing under adverse condit ions mexico could not continue to peg the peso to the dollar and follow divergent macroeconomic policy from the united states when an adjustment did not occur it was only time before markets forced the pesos devaluation the unresolved debate over the proper mexican response continues and the two main camps are mexico should have tightened fiscal and monetary policies to avoid devaluation or it should have devalued the peso much earlier and accepted the consequences before they became so severe in any event as mexico was forced to adjust to dwindling capital its trade deficit had to correct so exports rose and imports fell accordingly the balance of trade with the united states went from surplus to deficit the key points are that the seeds of this broad problem were planted years before nafta was contemplated and that the final collapse of the peso resulted more from domestic economic rather than trade policy reasons17 in fact mexico faced this problem in 1982 under closed trade policy and again in 1994 under more open trade policy mexican trade policy the preceding discussion points to many interconnected economic factors that can disrupt longterm trade patterns the effect of mexican trade reform by contrast should be evident over longer periods of time and promote stability in trade relations to recap in 198283 and 1995 mexico experienced severe recessions see figure 2 both were similar in that they were preceded by an overvalued peso balance of payments crisis capital outflows and major devaluation causing us exports to fall18 one of the critical variables that differed between the two setbacks was trade policy as will be shown more open policy in 1995 solidified by nafta and gatt had significant effect on the macroeconomic situation given other factors but had noticeable trade effect by keeping mexico from imposing import restrictions on the united states as it did in 1982httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97811crs10 19 lustig nora mexico the remaking of an economy

continuedclosed trade policy and the 1982 crisis prior to the 1982 crisis the mexican economy was considerably more closed to trade than it was in 1995 mexico had long followed an import substitution approach to development which by mainta ining high tariffs and other barriers to imports protected domestic industry from foreign competition in 1981 the average tariff rate was 27 percent 83 percen t of imports required licenses and domestic content requirements covered key industries such as automobile and computer manufacturing the sole purpose of these policies was to restrict imports in order to facilitate domestic industrial development in mexico given the wealth effect of new found oil reserves in the late 1970s there was little financial or political pressure to change policies19 as the 1980s approached mexicos economy continued to grow based on heavy external borro wing backed by seemingly unlimited oil revenues resulting in large current account deficits the 1982 balance of payments crisis occurred because mexico overborrowed and could not meet growing international debt service payments when world interest rates rose and oil prices plummeted mexico devalued the peso twice in 1982 and immediately faced economic decline inflation climbed to nearly 100 percent and economic growth fell by nearly 5 percent over two years20 to resume meeting its debt obligations mexico raised barriers to imports in order to earn foreign exchange the primary tool was the import license permiso previo which in 1982 was extended to 100 percent of imports exchange rate controls were also introduced and tariffs raised but as one experienced observer has pointed out under this import structure it was fatuous to speak of average tariffs levels in mexico denial of permiso previo was the equivalent of an infinite tariff21 the result for the united states was huge fall in exports to mexico as seen in figure 2 trade reform in the 1980s despite the initial strengthening of import barriers one outcome of the debt crisis was reform in mexican trade policy mexico began gradual unilateral reductions in trade barriers after 1982 these accelerated after 1985 when mexico made overt moves to integrate itself more completely with the world economic system by becoming member of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt in 1986 and the organization for economic cooperation and development in 1994 becoming party to nafta was also logical step in this progression22httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97811crs11 22 continued important areas are still protected and will be opened up under

licenses from 100 percent of imports in 1982 to 36 percent in 1985 27 percent in 1986 and 22 percent by the end of 1988 mexico also simplified its tariff schedules with maximum tariffs falling from 100 percent in 1982 to 20 percent in 1988 the tradeweighted average tariff rate continued downward and today stands at approximately 10 percent 5 percent under nafta by 1987 these and other policy changes transformed mexico from an extremely closed economy into one of the most open ones in the world23 all this transpired seven years before nafta took effect because mexico instituted major trade policy reform before entry into nafta the trade agreement may be seen as the continuation of longterm process at least as it affects the united states and canada under nafta mexicos few remaining import license requirements were converted to system of tariffrate quotas that will be phased out tariff rates remain low and will also disappear as the free trade agreement is fully implemented importantly as shall be seen nafta consolidated mexicos position on free trade with the united states the effect of mexicos trade liberalization on its trade volume with the world is easily documented from 1982 to 1996 mexican exports grew from 241 to 960 billion or nearly 300 percent perhaps most telling is that oil as percent of total exports fell from 776 to 126 percent over the same time period mexican imports rose over 400 percent from 170 to 895 billion24 because the united states is mexicos most important trading partner shifts in trade policy are particularly noticeable in the bilateral trade data as seen in figure 1 the level of trade between the united states and mexico experienced steady growth between 1983 the beginning of mexican trade policy reform and 1994 nafta both imports and exports rose dramatically at time when the mexican economy grew at an average annual rate of only 2 percent in fact real gdp per capita had not grown at all25httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97811crs12 26

tpis data in table 3 also show the growing importance of us trade to mexicos economy in 1982 total trade between the united states and mexico or trade turnover imports plus exports equaled 157 percent of mexicos gdp and us exports to mexico alone amounted to 67 percent of its gdp by 1994 these ratios rose to 268 and 136 percent respectively clearly trade with the united states has become more important part of mexicos economy this growth in the level and importance of trade is what would be expected of freer trade policies and it is coincidence that this growth occurred precisely at the same time that mexican trade policy reforms were implemented26 the large jump in these ratios for 1996 reflect these same trends but also the effect of the 1995 recession on gdp which served to lower the ratios denominator open trade policy and the 1995 crisis the details of the economic crisis in 1995 differed from 1982 in some respects but mexico faced the same fundamental problem the inability to cover its international obligations by 1995 the large trade and current account deficits had to be corrected and as mexicos largest trading partner the united states saw its bilateral trade balance reverse to large deficit position mexican imports to the united states contin ued to climb as us exports to mexico fell however us exports declined by only about 11 percent in 1995 as mentioned above this was much smaller decrease than experienced in 1982 34 percent and 1983 23 percent despite much larger contraction in mexicos economy the difference points to mexicos more open trade policy including acceding to nafta which kept mexico from raising barriers to us trade in response to the crisis hence the decline in exports represents the fall in demand that accompanied the deep recession and the effects of the peso devaluation as would be expected what the decline does not reflect is formal policy to restrict the flow of imports from the united states which was in place in 1982 but absent in 1995 nafta for its part helped solidify mexican commitments to an open trade policy and actually cushion united states exports from tariff increases ranging from 20 to 35 percent that mexico imposed on many goods from countries with which it had equivalenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97811crs13 27 united states trade representative 1996 foreign trade barriers washington dc p 239 28 tornell

the entire us trade deficit see us library of congress congressional research service us trade performance recent trends and policy options report 97487 by craig k elwell april 24 1997agreement the us trade deficit therefore was smaller than it might have been under less open trade regime27 in fact it has been argued that this is one of the more important achievements of nafta not only could mexico not fall back on protectionist trade regime but it is committed to continuing liberalization of trade policies in agriculture services and other areas28 although this is scant comfort to those who are concerned with trade deficit with mexico bilateral deficit is not major economic problem for the united states given its broad global trade relationships29 additionally under freer trade conditions economists generally expected us exports to mexico to recover more quickly than they did from the 1982 crisis under closed mexican trade policy which figure 1 and appendix 1 suggest has so far been the case conclusions and outlook mexico remains natural and over the long run growing market for us goods which will become more evident as the mexican economy recovers and the longterm trend of trade and investment growth reemerges as it appears to be doing this is trend that has been evident for decades and one that is dependent on mexicos economic stability and its willingness to maintain an open trade policy an option for which nafta may serve as an insurance policy the mexican case supports the contention that trade liberalization relativ to closed trade policy supports growth in trade and provides greater stability during times of economic setbacks other things being equal one problem is that other things are not always equal and it is these other things economic and political shocks that often cause shortterm disruptions to longterm trade trend s mexico periodically experiences macroeconomic problems that are common among developing economies and in 1994 mexico repeated many mistakes made in 1982 except for trade policy its primary economic policies focus on resolving such basic problems as tempering runaway inflatio n maintaining stable exchange rate managing current account balances and attempting to achieve long term savings rates necessary for development mexico like most developing countries looks abroad for resources to take up any slack in domestic savings given mexicos tendencies toward exchangerate and indebtedness problems often exacerbated by policy decisions balance of payment or liquidity problems can arise periodically that eventually disrupt trade and investment flows importantly these problems can arise under either an open or closed trade regimehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97811crs14 although trade policy can encourage trade growth over the long run it is only one economic policy tool and not the most influential in managing macroeconomic problems in this case trade agreement such as nafta was not the cause of mexicos 1995 recession but it was able to reduce although not eliminate the recessions negative trade effects on the united states only with mexicos recovery which depends more on mexico than trade agreeme nt will us export growth continue its upward climb finally it is worth reiterating the limitations of trade agreements they are intended to reduce barriers to trade and encourage growth in trade between countries this has occurred with mexico and the united states trade agreements however cannot guarant ee any particular balance of trade between countries nor can they guarantee that all businesses will prosper they do hold out the promise that business and trade success or failure will be less affected by deliberate policies to block imports as was evident in mexico in 1982 but not 1995 despite the doubts voiced by many over nafta moving back to more closed trade posture with mexico not only would risk losing broader gains from freer trade but also would not guarantee the united states of being insula ted from mexican economic problems as comparison of the 1982 and 1994 crises demonstrateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97811crs15 appendix 1 us merchandise trade with mexico 19771997 millions
