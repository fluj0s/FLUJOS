families act summary in response to rising numbers of childre n in foster care and concerns about the safety of children that remain with or return to their families after placement in foster care the 105th congress enacted the adoption nd safe families act of 1997 asfa pl 10589 with two primary goals 1 to ensure that consideration of childrens safety is paramount in child welfare deci sions so that children are not returned to unsafe homes and 2 to ensure that necessa ry legal procedures occur expeditiously so that children who cannot return home may be placed for adoption or another permanent arrangement quickly asfa is considered the most sweeping change in federal child welfare law in nearly 20 years most provisions in the 1997 law amended titles ivb or ive of the social security act which authorize grants to states for child welfare activities including foster care and adoption assistance in fy2004 titles ivb and ive received appropriations totaling 76 billion as acted in 1980 pl 96272 the underlying law requires states to make reasonable fforts on behalf of abused and neglected children or children at risk of abuse and ne glect to ensure that services are provided to their families so they can remain safely at home or return home if they have been placed in foster care states also must conduct administrative and court hearings on every childs case according to prescrib ed timetable and establish permanent placement plan for each child periodically since pl 96272 was enacted concern arose that some states and judges interpreted the federal child welfare laws as requiring family preservation and reunification at all costs including in cases where the childs health or safety was in jeopardy asfa was intended to clarify federal policy to ensure safety for children who come into contact with the child welfare system moreover asfa was intended to expedite permanency for foster ch ildren and to promote adoption for those children who cannot safely return home since 1997 all states have enacted their own laws to implement parts of asfa and the federal department of health and human services hhs has issued regulations to implement certain provisions of the 1997 law acting on 1994 legislative directive pl 103432 hhs also initiated review system in 2001 to monitor state compliance with federal child welfare laws including the provisions

longstanding barriers remain gao02585 us general accounting office june 2002child welfare implementation of the adoption and safe families act introduction in the mid1980s the number of children in foster care began to climb sharply while the number of children who were adopted from foster care remained static most children who enter foster care eventually return to their families but concern developed in the 1990s about the growin g number of children who did not return home and were remaining in foster care for long periods of time at the same time there was growing perception that federal law needed clarification regarding the importance of child safety these factors prompted the 105th congress to enact legislation with two primary goals 1 to ensure that consideration of childrens safety is paramount in child welfare deci sions so that children are not returned to unsafe homes and 2 to ensure that necessa ry legal procedures occur expeditiously so that children who cannot return home may be placed for adoption or another permanent arrangement quickly the adoption and safe families act asfa pl 10589 was enacted in november 1997 and is considered the most sweeping change in federal child welfare law since 1980 when the current configurati on of federal child we lfare programs was established since 1997 all states have acted their own laws to implement parts of asfa in january 2000 the federal partment of health and human services hhs issued regulations to implement cer tain provisions of the 1997 law and acting on 1994 congressional directive pl 103432 to establish review system to monitor state compliance with federal child welfare laws including asfa provisions hhs also has issued several reports that were ma ndated by asfa and has awarded six rounds of annual incentive pa yments also authorized by asfa and subsequently reauthorized in 2003 to stat that increased th eir numbers of foster child and special needs child adoptions this report provides

httpwwwncslor gprogramscyfasfaslrhtmfamily preservation and reunification at all costs including in cases where the childs health or safety was in jeopardy the adoption and safe families act was intended to clarify federal policy to ensure safety for children who come into contact with the child welfare system moreover in res ponse to concern about the growing numbers f children in foster care starting in the late 1980s and continuing through the 1990s asfa was intended to expedite permanen cy for foster children and to promote adoption for those children w ho cannot safely return home the 1997 law established significant new procedural require ments to promote safety and expedite permanency whic h the congressional budget office cbo estimated would save federal money by shortening the time that some children spend in foster care at the same time the new law also contained some spending provisions these included financial incentive payments to states that increased their numbers of adoptions from foster care requirement that states provide health insurance coverage to special needs adopted children who are not eligible for federal subsidies provision that continued eligibility for federal subsidies to special needs children whose adoptions are disrupted and reauthorization and expansion of the family preservation program under title ivb cbo estima ted the net cost of pl 10589 at 40 million over fiveyear period to offset these costs the law reduced spending for the contingency fund unde r the temporary assistance for needy families tanf block grant provisions of the adopti on and safe families act child safety provisions the adoption and safe families act amended the existing federal child welfare law to require that childs health and safety be of paramount concern in any efforts made by the state to preserve or reunify the childs family and to provide new assurances that children in foster care are safe reasonable efforts to preserve families states continue to be required to make reasonable efforts to avoid the need to place children in foster care and to return them home if they are removed but asfa established exceptions to this requirement specifically states ar not required to make efforts to preserve or reunify family if court finds that parent has killed another of his or her children or committed felony assault against the child or sibling or if his or her parental rights to another child were prev iously involuntarily terminated according to the national conference of state legislatures ncsl which tracked the enactment of state laws to implement asfa most states incorporated these exceptions in their statutes4 in addition the federal law established th at efforts to preserve or reunify family are not required if the court finds that parent has subjected the child to aggravated circumstances each state may define these circumstances in its own laws although asfa cites abandonment tort ure chronic abuse and sexual abuse as examples moreover pl 10589 states that it does not preclude individual judges from using their discretion to protect childs health and safety in any casehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30759crs4 5 in his 2000 campaign website thencandidate bush indicated th at he would propose elimination of the current law provision that llows states to opt out of the criminal record check requirement according to hhs all stat that opt out of the provision do perform criminal background checks but not necessarily in the way prescribed by asfa in general these states allow agency or court personnel discretion to approve certain prospective caregivers with criminal histor ies that would preclude appr oval under the asfa standards pl 10836 requires states later than june 2005 to do criminal background checks for continuedregardless of whether the specific circumstances are cited in federal law at the same time the federal law does not prohibit states from making efforts to preserve or reunify family in any case according to ncsl the aggravated circumstances most typically included in state definitions are those lis ted in the federal law as of august 1999 some states also included other circumstances such as physical abuse assau lt or battery of child 21 states serious or chroni c neglect 14 states discre tion of the court 14 states

easonable efforts to prevent removal or reunification are not required must be explicitly documented and made on casebycase basis the regulations also state that such findings must be made within 60 days of the childs removal from home criminal background checks to further promote safety the 1997 law required that states conduct criminal back ground checks for all prospective foster or adoptive parents and deny appr oval to anyone who has ever been convicted of felony child abuse or neglect spousal abuse crime against children including child pornography or violent crime including rape sexual assault or homicide in addition states must deny approval to an yone with felony conviction for physical assault battery or drugrela ted offense if the felony occurred within the past five years states may opt out of the asfa criminal record check provisions either through letter from the states governor to the secretary of hhs or through legislation enacted by the state legislat ure according to hhs as of august 2004 three states idaho oklahoma and oregon had opted out through enactment of legislation and six states arizona california new yor k massachusetts nebraska and ohio opted out through letter from their governors in final regulations issued on january 25 2000 hhs requires states to document th at criminal records checks have been conducted if the state opts out of the specific asfa require ment the regulations specify that licensing files for foster or adoptive family or for child care institution must document that safety c onsiderations have been addressed

rl32430 by kendall swensonasfa also required states to develop standards to ensure quality services that protect the health and safety of childre n in foster care with public and private agencies these standards are in addition to licensing requirements that were already established under title ive finally the law added references to child safety in various sections of titles ivb and ive timeframe provisions asfa requires states to meet variety of deadlines regarding child welfare cases these include deadlines for permanency hearings and initiation of proceedings to terminate parental rights reasonable efforts to promote doption if the court finds that efforts to preserve or reunify family are not required asfa specifies that permanency hearing formerly called dispositional hearing must be held for the child within 30 days of that court finding in these cases or whenever childs permanency plan is adopti on or another alternative to family reunification the law requires states to make reasonable efforts to place the child in timely manner in accordance with the permanency plan wh ich may include placement for adoption with guardian or in anot her planned permanent arrangement hhs specified in the january 2000 regulations that states must obtain judicial determination that such reasonable efforts were made within 12 months of the date the child entered foster care and at least once every subsequent 12 months that the child remains in care the law further provides that states must document specific efforts made to place the child for adoption in enacting these pr ovisions congress intended to shorten the length of time that children spend in foster care once court has determined that family reunification is not feasible or likely asfa also specifies that efforts to preserve or reunify family can be made at the same time as efforts are being ma to place the child for adoption or guardianship this practice is referred to as concurrent planni ng and allows states to develop backup plan in order to save time in the event that efforts to restore the original family are unsuccessful the adoption and safe families act also contains provisions intended to eliminate interjurisdictional issues as pot ential barrier to childs adoption first the law requires states to assure in their title ivb plans that they will develop plans to make effective use of cr ossjurisdictional resources to facilitate timely adoptions for waiting children as originally enacted the law also denied federal foster care and adoption assistance funding under

rather than complete denial of funding in cases of such violations hhs released program instruction in october 2002 to further clarify the regulations on in terjurisdictional adoptions including how penalties would be assessed6 in addition asfa directed the general accounting office gao to conduct study of interjur isdictional adoption issues including the implementation of the inte rstate compact on the placement of children gaos report was published in november 19997 additional legisl ation was considered during the 108th congress to improve and expedite interstate placements8 permanency hearings prior to the enactment of asfa federal law required that all foster children have judicial hearing known as dispositional hearing within 18 months of their placement in care to determine their future status pl 10589 now requires this hearing to occu r within 12 months of the date the child is determined to have entered care and changed the name to permanency hearing asfa also requires that foster parents preadoptive parents and relative caregivers be given notice and an opportunity to be heard at case reviews and permanency hearings the law revised the list of permanency goals which had included longterm foster care to include returning home referral for adopti on and termination of parental rights tpr guardianship placement with relative or as last resort another planned permanent living arrangement in its january 2000 regulations hhs specified that states must document compelling reason for selecting another planned permanent living arrangement and gave the following examples of such compelling reasons an older teen specifically requests permanency plan of emancipation from foster care parent and child are strongly bonded but the parent cannot care for the child because of an emotional or physical disability and the childs foster parents have agreed to raise the child to maturity and to enable visits with the natural parent tribe has identified another pla nned permanent living arrangement for the child hhs also specified in its regulations that the written case plan for child be developed within reasonable period estab lished by the state but later than 60 days after the childs removal from home if the childs permanency plan is family reunification the regulations require that the case plan describe how the state will achieve safe placement for the child in the most familylike setting in closehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30759crs7 proximity to the childs parents for all children the case plan must describe how the placement is consistent with the childs best interests and special needs termination of parental rights one of the most significant provisions of the 1997 law requires states to initiate pro ceedings for the termination of parental rights tpr for certain foster children this provision responded to concerns about the number of children who were remaining in foster care for long periods of time and who were not likely to return home prior to 1997 there was comparable provision in federal law specifically pl 10589 require s states to initiate tpr proceedings in any case where the court s found that parent has lost parental rights to that childs sibling killed another of his or her children or committed felony assault against the child or sibling or subjected the child to aggravated circumstances known as the fast track pr ovision or for infa nts deter mined under state law to be abandoned in addition the law requires states to initiate tpr proceedings for children who have been in foster care for 15 of the most recent 22 months known as the 15 of 22 provision states can opt not to initiate such proceedings if the child is in relatives care or if the state agency has documented in the childs case plan compelling reason to determine that tpr would not be in the childs best interest or if the state has not provided necessary services to the family regulations issued by hhs on january 25 2000 require that states must file the tpr petition by the end of the childs 15th month in care and provide methodology for calculating when this date occurs fo r example trial home visits or runaway episodes are not counted toward the 15 months the regulation also specifies that if the state decides not to initiate tpr pro ceedings at the 15month point with regard to particular child because an exception ex ists in that childs case as allowed under the law then the state does not need to apply the 15month tpr requirement to that childs case again in the case of an abandoned child the regulations require the state to initiate tpr proceedings within 60 days of court determination that the child is abandoned as defined by the individual state likewi in the case of child whose parent has been convicted of felony specified in the law the re gulations require the state to initiate tpr proceedings within 60 days of court determination that reasonable efforts to reunite the child with that parent are not required as stated above the law allows but does not require certain exceptions to the tpr requirement including that there is compelling reason for determining that such proceedings are not in the childs best interests the january 25 2000 regulations give the following examples of compelling reasons adoption is not the appropriate permanency goal for the child there are grounds for tpr the child is an unaccompanied refugee minor there are international legal obligations or compelling foreign policy reasons that preclude tprhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30759crs8 9 foster care recent legislation helps st ates focus on finding permanent homes for children but longstanding barriers remain gao02585 us government accounting office june 2002 10 for example massachusetts officials reporte d that in most cases children are removed from the home after the crime is committed but judges will not approve fast track for these cases until the parent is convicted of the crime which often takes at least year after the crime was committedthe law and regulations also provide that whenever state initiates tpr proceedings it must concurrently begin to seek and approve qualified adoptive family for the child for children who entered foster care af ter the enactment of pl 10589 states were required to comply with the tpr provision later than three months after the end of the first state legislative session that began after the date of enactment which was november 19 1997 for children who already were in care on the date of enactment states could phase in compliance with the tpr requirement but had to be in compliance for all children by later than 18 months after the end of the legislative session for purposes of the tpr provision and the 12month permanency hearing children are considered to have entered foster care on the first date that the court finds they have been subjected to ch ild abuse or neglect or 60 days after their removal from home whichever occurs first state implementation of timeframe provisions in 2002 the general accounting office gao published repor t on the implementation of asfa and its effects on the child welfare system9 the report cautioned that there was limited information on these provisions due to lack of data all six states in which gao conducted site visits reported that the asfa timeframe provisions helped their child welfare agencies focus on more quickly finding permanent homes for children some child welfare agency staff stated that the timeframes helped them work more effectively with parents by being able to inform them of the steps and timelines in the reunification process some states and agencies expressed concern though that the timeframes may rush the adoption or reunification process and lead to high er reentry rates into foster care the gao study also found that few states were using the fast track provision due to variety of courtrela ted issues such as judges or legal officials who are at times reluctant to approve fast track request and difficulty in scheduling tpr hearings other reported difficulties in utilizing the fast track option included fathers rights issues the desire to give parent another opport unity to demonstrate the ability to care for subsequent child and the length of time from childs removal from the home to parents conviction of an applicable crime10 some states reported using the fast track provisi on in cases of infant abandonment or cases involving serious abuse stat are not required to collect data on their use of the fast track provision and most states are not collecting this data similarly to the fast track provision states are not required to collect data on the 15 of 22 provision and few states

adoption and safe families act originally established incentive payments equal to 4000 for each foster child whose adoption was finalized over certain base level and 6000 for each special needs adop

of appropriations for adoption incentive payments is somewhat complicated because states as group exceeded lawmakers expectations and finalized more adoptions in the early years of the program than congress had anticipate d pl 10589 originally authorized appropriations of 20 milli on annually for fy1999 through fy2003 for adoption incentive payments for adoptions finalized in fiscal years 1998

subsequent years appropriations bills to able hhs to pay states the full amount of incentive payments earned see table 1 below also in each years appropriations law congress has limited the availab ility of these funds to certain years even though the authorizing law provides that appropria ted amounts shall rema in available for allocation to the states until expended state implementation gao 2002 report and cornerstone consulting group study indicate that stat most commonly use thei r incentive awards to fund the recruitment of adoptive families and provide postadoptive services25 some states reported using their incentive funds for onetime expenses such as studies training events and the purchase of legal services due to the uncertainty of receiving future adoption incentive awards additionally states reported that because the awards were relatively small compared to their overall child welfare budgets they were able to use their funds in innovative and flexible manners state reported that the adoption incentive bonus was the primary motivator for improving its adoption system the primary concerns of states regarding the incentives were that they may give the impression that adoption is the best plan in all cases that states with increased adoptions before asfa may have trouble exceeding their baselines this concern was expressed before the 2003 reauthorization upda ted the baselines and that the law did not make further change s in the structure of federal funding for child welfarehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30759crs15 26 this program was completely revised in the

as result of the adoption and safe families act researchers have had difficulty judging asfas effects on the child welfare system many states had already begun to make ad justments to their systems before 1997 and some had previously enacted laws similar to asfa this has made it difficult to determine how much of the shift in child welfare outcomes and data was due to asfa or other state and fe deral laws and programs28 the lack of comparable and reliable pre and postasfa data also limits the analysis of asfas effects for example gao 2002 not ed that the university of chicago collected preasfa ch ild welfare data for several states but this data cannot be matched with data from hhs because of differences in the measurement techniques additionally child ren often remain in foster care for several years before being adopted and therefore evidence of the effects of the 1997 enactment of asfa were not necessarily immediately apparent nonetheless current data can provide useful
