july 26 2002 president bush indicated that he would sign the measure into law within few days the cornerstone of us securities regulation is disclosure according to this approach the best way to protect i nvestors from fraud hype and irrational exuberance is to require companies selling stocks and bonds to the public to disclosedetailed information about their financial strengths and weaknesses withoutcomplete and accurate information investor s cannot make rational decisions and the market cannot allocate funds to the most productive users illinformed investment choices hurt individual investors but ther are also costs to the national economy in terms of wasted resources jobs not creat ed and innovations forgone if investors decide they cannot trust corporate disclosu res they will be less likely to buy stocks and bonds raising the cost of capital for ll firms good and bad since the markets peak in early 2000 us stocks have lost about 7 trillion in value the share prices of firms that fail to meet their own profit projections or wall streets expectations are apt to plummet the desire to avoid or postpone stock market losses creates apowerful incentive for
