bombers we re designed during the cold war to deliver nuclear strikes agains t the soviet union althoug h they can be vulnerable to enemy defenses if detected they combine the ability to fly extended distances much farther than most other comb at aircraft with the ability to carry weapons payloads many times larger than that of fighters ov er the past decade the air force has taken advantage of these characteristics by migrating its bomber fleet from nuclear to conventional role today the air force maintains three bombers the b1b the b2 and the b52 and each has been outfitted with variety of precision and dumb weapons for conventional strikes in recen t conflicts in afghan istan 2001 and iraq 2003 bombers have play ed prominent roles questions remain however about where bombers fit into air force spending priorities some argue that because bombe rs can be vulnerable against advanced air defenses scarce resources are best spent on other programs that can address the full spectrum of potential future conflicts such as the fa22 raptor others counter that the range and payload of the bombers many times that of fighters like the fa22 make them extremely valuable and believe that modernizing them building additional aircraft and developing nextgeneration bomber s hould be top budget priorities decisions in congress and the departme nt of defense regarding bombers may have important longterm implications ach of the three bombers is in need of expensive upgrades and decisions about the funding of these upgrades may affect the continued utility of these aircraft s econd debate has arisen over whether to expand or contract the bomber fleet third military observers and policymakers disagree about when to begin nextgener ation bomber program some push to begin new program immediately while others advocate waiting decade or more before initiating development of new bomber this report discusses the background stat us and current issues surrounding the air forces

dclongrange bombers background and issues for congress background during the cold war the primary missi on of longrange bombers was to deter nuclear attack on the united states by threatening the soviet union with retaliation manned bombers the airborne g of the us strategic triad were designated as secondstrike force that would hit back afte r soviet attack in the cold warera policy makers envisioned fleet of over four hundred bombers enabling the united states to overwhelm perceived ongoing improvements in soviet air defenses during the late 1980s and early 1990s th end of the cold war and the breakup of the soviet union led policymakers to r econsider the value of bombers at the same time us economic recessi on led to military spending cuts because bombers are among the most expensive systems in the air force inventory they were ripe targets for funding cuts during this period the planned procurement of b2s was reduced many b52s were retired nd an ongoing debate began about retiring number of b 1s in 1992 the bomber force was combined w ith other powerprojecting assets of the air force when strategic air command and tactical air command merged to form air combat command acc according to the air force this restructuring reflected an integrated way of thinking about air power the role of longrange bombers within the acc is to combine mass large payloads reach long range and immediacy quick response with th ability to conduct precision strikes with nonnuclear weapons today the united states air force maintains three longrange bombers the venerable b52 stratofortress the supersonic b1b lancer and the stealthy b2 spirit table 1 lists the characteristics of each since the end of the cold war their primary mission has shifted from nuclear deterrence to conventional bombing and all three have been reconfigured to carry variety of modern conventional bombs and airtosurface missiles since the debut of precision weapons in the late 1990s the bombers have seen their role increase w ith bombers increasingly used for precision strikes and close air support to us nd allied ground forces despite the shift to conventional missions some bom bers retain nuclear capab ilities the b2 is certified to deliver nuclear weapons and twelve b52s are held ready for nuclear missions1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31544crs2 in 1999 the three bombers were used toge ther for the first time in air strikes against yugoslavia under natos operation allied force the b2 bomber made its operational debut flying to yugoslavia from whiteman air force base in missouri all

widely praised role in the recent operations in afghanistan 2001 and iraq 2003 there is little consensus among military leaders and policymakers regarding the future of longrange bombers while some advocate increasing todays bomber fleet and be ginning development of new bomber immediately others are pushing to cut th fleet and postpone new bomber program supporters point to bombers ability to ca rry massive weapons payloads to loiter over battlefields for long periods of time and to strike targets around the globe from bases in the continental united states detractors contend that large lumbering bombers are vulnerable to enemy air defenses including surfacetoair missiles as well as enemy fighters in the highthr eat environments for which the air force plans the role of most bombers would be reduced and fighterst rike aircraft which are more survivable but have much shor ter range and fraction of the payload would have to take up the slack bomber advocates counter that the conflicts the united states has faced in recent years and those it is most likely to face in the foreseeable future would not involve hight hreat environments and that even if theyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31544crs3 did bombers would likely play an important role once enemy air defenses have been destroyed moreover they say bombers should be upgraded so they can penetrate advanced air defenses at issue then is what priority to give bombers in the overall defense budget advocates argue that the united states doe s not have enough bombers that they are not being modernized quickly enough and that the air force needs to begin investing in next generation bomber immediately there are currently open production lines for bombers although some have dvocated for reopening production of b2 stealth bombers bomber tractors believe that defens dollars are better spent elsewhere on programs that address the full spectrum of missions the air force might confront not just the lowthreat environments faced in afghanistan and iraq these detractors say that even though th bombers performed well in afghanistan and iraq those conflicts we re anomalies the former was among the poorest states while the latter had had its air defenses destroyed by the first gulf war and more than 10 years of sanctions and air strikes tingencies in other parts of the globe they argue could involve more extensive air defe nses requiring more survivable aircraft such as the fa22 to knock down the door and clear the way for followon aircraft others disagree and contend that the wars the united states is likely to fight in the foreseeable future like those it has fought over the past 30 years have been against poorly defended opponents in the developing world longrange bomber issues that may front congress include the following what types of conflicts does the united stat need to prepare for and how relevant are bombers to those scenarios how many bombers does the air force need to meet the requirements of these conflicts to wh at extent if at all do the bombers need to be upgraded to meet these requirements is nextgeneration bomber needed and if so when this report will address these bigpicture issues which relate to the entire bomber fleet before turning to each of the three bombers individually the role of bombers in current and future conflicts key consideration in decisions about modernizing the bombers expanding or contracting the fleet and developing next generation bomber is the type of conflict the united states might face in the foreseeable future the three bombers have different roles in different types of conflicts the rge but vulnerable b52 serves as bomber in lowthreat environments dropping variety of precision and dumb bombs while in higherthreat envir onments it serves as standoff missile launcher firing airtoground cruise ssiles from beyond the range of enemy defenses the b1 in addition to serving as bomber in low threat environments is capable of penetrating some air defenses because of its speed antimissile defensive systems and reduced radar si gnature stealth the b2 which has superior stealth can undertake penetra tion missions against more sophisticated defenses in recent conflicts the united states has faced opponents with rudimentary or battered air defenses and all three bombers have been able to attack targets with impunity against an opponent with sophis ticated defenses however the b52 and possibly the b1 could be reduced to stan doff role in the case of the b1 the planes existing defensive systems will soon become obsolete and the program tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31544crs4 design replacement was cancelled by the department of defe nse dod in late 2002 see b1 dsup below as result the b1 like the b52 could be relegated to standoff role against even modest air defenses although the b1 and b52 are being outfitted with more sophisticated st andoff weapons the b2 of which the air force maintains only 16 combatready aircra ft would be the only longrange strike aircraft capable of penetrating air defens other than the 16 b2s the air force would need to rely on fighterattack aircraft such as the fa22 and the joint strike fighter jsf despite their shorter rang and smaller weapons payload to attack ground targets in highthreat areas table 2 projected range and airtoground strike

carry the 2000 lb jdam it can carry two 1000 lb jdams internally for strike missions b numbers for the sdb are estimates sdb development has not been completed the air force points out that against th most sophisticated air defenses the fa22 will be the most survivable and ffective aircraft because of its stealth speed and agility even though its range is shorted and its payload smaller in comparison to the b2 the air force and other observers contend that the fa22 will be the only aircraft that can reliably penetrate advanced defenses and break down the door for followon aircraft res ources are therefore best spent on such aircraft rather than on upgrading or bu ilding more bombers b1s and b52s will continue to play role as standoff plat forms and as followon st rike platforms and b2s will continue to serv as penetrators but to ensure access in highthreat environments these observers say the bul k of air force investment should go to fighters bomber advocates on the other hand ar gue that building more b2s and upgrading the b1s defensive systems are cheaper more effective ways to address the highthreat environment than devel oping advanced fighters

gps and laserguided munitions and new targeting pods highflying bombers now conduct precision strikes previously conduc ted only by lowflying short range aircraft in afghanistan and iraq bombers performed close air support missions previously the excl usive domain of lowflyers like the a10 warthog bombers long range and massive pa yload enable them to loiter for hours above conflict zone s so they can respond rapidly to newly designated timesensitive targets bomber advocates point out that these new capabilities have substantially increased demand for bombers in recent conflicts in operation iraqi freedom for example b1s were in such demand th at centcom air component commander lt gen michael moseley personally managed their scheduling2 since 12 of the 36 combat ready b1s were deployed to guam in case of an emergency in korea and another 12 were undergoing maintenance or moderniza tion only 12 were available for the war the demand for bombers is also apparent in statistics for recent conflicts in afghanistan bombers accounted for 20 of combat missions and dropped 76 of the bomb tonnage in the first three weeks of the air campaign3 in iraq the b1 flew fewer than 2 of the total number of combat sorties yet dropped roughly half of the jdams4 bomber advocates also contend that few potential opponents are likely to obtain advanced air defenses because they are ex pensive and difficult to operate in recenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31544crs6 5 see crs report rl31673 for more information on potential bomber variant of the fa 22wars and in the most likely scenarios for

the conve rsion of ballisticmissile submarines ssbn into cruisemissile carriers ssgn each converted trident submarine would carry 154 tomahawk cruise missiles have on the required number of b52s can

so would this reduce the needed number of b1s or b2s5 bomber advocates including some memb ers of congress contend that more bombers are needed given the expanded roles of these aircraft in recent conflicts and the possibility that the unite d states will be denied access to overseas bases in the future in particular some in congress have argued fo r reopening production of the b2 to augment the bomber fleet and improve longrange penetration capabilities see b2 below httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31544crs7 6 john roos holding the heading air forc chief shares his view of transformational activities armed forces journal international may 2002 7 ibid 8 john tirpak bomber questions air force magazine september 2001the air force and dod however remain opposed to expanding the bomber fleet and continue to press for cuts in th numbers of b1s and b52s the air force contends that the current number of comb atready bombers is adequate for current and projected needs and that other needs are more pressing than expanding the bomber force air force chief of staff john jumper when asked if todays bomber fleet is sufficient for future challenges replied theres nothing ive seen that informs we dont have enough bombers6 the air force contends that the current bomber force is sufficient because bombers today are vastly more capable than in the past where previously several bombers and scores of bombs were required to eliminate single target today single bomber can reliably destroy dozen or more targets using precision weapons thus the air force and others turn around the argument that increased capabilities have increased demand for bombers to reason that increased capabilities mean fewer bombers are needed moreover the air force is developing smaller and more precise weapons that will enable bombers nd other aircraft to attack more targets with great accuracy 500 lb version of the jdam and the 250 lb small diameter bomb sdb will greatly increase the capabilities of existing bombers in coming years and even smaller weapons are pl anned improved accuracy it is hoped will give these smaller munitions the same destructive power as todays larger less accurate weapons today the b2 carries sixteen 2000 lb jdams but soon it will carry an estimated eighty 500 lb jdams which are scheduled to debut in 2004 general jumper believes these new weapons will re duce the number of bombers needed ten b2 bombers with 90 weapons each will take care of the target decks that we have prepared for conflicts in most parts of the world7 each b2 is anticipated to carry over 300 sdbs which are expected in 20078 thus 21 b2s could theoretically attack over 6000 separate target s in single operation today such an attack would require nearly 400 b2s assuming 16 weapons each bomber supporters counter that the ma th doesnt always translate to the battlefield if the united states were to face two simultaneous conflicts for example the 16 combatcoded b2s would be stretc hed thin regardless of how many bombs each carries moreover enhanced capab ility has increased not decreased demand for bombers in recent conflicts lastly bomber advocates note that neither the 500 lb jdam nor the sdb has been successfu lly fielded yet nd it may be imprudent to make decisions about the future size of the bomber inventory based on weapons that have not yet been deployed

bomber include the following the need for more and better longra nge highpayload strike aircraft that can penetrate advanced air defenses the old age and vulnerability of the b52 the youngest b52 isnow over 40 years old while its remarkable durability and flexibility has sustained the b52s relevance at some point fatigue will catch up to it additionally because the b52 lacks sophisticated defenses and is easily detected by radar its capabilities are limited unless enemy defens have been suppressed the possibility that the united states will be denied access to overseas bases for future conflicts the heavy reliance on bombers in recent conflicts bomber advocates contend that the air fo rce tends to be biased toward fighter aircraft and has chroni cally underfunded bomber prog rams one noted aviation historian argues they usaf leaders recoil at the idea of sending air force fighter pilots into airtoair combat during the first decade of the 21st century in f15c which were first built in the 1970s but upgraded and produced into the 1990s yet they apparently have qualms about condemning bomber pilots to fly the ancient b 52hs which were last produced in 1962 into combat during the first three decades of the 21st century12 these observers argue that the air force gives priority to fighters because the generals who run the service tend to be tac tical fighter pilots their bias some say is indicated by the increasingly lopsided ratio of dollars invested in tactical fighters versus bombers which increased from slightly less than 51 in 1999 to more than 301 in 200313 this

in the air force inventory in 1950 the ratio of fighters to bombers was two to one but by the 1990s the ratio had grown to 16 to one meaning that less than 5 of the rvices 4000 aircraft were bombers14 the air force has opposed accelerating development of followon bomber because it believes other priorities are more urgent major general dan leaf director of air force operational requirements has said that we cant realistically afford to modernize everything at once fielding the future strike platform is not as pressing problemas continue d modernization of the fighters15 leaf also argues that the air force plan favors fighter modernization not only because fighter capabilities need to be upgraded but also because there have not been major technological leaps that pply to bombers the ne xt

incremental the former favors the development of expensive revolutionary technologies while th latter prefers to build upon existing technologies the air force appears to fa vor leap ahead approach former chief of staff general mike ryan states the air force wants to make big leap in capability with its next strategic systemwe need to go to the next level of strike capability beyond the b220 supporters of the leap ahead approach argue that competitors may arise to challenge us air power in the future the proliferation of advanced russian surface toair missiles for example is just hint of the kind of weapons that may emerge tomorrow potential adversaries are also developing antiaccess systems and techniques like gps jamming antistealth radars and terminal defenses that will require serious technological dvances to defeat they argue incrementalists on the other hand point out that the united states has dominated the air in every conflict since vi etnam and especially since the persian gulf war in 1991 they argue that while we should improve on todays capabilities we can strive toward cost effective solutions developing leap ahead capabilities will be difficult and expensive

and more effective precision weapons single bomber is vastly more capable than in the past in operation desert storm in iraq 1991 for example numerous bombs and possibly multiple sorties were needed to destroy individual targets in operation iraqi freedom 2003 however single bomber coul d reliably destroy as many as two dozen separate targets effects of consolidation the air force reports that consolidation has brought substantial savings and improved performance to the remaining b1 fleet for two reasons first consolidation has expe dited modernization of the remaining fleet because according to an air force s pokesman the usaf is aggressively reinvesting dollars saved from the b1 consolidation to significantly increase the capabilities of the remaining aircraft61 in the first year since consolidation savings amounted to 130 million according to the air force62 initial estimates pegged total consolidation savings over five years at 14 billion but subsequent estimates lowered that figure to roughly 800 million63 second consolidation has boosted b1 performance both by reducing the demand fo r spare parts and by enabling the air force to take needed parts from retired planes by early 2003 the cannibalization rate had dropped drama tically while the mission capable rates during operation iraqi freedom have been the highest ye t reported for the aircraft 79 criticism of the consolidation plan september 2002 gao study criticized the plan for failing to analyze how the reduction would affect national security needs or detailing how the air force would replace the capabilities of the lost b1s using other aircraft the study also found that the air force was inconsistent in its methodology for imple menting consolidati on and incomplete in estimating savings64 the gao report further criticized the decision to move planes from the air national guard to active duty finding that guard units had lower flying hour costs higher mission capable ra tes and more experienced crews65 1998 gao report argued that moving b1s from active duty to the national guard could save millions of dollars while maintaining bombing capabilities66 others have

additional st andoff aircraft and whether 16 longrange bombers capable of penetr ation missions is enough these critics also ask why the b1s capabilities should be downgraded s ubstantially when the purpose of the consolidation was to fr ee up funds for upgrades reinstatement of retired b1s some members of congress have fought the consolidation plan since it was first proposed the decision

projected to be scarce in four years at the rate they are currently being replaced advan ces in digital technology will likely make it harder to find suppliers for analog gine hardware dod suggests replacing the b2s analog engine controller with digital model in addition to alleviating spare parts shortage switching to digital gine controller may also provide better airspeed control131 cracks cracks appeared in the aft deck of several b2s in 1990 but were fixed at cost of 200 million after change in th design of the aircraft second series of cracks located on titanium plates behind the jet engines exhaust appeared in 2000 on 16 of the 21 b2s132 the cause of these cracks is being reviewed both the air force combat command and northrop grumman are working on fix and at this stage it is difficult to predict how much these cracks will cost to repair in its fy2004 appropriations bill the hous armed services committee added 27 m illion to dods budget request for repairing the cracks133 according to northrop grumman the money in the appropriations bill would go toward permanent solution to the problem134 the cracks range from one inch to as long as nine inches but according to air force officials they do not represent threat to stealth capabilities missionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31544crs39 135 ibid 136 vernon loeb from us batwinged b2 strikes at taliban bomber aloft for days

is keeping close watch on these cracks aircraft with cracks are examined at the end of every flight day and those aircraft without cracks every 200 flight hours the air force is concerned that the cracks may expand to the point of affecting th b2s stealth if not fixed it appears that fuselage cracking may not be unique to the b2 other aircraft have experienced similar cracks including the f22

all b2 sorties we re flown 31hours round trip nonstop from whiteman afb missouri to yugoslavia the 50 b2 strike sorties accounted for approximately 1 of total sorties flown during th operation while releasing 11 of total us air force precision weapons which destroyed 90 of the targets they attacked136 the bomber employed gps guided munitions including 651 2000 lb jdams and gbu37 the b2s reportedly fl ew without support aircraft for some sorties operation enduring freedom afghanistan six b2s took part in the conflict flying from missouri for missions over afghanistan beginning october 5 2001 they were the first bombers deployed in the conflict b1bs and b52s were employed once enemy air defenses were destroyed and low observability was less important as in operation allied force the b2s were able to deliver 16 jdams per mission and demonstrated great accuracy137 crew fatigue was an important consideration for such long missions after attacking targets in afghanistan b2s stopped at diego garcia in the indian cean with the engines still running they changed crews refueled and flew back to missouri the whole trip took six aerial refuelings operation iraqi freedom four b2s stationed on diego garcia flew 49 sorties during oif it was the first time that b2s have been stationed overseas using the new deployable shelters the air force has not released detailed information about the activities of the b2 during the conf lict but did praise the aircrafts ability to carry the 4700 lb bunker buster guided bomb costs unlike the b1 the b2 program was not limited by price cap costs for the stealth bomber grew even as planned pr oduction shrank in 1978 planners called for 165 b2s at total cost of 36 billion 218 million each fy1980 dollars in early 1986 the air force reduced

was cut to 75 at total cost of 648 billion 863 million each and in 1993 the final purchase of 20 b2s was totaled 445 billion 22 billion per plane some argue that this aircraft is not only expensive to purchase but also to maintain requiring workforce of 1000 mech anics for its 16 combat ready aircraft others argue that the b2 actually costs less than conventiona l aircraft because thanks to its stealthy features it can deliv er an enormous payload without escort or air superiority if one compares the cost of conventional multiplane strike package to b2 strike package the value of stealth becomes apparent advocates argue138 however opponents point out that the b2 is usually escorted by standoff jamming aircraft the b2s program acquisition cost current air force estimate was 445 billion
