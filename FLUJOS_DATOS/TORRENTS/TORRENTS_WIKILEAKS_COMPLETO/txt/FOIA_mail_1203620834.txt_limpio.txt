from david thompson davetatmoscolostateedu to phil jones pjonesueaacuk subject re your enso series date thu 21 feb 2008 140714 0000 phil if it works lets plan on visiting for the day april 30 ill come out april 29 leave may 1 ill put the date on my calendar and assume it works unless i hear otherwise if there is better day that week please let know thanks dave dave will send on your details to the seminar organizer here the week of april 28 may 2 is ok for i hope this is what you meant by last week few thoughts on the plots 1 there isnt drop off in land data around 1945 nor during ww2 so this is different from the ocean data most series are complete or have been slightly infilled during the period in europe berlin for example only missed one days t obs in april 45 2 fuego could be underestimated 3 it could also be that sulphate emissions were very high at this time late 60s early 70s ill await the text cheers phil at 1618 19022008 you wrote hi phil id enjoy visiting how does the first or last week of april look to you as for some new results ive attached two figures both focus on the land data the first figure includes 4 time series from top to bottom the globalmean land data crutem 3 the enso fit the cowl fit the residual globalmean time series there is nothing here you havent seen before the residual land time series is identical to the one in the nature paper as weve discussed the residual land time series highlights the signature of the volcanos and as far as low frequency variability goes the residual land time series supports the ipcc contention that the global warmed from 19001940 did not warm from 19401980 and warmed substantially from 1980 to present ok so now im going to play with removing the volcanic signal there are lot of ways to do this and i havent settled on the best method for now i am driving the simple climate model ive been using for enso with the ammann et volcanic forcing time series i get identical results using crowleys estimate and satos estimate the figure on page 2 shows the effect of removing the volcanic signal from top to bottom the the globalmean residual land time series repeated from the previous figure the volcanic fit the ensocowlvolcano residual land time series some key points 1 the volcanic fit isnt perfect but captures most of the volcanic signal 2 the residual time series bottom of fig 2 is interesting if you look closely it suggests the globe has warmed continuously since 1900 with two exceptions bite in the 1970s and downwards step in 1945 the step in 1945 is not as dramatic as the step in the ocean data but its there im guessing the corresponding change in variance is due to sudden increase in data coverage 3 the volcanic fit highlights the fact that the lack of warming in the middle part of the century comes from only two features the step in 45 and agung when agung is removed land temperatures march upwards from 19451970 fig 2 bottom 4 the bite in the 1970s could be due to an underestimate of the impact of fuego the bite is also evident in the sst data what do you think the step in 1945 is not as dramatic as the step in the sst data but its certainly there its evident in the cowlenso residual time series top of fig 2 removing agung simply clarifies that without the step temperatures marched steadily upwards from 19001970 dave on feb 19 2008 at 128 pm phil jones wrote dave thanks before seeing what you send i think ill find it harder to believe something is wrong with the land data i can be convinced though so youre in reading now do you still want to come up to distant norwich at some point and also give talk cheers phil at 1655 18022008 you wrote phil im really sorry for the delay my family and i have been in transit from the us to the uk this past week and its taken bit for us to get settled ive attached the enso index ive been using the first month is jan 1850 the last is dec 2006 the time series has silly number of sig figures thats just how matlab wanted to save it the data are in k and are scaled as per the fit to the globalmean as in the paper ive got some new results regarding the land data ill think youll find them interesting ill pass them along in the next day or so the main point is that i suspect the land data might also have some spurious cooling in the middle part of the century more to come dave ï¼ on feb 14 2008 at 1235 pm phil jones wrote david for presentation im due to make in few months can you send the enso and the cowl series that are in figure 1 in the paper im not sure what i will do with cowl but i want to compare your enso with some of the ensotype indices i have these seem monthly from about the 1860s or maybe earlier cheers phil at 1649 07022008 you wrote so it made it past the first hurdle which is good my hunch is that the paper will fare ok in review but you never know with nature and its possible reviewer will insist on our providing correction anyway well see dave begin forwarded message from
