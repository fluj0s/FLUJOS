in open ocean and nearshore coastal areas many federal laws and regulations guide their management commercial and sport fishing are jointly manage d by the federal government and individual states states generally have jurisdiction within 3 miles of the coast beyond state jurisdiction and out to 200 miles the federal government manages fisheries under the msfcma through eight regional fishery management councils beyond 200 miles the united states participates in international agreements relating to specific areas or species some of the fishery measures enacted by the 110 th congress included pl 11028 providing 604 million for pacific salmon disaster assistance as well as 110 million for hurricane recovery assistance to the gulf of mexico shrimp and fishing industries pl 110161 provided 13395 million for alleviating economic impacts on the massachusetts groundfish fishery and provisions in pl 110246 transferred 170 million to nmfs for distribution to commercial and recreational members of the fishing communities affected by the salmon fishery failure in california oregon and washington provisions in pl 110114 increased the authorization for research on columbia and snake river salmon survival including methods to reduce avian predation on juvenile salmon coordinated management of two aquatic nuisance species dispersal barriers on the chicago sanitary and

to alter relationships between environmental protection and sustainable resource management recent reports note declines in marine resources and shortcomings in the fragmented and limited approaches to resource protection and management in federal and state waters further concern is the increasing pressures and conflicts that arise from economic activity associated with continued human population growth in coastal areas common concern is habitat loss or alteration due to both natural processes such as climate variation as well as development changes in land management practices competition from invasive species and other factors nearly all related to economic political or social interests congress faces the issue of how to balance these diverse interests which may fall on various sides of any given controversy while promoting the sustainable management of fishery and other marine resources in the final hours of the 109 th congress the magnusonstevens fishery conservation and management act msfcma was reauthorized and extensively amended in pl 1094791 reauthorization of the marine mammal protection act mmpa was not finalized the 110th congress considered measures to reauthorize the mmpa address aquatic habitat concerns modify or extend fishery disaster assistance and address fisheryspecific concerns as well as conducting oversight of msfcma implementation

was caught however as fi shing techniques improved fishermen ventured farther offshore before the 1950s the federal government assumed limited responsibility for marine fisheries responding primarily to international fishery concerns and treaties by enacting implementing legislation for treaties eg the northern pacific halibut act in 1937 as well as to interstate fishery conflicts by consenting to inte rstate fishery compacts eg the pacific marine fisheries compact in 1947 in the late 1940s and early 1950s several latin american nations proclaimed marine jurisdictions extending 200 miles or further offshore this action was denounced by those within the united states and other distantwater fishing nations who sought 1 for comprehensive summary of legislation in the 109th congress on

farranging fishing vessels beginning in the 1950s atlantic and 1960s pacific increasing numbers of foreign fishing vessels steamed into us offshore waters to catch the substantially unexploited seafood resources since the united states then claimed only 3 mile jurisdiction in 1964 pl 88308 prohibited fishing by foreignflag vessels within 3 miles of the coast in 1966 pl 89658 proclaimed an expanded 12mile exclusive us fishery jurisdiction foreign vessels could fish many of the same stocks caught by us fishermen us fishermen deplored this foreign encroachment and alleged that overfishing was causing stress on or outright depletion of fish stoc ks protracted law of the sea treaty 2 negotiations in the early and mid1970s provided impetus for unilateral us action the enactment of the fishery conservation and management act fcma in 1976 later renamed the magnuson fishery conservation and management act and more recently the magnusonstevens fishery conservation and management act msfcma 16 usc 1801 et seq ushered in new era of federal marine fishery management the fcma was signed into law on april 13 1976 after several years of debate on march 1 1977 marine fishery resources within 200 miles of all us coasts but outside state jurisdiction came under federal jurisdiction and an entirely new multifaceted regional management system began allocating fishing rights with priority given to domestic enterprise primary federal management authority was vested in the national marine fisheries service nmfs also popularly referred to as noaa fisheries within the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa of the us department of commerce 3 the 200mile fishery conservation zone was superseded by an exclusive economic zone eez proclaimed by president reagan on march 10 1983 presidential proclamation 5030 eight regional fishery management c ouncils were created by the fcma4 council members are appointed by the secretary of commerce from lists of candidates knowledgeable of fishery resources provided by coastal state governors5 the councils prepare fishery management plans fmps for those fisheries that they determine require active federal management after public hearings revised fmps are submitted to the secretary of commerce for approval approved plans are implemented through regulations published in the federal register together these councils and nmfs have developed and implemented 40 fmps for various fish and shellfish resources with 9 additional plans in various stages of development some plans are created for an individual species or few related ones eg fm ps for red drum by the south atlantic council and for shrimp by the gulf of mexico council others are developed for larger species assemblages inhabiting similar habitats eg fmps for gulf of alaska groundfish by the north pacific council and for reef fish by the gulf of mexico council many of the implemented plans have been amended one over 30 times and three have been developed and implemented jointly by two or more councils the msfcma was reauthorized in the final hours of the 109 th congress by pl 109479 the magnusonstevens fishery conservation and management

husbandry of fish shellfish and other aquatic animals and plants usually in controlled or selected environment23 the diversity of aquaculture is typified by such activities as fish farming usually applied to freshwater commercial aquaculture operations eg catfish and trout farms24 shellfish and seaweed culture netpen culture used by the salmon industry wherein fish remain captive throughout their lives in marine pens built from nets and ocean ranching used by the pacific coast salmon industry whereby juvenile salmon are cultured released to mature in the open ocean and caught when they return as adults to spawn fish hatcheries can be either publicly or privately operated to raise fish for recreational and commercial stocking as well as to mitigate aquatic resource and habitat damage the food and agriculture organization fao has characterized aquaculture as one of the worlds fastest growing food production activities world aquaculture production more than doubled in 10 years from about 10 million metric tons in 1984 to 255 million metric tons in 1994 by 2002 global aquaculture production had re ached almost 40 million metric tons by mid 2006 fao estimated that 43 of all fish consumed by humans came from aquaculture 25 fao has projected that aquaculture will surpass wildharvested seafood as the source of more than 50 of global seafood consumption in 2008 in ddition fao predicts that world aquaculture production could exceed 130 million metric tons by 2030 26 us aquaculture until recently and with few exceptions has been considered minor industry the us department of agricultures 2005 census of aquaculture reported that us sales of aquaculture products had reached nearly 11 billion with more than half this value produced in alabama arkansas louisiana and mississippi27 despite considerable growth the domestic aquaculture industry faces strong competition from imports of foreign aquacultural products from the domestic poultry and livestock industries and from wild harvests 28 with growth however aquaculture operations face increasing scrutiny for habitat destruction pollution and other concerns the major statute affecting us aquaculture is the national aquaculture act of 1980 as amended 16 usc 2801 et seq in october 2007 noaa released 10year plan for its marine aquaculture program29 the 110th congress did not consider legislation the

protection act mmpa 16 usc 1361 et seq due in part to the high level of dolphin mortality estimated at more than 400000 animals per year in the eastern tropical pacific tuna purseseine fishery while some critics assert that the mmpa is scientifically irrational because it identifies one group of organisms for special protection unrelated to their abundance or ecological role supporters note that the mmpa has accomplished much by way of promoting research nd increased understanding of marine life as well as encouraging attention to incidental bycatch mortalities of marine life by the commercial fishing and other maritime industries the mmpa established moratorium on the taking of marine mammals in us waters and by us nationals on the high seas it also established moratorium on importing marine mammals and marine mammal products into the united states the mmpa protected marine mammals from clubbing mutilation poisoning capture in nets and other human actions that lead to extinction it also expressly authorized the secretary of commerce and the secretary of the interior to issue permits for the taking of marine mammals for certain purposes such as scientific research and public display under the mmpa the secretary of commerce acting through nmfs is responsible for the conservation and management of whales dolphins porpoises seals and sea lions the secretary of the interior acting through the fish and wildlife service fws is responsible for walruses sea and marine otters polar bears manatees and dugongs this division of authority derives from agency responsibilities as they existed when the mmpa was enacted title ii of the mmpa established an independent marine mammal commission mmc and its committee of scientific advisors on marine mammals to oversee and recommend actions necessary to meet the requirements of the mmpa prior to passage of the mmpa states were responsible for marine mammal management on lands and in waters under their jurisdiction the mmpa shifted marine mammal management authority to the federal government it provides however that management authority on speciesby species basis could be returned to states that adopt conservation and management programs consistent with the purposes and policies of the mmpa it also provides that the moratorium on taking can be waived for specific purposes if the taking will not disadvantage the affected species or population permits may be issued to take or import any marine mammal species including depleted species for scientific research or to enhance the survival or recovery of the species or stock the mmpa allows us citizens to apply for and obtain authorization for taking small numbers of mammals incidental to activities other than commercial fishing eg offshore oil and gas exploration and development if the taking would have only negligible impact on any marine mammal species or stock provided that monitoring requirements and other conditions are met the mmpas moratorium on taking does not apply to any native american indian aleut or eskimo who resides in alaska near the coast of the north pacific including the bering sea or

is for subsistence purposes or for creating and selling authentic native articles of handicrafts and clothing and is not done wastefully the mmpa also authorizes the taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations in 1988 most us commercial fish harvesters were exempted from otherwise applicable rulemaking and permit requirements for fiveyear period pending development of an improved system to govern the incidental taking of marine mammals in the course of commercial fishing operations this exemption expired at the end of fy1993 and was extended several times until new provisions were enacted in 1994 by pl 103238 which reauthorized the mmpa through fy1999 the eastern tropical pacific tuna fishery was excluded from the incidental take regimes enacted in 1988 and 1994 instead the taking of marine mammals incidental to that fishery is governed by separate provisions of the mmpa and was substantially amended in 1997 by pl 10542 the international dolphin conservation program act section 319 of pl 108136 amended the mmpa to provide broad exemption for national defense this section also amended the definition of harassment of marine mammals as it applies to military readiness activities to require greater scientific evidence of harm and the consideration of impacts on military readiness in the issuance of permits for incidental takings on january 23 2007 the department of defense announced the authorization of twoyear exemption under these provisions for midfrequency active sonar use 30
