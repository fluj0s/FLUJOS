estimates indicate that more than 250000 people are dead or missing and millions of others are affected including those injured or displaced making this the deadliest tsuna on record sections of indonesia sri lanka india and thailand have suffered the worst devastation in response the united nations the ited states and othe r donor nations have organized what some have called the worl ds largest relief and recovery operation to date president bush pledged 350 million in aid early on and mobilized the us military to provide logistical and other assistance the administration has increased this amount by seeking 600 million in its request for 950 million for tsunami relief in the fy2005 emergency supplemental of this total 346 million would replenish usaid emergency aid accounts that had b een drawn down in support of the us government response and reim burse defense department accounts that were used in the relief effort on march 16 the house passed hr 1268 funding all items proposed under the tsunami recovery and reconstruction fund except for the 45 million proposed for debt reduction the largescale us response to the ts unami is unlikely to reverse the decline in the us image abroad since the september 11 attacks because this decline primarily is due to american policies in the middle east however the scale and scope of us assistance could provide positive example of us leadership and military capabilities additionally the disa ster relief cooperati on between the us and indonesian militaries is likely to be mentioned during the annual congressional deliberations over renewing restric tions on usindonesian militarytomilitary relations which the bush administration s sought to restore since the september 11 2001 attacks this report

southeast asia and stretched as far as the northeastern african coast within six hours the dead ly waves traveled more than 3000 miles and carved trail of death and destruction as they arrive d on land current official estimates indicate that more than 250000 people are dead or missing and millions of others are affected including the injured or displaced2 the world health organization who indicates that an estimated three to five million people lack the basic necessities for survival between one and two million people may be displaced in many places the physical environment is badly damaged or destroyed including entire communities homes businesses tourist areas and infrastructure roads bridges power and telephone systems and public buildings for many their means of livelihood and way of life has been wi ped out in the hardest hit areas social services are severely compromised or nonexist ent experts have said this is the most powerful earthquake in 40 years and the four th

falls below other events see table 1 the unique feature of this tsunami is the extent of the damage and the number of countries affected unlike the damage cause d by other disasters which tended to be highly localized the indian ocean ts unami struck thousands of miles of populous coastline in nearly dozen countries affecting millions of people the devastation was particularly acute in several island areas where at times entire land masses were flooded the very nature of the tidal wave s combined with the lack of warning made women children the elde rly and others unable to sw im particularly vulnerable also the potential deaths of thousands of tourists from the industrialized world vacationing in southern th ailand and sri lanka mostly europeans but also many americans and

instead of the 2 it used to take prior to the tsunamirelief operations and aid delivery experts break relief operations into severa l phases search and rescue treatment and survival relocation and rehabilitation and longterm reconstruction6 as with any massive undertaking that has many moving parts it can take days to get relief effort underway delays in transportati on and congestion lack of transportation infrastructure bureaucratic pr oblems lack of access all can cause bottlenecks at key points in the system while timing is critical to save lives to enable network of this size to function efficiently requires the coordination of assessm ents and appropriate responses with local governments comm unities and the international community in general the relief effort has be viewed positively and the convening authority of the united nations has been well received the sheer scale of this relief effort has brought together tremendous cap acity and willingness to help but experts generally caution that an ongoing effort nd strategic planning at the regional and country levels is required at each phase to work out coor dination and logistics issues the relief effort is now focused primarily on recovery and rehabilitation7 more detailed interagenc assessments are underway the information from which will be critical for planning recove ry and reconstruction initiatives developing strategies for the use of funding and termining whether personnel are in place with adequate resources in certain areas par ticularly in indonesia access and logistics problems continue there are logistical bottlenecks and the lack of transportation and adequate infrastructure re main challenge concerns about disease and the need for sanitation and medical capacity are still critical impediments to aid in indonesia appear to be particularly cha llenging for several reasons there are the obvious logistical diffi culties the destructi on of transportation infrastructure has made it difficult to extend assistance to all of the affected areas8 the coordination of national and local level government with the military and reliefgroups presents problems the conflict betw een secessionists and the government has also complicated the relief effort the indonesian military feels it has to look to both relief and counterinsurgency operations there is also the issue of national pride indonesia was like india leading member of the nonaligned movement this may be in part reason for indonesias deci sion to ask providers of foreign military assistance to leave the country by march the indian ocean earthquake and tsunami cr eated natural disaster of historic proportion the massive relie f and reconstruction effort underway also departs from previous emergency operations in

international aid as of january 3 2005 officials doctors without borders and the internationa l committee for the red cross have sought government permission to visit the lower burma coastline the issue of aid is complicated by the heavy economic sanctions imposed by the united states and the european union on burma because of the politically repressive policies of the militarydominated burmese

unlikely that the government would ask for or accept aid from the united states number of experts on burma have stated that the views of burmese military officials toward the united states ve become

reported as gi ving 014 percent of gnp in international development assistance as compared to norways 092 percent contribution127 usaid director andrew natsios has refuted egelands statement saying

in previous disasters pledges made by governments have not always resulted in actual contributions the bam earthqua ke of december 2003 is but one example raised by the united nations experts are concerned that while billions of dollars have been pledged to help the victims of the tsunami disaster there is guarantee that these pledges will be honored it also cannot be assumed that the funds represent new money as it may previously have been allocated elsewhere some are also concerned about funding prior ities and resources for other disaster areas and the very real possibility of internati onal donor fatigue it will ta ke time for more complete picture to reveal how the actual costs of the tsunami disaster will be shared among international donors130 competing aid and budget priorities131 even before the disaster struck congress was expected to struggle to find th resources to sustain us aid pledges amid efforts to tackle rising budget defi cits by among other measures slowing or reducing discretionary spending during the fy2005 debate lawmakers reduced the presidents foreign assistance budget request subset of the larger foreign policy budget request by 17 b illion or nearly 8 this was the first time such cuts occurred during the bush administration some members of c ongress publicly have expressed concern that funding for tsuna relief and reconstr uction which depleted most worldwide disaster contingency acc ounts if not fully restored through supplemental appropriations ma jeopardize resources for subsequent international disasters or for other aid priorities from which tsunami emergency aid has been transferred132 transparency members of congress have also raised concerns about transparency of donor contributions allocati on of monies and monitoring of projects by the united nations the united nations has said it will improve its financial tracking and reporting system and price wa terhouse coopers is reportedly assisting in that effort many contributions are so being made directly to international organizations and nongovernmental orga nizations which could raise the same questions about transparen cy requirements moreove r

organizations and charities with known ties to ji have dispatched humanitarian relief teams to aceh in southern thailand the areas most affect ed by the tsunami are generally considered ethnically and regionally distinct from the predominantly muslim provinces on the western coast of peninsular thailand which have been the site of sectarian and anti government violence by muslims over the past year countering negative images of the united states the largescale us response to the tsunami is unlikely to reverse the decline in the us image abroad since the september 11 attacks because this decline primarily is due to american policies in the middle east however the scale and scope of us assistance could provide positive example of us leadership and military capabilities the decline in the us image abroad has been particularly acute in the muslim world especially in indonesia wher according to one series of polls only 15 of those polled in 2003 said they had favorable opinion of the united states down from 61 in 2002137 additionally the us tsunami relief effort could help counter the perception among some southeast asians that the united states not only has placed too much emphasis on

will likely be complicated for number of reasons one reason is because of the number of different potential international par ties that would be involved with the need to coordinate data collection and warning dissemin ation and second is the funding needed to establish tsunami warning system in that region third is that nations including some in the indian ocean might charge for access to critical satellite data that may help in warning potential victims some in congress assert that the costs of acquiring those data could be well worth it in terms of lives saved wh ile others counter that access to those proprietary data should be provided free of charge especially when the united states and other nations provide disaster relief and propose funding tsunami detection and warning activities for the region140 the greatest challenge is likely to be establishing local or regional emergency management infrastructures for inhabita nts in coastal regions bounding the indian ocean to receive tsunami alerts in suffici ent time to evacuate and to be notified when to return after the dangers have subsided141 many question who would be responsible for building and maintaining such systems after the indian ocean tsunami disaster some members of congress were concerned about the possible vulnerability of us coastal areas to tsunamis and the adequacy of early warning for coastal

immediate care and protection and on longer term psychosocial wellbein g registration of children and family tracing were of critical importance in the first weeks following the disaster unicef in collaboration with agencies ngos and governments helped in setting up of registration and tracing facilities in order to identify orphans and reunite families the issue affecting most surviving childre n in the long run is distress at what they have gone through as result ther is high need for psychosocial support not only to children but also to their families as well as those working with children such as teachers and social workers there have been scattered reports of trafficking of children most could not be confirmed particularly in sri lanka cases of military recruitment of children have been increasing some have occurred from tsunami camp facilities but most from local communities the particular vulnerability of the displaced populations the deployment of thousands of
