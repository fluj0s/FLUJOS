subject shsbc 42 date 22 mar 2000 162830 0000 from shsbcfzbaorg organization mail2newsnymaliasnet newsgroups altclearingtechnologyaltreligionscientology basics of auditing matteroffactness lecture given on 11 august 1961 thank you thank you of course that was mary sues applause ahha whose applause was it audience mary sues yours all right thats it all right 11 aug 11 the subject of todays lecture well one could say this in sad voice one could say this in happy voice almost any kind of voice is auditing i think lot of auditors are doing something besides audit i think theyre trying to press through in addition to auditing i think they are trying to introduce some additional factor that will make auditing work i think they are arent pressing hard theyre putting something else in sessions the exact tools with which youre working if you will just sit back half asleep and administer them will clear people you actually dont even have to be very alert now i myself am responsible to some degree by saying the auditor is making the auditing work and that sort of thing but probably this advice has occasionally gotten different reception than was intended yes the auditor ought to be on the ball he ought to be alert he ought to be there but the auditor shouldnt have to be doing something else beside auditing certain impatience for result or certain apathy about result causing sort of grind atmosphere you know these two things alike would speed up or slow down apparently auditing that is to say if you were pressing in there all the time you see and you say well that process isnt working i think ill change it you know it isnt hasnt ive ive run it for ten minutes you know and it hasnt worked so ill change it merely is expressing your desire to help you see its an anxiety you know its an anxiety or contrariwise well this probably wont work but im supposed to run it you know that sort of thing and so ill just sit here and grind away on it you know well what girl havent you ever known yeah well the pressure or the withdrawal of the auditor from the session the impatience of the auditor the feeling that the auditor has that it ought to all be different or ought to all be faster alike get in the road of smooth rendition of model session and smooth application of processes ive been long time at this business i gave session last night oh to mary sue she had bit of headache and it was by standards of course would have been seemed to you rather sloppy session but im sure you would have thought of this sloppy session it started without rudiments and it ended without rudiments but it was an assist and it started with is it all right if i give you an assist yes she says so i explore around and find out what im trying to assist and then i move around and try to find out why she feels bad and then i take the basic technology of scientology and put process together that answers this and then this ran scrambang into an engram and i knew confounded well that the process i was running might run into an engram but it darned well wouldnt move through an engram dont you see so i thought wed better clean up this engram with practically the same auditing command but lets put not know in it you know lets find out what shes notknowing in this engram and get the thing blown out of the way so we can smooth out the track and get her into pt otherwise i had vision of her being parked down the track some place at the end of session dont you see blew her through that returned to the original process smoothed see flattened the interim process returned to the original process moved her up to present time headache was gone everything was fine checked through some just the important things do you have an arc break was there anything i did wrong in the session you know that sort of thing are you upset about anything thats it end of session see is it all right with you if i end the session now is there anything you care to say you know boom end of session oh i dont know it took twenty minutes something on this order in that twenty minutes took chronic headache which had apparently been cutting in and out for long time and heavy engram which had apparently been there for quite while and got rid of both of them at the same time got rid of present time difficulty twenty minutes auditing all right but there was doubt in my mind about what i was doing or what my intentions were or what i was doing which is to say i was there to give the pc an assist wrap it up as fast as possible effectively not with super pressure or doubt or withdrawal i was just there to help the pc so i went right ahead factually and helped the pc and that was it and as i was doing this i had bit of cognition about some other auditors auditing i i suddenly sort of exteriorized from what i was doing and took look at it and made comparison and was suddenly struck by the fact that my auditing was very matter of fact basically because there is doubt in my mind but what i could help the pc theres doubt in my mind about the effectiveness of the process im going to run and theres doubt in mind about the fact that the process is working and there it is the thing that summed it up is matteroffactness you know theres just an inevitability matteroffact relaxedness about the thing that i havent seen in other peoples auditing and i just thought id better make up my mind on it because weve still got this well its factor that measures five to one i get auditing results with considerable speed and i suddenly realized i dont get in the road of my own results you see you get what i mean well its just matteroffact application i i know that this person has has headache and difficulty is having present time problem and it all lumps together in some peculiar fashion so i just go to find out what this is and then i know the mechanics of the mind and what the mechanics of the mind add up to in terms of psychosomatic illness so we just start getting rid of this whole thing and sure enough run right into the engram so we hit secondary so were going to run into the engram and that blew little grief charge secondary must be an engram there got the idea old book one so boom well lets plow out the engram well what was the biggest difficulty weve had with engrams well people notknow dont want engrams known theres something theyre trying to hide about the thing or something or it wouldnt be that held in that close well run the thing out get rid of that thing bring her back up lets make sure the original process is flat thats it man just checking with the pc all the time how is it you know and where are we going and so forth but it was all very matteroffact i think youll agree with that that was female voice good session got rid of my headache well it was good good session see that was just nothing to it but i thought id better remark on this not holding myself up as vast paragon of virtue but i do get auditing results and i dont have any difficulty with auditing you could say well its my subject not necessarily my subject ive known witch doctors and and ive known birds that were pretty clever in my day pretty clever at getting some kind of result very clever at handling people and so forth my hats off to them i know i know only one at this particular business but i just suddenly realized well theres theres doubt about what im doing in you see its all matteroffact because its just matteroffact this is this is sort of inevitable and its all going to come out all right i just auditing by the rules of the game i wasnt departing in any particular direction on the thing and also some more data turned up that the reason an auditor wasnt flattening processes was because the auditor was anxious to get the job done so he didnt flatten process because it wasnt getting the job done dont you see but then the process never had chance to get the job done you got the idea terrific impatience has entered into the thing therefore sort of an anxiety is communicated therefore the pc gets pulled out of session all the time so therefore theres arc breaks so theres all kinds of upsets you know and ive often wondered how i could get away with the things i get away with in auditing because i have to caution you all the time not to do some of the things i do in auditing i dont evaluate for pc but i sure tell him what i think you know if theyre struggling around and floundering around and and theyre avoiding auditing commands or something like this why ill just level with them you know i say something like come on come on come on come on come on come on come on you want to get rid of this or dont you you know and the pc says oh yes i want to get rid of it well lets get down to business come on now its sort of an odd approach but its it is quite real in that i dont artificialize the way i feel about the pc particularly when i when im giving session that i consider successful session or its very happy circumstance of one kind or another im perfectly happy to give session and so forth as long as i keep it real as long as im not on big artificiality and auditing sounds kind of artificial to here and there when i hear it you know it sounds like the auditors being very artificial about it hes not really being very matteroffact about what hes doing he hes sort of being stilted madly so his intention of course is not too well defined but even so if he just sat there and did model session right according to the rote without pressing it you know without being impatient about it and without pulling off and just being exhausted about it if he just was sort of matteroffact and did model session and did the process he was supposed to do and the assessments he was supposed to do ill tell you the pcs would come out the other end feeling wonderful and ive looked in vain for any other bug factor in auditing now and i dont find any bug factors in auditing i just dont find any additional bugs that we might have overlooked and so forth ive been looking for this for long time ive been looking for maybe oh i dont know two or three years and i havent found anything weve missed since i put the model session together i put the model session together last year actually and put it together because i was perfectly convinced that it was time for an auditor to memorize session form because we had session form you see it had been on there and it had been working for long time well lets standardize it and thered be lot of use in standardizing it basically in my matteroffact session i did not particularly depart from model session form i was running an assist not model session but i was running the assist in model session form there was nothing strange there you would have found all the words all the words and music would have been very familiar to you but i think you would have found the atmosphere different thats what i think you would have found the matteroffactness of which this thing was rolling off was i had to stand back and look at it myself i said there there is difference i actually was taught this many years ago by ken and steve and i found these guys were listening to audit to find out what i was doing that other people werent doing and they kept isolating factors and kept speeding up auditing and the first of these was acknowledgment it had never been announced you see it had never been announced that you ever acknowledged anybody and they discovered this as fantastic discovery that when pc said something i answered them and that was big new thing that was fabulous discovery to them so the only reason i bring this up and make this level of comparison is because they they were making such fabulous discoveries and i suddenly awoke to the fact there was lot about auditing that hadnt been communicated and its all been communicated so far as im concerned now now an auditor who will sit there and turn in good model session and run something thats real on process handle the exact pc that is in front of him handle the exact rundown makes sure he flattens what hes running and so forth within the realms of reality oh man he cant miss i dont think he could miss i think hed just have to work day and night belong to the union in order to miss i cant understand how hed miss its something to think about but there is difference which i have detected which might be of interest to you and you might care to take that as frame of mind sit down draw long breath relax make up your mind youre trying to help the pc and then just go ahead and do so just go ahead and do so with further nonsense about it you see just run off your model session patter but thats all just to assist you to help the pc you see and just go ahead and matteroffactly help the pc and take care of what the pcs doing the pcs writhing around you say whats got into you mac and the pc says you say this because you want to know you see not because its all written down someplace and oh well ive got this horrible pain in my umbekillus and when did that turn on well did it turn on in the process we were running before this one oh it did well why didnt you tell all right here we go im going to give you one more two more commands of the process that we are now running and then were going right back to the earlier one next time sing out man you know find out ive missed he doesnt take it as an arc break he interprets this as being thorough in other words go back to an earlier process and flatten it if i find it wasnt flat or find out what was wrong with it you know do something you know just be effective at all times compared to what the case is dont be so hidebound that you wont do something you know its something on the order of walking tightrope anyhow the guy who walks tightropes best of course walks them and yawns at the middle of the tightrope and hes very familiar with tightropes and stands on his hands for few minutes and finishes off and goes to the other end of the tightrope and he doesnt think anything about it somebody else comes up and takes look at the tightrope and he says uuuuuuuuuuuhhh hed fall 117 feet point 5 hes worried about falling off the tightrope all the time hes not worried about walking the tightrope you got the idea and this is expressed i think with this term matteroffactness its just matteroffact proposition if you can turn in sort of matteroffact nothing heroic about this sort of of an auditing session i think your pc would do an upsurge it isnt that youre doing badly or the cases are holding up or anything like that but that addition by itself might speed it up for you im only interested and have been interested all summer only in one thing is just faster result in the same unit of time with greater ease of auditing thats all ive been interested in all this summer ive had it taped since february ive tried to clarify mistakes and bring people back on them again and i have taken the liberty of trying to set cases up little bit better for assessment for you and so on and find out if theres any great advantage to that and so on feeling my way through here about what you can do with it thats what ive been concentrated on same time weve made some interesting discoveries and rediscoveries the practical application of forget and notknow are utterly fabulous turn back the clock to 1950 any engram any secondary you ran would have run on just notknow any one of them would have run from beginning to end on notknow and forget and man they would have run like startled deer you get this guy into this horrendous cataclysmic space opera godelpus you know and hes writhing around and so on and burning down cities and executing maidens and revolting against the captain and all kinds of things going on in this particular engram well we used to just agonize through it and grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind and then grind grind grind and then all of sudden his perceptics you know would turn off and they would turn on and wed sweat to get these things on and wed run him through it again and so forth well im telling you its very weird but you could set person down and you could run not know on an engram or forget on an engram in command form which includes as many dynamics as necessary to resolve it command form must include dynamics in other words not known you could specialize it in well what would you rather notknow about this you see now theres the first dynamic what would you rather your fam any family would rather not know about this or any children would rather not know about this you see or what should be not known about this to children what should children not know about this what should be any kind of way you want to use this thing you see what should remain unknown about this incident to the public at large you see what should the government not know about it what should your superiors not have known about your activities on planet xerxes bzzzzzzz see its just all occlusion just starts flying off in all directions our enemy in 1950 was occlusion we can say that the occlusion is selfmotivated in order to withhold and that the hangups in any engram are from desire to get these things unknown or on the third postulate forgotten or make somebody forget or use forget as an overt act itll be some combination of occlusion and you can play it directly play it instantly and directly you can ask somebody now if you forgot about that who would really be messed up now if you knew nothing about that whatsoever would this would this mean something else would happen someplace else youd always get the answer oh yes forgetting is sort of an overt act you see and the forget and the withhold come together and youve got the sum and substance of the reactive bank and the reactive bank is composed of engrams and secondaries so if you use various versions of what we know now about notknowing and what we know about forgetting why of course these component parts of the reactive bank known as engrams secondaries machines anything else you want to say will just start flying apart in all directions shades of 1950 wouldnt have mattered whether the fellow had sonic visio or anything else man he would have had sonic and visio on the redcoats and the rebels rifles alike would be knocking his eardrums in dont you see as he ran through the incident up to that time its all black and invisible you know well i dont see anything here you say theres some kind of an incident here but i dzaza dont see any incidents dzaaza eh incident yeah i just had that one little flick that one little flick there you know that picture of the corner of the tower just haha that one picture of the corner of the tower and so forth yeah and kind of the idea kind of the idea that maybe i was beheaded at the tower yeah maybe maybe could have been see but of course now youre trying to force this incident off on all of thats just occlusion this unreality this feeling of pretense the feeling of the pretension of knowing about it also blows on notknow this is of course the pretension of knowing about an incident dubin in other words simply blows up because thats another method of disguise boy can you run incidents if you try that one you ought to try that just for the hell of it to give yourself good win somewhere along the line if you ever ran engrams just try it just sit somebody down and say all right now go to the incident necessary to resolve your case you know and they wind up plank in prenatal or conception sperm sequence or beheading or planetary space opera or something of this sort and now just run it on the basis that he is overtly notknowing and forgetting various parts of it and just use any version of that command or those commands necessary to plow through it and youll find this thing going boom boom thud thud boom boom all of this of course has as prerequisite that the rudiments are in and that the individual is is to some degree insession and therefore under the auditors control so they will do what the auditor says with those reservations why you really find the engrains flying kind of fun running engrams and i dont know how much weve speeded up the run of an engram with this because i havent made an actual measure but i would say something on the order of about onethousandth of the time i mean its jump of that breadth take you about onethousandth of the time to run an engram now running engrains by the way should not be discounted in the benefit to the case because youre liable to do this youre liable to clear somebody and youve got them more or less stabilized this will be in the stabilization period which usually follows for three or four months but theyll be clear all right and the needle will be drifting around everythings fine and youll have worked on them to stabilize them and then they will defy you by all of sudden being in an engram see heres an engram staring them in the face and so on giving them symptoms of some kind or another well because theyre clear and able to take these things in their stride its not going to take very long to run this thing anyhow its going to take very brief span of time to run it because theyre clear dont you see even if you ran through with old dianetic techniques of 1950 and itll blow up but you want to clear up that particular thing this guy has got still got piece of bank all right clear up the bank bang we had clear down in south africa had an appendectomy they were going to rush her to the hospital she was clear but the doctor said oh terrible you have all the symptoms so forth she went around and saw the auditor the auditor had hell of time because he couldnt read the emeter on it and gradually was able to read the emeter on it cleaned up the incident zuuupbooopzzzt bong thud crash that was the end of the appendectomy but so this tool is not not to be despised at this time it isnt just nostalgic value youll have something like this during stabilization period while person is coming out of it and unsnarling track and that sort of thing after theyre asising still asising things and so on theyll still run into things you see now youve got to give them hand as they come along and then all of sudden itll all blow clear if you can run an incident with even greater speed than clear can run them its practically at glance you know just its almost at glance clear running an engram runs them almost at glance you see well its soandso and soandso and soandso and soandso and soandso and soandso and its soandso and soandsoandso and then i soandso and then they said soandso and oh theres the overt oh well thats it bang its gone well thats thats fast enough now supposing you said well what are you trying to notknow about that or what notknowingness about that would do somebody in or any kind of phraseology youd care to apply using the notknow as an overt using it as just straight occlusion so forth why the missing piece of it that is holding it there would blow just like that it wouldnt be dadadadadada dadadadaadadada dadadada itd just be dada da see difference of speed is would even be apparent there so this is trick youd better latch onto latch onto youre going to use this trick and i hope you are using this trick with some success right now in handling your goals assessments and terminals assessments and handling what you run into in terms of getting the pc set up so they will give you some goals now theres probably the most valuable application pc goes on to 2975 goals and so forth and you havent got goal out of the pc yet well what is this what is this you know somethings wrong with the pcs giving of goals its something wrong there are these the pcs goals or is the pc trying to please you or something of the sort there is something disconnected here and before it went out that long you had certainly better introduce into goals assessment another type of questioning when you start up goals assessment it just could be that you should set up pc to having goals assessment and that you keep the pc set up for goals assessments with some kind of an additive question of more or less this character what sort of person would get in the road of somebody having goals has anybody ever got in the road of your goals see and what are you notknowing about goals in general and what goals dont you want known of course now when we say what goals shouldnt be known were over into assessment because thats legitimate assessment question but whos gotten in the road of your goals what sort of person would get in the road of your goals if i were sitting here trying to make nothing out of your goals what would my name be this kind of an approach you see if i were here trying to pound you and hammer you and order you to get something done in life who would i be its in other words clearing the auditor to get the auditor disassociated from the personnel who has stamped on the persons goals you get the idea so its another another string to the bow on the clarification of the identity of the auditor its more modern version of who would i have to be to audit you you know who would i have to be to make to raise hell with your goals who would i have to be to actually make hash out of you on the subject of goals to what person could you best tell your most secret ambitions this type of questioning you see who would you leave totally in the dark with regard to your with regard to your goals who would you leave in the dark with regard to your goals who had you better not tell them to man and youll get some kind of an interrogation line like this going and all of sudden the pc will sort of loosen up and disassociate you from the barricades of progress toward their own ambitions got the idea because let tell you one of the most prevalent neuroses afloat if goals can stand in the road of clear obviously they do because if you straighten out person on goals they get clear been demonstrated time and time again well then youd look around the society and you wouldnt find very many clears then you must assume you see you look around the society prescientology society and you find out there werent many clears present none so that you must then assume that it must be fairly prevalent neurosis psychosis or batosis to knock in the head other peoples goals and ambitions you must assume that there must have been some people around who were anxious to do this see by assumption and therefore if you were having trouble with pc in getting his goals you then by great mathematical computation should assume that he has been up against such person and so therefore bit deranged and unwilling to communicate on the subject of goals do you follow out the reasoning there very elementary reasoning so i think that should be taken care of thoroughly at the beginning before you start goals assessment on pc just beat this to death this one i know you can beat to death because itll have the pcs interest see and just just take flail to it and morning star and broad sword and mace and then beat it for while you see with sjambok and in other words just knock this around something fierce and hammer and pound it and all of sudden youre liable to get your pc with big cognition on the idea just using these basic mechanics ive been talking about oh oh yes well as matter of fact you do look little bit like my father hes an ugly of and then hed have big cognition big cognition you are not my father you know you know my father use used to sit there day in day out and hed say when are you going to amount to something and i remember i was working at the bakery and i was making sixtyfive quid month and i was doing all right and i was buying new clothes and my father would sit there and hed put the paper down in the evening and he would look at and he would sigh deeply and then hed pick up the paper again yeah i remember in the army the officers always used to keep telling that if i just had little ambition i could make something out of myself and so forth i remember this i remember just like my grandfather used to do you know and then of course theres be all mechanisms with regard to goals thered be coercing person to have goal and trapping him because he did there would be the mechanism of making sure that any goal person came up with was promptly stamped on and wiped out of existence there would be the mechanism of demanding that person had other goals than the person has the person comes up and says i would certainly like to take nice photograph of that landscape out there and then the mechanism well it would look much nicer if it were painted instead of photography actually your interest ought to be in the subject of oil painting oil painting yes you should go in for oil painting not not photography not well much better much better oil painting now what the person who was standing there who had been talking about the landscape and photographing it does not latch onto at that moment is the other persons simply dramatizing squash of goals it has nothing to do with anything but squash and if the person examining it had said oh i would certainly love to make an oil painting of this particular landscape the other person would of course said immediately you dont want to take up oil painting you should take up photography see but this is being helpful this is normally branded as being helpful constructive criticism man even has various labels for it one way or the other but then parentally children almost never are recognized as individuals by the parents they are recognized if at all as an extension of the ambitions of the parent and theyre just all over the place parents are busily trying to do life continuum on their ambitions you know and they take this poor little skinny runt you know this little runt of kid and papa who was fairly broad bruiser in his day you see he wanted to be star of the football team or something like this and nothing will do but what this poor little runt you see hes gotta get out there on the football field and get half killed you see every saturday the old man just never seems to notice that theres some stone difference between the two you see never seems to take this out you know the kid has the mathematical genius of being able to add up always two and two and get three six nine any number just think of number oh yes hes got to be mathematician because the old man wanted to be mathematician you see life continuums of various kinds and its odd how many people are walking around right now who actually fell for it went ahead and executed it and are being moderately unsuccessful successful and so forth in some walk of life well i tell you the armed services in any war can be utterly counted on to just dramatize this just flat out with shown teeth fellow walks up he says what have you been doing he says im garage mechanic he says and the navy will say to him inevitably and invariably deck force you know or what you really want to be is signalman how about cooks school and he walks up and he says well he says ive been merchant sailor and deck sailor for the last fifteen years and here are all of my tickets and that sort of thing very good the very very man we want youre yeoman instant and immediate response i mean its almost berserk and then they give tests that can be thrown any way you want to throw test called aptitude tests and i had lot of fun one time i took bunch of these tests it was very nice of the government to give these tests i spent all one day in some little town in pennsylvania where my records happened to be at the moment taking aptitude tests to find out how i should be rehabilitated as disabled veteran it was utterly fascinating they finally woke up at the other end that i ought to be playing an organ i never found out whether it was the handcrank variety or the pipe variety as matter of fact it was what was baffling to them is anytime they gave test i showed aptitude you see so they just took the one i didnt really want and that was that settled it but i malign them because they were very pleasant after the war and training up veterans and that sort of thing but anyway even these tests are about the cloudiest things for vocation you ever want to have anything to do with you look them over sometime you notice we dont use them we have them weve got tons of them ive investigated most of them only one test out of the commercial tests i was terribly interested in i was fascinated with this particular test because it was an anonymous test that employees could make out with regard to the management and their own bosses and so forth and you gave this test out to roomful of employees and then they marked down all their nasty unkind thoughts you see about the management and then they turned it in and management then knew what their employees thought of them i thought it was an awfully interesting test in that it was rather pointless management that is unimaginative enough to know what employees are thinking about it anyhow shouldnt be managing obvious what this score is well anyway that test was very good as matter of fact i figured out way for for them to boobytrap it and ive been very carefully not telling any psychologist how to boobytrap this test well you make it out you see and you have form number tiny printed figures form number you see you just number the chairs of the room and you have this form number of the test which goes undetected as different but its the number of each chair you see and the fellow turns it in and then you know who to fire you fire the fellow who says the kind things naturally from the psychologists point of view thats why i havent released it they are now running all kinds of lie detector tests on employees we actually have really started one in the us we are being copied like mad in the us just copied like mad its marvelous start worrying when nobody copies you dont worry about all the things theyre grabbing that are ours see start worrying when they dont do it and were sure leading the van because apparently every detective agency every employment agency and every psychologist has suddenly set himself up with battery emeters they are lousy emeters and they mean nothing but hes set himself up with them and theyre giving lie detector tests to everybody and its getting to be quite quite scandal so that even in australia they are publishing articles about how to ruin your home just bring in one of these things you see so these are the earmarks of success theres greater the greatest praise with which the public at large is capable of course is damning you thoroughly and if you want even greater praise have them lie about you but thats about as high as they come up the line because they they move off of this point you see they move off of this point onto copying imitating and the duplication gets little closer and little closer and little closer and all of sudden why there it is its nothing of nothing to be worried about when you see that sort of thing of course your hair kind of stands on end when you first see this but anyway everybody is now doing this and they are only hiring as i mentioned they are only hiring those people you see who get reaction on the machine of any kind whatsoever and if this trend of course is followed every able person in the country will be out of work interesting isnt it ah well theyll discover the error of their ways sooner or later and come around to the old stand and they covertly get on our bulletin lines which is quite interesting we have all sorts of joe doakeses and bill smykes sykeses and things like that in our mailing lists and so on in order to get bulletins and memberships and so on and these turn out to be the most interesting people when you run them down they turn out to be the head of mit or something like this you know and the weve suddenly started selling books in the united states to the most unlikely areas the army infantry school has just now officially put in orders for many scientology and dianetic books one invoice was sent to maybe there was just one at the moment but therell be more loyola university by the way uses dianetics modern science of mental health as textbook the catholic university that teaches priests interesting huh well the american psychiatric association the american psychological association spent rivers of money to get loyola to study psychiatry and psychology and after they succeeded in doing this and loyola set up an actual department to do this then the first book they ordered was dianetics modern science of mental health which i thought was pretty good theyre doing landoffice business in book sales these days to unlikely areas theres quite few of them have come in lately female voice american tel tel mmm female voice american tel tel have bought all of our books yeah yeah they got them all so dont dont worry about it dissemination goes out on covert line when youre being successful broadly it goes out on covert unlabeled copyist line and then keep moving up and eventually they establish it because of course theyll monkeying with this sort of thing theyll get into so much trouble that theyll need help sooner or later its like two guys were found someplace or another who were auditing each other and they hadnt clue they had just heard it on rumor line this is back in 1950 and they heard it on rumor line so they were auditing each other and what they were doing and somebody from 42 aberdeen road got ahold of them and spent all one night with them straightening them up teaching them how to audit and went away and left them and never had another report on it but they were in plenty of trouble theyd parked themselves all over the track and just messed themselves up gloriously but they could be straightened out all right back on this other thing the slambang attack that ones goals are up against are not confined of course to an antagonistic personality one himself has overts on the subject of other peoples goals and you can straighten that out too you see one has run all kinds of ambitions with regard to other peoples ambitions for instance right now theres tremendous ambition on the subject of russia to covertly take over small nations one after the other or dominate their political scene you see well saying russia shouldnt do this is actually invalidating russias goal to do this dont you see its simple ive also watched with some amazement the united states getting itself whipped up to go into an atomic war i think the deterrent factor has now been accepted by the public as the very best way to bruise off war the public attitude should now serve as deterrent evidently theyve collectively sort of gotten the idea somehow or another that that if the public is unwilling to go to war therefore they are not deterrent so all you have to say is youre willing to go to war and this is very deterrent because mr khrushchev counts totally on the decadent democracy each war its the decadent democracy you know the decadent democracy is not willing to engage in war so therefore of course he can do what he pleases and apparently this is all i read out of this i dont read any war dangers to amount to anything or id be helping out the washington organization to evacuate and so on which i am not nothings going to happen its just deterrent youre going to watch khrushchev back down on this hes going to back down fast and if that wins youre going to have nation of warmongers theyre going to say look we won of course i will admit that its mostly texans that theyve been interviewing anyway on the subject of goals the theres an interplay of goals and an individual who has countless just countless overts on other peoples goals well lets say music critic lets take him as profession he comes and sits down in the auditing chair as in the pcs chair and and hes in an auditing session and his profession is music critic and you start to do goals assessment well use your head auditor how many ambitions in the field of music do you suppose this boy has wrecked hm so you could start in as well as finding out who has stopped the pcs goal lines lets not go totally motivator about it lets also find out few of the goals that the pc has stopped you know what goals should be unknown some broad question of this character other peoples goals he will say yes yes well which one should just be forgotten completely you know and just not known oh man on some people youd get roaring automaticity as result of that question or that type of question whose goals should never be valid whose goals should never take place or form up or become reality what goals should be unknown of course tends to plow it out of the pc his unknowingnessocclusion button is then set to work and he starts showing stuff to the light of day so theres numbers of things you can do im just trying to show you theres numbers of things you can do by being very matteroffact and very flat about the whole thing in looking at this pc this pc is having trouble giving you goals all right then you had better get down to basic trouble with regard to goals you just better ask for it right now all right now lets take terminals assessment you see theres something wrong with pcs goals they give them to you slowly or or very very slowly or poky or dont seem to have many they give you unlimited numbers any one of these various things or they give you goals that they havent themselves anything to do with you could handle this by handling the factor of who has suppressed goals and whose goals that they have suppressed you got the idea all right now lets take terminals thats slightly different and we get back to lecture lecture back here in camden of 1954 wasnt it suzie yeah it was about 53 it was way late in the autumn of 53 granting of beingness most of youve heard this lecture well you know how scarce it is granting of beingness the willingness to grant beingness to somebody thats pretty scarce oh that tenet and that observation and so forth is still valid well apply that tenet to to assessment for terminals lets look it over if this persons very unwilling to grant beingness ahhah then this person would be rather unwilling to remember beingness you see they squashed beingnesses so that beingnesses must be on scarcity theres misemotion here with regard to the subj whole subject of beingness and therefore youre going to get terminals being out terminal lists then are hard to acquire or theyre too numerous and so forth you dont have as much trouble with terminals however as you do with goals but nevertheless remember that you could remedy difficulties with getting getting terminals list you could remedy them rather rapidly you could ask the individual ask the pc what type of beingness should remain unknown forever thats good broad statement what class what general class of beingness should just be forgotten not known never heard of again and so forth what what would be that well they start plowing up terminals for you the like of which you havent heard before dont you see all of sudden herere lot of terminals of course you dont ask that in conjunction with the assessment itself you just ask that in general you know just twoway comm sort of basis you know lets get this out of the road lets see if we can start any roaring automaticities going here and of course if an automaticity starts going why we continue to run what started it as process until we get it slowed down and all of sudden youll have pc whos assessing on terminals entirely differently theyll assess entirely differently because not granting of beingness is an effort to suppress beingness isnt it and if this is fairly prevalent and your pcs having difficulty giving you terminals then he must be having this trouble with beingness and he must be suppressing beingnesses so when he tries to think of terminal his automatic suppressors on the subject of beingness will squash the terminal out of existence and he wont be able to give you list thats as simple as that so you can take care of that any any type of question that says what beingnesses should be forgotten unknown skipped never looked at particularly what kind of beingness should just be ignored various types of questions this way add us up to some of the most innocuous sounding questions you ever heard of which add up mildly to the same thing which is what sort of person shouldnt you associate with that sounds like perfectly reasonable almost freudian sort of you know mild psychotherapeutic you know sort of question have your parents ever protested against certain types of association or something like that well youre asking them what beingness should be unknown not known forgotten gotten rid of gotten away with you know what type of personality is particularly detestable now youre much further afield but youd still produce some kind of result youre getting away from the core of the matter but its still still question that could be asked and youd say well now if you were in the business of manufacturing people what types would you keep off your list who would you never under any circumstances list as to be manufactured any any such type of oddball questioning of course is just notknow beingness and you can take the formula notknow beingness and extrapolate from it day and night for long time and still get material off the pc and you can set pc up for fast terminal assessment of course you could do the oddity of setting them up for clear you the whole thing blows if you treat it in this particular line you know dont you that it isnt necessary to run the terminal to make clears you you know that dont you i mean that you can assess person through to clear and it will happen for some reason or other you just never seem to find the goal and maybe you find the goal and you find goal that sticks and you say this is marvelous and then you assess the terminal and then you cant find any terminal and so forth and go back and check the goal and you cant find that goal anymore and you say well where the devil have i wound up here you know and now you go back all over it again and youve got to do another goals assessment you see what i mean then you find goal that hangs up for whole session and then you start in looking for terminal for the goal and it all goes into mush and its nowhere and you go back and check the goal and its gone now and you could keep doing this and run person through to clear i mean it can happen remarkable number of cases will do this and this should change your attitude toward you must find goal that sticks because this will occur that you will every now and then find pc thats not even rare in fact quite ordinary youll find pc who doesnt have any goals stick at all they just goals assess to clear pretty soon why all of sudden the needle is splop you know needles coasting youre not getting any registry and so forth what do you do now well you goals assess to stable clear thats what you do now got the idea and then another type as i just said you goals assess the case and find the goal hurrah hurrah hurrah and were all set now and all weve got to do now is find the terminal you set the person up for terminals for that goal and you never find terminal and you go back and you check the goal and its gone got the idea get off of your anxiety that you must must must find the pcs goal see what youre trying to do is clear the person by assessment its different action now if their goals go too numerous and the needle is not getting loose and the tone arm is not getting better and so forth now this is the case we were talking about where you have to do some work on the case to get this malfunction out of the road the person hasnt given you any goals the persons having great difficulty giving you goals you get the idea well thats person who has such heavy bug on goals thats sitting right there that you just cant really get an assessment going if person is assessing easily and youre doing good job of assessment and your rudiments all stay in and so forth you can assess person straight through to clear just on goals alone never even get to terminal and you can assess person through to goal and the goal hangs and you never get through with terminal to run you just never find terminal that fits the goal you find lot of terminals but then you go back and check the goal and you you cant get anyplace with that line thats it youve run that one completely out now youve got to go back and find more goals and this is on gradient scale the next step up from that is you find the goal and then you find the terminal and then you assess the terminal on the prehav scale and thats it youve had it you cant find any level for the terminal on the prehav scale well then you go back and check the terminal and you find out it longer registers now you go back and check the goal you find the goal registers little bit so youll find another terminal for that goal you see all right now youve got that terminal and you get terminal and youve got the terminal all pegged and its right there and you open your mouth to get it onto the prehav scale and you dont make it and then you run it back and you check for that goal and the goal is now gone then you have nothing to do but to return to another goals assessment you got the idea you see if youre trying to find something if that is the basic goal of all of your assessments if youre youve got to find the goal and if you have mocked it up so that you have failed if youve failed to find the pcs goal you see youre just going in the wrong direction entirely that isnt that isnt correct you see what youre trying to do is clear person well clearing person consists of getting the stuck goals and stuck terminals off the case you got the idea so youre really taking the goals and terminals off the case and if you have to take them off with by finding terminal and then assessing the terminal on the prehav scale and then running the terminal on the prehav scale on and on and on dont you see thats the way youve got to go about it and then run it for lots of hours and so forth to loosen it up well all right thats how you had to go about it dont worry about that but you see thats why the fast short assessment to find the goal and terminal so that you can run it and run the person through to clear is not valid approach its not valid piece of thinkingness that is that youve got to find the goal and then find the terminal and then find it on the prehav scale and run it and that is the only way to make clear you see thats not valid approach that would be the rougher clear level you see youre going to make it that way but thats going to take longer the approach is youre trying to knock out the stuck goals and the stuck terminals that have got this pc fixed in various game conditions which prevent him from escaping into existence again thats what youre trying to do so if youll just change your level of orientation there and what youre trying to do all of sudden why you can draw long breath and youll find your assessments are much smoother much happier dont you see and if this pc doesnt seem to be getting any meter changes by reason of assessment you know youre assessing the pc but youre getting meter changes then you can assume that you have leaped off with case that isnt going to give you any goals or theres something wrong with goals at large or goals in general and you certainly better straighten this case up so just to be on the safe side straighten all cases up on the subject of goals before you start to do goals assessment and every so often during goals assessments or reorient the person on the subject of goals what class of person is particularly hard on goals you know give list of people that you wouldnt want to have have goals give list of people whose goals are not very acceptable and he comes back with gangsters politicians psychiatrists you know and he comes down and hes thought each one of these over and hes decided their goals are not acceptable well you could take this list and run different approach on the thing and that is you could ask him one two three ask him just this what goals of psychiatrist have you combated you know this is just light run sort of thing this is not anything you would do as profession for the next five hundred hours but this guy will come up with the fact well they just shouldnt hurt people and they shouldnt do this and they shouldnt do that and they shouldnt do something or other and they shouldnt accept peoples money without giving them any benefit in return and so on well you say well form these up into goals i mean what are the goals well they dont have any goals well they must have some kind of goal all right well what goals do you think they would have do you see oh well they have this kind of goal and that kind of goal and they have the goal to hurt people and they have the goal to do this and they have the goal to do that all right now have you been in combat with that type of goal oh yes yes i have been all right now what are you can you run back now and find exact times when you have actively combated those goals oh well yeah well thats pretty hard to do you know and then he spots one and he spots another and he spots another and he spots another and he spots another and he spots another and you say well thats it youre not getting much needle action now so you say well thats it were not going to go any further along that line all right now lets take up this gangster all right what gangster goals well this time he knows what youre talking about so hes grooved in what gangster goals have you objected to well i havent really objected to any gangster goals as matter of fact i was gangster in my last lifetime something like that blows off that sort of is out of the road now and now we take politician what political goals well the goal of hiring young men at slave wages to go out and shoot other young men because theyre wearing different uniform i i think thats bad goal well now exactly what is that goal and the guy will think for long time then hell decide nationalism yes nationalism is bad goal yeah they have the goal of nationalism yeah their goal well now have you ever actively combated such goal oh yes yes yes oh yes yes used to make speeches and that sort of thing nationalism combated these goals what other goals in that area were you combating well theres soandso and soandso and soandso and soandso all right okay okay well now how about your immediate family any of them very hard on goals or any of them have goals oh well my brother my god my brother he always wanted to play the pianer was there something wrong with that oh yeah he was just obsessed all the time he wanted to play the pianer of course he hes with sammy kaye now at and so forth but gee he always wanted to play the pianer all the time youll notice this guys kind of sighing hes looking at failed overt on goals see he didnt want his brother to play pianer but his brother went and played the pianer and now his brothers being very successful and he has hollywood beauties standing ten deep around the the baby grand you know big failed overt you can start sorting these things out and it isnt the aggregate of small things what you are really looking for is some crashers see were looking for the unknown people here were looking for the squelchers and so forth were looking for the incidents where ones goals really started to blow up in smoke you know and just went blooey or when one really got to somebody else and blew all of his goals up blooey see for instance i know several people at the present moment that you undoubtedly couldnt goals assess you just couldnt goals assess because every single ambition dianetics and scientology ever announcedly had these people were violently against and theyre just violently against them so youre assessing them with the understood goal of freeing them how are they going to make it how are they going to make it well the only way you could make them make it is theyd have to pick up all their overts and attitudes against dianetics and scientology and then they possibly could make it but theyve stood in the line of any goal that we had for man or anything else now handling pc has lot to do with it because you handle the pc you are auditing and when you get glib enough and smooth enough with your tools and you feel very sure of these tools you can sound very matteroffact in the use of these tools but lets put it another way when you have had some wins you will start getting very matteroffact you see that and youll all of sudden find that your tools are much easier to use see so it works both ways and what you need are some wins basically and what you need is to get those wins is very relaxed attitude and and just an application of exactly what youre doing in order to get that forward now ive shaken out of the hamper for my money anything that was wrong with goals assessing i think ive got taped now and its all right with if anybody anyplace in the world wants to run goals assessments this is okay with theyre not going to do anybody any damage but for heavens sake keep on assessing i mean lets keep going here and lets not get some wild idea this is what they were doing somebody would get some wild idea that this fellows goal really is you know they just make it up out of the blue and foist this goal off on him and say thats it isnt it yeah well dont bother to look at the emeter and then get terminal you see that fits the goal very nicely thats all set theyre very easy to do that all theyre reading is arc break you see and then they go tearing off on the prehav scale and they run this thing madly and they say well were going to make clear well thats not so had to be much more skilled in assessment than that believe but keep assessing just go on assessing if you just went on assessing and checking through youd sooner or later reach the stop point where it became obvious to one and all that you either werent going to clear this case by just running out all goals and all terminals by assessments you see but that you had come to total stuck yeah goal had stuck and there wasnt single thing you could do to free that goal that was it that was there and then you pick up all the cause effect both ends of the goal you know the line of the goal the person that wants to do it and the person its to be done to or something like that you pick up both ends of the goal and list those things and just keep listing them and listing them and listing them and listing them and going on and on and on until one sticks and if one doesnt stick just keep on going and eventually you can get nothing to react in the way of terminals and so forth go back and examine the goal and youll find the goal has probably blown up at this point youve run out all the beingnesses that had to do with that particular goal now youve got to do goals assessment all over the top but the game is assessing assessing is clearing if you want clear do good assessment this is what is emerging as people have gone ahead and done lot of auditing and as lot of results have emerged here and there they have all emerged on assessment the runs of the terminal flattening that and then reassessing and all clears have emerged on that pattern and clears have not emerged in any other pattern the only other technique of clearing i know of is familiarizing the pc with the bank so expertly that he longer has any slightest qualms of facing even the most unknown portions of his bank and he will eventually blow clear and its done by gradient scales and ive never been able to teach anybody to do it this other one is surefire and auditors far away from supervision are making it with it and so forth so you just have to say well thats the way to clear people now as far as preparatory steps are concerned preparatory steps as contained in routine 1 and routine 2 and routine 1a that sort of thing these preparatory steps are very valid and very valuable preparatory steps but i wouldnt use them any longer than was necessary to put the pc in shape to be assessed how long do you use routines 1 2 or 1a you use them long enough to put the pc in shape where he can be assessed well and then you go to town on assessment and there is faster method of handling this and better definition of how you go about it and i think your own experience so far tends to bear that out and you get little bit more experience along this line of assessment and you are really going to see this thing borne out like mad so get to be demons on the subject of assessment in the last two lectures ive stressed nothing else but assessment this requires of course pretty smooth matteroffact auditing invalidation of the pc just carrying on putting them all down doing workmanlike job knowing where youre going and knowing what youre doing the pc communicates to him he goes ahead and he gets in there and he saws on down the line and his anxieties start coming off and he starts straightening up and he gets more and more insession the more insession he is why of course the faster he clears as running it is concerned you dont need much experience or practice in running the thing because weve had lots of auditing on this we need experience right now in assessing how to set case up for assessing how to assess case and what to expect from an assessment and then at the end of all of this how to check and reassess and all of those things are very skilled activities you can invalidate pc out of existence you know i mean you can you can take goals assessment terminal assessment you can just invalidate the pc down to nothing but you have to be pretty crude you have to be actually kind of overtly snide about the whole thing or there has to be something in the attitude which is all wrong or you have to be doing it in some fashion which is totally totally totally contrary to insessionness or the auditors code or something like that the error has to be very gross to do poor assessment and if your pc isnt progressing i am charitable enough to assume its because the pc has such wide bug on just the subject of goals that you cannot penetrate that particular barrier without letting some sunshine in on the subject first and on terminals well he has such large bug on beingness that you cannot get anyplace with the beingness so as result why youve got to do something desperate about beingnesses well right along with this emerges this brandnew tool which is the an old tool in theory but was never really applied successfully in practice because the whole ramification of it you see the ow was missing on the early notknow we didnt have ow when we were first using notknow and forget so therefore it didnt have the horsepower to climb the hill and the ow gives it the horsepower who should be forgotten if you forgot something who or what would have been gotten even with what forgettingness would get even with them interesting question who or what would be confused by your forgetting is enough question that on trying to answer at once all the somatics pcs got could and have blown in just trying to answer it once every somatic the pc had blew up of course it was half hour attempt to answer but answer was ever really given so you see as soon as this is combined with ow and as soon as its combined with goals and as soon as its combined with terminals you make that various type of combination there why you should be able to straighten out any pc rapidly that is having lot of difficulty trying to give you some goals you see or is very afraid you will invalidate his goals or thinks the erasure of the goal or the testing of the goal is an invalidation of the goal dont you see you have to be very careful of that well if pc is getting all arc broke on this subject he must have whole lot of bugs on the subject of goals so lets take these up with him you see as sort of of necessary rudiment to goals assessment hmmm and i want you to try that out in giving your sessions now and just try and find out how this pc of yours is oriented on the subject of goals are goals something one must never have are goals something one must make up are goals something one must stamp all over what what whats the orientation you can get that orientation as i gave you earlier in the lecture by using notknow forget people what kind of person you know that kind of thing and smoke it out youre liable to blow some secondaries youre liable to get some action youre liable to throw some engrams into view of course you understand that every execution is simply an invalidation of the goal of living thats why the state does it the most effective invalidation of life known is to kill somebody and thats very successful thats also the most equal thing there is dead men now i wasnt chipping away at the philosophy of equality in democracy because thomas jefferson was absolutely right all men are born with equal rights under law i notice though he didnt at the same time say all men are equal and i notice that the democracies today have gotten this as on the third string of their violin as the most monotonous chant that you ever heard all men are equal well the inequalities of men start showing up in all directions when you clear one and one remains unclear youve got an inequality like mad its its an observable fact its contrary to life so we must assume then i have just little while ago figured out the most equal man i could think of and of course thats dead man all dead men are equal to all dead men so now we know which way theyre going snide remarks all right well have good auditing session tonight and have good weekend and ill see you next week
