racial discrimination xenophobia and related intolerance wcar held in durban south africa at wcar participating governments including the united states sought to recommend ways for the international community to address racism the united states withdrew from wcar because of what it viewed as participating governments disproportionate focus on israel as perpetrator of racism and intolerance in the middle east the george w bush administration has not participated in review conference preparations and voted against resolutions supporting or funding the conference because of concerns that it may repeat the perceived mistakes of wcar the administration has stopped short of announcing it will boycott the conference likely recognizing that new administration will make the final decision on us participation canada and israel announced that they will boycott the review conference and other governments announced they will not participate unless it is demonstrated that the review conference will not target israel congressional perspectives on us participation in the review conference vary some members of the 110th congress have introduced legislation supporting us participation in the conference arguing that the united states should play an active role in combating international racism see for example hres 1361 other members contend that the united states should not participate or fund the conference because of wcars focus on israel see samdt 4264 to sconres 70 specifically they propose that the united states withhold proportionate share of its assessed contributions that fund the conference because assessed contributions finance the regular budget in its entirety and not specific parts of it withholding funds in this manner would not affect the review conference for many us participation or nonparticipation in the review conference touches on the broader issue of us engagement in the system supporters contend that us participation in efforts such as the review conference is important to the success and credibility of the united nations as whole opponents maintain that us engagement in the conference would give undeserved legitimacy to mechanisms that

conference against racism review conference some members of congress and the bush administration are concerned that the review conference will repeat the perceived mistakes of the world conference against racism racial discrimination xenophobia and related intolerance wcar which was held in durban south africa from august 31 to september 7 2001 at wcar participating governments including the united states sought to acknowledge and recommend ways for the international community to address racism and related intolerance the conference attracted significant amount of national and international attention because of what many viewed as participating governments disproportionate focus on israel as perpetrator of racism and intolerance in the middle east the united states withdrew from wcar when in its view it became clear that governments particularly members of the organization of the islamic conference oic1 would continue to target israel while contemporary forms of racism remained unaddressed in december 2006 the general assembly adopted resolution calling for durban review conference to assess the implementation of wcars main outcome documents the durban declaration and program of action the bush administration opposes the review conference and has not participated in the preparatory process or voted for resolutions supporting or funding it the final decision regarding us participation in the review conference however will fall to the next administration other countries including canada and israel have announced that they will boycott the conference and some governments stated they will not participate unless it is clear that the conference will not target israel members of the 110th congress demonstrated continued interest in the durban review

of congress recognized the importance of combating racism internationally and have proposed and passed resolutions urging the george w bush administration to engage in diplomatic efforts to ensure that the review conference does not further discredit efforts to address racism by disproportionately focusing on israel2 members of the 111th congress will likely consider number of issues when conducting oversight of the review conference and determining appropriate levels of us participation and financial contributions some suggest for example that ongoing review conference preparations indicate that certain member states will continue to target israel others are concerned about the potential diplomatic or political impact of us participation or lack thereof some for instance maintain that the question of us participation in the review conference is inherently linked to the larger issue of us participation in international organizations some are concerned that selective approach to us engagement in the united nations may damage the reputation and negotiating influence of the united states both within and outside of the system opponents however contend that us participation in the review conference contradicts the objectives of the conference and would provide legitimacy to mechanisms that allow member states to criticize israel in the context of racism this report provides background information on previous efforts to address racism and the 2001 world conference against racism the report further discusses the objectives of the durban review

world conference against racism and the upcoming durban review conference are part of broader efforts to address racism and racial discrimination previous efforts since the united nations was established in 1945 member states have sought to address racism both in the broader context of human rights and as standalone issue member states for instance incorporated the idea of racial equality into international documents such as the charter in 1945 and the universal 2 for specific examples of congressional interest in the review conference see the us response under the 2009 durban review conference section crs3 declaration of human rights in 19483 through the 1960s member states negotiated and ratified international agreements and declarations that addressed the issue the international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination icerd for example requires parties to condemn and work to eliminate discrimination in all of its forms regardless of race sex language or religion4 the treaty which entered into force on january 4 1969 has been ratified or acceded to by 173 member states it was ratified by the united states on october 21 19945 member states have also addressed racism through bodies such as the subcommission on prevention of discrimination and protection of minorities the main subsidiary body of the commission on human rights now the human rights council6 in 1993 the human rights council appointed special rapporteur on racism racial discrimination and xenophobia to report to member states on contemporary forms of racism7 in the past three decades member states have focused on raising global awareness of racism and taking measures to address the issue through decades against racism and three global antiracism conferences8 during each decade 3 article 1 of the charter treaty notes the importance of racial equality stating that the united nations should achieve international cooperation in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race sex language or religion the charter was signed on june 26 1945 and entered into force on october 24 1945 the universal declaration of human rights which is nonbinding states everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this declaration without distinction of any kind such as race colour sex language religion political or other opinion article 2 the declaration was adopted by the general assembly on december 10 1948 with 48 in favor including the united states zero against and eight abstentions 4 icerd also establishes committee on the elimination of racial discrimination to review reports from parties about their implementation of convention provisions and to examine complaints by parties the treaty was adopted and opened for signature and ratification by general assembly resolution 2106 xx december 21 1965 5 icerd entered into force for the united states on november 20 1994 6 the subcommission was established by the human rights commission during the commissions first session in 1946 it was comprised of independent experts who conducted studies and made recommendations to the commission concerning the prevention of discrimination of any kind relating to human rights and the protections of racial national or religious minorities in 1999 the economic and social council changed the title to the subcommission on the promotion and protection of human rights when the human rights commission was replaced by the human rights council in 2006 the

conference in durban south africa9 at each conference member states negotiated programs of action that would be implemented by governments and specialized agencies funds and programs some member state efforts to address racism in fora have been controversial probably the most notorious effort occurred in 1975 when member states adopted general assembly resolution 3379 which stated that zionism is form racism and racial discrimination10 the united states strongly opposed the resolution stating that it treated racism not as serious injustice but as an epithet to be flung at whoever sic happens to be ones adversary11 sixteen years later on december 16 1991 the general assembly adopted resolution to revoke resolution 337912 despite its repeal many argue that the adoption of resolution 3379 greatly diminished the credibility of efforts to address racism and had lasting and adverse effect on relations among member states particularly among israel and other middle eastern countries13 us role the united states did not participate in the 1978 and 1985 world conferences against racism because of its strong opposition to resolution 337914 the bush administration decided however to participate in the 2001 world conference against racism in large part because of the 1991 general assembly decision to revoke resolution 3379 8 continued events or disadvantaged groups including refugees the disabled and women in 1966 the general assembly named march 21 the international day for the elimination of racism discrimination 9 the first decade against racism focused on measures to implement various treaties addressing racism and racial discrimination the first world conference against racism was held in geneva switzerland in 1978 the second decade against racism emphasized recourse procedures for victims of racial discrimination and focused on the elimination of apartheid at the second world conference against racism held in geneva in 1982 participants reviewed and

efforts to address racism has varied over time members have supported mechanisms that address racism such as icerd15 on the other hand congress has condemned the efforts of some member states to address racism that appear to target israel many members were particularly critical of general assembly resolution 3379 and adopted joint resolution condemning its passage16 members also generally agreed with the us decisions not to participate in the first two decades against racism and first two world conferences against racism17 the 2001 world conference against racism the world conference

language in february 2001 at the asian regional preparatory meeting in iran members of the organization of the islamic conference oic included language in the regions outcome documents that appeared to target israel28 some of the controversial text from the regional meeting was incorporated into the outcome documents negotiated at the conference initial drafts of the wcar declaration for example included language that equated zionism with racism29 some countries including the united states canada and members of the european union strongly objected to these sentiments they argued that wcar was the wrong forum in which to raise the israelpalestine issue and emphasized that individual countries and regional conflicts should not be singled out in conference outcome documents countries in support of the text argued that the israeli occupation of palestine was racially motivated and therefore should be addressed at wcar the administration emphasized that it would not participate in the conference if language in the draft outcome documents continued to target israel30 consequently there were some questions regarding the level and extent of us 25 continued department of state and the

compensation for slavery at the african regional meeting in senegal in 2001 participating governments agreed to language that requested an apology from states involved in the slave trade as well as compensation and reparations for victims of racial discrimination and slavery32 some of this proposed language was included in the outcome documents considered at durban the draft program of action for example urged countries to protect against racism by ensuring that all persons have access to adequate remedies and adequate reparations for damage resulting from racial discrimination the draft declaration also expressed explicit and unreserved apologies to victims of slavery and their heirs33 the transatlantic slave trade in particular was cited several times in the draft outcome documents in july 2001 the administration called the specific mention of transatlantic slavery in the proposed durban drafts extreme and unbalanced noting that its mention was selective and inconsistent with

reparations and would continue to do so assistant secretary wood further stated that the united states was ready to join wcar participants in expressing regret for historic injustices such as slavery

congressional response to wcar some members of congress viewed wcar as crucial international mechanism for combating racism and supported full us participation others however were concerned that language in the draft outcome documents appeared to target israel and urged the administration not to participate if such language remained39 some members viewed wcar as an opportunity to address historic and contemporary factors that may have contributed to presentday racism they urged the administration to participate regardless of controversial text in the draft outcome documents arguing that the united states could bring balance to the issue40 some members also viewed the conference as an opportunity for the united states to acknowledge its role in the transatlantic slave trade and

that the united states should not allow one issue to overshadow the conferences overall purpose of combating racism45 wcar outcomes the durban declaration and program of action after the united states and israel withdrew from the conference the remaining member states engaged in series of intense and difficult negotiations that resulted in wcars main outcome documents the durban declaration and program of action46 these documents created international definitions and established new mechanisms to address racism and other related issues in the program of action for example governments agreed

requested that ohchr work with five independent experts to follow up on the implementation of provisions in the declaration and program of action50 the outcome documents also urged member states to establish and implement national policies and action plans to address racism racial discrimination and related intolerance51 some observers expressed concern that wcars focus on israel and palestine overshadowed other aspects of the conference some for example spoke positively of the outcome documents focus on the vital role of human rights institutions in combating racism many supported the outcome documents focus on education and the role of good governance in addressing racial discrimination52 yet some maintain that wcars focus on israel and palestine diverted attention from subjects that they believe wcar should have addressed more effectively such as the rights of indigenous people53 and specific instances of contemporary racism such as caste discrimination in india54 prior to the adoption of the declaration and program of action however some governments disassociated themselves from or expressed reservations about specific provisions in the text particularly those that addressed the situation in the middle east the impact of historic injustices such as slavery and colonialism and the rights of indigenous peoples55 some countries also disagreed with text that appeared to equate colonialism with slavery and genocide56 49 the discrimination unit now called the antiracial discrimination unit compiles data on racism provides legal and administrative support to

independent state57 they also called for the the end of violence and the swift resumption of negotiations in the middle east the outcome documents did not include text equating zionism with racism members of the european union viewed the final language as an improvement over previous drafts that appeared to repeatedly target israel other countries however maintained that the situation in the middle east should not be addressed at wcar because it was political situation rather than racial one canada in particular disassociated itself from text that directly or indirectly mentioned the situation in the middle east58 conversely some countries argued that the text did not go far enough to address the situation in the palestinian territories59 provisions on slavery and reparations the declaration acknowledged slavery and the slave trade including the transatlantic slave trade as crime against humanity and invited the international community to express regret or remorse for slavery60 the program of action also recognized that slavery has undeniably contributed to poverty and underdevelopment61 it urged countries to reinforce protection against racism by ensuring that all persons enjoy the right to seek just and adequate reparations from damage resulting from discrimination62 further it recognized the need to develop programs for the social and economic development of societies impacted by historic injustices such as slavery63 it called on developed countries and the system to support development mechanisms particularly in africa64 the outcome documents did not call for reparations or an explicit apology 57 paragraph 161 of the program of action calls for respect for international human rights and humanitarian law as well as for the principle of selfdetermination and the end of all suffering thus allowing israel and the palestinians to resume the peace process and to develop and prosper in security and freedom 58 representatives from canada stated we are not satisfied with this conference not enough time has been dedicated to advancing its objectives we believe we have said in the clearest possible terms that it was inappropriate wrong to address the palestinian israel conflict in this forum document aconf18912 p 119 59 for this reason iran dissociated itself with text addressing the middle east document aconf18912 pp 125126 60

documents in march 2002 the general assembly adopted resolution on the durban declaration and program of action that endorsed the implementation of the outcome documents urged member states to create national action plans and policies to combat slavery and called for the creation of the antidiscrimination unit and group of experts to follow up on implementation of durban outcomes66 one hundred and thirtyfour countries voted for the resolution two opposed it united states and israel and two abstained australia and canada when explaining its vote the united states stated that because it withdrew from the wcar it did not agree to the durban declaration and program of action it opposed the creation of the discrimination unit and the group of experts arguing that the cost of the new mechanisms would place additional pressure on the regular budget67 nongovernmental organization ngo forum representatives from local national and international ngos held an ngo forum parallel to the conference in durban68 at its conclusion forum participants agreed to the ngo wcar declaration which number of observers viewed as an unbalanced document that disproportionately focused on israel specifically the declaration called for the end of israeli systematic perpetration of racist crimes including war crimes acts of genocide and ethnic cleansing and declared israel racist apartheid state69 because

sentiments and activities96 in november 2008 however israel formally announced it would not participate in the conference stating that the conference appears to be heading once again towards becoming an antiisrael tribunal which has nothing to do with fighting racism97 high commissioner for human rights navanethem pillay urged countries that announced they may not participate in the conference to reconsider she argued that the antiracism debate and agenda will be significantly compromised without the participation of all countries98 issues for congress members of the 111th congress may wish to consider number of issues when conducting oversight and considering us funding for the durban review conference and possible followup activities balance in the durban review preparatory process bush administration officials and some members of congress have suggested that the united states should participate in the durban review conference only if it is proven that the conference will 1 focus primarily on the implementation of the durban declaration and program of action and 2 not become vehicle for anti semitism consequently members of the 111th congress may wish to consider member state actions during the review conference preparatory process scope of the review conference during the preparatory process participating governments have aimed to determine the scope and agenda of the conference countries such as australia canada and israel and members of the european union maintain that the conference should focus primarily on member state and system implementation of the durban

conference preparatory committee elected bureau of 21 members group of 21 to determine conference modalities and objectives103 number of conference observers and participants have expressed concern about the composition of the group which includes countries that expressed antiisrael sentiments at wcar including iran indonesia and senegal104 some are particularly concerned that libya and cuba states that many view as antiisraeli and antidemocratic are bureau chair and vicechairperson rapporteur organizational meetings and intergovernmental working group drafts to prepare for the review conference participating governments have attended several organizational meetings to consider the scope and agenda of the review conference105 some governments also have participated in meetings of the newly established intersessional openended intergovernmental working group of the preparatory committee which is tasked with reviewing recommendations 100 disagreements over review conference objectives are reflected in member state votes for and against general assembly and human rights council resolutions that address conference objectives and funding australia canada and the united states for example voted against resolution ac362l65rev1 november 27 2007 in the general assemblys third committee because it seemed to contradict previous consensus that the review conference will focus on implementation of wcar outcomes rather than issues negotiated at wcar including contemporary forms of racism and intolerance 101 on february 27 2008 president bush appointed special envoy to

crs20 submitted by countries and other stakeholders for possible inclusion in the review conference outcome document106 some have expressed concern with drafts proposed by the working group in may 2008 for example the working group circulated list of issues that may be included in the conference outcome document the list specifically referred to the plight of the palestinian people and stated that the situation in the occupied palestinian territories violates range of civil and political rights107 regional meeting outcome documents many governments have already met at regional sessions where they shared best practices for combating racism and negotiated text to be incorporated into the review conference outcome documents two regions latin america and the caribbean and africa held regional sessions and agreed to regional outcome documents the asian and european regional groups agreed to an outcome document without holding regional meetings108 the outcome documents from the africa and asia regional sessions have again generated controversy among some conference participants and observers due to their apparent focus on the israelpalestine conflict and to lesser extent on reparations and compensation for slavery some view the africa outcome document as unbalanced because it focuses on islamophobia as particularly serious form of religious hatred and refers to the plight of the palestinian people under foreign occupation109 it also urges states to issue formal apologies to victims of colonialism and historic injustices110 and calls upon the review conference to address the issue of reparations for people of african descent111 similarly the asian outcome document expresses deep concern for the plight of palestinian refugees who were forced to leave their homes because of war and 106 the intersessional openended working group was proposed by the group of 21 and created at the first substantive session in may 2008 it met in geneva from may 25 to 30 2008

african descent with reference to paragraphs 164 165 and 166 of the durban programme of action several provisions also mention slavery and the trans atlantic slave trade preamble and paragraphs 60 62 crs21 racial policies of the occupying power112 it reemphasizes the responsibility to provide international protection for the palestinian people under occupation and calls for an international effort to bring foreign occupation together with all its racial practices to an end in jerusalem113 the document reaffirms that foreign occupation founded on settlements contradicts the charter and constitutes violation of international human rights and new kind of apartheid crime against humanity form of genocide and serious threat to peace and security114 the asian document also reiterates its call on states to apologize and pay reparations for slavery and the slave trade115 the outcome document agreed to by the latin american and caribbean states does not refer to the situation in the middle east it identifies the need for progress in the implementation of measures to ensure just and adequate reparation for victims of racism116 it also reiterates concerns regarding violence and discrimination committed against individuals on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity117 draft review conference outcome document as of october 16 2008 on october 27 2008 the office of the high commissioner for human rights published compilation of review conference outcome document proposals submitted by delegations during the second substantive session of the review conference preparatory committee118 the compilation reflects member discussions and contributions to the review conference draft outcome document as of october 16 2008119 text that has been objected to by certain member states was placed in brackets bracketed for further discussion in the coming months the intersessional openended intergovernmental working group will continue to negotiate the outcome document and report back to the third substantive session of the preparatory committee which will be held in geneva from april 15 to 29 2009 some are concerned that text in the october 18 2008 draft outcome document both bracketed and nonbracketed focuses disproportionately on israel and possibly limits freedom of expression one section for example reiterates concern about the plight of the palestinian people and other inhabitants of arab territories under 112 contribution of the asian region to the durban review conference october 8 2008 paragraph 26 113 ibid paragraphs 27 and 18 114

draft document crs22 foreign occupation120 another section condemns the fact that the palestinian people continue to be denied the fundamental right to self determination121 additionally some argue that the text could provide countries with authority to censor the media and invade the private lives of citizens based on their own definition of racism122 some are also apprehensive about draft language that appears to focus on discrimination against islam to the exclusion of other religions123 moreover some maintain that sections of the draft outcome document for the review conference were already discussed and agreed to at wcar in 2001124 according to some such concerns indicate that the review conference will likely revive the controversies that surrounded wcar by focusing on israel others argue however that the draft outcome document is still in its preliminary stages and emphasize that the final outcome document to be considered at the review conference has not been negotiated or finalized supporters point to the difference between early wcar drafts in 2001 that equated zionism with racism and the final durban declaration and program of action which contained in the view of many relatively moderate language by comparison us funding of the review conference bush administration officials have indicated that the united states will not fund the review conference or its preparatory process unless it is proven that the conference will not become platform for antisemitic behavior125 the final decision regarding us funding of the conference however will be made by the barack obama administration or members of the 111th congress if the 111th congress does not enact legislation prohibiting us funding for the review conference the obama administration may decide on its own to withhold the us proportionate share of us contributions prior to the conference if such scenario occurred it would raise the question as to whether the administration would release funding for after the conference if the outcome was acceptable to the united states 120 section one part b paragraph 136 document aconf211pcwg2crp1 121 section one part b paragraph 137 document aconf211pcwg2crp1 in addition other bracketed language reaffirms that foreign occupation founded on settlements constitutes serious violation of human rights and humanitarian law new kind of apartheid crime against humanity form of genocide and serious threat to international peace and security section four part paragraph 9 122 section five paragraph 16 of the draft outcome document urges states to adopt and enforce legal and administrative measures at the national and local levels or to strengthen existing measures with the aim of preventing and punishing expressly and specifically contemporary forms of racism racial discrimination xenophobia and related intolerance in public and private life 123 section one part paragraph 41 some of the most worrying trends since 2001 include racioreligious profiling and discrimination defamation of muslims their faith and beliefs 124 see for example shattering the red lines the durban ii draft declarationun watch october 2008 and releases new draft of the durban ii final document eye on the november 8 2008 125 see us response section for more information crs23 specifically some members of the 110th congress proposed that the united states withhold proportionate share of its assessed contributions approximately 22 from the regular budget which is used to fund the conference withholding funds in this manner would not affect the conference because assessed contributions finance the regular budget in its entirety and not specific parts of it the us decision to withhold proportionate share of funding from the human rights council for fy2008126 would not affect funding for the durban review conference or its preparatory process because funding for both mechanisms falls under separate parts of the budget of the office of the high commissioner for human rights127 as of november 17 2008 the secretarygeneral estimates that the cost of the review conference and its preparatory process will be 3754800128 however the secretarygeneral will seek only 570400 in additional funding because he anticipates that the balance of 3184400 will be absorbed by other related parts of the regular budget129 wcar outcome documents and us participation some suggest that the united states should participate in and provide funding for the durban review conference in part because the final text that addresses the situation in israel and palestine in the durban declaration and program of action was significantly toned down from drafts that led to the us withdrawal130 some argue that the us and israeli withdrawals from wcar were turning point in negotiations and sent powerful diplomatic message to conference participants they contend that the withdrawals pressured other governments to adopt more moderate language on the middle east in the final outcome documents131 126 the department of state foreign operations and related programs appropriation act 2008 division j of the consolidated appropriations act 2008 pl 110161 congress prohibits us contributions to support the council unless 1 the secretary of state certifies to the committees on appropriations that council funding is in the national interest of the united states or

jewish nation were removed from the conferences final outcome document serge schmemann new york times september 9 2001 also see israels reaction to the conclusion of the conference against racism continued crs24 conversely some contend that the language in the declaration and program of action remains unacceptable to the united states to support this view opponents point to the bush administrations policy of consistently voting against resolutions supporting the review conference in fora they maintain that the declaration and program of action unfairly single out one regional conflict and refer to the plight of only one party the palestinians with mention of israel132 political and diplomatic impact of us engagement for some the question of us participation or nonparticipation in the durban review conference touches on the broader issue of us engagement in the system supporters contend that us participation in efforts such as the review conference is important to the success and credibility of the united nations as whole they argue that instead of withdrawing from conferences that have processes or outcomes it opposes the united states should fully participate and work from within to build member state coalitions in support of us policies if the united states does not fully participate in fora some argue member state actions might be determined by groups of member states advocating agendas that are contrary to us interests they maintain that us absence from such efforts could create vacuum in which views opposed by the united states hold supreme133 supporters contend that piecemeal and selective approach to participation in the united nations damages the us negotiating position and its influence both within and outside of the system134 moreover some argue that us engagement in human rights efforts such as the review conference provides valuable international tool for groups and individuals battling racism in countries where human rights is not priority 131 continued in durban and the conclusion of the durban conference comments by israeli leaders and officials israel ministry of foreign affairs press releases september 9 2001 132 rep tom lantos the durban debacle an insiders view of the world conference against racism the fletcher forum on world affairs the fletcher school of law and diplomacy tufts university vol 26i winterspring 2002 133 such perspectives apply to united statesunited nations relations beyond wcar and the durban review conference in 1974 for example during the 29th session of the general assembly former us ambassador to the united nations john scali stated each time that this assembly makes decision which significantly minority of members regard as unfair or onesided it further erodes vital support for the united nations among the minority he stated that at the time the general assembly demonstrated sharply increased tendency to disregard its normal procedures to benefit the side which enjoys the favor of the majority and to silence and even exclude the representatives of member states whose policies the majority condemns see us position at the 29th general assembly us department of state publication 8800 13 international organization and conference series 119 february 1975 134 for discussion of the possible implications of the united states withholding funding from the united nations see crs report rl33848 united nations reform us policy and international perspective us policy and international perspectives by luisa blanchfield crs25 opponents of us participation in the review conference maintain that us engagement would give undeserved legitimacy to mechanisms that provide platform for member states to target israel they also argue that it would imply that the united states supports the antisemitism demonstrated at wcar as well as what many perceive as unbalanced language in the durban declaration and program of action according to some us nonparticipation in the review conference sends clear message to member states that repeatedly targeting one country and regional conflict in fora is unacceptable to the united states they contend that the longterm political impact of such message outweighs the shortterm diplomatic impact of us nonparticipation or withdrawal these opponents therefore agree with the bush administrations decision not to participate in the preparatory process until as us officials say it is proven that the review conference will not become platform for antisemitism they argue that holding out the possibility of us participation as well as the participation of other likeminded governments who have made similar statements may persuade member states to take more balanced approach when drafting and negotiating review conference outcome documents in preparation for the april 2009 conference for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34754
