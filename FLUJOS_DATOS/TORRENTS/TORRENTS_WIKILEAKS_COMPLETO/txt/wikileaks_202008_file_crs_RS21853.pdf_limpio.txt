peri od unless otherwise indicated all expenditures are in constant 2000 dollars this shift in the distribution of support for university rd expenditures can be attributed to significant increases in other sources of support for academic rd specifically industry nd self financing of rd by academic institutions industries shar grew the fastest with funding expanding from 286 million in 1971 to 1479 billion in 1990 417 increase in real dollars see figures 1 and 2 concomitantly as per cent of academic rd ex penditures industries share climbed from 3 of total expenditures in 1971 to 7 in 1988 and then declined to 6 in 2002 as industry reduced rd funding due to the economic slowdown in 2001 and 2002 between 1971 and 1990 university financed rd expenditures experienced the greatest growth in funding as indicated in figure 2 university financed rd increased from 1150 billion in 1971 to 4043 billion in 1990 an average annual increase of 68 as result by 1990 university financed rd accounted for 19 of academic rd expenditures up from 11 in 1971 during th is time period state support of university research declined from 10 of university rd expenditures in 1971 to 8 in 1990 even though

1980s as indicated in figure 2 most of this increase in nonfederal expenditures for university based rd occurred between 1981 and 1990 for example during the 1980s federal expenditures for university rd incr eased 50 while industry expenditures for university rd increased 162 university financed rd expenditures more than doubled during the 1980s increasing from 1902 billion in 1981 to 4043 billion by 1990 during the same period state expendi tures for university rd increased 70 while expenditures from other sources increased 90 while support for university based research experienced double digit growth rates during the 1970s and1980s this rapid growth rate slowed significantly in the early 1990s between 1991 and 1995 federal rd expenditu res to universities increased 149 in real dollars while nonfederal rd expenditures to universities increased 8 between 1991 and 1995 total rd expenditures to univ ersities and colleges from all sources increased from 22127 billion to 24780 billion 12 increase this was the slowest rate of growth for university r d expenditures since the early 1970s this trend of slower rate of increase for university based rd expenditures began to reverse in the late 1990s in fact between 1996 and 2002 total university rd expenditures from all sources increased 37 concomitantly university self financing of rd increased 44 in real dollars cons equently by 2002 univers ity self financing of rd accounted for almost 20 of th eir total rd expenditures funding to universities from federal sources increased 39 during this time period while rd expenditures from industry and state resour ces continued to lag behind increasing 18 and 20 respectively over this six year period httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21853crs4 3 this act is contained in amendments to the patent

17a18 it is also interesting to note that in 1980 industry accounted for 146 of total basic research expenditure in the us however acco rding to nsf by 2000 industries share of total basic research expenditures had increased to 34much of the federal 37 increase in university rd expenditures between 1996 and 2002 can be attributed to the doubling of the budget for the national ins titutes of health nih the doubling of nihs budget alone resulted in average annual increases in excess of 1 billion for those select universities that receive nih rd funding between 1996 and 2002 total university rd ex penditures from all sources increased from 25392 billion to 34909 billion an increase of 95 billion in real dollars this represents an average annual increas of 55 over this six year period number of experts have examined recent trends in rising university rd expenditures david mowery professor at th university of california at berkeley has identified several reasons wh university self financin g of rd expenditures has increased over the past 20 years according to mowery the first reason is the bayhdole act of 1980 which allows unive rsities to obtain patents and sign licensing agreements with commercial entities with the expectation that these commercial entities will further develop and commercialize the technology generating roya lty payments to universities3 while universities were involve d in licensing activities prior to 1980 data from the nsf illustrate how the 1980 law may have accelerat ed these activities for example in 1982 all academic institutions recei ved 464 patents by 2001 the number of patents awarded to universities increased to 32034 professor mowery contends that the s econd major reason that nonfederal sources for university rd grew significantly has to do with industrys eight fold increase in basic research funding between 1980 2557 billion and 2000 16223 billion in constant dollars as result according to mowery it seems reasonable to expect that universities would benefit from this increase the nsf data show that total industry expenditures for university based re search increased from 310 million in 1980 to 2310 billion by 2 000 with in the industry total for 1980 more than half 273 million was spent on basic research however by 2000 i ndustry support for unive rsity based basic research had increased to 1421 billion 420 increase over 1980 this represents an average annual increase of 86 for industry sponsored university basic research between 1980 and 20005 professor mowery also acknowledges that combination of one or two other factors may have contributed to the increase of uni versity financed rd expenditures over the last 20 years the first is the growth of university endowments in the 1990s that enabled some universities to support more self financed research s econd the growth of licensing income associated with the expansion of university patenting activities may have contributed additional selffinanced rd ex penditures finally mowery notes that declines in the stock market value of comp anies that fund rd and weak private sector business performance may have constraine d the growth of these sources of rd fundinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21853crs5 6 the chronicle of higher education defines an earmark as an appropriation to university or college for research activity that was not requested by the funding agency b was directed to specific university or universities and c wa s not rewarded through the traditional scientific peer review process september 26 2003 page a18the 60 federal share of university base d research funding in 2002 was down from 69 in 1971 during this 31 year period fe deral funding to universities grew at an average annual rate of 36 wh ile concomitantly university self fina ncing of research increased at an average annual rate of 59 over the same period university financed rd funding increased from 11 of the total expenditures in 1971 to nearly 20 of rd expenditures in 2002 congressional issues two issues regarding federal rd funding for academic research are1 the level of rd funding and 2 the recipients of the funds which relates pr imarily to earmarking or congressional specification as to where university rd expenditures should be spent future university rd funding trends the academic sector has relied on variety of funding sources that has help ed it sustain real dollar increases in rd funding between 1971 and 2002 however growin g federal budget defi cits coupled with industrys recent reduction in support of univers ity based research ma well constrain the growth of future academic rd funding am erican association for the advancement of science aaas estimates that with the co mpletion of doubling the nih budget between fy1999 and fy2003 federal rd expenditures to academic institutions are likely to remain flat in real dollars the presiden t proposed that the fy2005 budget for basic and applied research would remain at fy2004 levels since basic and applied research accounts for 96 of federal r d expenditures to universities it is likely that federal funding to universities could decline in fy2005 further

fy2003 academic research earmarks increased from 25 to 8 of total federal academic rd expenditures referencing an article from the chronicle of higher education the administration stated in its fy2005 budget request to congress that often only minor portion of earmarks go to states with the smallest share of fe deral research funds wh ile earmarks help some rich institutions become richer9 some agency personnel contend that earma rks can hamper an agencys ability to fulfill its mission responsibilities norine noonan former chief of the environmental protection agencys research office noted th at earmarks may force agencies to cut peer reviewed mission oriented research10 in contrast john r silber chancellor and former president of boston university contends that peer review is understandably and inevitably biased in favor of established programs whose faculty dominates the review process he indicated that congress provide s earmarks for carefully considered projects that meet important national interests and build the recipients ability to compete for peer reviewed grantspeer review is good earmarking is good and both are capable of abuse11 members who support earmarking state that without them some worthy projects would not receive funding they contend that competitively awarded research grants go disproportionately to sma ll group of elite institutions many universities primarily smaller schools seek earmarks for research in frastructure buildings and research labs because the federal government has not s ponsored program for funding bricks and mortar since the early 1970s other memb ers oppose earmarks for example senator mccain said on the floor that appropr iations committees that accept earmarks have effectively usurped the power of the authorization committees and act as one all powerful funding machine12 other congressional opponents point out that earmarks can distort agency rd priorities
