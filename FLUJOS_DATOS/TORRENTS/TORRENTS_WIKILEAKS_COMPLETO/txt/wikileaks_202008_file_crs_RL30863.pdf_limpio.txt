early as 1934 when the ncua national credit union administration was the federal credit union bureau credit union examiners conducted their examinations at credit union sites and then completed their reports at home neither the ncua nor its predecessor provided office space for credit union examiners the ncua implemented workathome program for its auditors that is still operating successfully the earliest effort to generate federal telework program however appears to have occurred in the early 60s when jack nilles commonly considered to be the father of telework began teleworking from angeles to washington dc while working as consulting rocket scientist to the us air force space program inspired by this experience nilles coined both the words telecommuting and teleworking in 1973 the first

regulations in an effort to facilitate working at home as means of improving productivity saving costs and saving energy this was at the height of the energy crisis during that same time schiff coined the term flexiplace to encompass not only workathome but also such other flexible location arrangements as satellite work centers in contrast to such terms as telecom muting flexiplace stressed increased flexibility in the location of work whether or not this is based on the use of telecommunications equipment11 1980s among other early examples of telework were 1980 experiment at an army facility in st louis and 1989 flexiplace pilot study lasting six months at the environmental protection agencys epas research triangle park north carolina facility the army project was discontinued when despite the fact that the program performed successfully project manager evaluations an army audit team concluded that the potential benefits were exceeded by the risks of fraud and abuse the final report on the epa pilot was generally positive about the feasibility of flexiplace arrangements12 when the loma prieta earthquake severely damaged epas offices in san francisco california on october 17 1989 the agency responded by establishing an auxiliary command post for 80 employees and workathome arrangements for the remaining 700 workers 13 in 1989 gsa found that substantial number

the corresponding time savings for telecommuter is some 160 hours year and 500 year in transportation costs34 other potential savings that could accrue from telework programs can also be identified employees who are teleworking on those days which are designated as liberal or unscheduled leave could continue to work thereby reducing the cost to the government35 telework benefits to employees can

building has been destroyed agencies should work with local federal executive boards and the general services administration in these areas to assist in locating alternative work sites telework arrangements must be sensitive to the employees needs for recovery teleworking can be helpful for the employee recovering from trauma if it shortens long stressful commute and gives the employee more time with loved ones on the other hand if not correctly designed the telework arrangement has the potential for making it even more difficult for an employee to recover from trauma federal employee assistance programs have staff who understa nd these issues and can advise managers who are making decisions about telework38 advocates of telework believe that it would allow an organizations or agencys workforce to be dispersed and decentralized so that essential functions could be continued in emergencies agencies might develop telework programs that include rotating certain number of employees between primary and offsite locations during crisis work could continue at the offsite locations this feature of telework program could be used as trial period for certain employees or as part of pilot program at those agencies that have thus far been skeptical about the merits or feasibility of telework backup files electronic or otherwise could be stored at space leased by agencies at other locations thereby providing for protection of those files during emergencies such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks some managers who might have been skeptical about the merits of telework prior to the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks and the anthrax threat might now consider it as an important component of contingency planning prior to these events some managers might have perceived telework primarily as benefit for the employee shift in that perception could occur as managers reassess and refine their emergency preparedness and disaster recovery plans in preparation

thinking of establishing telework programs and the considerations of employees thinking of participating in telework programs are the following tasks and positions certain tasks may be better suited to telework than others among those mentioned by gsa and opm are general planning writing data analysis reviewing files telephoneintensive tasks information research setting up meetings and computeroriented tasks programming data entry word processing additionally telework may be appropriate particularly for completing episodic work or projects without interruptions typically eligible for telework are jobs characterized by work that 1 is unclassified and does not require security clearance can be performed offsite lends itself to easy measurement of its products and progress 2 requires tools that are easily portable 3 can be performed with the use of telephone computer andor facsimile machine and 4 can be performed by an individual rather than group44 tasks that may not be suited for telework include those involving 1 extensive facetofa ce interaction with the supervisor or other employees or the public 2 supervision of other employees 3 research that requires access to materials not accessible electronically or that cannot be removed from the main office site and 4 the use of equipment that cannot be provided by the employing office in the executive and legislative branches telework may not be practical for certain staff whose positions require close and frequent interaction with members of congress high government officials or other staff or responsiveness to constituent inquiries including office visits and telephone calls equity and morale while some cite morale and productivity as benefits of telework making some employees eligible for participation and others ineligible may raise fairness issues and have an opposite effect on employees who remain at work in the central office site productivity if an employees productivity declines and if the evaluation so indicates the employer and employee would need to reevaluate the terms of the telework agreement or even terminate it reserved for the manager or supervisor is the right to terminate telework agreements for any reason and at any time some employees who were initially motivated to participate in telecommuting may decide after period of time that telework is unsuitable for their particular circumstances others may find that they prefer clear delineation between work and home or that the alternative work location does not provide an environment conducive to greater productivity still others may conclude that there is substitute for being at the central worksite full time interacting facetoface with colleagues and accessing work materials that are digitally inaccessiblehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30863crs14 45an examination of the telework policies indicates that employees who are teleworking would come into the central office as needed 46the congressional

teleworking employees to stay connected to the cultures of their organizations are thought to be important because the procedures for fulfilling agency missions are developed and communicated by those cultures the scope and implementation of telework program might affect how the culture is transmitted throughout the organization and the way in which managers and staff interact and work policy twice

has corresponding entities comparison of the policies and guidance for this branch where telework programs exist indicate that they are quite similar to those of the executive branch50 principles underlying telework programs as enunciated by gsa and opm can be grouped into three categories stated below ground rules telecommuting is management decision and option not an employee right or benefit participation is voluntary and may be terminated by either the employee or the supervisor or manager written telecommuting agreement must be signed by the employee and supervisor or manager telecommuting does not change the terms and conditions of employment including salary and benefits responsibilities of employees are specifically defined work schedule days or hours and location of

security issues80 in july 2001 gao published the text of briefing that was conducted for representative dick armey on potential tax regulatory and liability barriers that employers face when they establish telecommuting programs for their employees in seeking to explore the potential barriers faced by private industry employers gao among other activities interviewed representatives from two organizations that promote telecommuting programs two industry trade organizations that represent employers who have telecommuting programs four employers with telecommuting programs in place several union officials and an attorney from law firm that provides assistance to employers who may want to establish telecommuting programs gao estimated that 165 million employees telecommute at least once month and 93 million employees telecommute at least once week according to gao many telecommuting proponents believe that significant obstacles to increased use of telecommuting involve internal management concerns related to 1 assessing whether the employer has the types of positions and employees suitable for telecommuting program 2 maintaining security over sensitive company data while monitoring the actions of remote workers and 3 ensuring that telecommuting activities do not adversely affect profits81 furthermore gao identified individual state tax laws that could expose employers and employees to additional state taxes and the applicability of federal workplace health and safety laws and regulations to telecommuters home offices as other potential barriers to telecommuting because several of these laws and regulations predate the move toward the more technological and informationbased economy in which telecommuting has developed gao observed that their application to telecommuting is evolving and is somewhat unclear at this time82 best practices for telework june 2000 study published by the pricewaterhouse coopers endowment for the business of government concluded that best practices in teleworking have yet to manifest themselves and their development will be ongoing and incremental the authors found that such practices would be optimized by the happy confluence of work inherently suited to flexiplace workers suited to independent work and trusting supportive and unintrusive managers83 in may 2001 opms philadelphia regional office released special

programs that we asked about in our survey telecommuting stood out for several reasons first it showed the greatest disparity between importance and availability making it one of the mostdesired but least available programs second of all the worklife programs we asked about only telecommuting was the one that appeared to have relationship to employee intentions to retire or look for another job in the coming year ie planning to leave telecommuting is certainly not the only factor related to employee plans to leave their jobs indeed more than few respondents to whom telecommuting is important say they plan to leave even when telecommuting is available nevertheless the data show that telecommuting has high appeal for many employees90 telework benefits december 2000 report issued by the senate subcommittee on oversight of government management restruc turing and the district of columbia of the committee on governmental affairs supported efforts to increase the number of federal

september 2001 the first hearing focused on managing telework policies the second hearing addressed public and private approaches to telework managing telework policies during its march 22 2001 hearing the subcommittee took testimony from representatives of opm gsa the federal railroad administration fra the national industries for the severely handicapped nish american telephone and telegraph att and the washington metropolitan telework centers wmtc in his opening statement the subcom mittee chairman representative tom davis identified telecommuting as critical to the federal governments recruitment and retention efforts office of personn management commenting on why telecommuting has not been implemented as quick sic as many would have liked the then acting director of opm steven r cohen said that this was partly due to many misconceptions about telecommuting as viable work option he noted opms advisory role on telework but emphasized that the law gives the authority to develop and implement specific telecommuting policies to each executive agency121 general services administration david l bibb acting deputy administrator at gsa recommended that agencies focus on four areas in implementing telework 1 training for both managers and staff on working in telework environment including focus on results rather than where the work is performed 2 continuing ongoing initiatives to identify problems with and find solutions for telework 3 recognizing that greater numbers of teleworkers will require an increased investment in technology connectivity and training and 4 communicating the rationale for telework and communica ting that it is encouraged where practical122 federal railroad administration the acting deputy administrator of the fra s mark

deadlines and completing reports assignments and projects distractionfree work environment reduced personal cost associated with commuting to work and reduced employee stress were other benefits of telecommuting identified by employees123 national industries for the severely handicapped according to tony young the director of governmental activities for nish nonprofit organization telework is particularly attractive to people with severe disabilities who have significant transportation barriers to employment or who live in areas where transportation options are limited stating that nish is not aware of government contract that employs great numbers of individuals with disabilities through telework he recommended that federal agencies do more to reach this previously underutilized workforc such as contracting with the javitswagneroday program which provides employment opportunities to people with severe disabilities124 american telephone and telegraph the vice president for environment health and safety at att dr braden allenby discussed his companys use of telework he said that atts management approach is partly responsible for the fact that 56 of the companys employees participate in telework at least once month att believes that telework should be integrated into the business almost every existing organization plays role in terms of policies processes and procedures within the existing business functions for example real estate takes telework into account when designing space security takes remote work into account when implementing new policies processes and procedures information technology services takes telework into account when they build out our employee intranet what this does is ensure sustainable management system for telework125 further according to dr allenby what weve learned is that many managers are already working with teams and individuals who work elsewhere perhaps on the other side of the globe or maybe only the next building over in todays environm ent it is basic expectation that managers are able to manage beyond their line of sight managers and workers who are sitting in an office working with managers and workers sitting in other offices are ideal candidates for telework126 washington metropolitan telework centers jennifer thomas alcott presented testimony to the subcommittee on behalf of the telework centers that are administered by gsa as manager of three centers located between the capitol beltway and fredericksburg virginia along interstate 95 she said that the full and long term support of gsa is necessary for successful telework center program she stated that because the program is not funded and overseen by one central officehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30863crs40 127ibid p 88 128all

telework center program will continue in her opinion the telework centers fill an important market niche for telecommuters including those who do not have the space or resources for home office or who prefer the distinct delineation between their work and their personal lives127 public and private approaches to telework at its september 6 2001 hearing the subcommitt ee on technology and procurement policy took testimony from representatives of gao opm gsa the information technology association of america itaa siemens enterprise networks and carramerica subcommittee chairman davis stated that changing the federal workplace culture will not occur overnight and that federal managers need to shift their focus from processoriented performance measurements to results128 general accounting office bob robertson director of education workforce and income security issues at gao told the subcommittee that in the private sector decisions on whether an organizatio n ultimately adopted telecommuting programs or expanded them over time was heavily dependent on the resolution of three concerns identifying the positions and employees suitable for telecommuting protecting data and controlling the costs associated with telecommuting he also noted that the application of laws and regulations covering taxes workplace safety recordkeeping and liability for injuries associated with telecommuting is still evolving and unclear at this time office of personnel management according to teresa jenkins director of the office of workforce relations at opm its april survey of executive branch agencies found that 76 agencies have telework policies in place 18 agencies reported policies in place and 26 of federal employees telecommute at least one day per week she identified for the subcommittee the various efforts the agency has undertaken to increase executive branch participation in telework among these efforts opm is sharing best practices with and aggressively marketing telework to federal agencies has launched joint web site with gsa to improve access to information on telework is developing an internetbased training module on telework and has conducted leadership seminar for top agency officials general services administration david bibb of gsa noted for the subcommittee that 2500 agency employee s or 21 of its workforce are teleworking 800 employees telework

that study on federal home based telework will be completed early in 2002 the study will identify technology barriers to telework estimate the prevalence of such barriers across agencies and the number and types of employees affected and recommend solutions and implementation of those solutions to break down technology barriers information technology association of america according to harris n miller president of the itaa the organization has compiled information showing the following benefits of telecommuting for the private sector att teleworkers work 5 more hours per week at home than att office workers jd edwards teleworkers are 2025 more productive than their office counterparts att saves 3000 per teleworker annually telework can cut corporate real estate costs by 2590 teleworkers save 529 minutes of commute time each workday barriers to widespread participation in telework arrangements according to mr miller may be the inability of employees to access broadband technologies remotely concerns about information security managerial resistance and regulations related to tax and home safety issues siemens enterprise networks the vice president for global marketing for siemens enterprise networks mark straton testified that since 1996 teleworking has resulted in 35 nationwide decrease in office space at an annual cost savings of over 3 million dollars and productivity increases of over 20 for the electronic company he recommended that the federal government partner with the private sector on telework programs and consider pilot telework programs carramerica robert m milkovich managing director of carramerica real estate investment trust with experience in providing office space for mobile workforces believes that technology will continue to be enhanced at rapid pace according to milkovich the challenge of telework is faced on the cultural side of the equation it is our experience that the companies and organizations that are technologically on the forefront have fewer cultural hurdles to overcome these companies are already invested in the new economy both financially and culturally and operate with an advanced or progressive way of doing business facility projections for space utilization and growth are made easier for top management to track and project these companies view telework as method to create more flexible use of workspace the cultural challenge can only be overcome if the technology is in place to support management and its employees and if the economic savings are substantial enough to make it compelling business decisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30863crs42 129see crs report rl30745 electronic government conceptual overview by harold c relyea esp pp 7 1920 hereafter cited as electronic

related to telework will require continuous evaluation as entities in the executive and legislative branches consider develop and implement programs security and confidentiality129 agency investments in information technology infrastructure which allow firewalls to be created for both internet and email files are increasing the security and confidentiality of government information security measures and established procedures for protecting sensitive information such as the use of passwords for different gateways likewise are designed to prevent unauthorized access nevertheless information technology professionals and agency employees need to work together to monitor the effectiveness of policies and requirements specific to their work hackers are increasingly aggressive in infiltrating government computer networks and systems and planting viruses that can incapacitate them and result in possible shutdown of entire systems files could be permanently lost and the integrity and authenticity of data could be compromised agencies are continuously vigilant and share information to develop common safeguards and antidotes for combating these attacks they will need to extend such vigilance to ensure that the connections between central worksites and alternative worksites are secure department of energy representative told the telework issues working group that there is need to establish governmentw ide minimum level of teleworker access to nonclassified information such as email particularly for networks which have significant controlsfirewalls that prohibit teleworking on regular basis the representative strongly recommended partnership among the federal chief information officers cio counsel gsa and opm on this issue130 in the legislative branch as discussed under implementation above the house senate sergeant at arms cbo and gao policies address confidentiality and security confidentiality in serving congress is an important component of the missions of the legislative branch support agencies privacy in addition to the security and confidentiality considerations the requirements of the privacy act must be met by federal agencies131 these include requirements regarding their management ie collection use and storage of personally identifiable information132httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30863crs43 132continued government information in the united states by harold c relyea 133telework related policy issues p 17 134ibid p 5 135see us library of congress application of the occupational safety and health act osha to teleworkers gsa has counseled agencies that records subject to the privacy act may not be disclosed to anyone except those authorized access as requirement of their official responsibilities agencies should ensure that appropriate physical administrative and technical safeguards are used to protect the security and confidentiality of such records133 the telework issues working group heard from representative of the department of health and human services hhs that the agency is very concerned about the protection of government records while federal employees are telecommuting hhs found this protection to be serious problem when translated to flexiplace and suggested that opm andor gsa specifically address this issue in telework guidance according to the representative some form of control is necessary so that the appropriate federal office will know exactly where record is when it is not in the official files that hard copy and electronic records are adequately protected during transmission to and from telework site and that all federal electronic records and data bases used by an employee from telework site are secure and protected at all times134 in the legislative branch each of the entities with telework programs addresses privacy issues in its policies as discussed under the implementation section above another issue related to privacy is whether and how government officials will have access to personal computers owned by teleworking employees if those computers are thought to have official governm ent files saved on them while an employing agency may arguably conduct unannounced inspections of agency equipment used in an employees home it is not certain whether such authority exists when an employee uses his or her own equipment health and safety135 as more employees participate in telework programs and increase the amount of time they spend at alternative worksites health and safety at these locations including standards for ergonomics will continue to be issues for review both gsa and opm have drawn up checklists that are not legally binding but enable teleworkers to certify that specific health and safety elements are present at the alternative worksites which may be subject to inspection by the employing office among the items on the checklist are the following are temperature noise ventilation and lighting levels adequate for maintaining your normal level of job performancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30863crs44 136us general services administration evaluation and innovative workplaces division office of real property office of governme ntwide policy

publish and maintain basic guidance at the layperson level on safety and health in the home office and establishclarify healthsafety responsibilities for alternate worksites such as telecenters or other nonresidence thirdparty ownedoperated worksites137 during the 106th congress at least six bills were introduced on this subject but none reached the floor five of the bills would have amended osha to prevent its application in home offices while one bill would have specifically provided for its application138 as discussed above all the legislati ve branch entities with telework programs have provisions regarding the right of the employing office to inspect the offsite work location other considerations on which the executive branch is expected to focus include the funding of telework programs and the training of both managers and employees about their responsibilities in carrying them out funding very little data on the funding of telework programs are readily available there appear to have been formal requirements for data collection hence opm has modest data to report the departments of the treasury and hhs anticipate that they will begin to collect data on their programs so as to monitor the implementation of the recently passed law mandating establishment of telework policies139 at thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30863crs45 139continued treasury and karen

administer programs mentioned in this report 144telework related policy issues p 12telework issues working group meeting representative from hhs suggested that the human resources technology council should be directed to bring about interagency consensus on minimum standard data set for teleworking providing for consistent agency transmissio ns to opms central personnel data file140 if accomplished this would facilitate the evaluation and comparison of the various telework programs in the executive branch training opm is developing training module on telework that will be designed in self teaching format and accessible by computer similarly the department of the treasur has discussed with gsa the possibility of establishing common training program that can be used by all the executive branch agencies141 according to department of education representative on the telewor k issues working group there is need to find ways to make managers more comfortable with managing off site employees as well as need for consistent training especially in the areas of virtual teaming and communication techniques desire for an increased commitment to management and teleworker training was expressed by representatives from hhs and the epa on the working group as well142 some have observed that while trust and accountability cannot be taught they can be built and environments conducive to them can be fostered143 opm emphasizes that an agreement worked out in common by and specifying the responsibilities and work assignments of managers and employees must be signed by both parties before teleworking can occur fulfillment of the agreement would perhaps help overcome the significant barrier to greater utilization of teleworkflexible workplace arrangements the attitude of the manager and the concern about work being completed144 conclusion interest in telework continues to grow and policies continue to evolve in both the executive and the legislative branches the merit systems protection boards 2000 survey on merit principles discussed earlier found that telecommuting program was either important or very important to 47 of employees responding tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30863crs46 145programs on flexible work schedule 86 sick leave for family care 85 compressed work schedule 71 employee assistance programs 54 and leave sharing 51 placed higher see issues of merit p 5 146the crisis in human capital p 48the survey this response ranked telecommuting in sixth place out of 12 places145 the december 2000 report issued by the senate subcommittee on oversight of government management restructuring and the district of columbia expressed the desire that the goal set in january 1996 by the presidents management council to have 160000 federal employees telecommuting nationwide by fiscal year 2002 would be met or exceeded146 among the factors that appear to contribute to successful telework experiences are top management support clear telework agreement that includes expectations accompanied by measurable goals accountability and performance results rapport between the manager and the employee and the temperament of both to be flexible as the workload and other demands dictate participating employees who have proven performance records an organizational culture that supports change flexibility and creativity proper training equipment and infrastructure and initial implementation as pilot programs or episodic arrangements reservations about telework may include managerial concerns about maintaining performance and productivity in the office or organization the security of government records and the use of software licensed to the government on computers at the alternative work sites and the availability of funding to provide necessary support for employees to work away from the main office while at the same time maintaining an office at the agency as additional information about what factors are important to successful telework programs becomes available agencies may see applications for their own employees further as the infrastructure to support telework develops and if security safeguards are enhanced an increase in the number of telework programs may occur the telework issues working group may identify whether additional legislation or guidance are needed the newness of telework policies in the legislative branch has some of the entities reviewing existing programs and looking to those in the executive branch and private industry for insights into the requirements for successful implementation of telework some believe that the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon and the discovery of anthrax in washington dc and other cities have fundamentally changed the workplace and demonstrated the practical application of telework to the continued operation of the government issues of security crisis management disaster recovery and remote access to office computer systems are prompting some federal executive and legislative branch agencies and their employees to expand existing telework programs or to consider telework although in many cases how to implement telework remains unclear
