been introduced as proposed constitutional amendments federal statutes and house and senate rules changes1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22067crs2 1 continued the congressional research service the listed author updated the report and is available to answer questions concerning its contents 2 the time since the terrorists attacks is not the first period however in which congress has considered the issue for example from the 1940s through 1962 more than 30 proposed constitutional amendments were introduced to provide for temporarily filling house vacancies or selecting successors in case of the disability of significant number of representatives 3 for further information on the proposals and other activity prior to the 109th congress see crs report rl31394 house vacancies selected proposals for filling them after catastrophic loss of members 20012004 by r eric petersenbackground while the constitution requires that vacanci in both the house and the senate be filled by special election it empowers state legislatures to provide for temporary appointments to the us senate by state governors until elections are held house members on the other hand have alwa ys been chosen in one way by direct election of the people and house vacancies have always been filled by special election provision has been made for temporar appointments to the us house of representatives since september 11 2001 proposals to ame nd the constitution enact federal law and change house rules regarding vacancies have been introduced2 eight such proposals were introduced in the house or senate during the 108th congress six of them would have amended the constitution to allow for the temporary appointment of individuals predesignated by members hjres 77 hj res 83 and hjres 92 to allow state legislatures or governors to make temporary ppointments hjres 89 to authorize congress to provide tempor ary appointment process hj res 90 or to authorize congress to regulate temporar ily filling vacancies by law sjres 23 the remaining two measures were proposed federal laws one hr 2844 would have required the states to hold expedited speci elections the other s 1820 which was offered as implementing legislation for sjres 23 w ould have authorized states to develop mechanisms for temporarily filling v acancies in their congressional delegations if prescribed number of members were killed incapacitated or otherwise unable to discharge the duties of office many of th proposals were similar to others offered in the 107th congress or were re visions of earlier plans3 issues in debate amending the constitution as previously stated the constitution requires that vacancies in the house be filled by special election it makes provision for temporary appointments to vacant seats in the house accordingly if temporary appointments to the house are to be provided for constitutional amendment arguably would be the best way to avoid constitutional challenges supporters contend that amending the constitution would demonstrate concurrence of the st ate legislatures because constitutional amendments are effective onl upon ratification by threef ourths of those state bodies they also point out that constitutional amendment would treat the office of us representative like that of us senator and president of the united states both of whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22067crs3

amendments on the other hand cr itics argue that amending th constitution is cumbersome process additional terrorist attacks could occur before the process was completed further they contend that the office of us representative does have constitutionally based replacement plan writs of election as set forth in article i section 2 of the constitution they also note differences be tween the two houses of congress unlike us senators4 and us presidents us representa tives have the distinction of having been chosen in but one way since the incepti on of their office by direct election in addition they point out that the scope of th issues and constituencies for governors and us senators is with rare exceptions broader than it is for us representatives governors and us senators are elected by voters in the entire state while us representatives except for those representin g single district states are elected by voters in their congressional districts moreover some political observers believe that constitutional amendment is unnecessary ce change could be implemented through less extreme means such as by enacting federal legislation or by modifying house rules enacting federal law requiring expedited special elections supporters of federal statute instead of constitutional amendment contend that in the event of mass house vacancies congress could exerci its constitutional authority to preempt state law regarding the times places and manner of holding elections5 for the house and pass legislation that woul d require states to hold expe dited special elections within specified time frame6 they assert that the legislation could amend current law7 which leaves it to state law to determine when an election must be held to fill house vacancy supporters note that current provisions for filling vacancies in the house in non emergency situations would remain intact and the expedited special elections provision would be triggered only in the event of significant number of house vacancies due to national emergency further supporters argu that passing federal statute is far less cumbersome process than amending the cons titution in addition advocates believe that statute providing for expedited special elections could minimize the length of time house membership would be verely depleted without violating the basic tenet of elected representatives on the other hand critics of this approach argue that it could result in campaign periods so short that citizens could not make reasoned informed decisions
