fm yang discussed deepening saudichinese ties in variety of fields emphasizing trade in particular with his saudi counterparts responding to statements made by fm saud yang also briefly discussed chinese support for iraq concern about iranian nuclear ambitions and hopes for the middle east peace process fm yangs foray into regional political commentary appears to have been result of fm sauds prodding both publicly and behind closed doors and is reflection of the developing saudichinese relationship end summary trade takes precedence 2 u fm yang arrived in riyadh on january 13 the first highlevel visit since chinese president hu jintaos february 2009 trip of friendship and cooperation fm yangs visit coincided with the 20th anniversary of saudichinese diplomatic relations and followed three days after chinese trade minister chen deming cochaired the 4th session of the saudichinese joint commission in riyadh 3 u the chinese foreign minister has traditionally made his first overseas trip of the new year to africa visiting with african leaders and expressing chinese goodwill and improvements in trade relations this year fm yang extended his visit to include not only major trading

bilateral trade by 50 from total annual value of 40 billion to 60 billion over the next five years ref during the joint commission meeting saudi minister of finance ibrahim alassaf reportedly urged

chinas 44 billion riyal 117 billion worth of infrastructure projects in the kingdom dumping causes bump 5 c this call to increase sinosaudi trade comes on the heels of december 24 announcement that china would impose antidumping tariffs of up to 136 percent on saudi and taiwanproduced butanediol beijing began dumping probe on methanol and butanediol bdo from saudi arabia in july which caused an unusually public trade spat between the two countries ref b methanol and butanediol make up 10 to 15 percent of saudi arabias 2 billion in annual nonoil exports to china ministry of commerce and industry official told econoffs on january 13 that saudi arabia was able to convince the chinese not to impose tariffs on methanol but said the bdo case was still pending the ministry recently appointed new deputy minister for technical affairs dr hamad alawfy who will handle all antidumping issues he said alawfy previously complained to econcouns that the sag was increasingly frustrated by the growing number of saudi companies complaining about chinese dumping in saudi arabia other senior sag officials have caustically complained about the low quality of chinese construction and the shortterm extractive approach of chinese companies to investments in saudi arabia riyadh 00000123 0022 of 003 maturing economic relationship 6 c china recently surpassed the us as the largest importer of saudi oil saudi arabias investments in china have increased significantly over the last few years including 35 billion refinery in fujian and 286 billion jointventure petrochemical complex in tianjin additionaly president hu jintao commemorated the opening of cement plant when he visited saudi arabia in february 2009 saudi arabias more forwardleaning approach including largescale investments in china indicates maturing of the bilateral relations and assumes more proactive rather than reactive role towards economic engagement note china is now the sags number two trade partner after the us saudichinese bilateral trade was estimated at 40 billion in 2008 while saudius trade was estimated at 67 billion during the same time period end note fm saud prods fm yang responds 7 u while trade issues dominated fm yangs agenda both he and fm prince saudal faisal commented on the regional political landscape in press conference that followed their bilateral meeting fm saud spoke out against israeli defiance of security council resolutions and called on china as permanent member of the security council to deal with world disputes in accordance to international legitimacyas stipulated in the arab peace initiative the meetings with fm yang were part of framework of coordination and consultation fm saud continued that included not only the palestinian cause but also irans nuclear file iraq and yemen in particular he emphasized chinas role as member of the p5 plus 1 group and their responsibility to solve the iranian nuclear crisis through dialogue and peaceful means our two nations are keen that the middle east and the gulf should be free of all weapons of mass destruction including nuclear weapons he stressed 8 u in response to fm sauds comments fm yang said china called for serious negotiations between israel and palestine that would carry out the peace process and establish the state of palestine china is ready for cooperation with the world community to work for stability in the middle east he added in regard to iraq he said that china extended assistance by reducing iraqi debt obligations to china and forging trade agreements between iraqi and chinese companies with respect to iran fm yang said the iranian file should be solved through political diplomatic channels which help stabilize the situation in the region fm saud china needs to more actively counter iranian nukes 9 c deputy foreign minister dr prince torki told visiting nea as feltman on january 26 ref c that fm saud had pressed the chinese foreign minister hard on the need to be more active in working with the rest of the international community and the security council to counter the threat of iran developing nuclear weapon fm saud told fm yang that saudi arabia was convinced iran intended to develop nuclear weapon despite its assurances and that only concerted international action could stop that while explicit bargain was discussed dep fm torki explained that saudi arabia understood china was concerned about having access to energy supplies which could be cut off by iran and wanted to attract more trade and investment saudi arabia was willing to provide assurances on those scores to china but only in exchange for tangible chinese actions to restrain irans drive for nuclear weapons comment 9 c since king abdullahs historic visit to beijing in january 2006 the saudichinese relationship has focused predominantly on energy and trade however the relationship may be showing signs of political evolution while the chinese would likely prefer to stay away from political controversy their economic power and permanent seat on the security council has made it more and more difficult for them to avoid politics altogether 10 c comment continued the incentives for the saudis to riyadh 00000123 0032 of 003 try and leverage their economic relationship with china for political gain with respect to sensitive regional issues such as iran and the israelipalestinian conflict are significant and growing after patiently focusing on building the economic relationsip since 2006 fm sauds public and private prodding of fm yang indicates the saudis are ready to try and cash in some political chips end comment smith
