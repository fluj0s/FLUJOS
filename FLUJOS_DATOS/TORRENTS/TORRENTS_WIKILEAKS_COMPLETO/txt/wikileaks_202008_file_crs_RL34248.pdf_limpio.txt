nuclear security cooperation programs have improved the security situation in recent years current instability in pakistan has called the extent and durability of these reforms into question some

2007 has called atte ntion to the issue of the security of pakistans nuclear weapons and how the world can be ssured they remain in safe hands during potential transitions of power some obser vers

states measures to improve the security of pa kistans nuclear weapons have been on going and include some cooperation with the united states since pakistan and indias nuclear tests in 1998 increased atte ntion has been given to reducing the risk of nuclear war in south asia the two c ountries have most recently come to the brink of fullscale war in 1999 and 2002 over kashmir and realizing the dangers have developed some nuclear risk reduc tion measures to prevent accidental war1 pakistan has also develope d its command and control sy stems and improved security of military and civilian

withstood ma ny of the political changes over the years president musharraf has said that paki stans nuclear wea pons are under total custodial controls40 the security of pakistans nuclear weapons could also be jeopardized by another conflict between india and pa kistan krepon argued explai ning that an escalating war with nuclear forces in the field would increase the probability of accidents miscalculations and the use of nucl ear weapons this is because when tensions rise precipitously with india the readiness level of pakistans nuclear deterrent also rises because th geographical coordinates of pakistans main nuclear weapon storage sites missile and air bases can be readily identified from satellites and therefore targeted by opposing forces the dictates of deterrence mandate some movement of launchers and weapons from fixed locations during crises nuclear weapons on the move are inherently less secure than nuclear weapons at heavily guarded storage sites weapons and launchers in motion are also more susceptible to insider threats and accidents41 such war would also place stress on th armys unity of command krepon added the issue of us plans to secure paki stani

similar network to supply libya north ko rea and iran with materials related to uranium enrichment53 alqaeda has also sought assistance from the khan network according to former director of central intelligence ge orge tenet the united states received fragmentary information from an intelligen ce service that in 1998 osama bin laden had sent emissaries to estab lish contact with the network54 other pakistani sources could also pr ovide nuclear material to terrorist organizations according to 2005 report by the commission on the intelligence capabilities of the united st ates regarding weapons of mass destruction alqaeda had established contact with pakistani scientists who disc ussed development of nuclear devices that would require hardtoobtain materials like uranium to create

most official reports indicate that at the least it has been damaged considerably director of national intelligence john d negroponte implied that the network had been dismantled when he asserted in

weve done similarly the international atomic energy agency iaea has not yet been able to interview khan directly according to an agency official however islamabad has responded to written questions from the iaea and has been cooperative in its investigation of iran s nuclear program58 khan himself told dawn news tv may 29 2008 that he would not cooperate w ith us or iaea investigators pakistani

burns testified in july that the bush administration has told the pakistani government that it is its respons ibility to make sure that neither the khan network nor similar organization resurfaces in the country since the revelations about the khan ne twork pakistan appears to ve increased its efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation but whether nd to what extent these efforts have been successful is not yet clear it is worth noting that because khan conducted these activities as government official they ar not necessarily symptomatic of failure of islamabads export controls pakistani officials argue that islamabad has taken number of steps to prevent further proliferation of nuclearre lated technologie s and materials59 for example pakistan adopted new nationa l export controls legisla tion
