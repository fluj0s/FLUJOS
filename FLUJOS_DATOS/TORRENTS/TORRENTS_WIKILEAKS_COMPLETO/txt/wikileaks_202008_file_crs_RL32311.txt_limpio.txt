total us international affairs spending funding for foreign operations programs have been rising for five consecutive years although amounts approved in fy2003 and fy2004 have reached unprecedented levels over the past 40 years substantial supplementals in both years for assistance to the front line states in the war on terrorism and afghanistan and iraq reconstruction have pushed spending upward the regular foreign operations bill signed by the president on january 23 2004 combined with an earlier iraq supplemental approved in november 2003 pl 108106 bring current year appropriations to 394 billion constant fy2005 dollars the highest level in real terms since the early 1960s for fy2005 president bush asked congress to appropriate 2132 billion the budget proposal was 205 billion or 106 higher than foreign operations appropriations for fy2004 excluding funds approved for iraq reconstruction despite the large overall increase for foreign operations much of the added funding was concentrated in few areas the fy2005 budget blueprint continued to highlight foreign aid in support of the war on terrorism as the highest priority two recently launched foreign aid initiatives the millennium challenge corporation mcc and the presidents emergency plan for aids relief pepfar were slated for significant funding increases the mcc would have grown from 994 million in fy2004 to 25 billion for fy2005 pepfar would have risen from 16 billion in fy2004 to 22 billion in the fy2005 request additional pepfar funds were proposed in the laborhhs appropriation measure bringing the total fy2005 pepfar request to 282 billion the fy2005 request further included substantial increases for the peace corps and for debt reduction the fy2005 foreign operations debate included discussion of several major policy issues including foreign aid as tool in the global war on terrorism the millennium challenge account programs to combat hivaids international family planning programs and afghan reconstruction although additional funds were sought for iraq reconstruction attention also focused on implementation efforts for the roughly 238 billion appropriated in fy2003 2004 on november 18

foreign operations export financing and related programs most recent developments on december 8 2004 the president signed into law pl 108447 hr 4818 the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act within which foreign operations is included as division d as enacted the measure provides 1964 billion for foreign operations after adjusting for required 08 acrosstheboard rescission although this is 168 billion or nearly 8 below the presidents request congress increased amounts passed earlier by the house 1939 billion and the senate 1961 billion the conference agreement is about 23 billion 13 more than the regular fy2004 foreign operations level but far less than the 3878 billion total appropriation in fy2004 that included 212 billion for iraq reconstruction and other supplemental needs for the core development and child survival accounts including the global aids initiative pl 108447 provides 436 billion after adjusting for the 08 acrosstheboard rescission about 675 million higher than fy2004 and 160 million more than the request within these totals hr 4818 provides 228 billion for the presidents emergency plan for aids relief pepfar after applying the rescission roughly 80 million higher than the request and the housepassed level but 139 million less than passed by the senate funding for international hivaids included in other appropriation bills brings the total to 292 billion 100 million more than the request on family planning and reproductive heath matters the conference on hr 4818 sets bilateral assistance at 441 million between house and senatepassed amounts the bill includes 34 million for the population fund unfpa subject to the kempkasten conditions but drops the senate language amending kempkasten that may have narrowed the grounds on which the administration could deny funding to the organization conferees also deleted the senateproposed revision to the presidents socalled mexico city conditions on bilateral family planning assistance in way that may have reversed the policy restrictions for specific countries pl 108447 provides 404 million for relief and peace and security activities in sudan 85 million for haiti and 980 million for afghanistan the sudan amount is in addition to 95 million emergency funding for the darfur region approved by pl 108287 the fy2005 defense appropriation bill the largest reduction in the enacted appropriation falls on the millennium challenge account reduced by 1 billion from the presidents 25 billion request crs2 the final level however is 250 million and 380 million than amounts recommended earlier by the house and senate respectively coming only after strong pressure from the white house the measure further reduces funding for the export import bank debt reduction the peace corps and multilateral development bank contributions among other accounts introduction the annual foreign operations appropriations bill is the primary legislative vehicle through which congress reviews and votes on the us foreign assistance budget and influences major aspects of executive branch foreign policy making generally1 it contains the largest share about twothirds of total international affairs spending by the united states the legislation funds all us bilateral development assistance programs managed mostly by the us agency for international development usaid together with several smaller independent foreign aid agencies such as the peace corps and the interamerican and african development foundations foreign operations also includes resources for the two newest administration initiatives the millennium challenge corporation mcc and the global aids initiative managed by the state departments hivaids coordinator most humanitarian aid activities are funded within foreign operations including usaids disasterfamine program and the state departments refugee relief support foreign operations includes separate accounts for aid programs in the former soviet union also referred to as the independent states account and centraleastern europe activities that are jointly managed by usaid and the state department security assistance economic and military aid for israel and egypt is also part of the foreign operations spending measure as are other security aid programs administered largely by the state department in conjunction with usaid and the pentagon most recently foreign operations has funded reconstruction programs in both afghanistan and iraq us contributions to the world bank and other regional multilateral development banks managed by the treasury department and voluntary payments to international organizations handled by the state department are also funded in the foreign operations bill finally the legislation includes appropriations for three export promotion agencies the overseas private investment corporation opic the exportimport bank and the trade and development agency 1 although the foreign operations appropriations bill is often characterized as the foreign aid spending measure it does not include funding for all foreign aid programs food aid an international humanitarian aid program administered under the pl 480 program is appropriated in the agriculture appropriations bill foreign operations also include funds for the exportimport bank an activity that is regarded as trade promotion program rather than foreign aid in recent years funding for food aid and the eximbank have been about the same so that foreign operations and the official foreign aid budget are nearly identical throughout this report the terms foreign operations and foreign aid are used interchangeably crs3 for two decades the foreign operations appropriations bill has been the principal legislative vehicle for congressional oversight of foreign affairs and for congressional involvement in foreign policy making congress has not enacted comprehensive foreign aid authorization bill since 1985 leaving most foreign assistance programs without regular authorizations originating from the legislative oversight committees as result foreign operations spending measures developed by the appropriations committees increasingly have expanded their scope beyond spending issues and played major role in shaping authorizing and guiding both executive and congressional foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives it has been largely through foreign operations appropriations that the united states has modified aid policy and resource allocation priorities since the end of the cold war the legislation has also been the channel through which the president has utilized foreign aid as tool in the global war on terrorism since the attacks of september 11 2001 and launched afghan and iraqi reconstruction operations the appropriations measure has also been key instrument used by congress to apply restrictions and conditions on administration management of foreign assistance actions that have frequently resulted in executivelegislative clashes over presidential prerogatives in foreign policy making status table 1 status of foreign operations appropriations fy2005 hr 4818 and s 2812 subcomm conf report markup

house and senate appropriations committees held several hearings on the fy2005 request the house foreign operations subcommittee marked up its draft legislation on june 23 followed by full committee approval on july 9 hr 4818 passed the house amended on july 15 the senate appropriations committee reported its bill s 2812 on september 16 which was debated and amended on september 23 the senate passed hr 4818 after substituting the text of s 2812 as amended conferees reached agreement november 19 on the foreign operations measure together with eight other pending appropriation bills for fy2005 hr 4818 originally the foreign operations measure became the vehicle for the omnibus consolidated appropriations act 2005 foreign operations is included as division d of the act the president signed the measure on december 8 crs4 foreign operations policy trends and goals arguably from the end of world war ii until the early 1990s the underlying rationale for providing foreign aid was the same as that for all us foreign policy the defeat of communism us aid programs were designed to promote economic development and policy reforms in large part to create stability and reduce the attraction to communist ideology and to block soviet diplomatic links and military advances other security assistance activities provided defense equipment and training to american allies and friendly states some of which faced soviet or soviet proxy threats aid programs also were used to help the us gain access to military bases around the world in order to forward deploy american forces foreign aid programs also supported number of secondary us policy goals such as reducing high rates of population growth promoting wider access to health care expanding the availability of basic education in the developing world advancing us trade interests and protecting the environment if these secondary goals were also achieved us aid programs could be promoted as delivering more bang for the buck with the end of the cold war the united states launched expansive aid programs in russia and many easternbloc states that were previously those that us assistance tried to combat while these and other new elements of american foreign aid emerged broad consensus developed over what should be the new overarching rationale for us aid programs throughout the 1990s policymakers and congress explored number of alternative strategic frameworks around which to construct revised foreign assistance policy rationale not only did policy consensus fail to emerge but efforts to overhaul the largely cold warbased foreign aid legislation also did not succeed during this period the clinton administration emphasized the promotion of sustainable development as the new postcold war main strategy of those parts of the foreign aid program under the aegis of the us agency for international development usaid economic assistance supported six interrelated goals achievement of broadbased economic growth development of democratic systems stabilization of world population and protection of human health sustainable management of the environment building human capacity through education and training and meeting humanitarian needs early in the bush administration these goals were modified around three strategic pillars of 1 economic growth agriculture and trade 2 global health and 3 democracy conflict prevention and humanitarian assistance more recently usaid white paper on american foreign aid identified five core operational goals of us foreign assistance promoting transformational development especially in the areas of governance institutional capacity and economic restructuring strengthening fragile states providing humanitarian assistance crs5 supporting us geostrategic interests particularly in countries such as iraq afghanistan pakistan jordan egypt and israel and mitigating global and international ills including hivaids2 perhaps the most defining change in us foreign aid policy came following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states when american foreign assistance has taken on more strategic sense of importance and has been cast frequently in terms of contributing to the global war on terrorism in september 2002 president bush released his administrations national security strategy that established global development for the first time as the third pillar of us national security along with defense and diplomacy also in 2002 executive branch foreign assistance budget justifications began to underscore the war on terrorism as the top foreign aid priority highlighting amounts of us assistance to about 30 frontline states in the terrorism war countries that cooperated with the united states in the war on terrorism or faced terrorist threats themselves the substantial reconstruction programs in afghanistan and iraq which total more in fy2004 than the combined budgets of all other aid programs are also part of the emphasis on using foreign aid to combat terrorism at roughly the same time that fighting terrorism became the leading concern of american foreign aid the bush administration announced other significant initiatives that have defined and strengthened two additional key foreign assistance goals promoting economic growth and reducing poverty and combating the global hivaids pandemic the millennium challenge corporation mcc is new aid delivery concept authorized by congress and established in early 2004 that is intended to concentrate significantly higher amounts of us resources in few low and lowmiddle income countries that have demonstrated strong commitment to political economic and social reforms if fully funded 5 billion will be available by fy2006 to support these best development performers in order to accelerate economic growth and lower the number of people living in absolute poverty addressing global health problems has further become core us aid objective in recent years congress created separate appropriation account for child survival and health activities in the mid1990s and increased funding for international hivaids and other infectious disease programs president bushs announcement at his 2003 state of the union message of fiveyear 15 billion effort to combat aids malaria and tuberculosis has added greater emphasis to this primary foreign assistance objective beyond these recently emerging foreign aid goals other prominent objectives that have continued since the early 1990s have included supporting peace in the middle east through assistance to israel egypt jordan and the palestinians fostering democratization and stability for countries in crisis such as bosnia haiti rwanda kosovo and liberia facilitating democratization and free market economies in central europe and the former soviet union suppressing international narcotics production and trafficking through assistance to colombia and other 2 us agency for international development us foreign

operations funding trends as shown in the figure 1 foreign operations funding levels expressed in real terms taking into account the effects of inflation have fluctuated widely over the past 29 years3 after peaking at over 34 billion in fy1985 constant fy2005 dollars foreign operations appropriations began period of decline to lowpoint of 141 billion in fy1997 with only brief period of higher amounts in the early 1990s due to special supplementals for panama and nicaragua 1990 countries affected by the gulf war 1991 and the former soviet states 1993 figure 1 foreign operations funding trends 3 some of these swings in budget levels shown in the figure are not the result of policy decisions but are due to technical budget accounting changes involving how congress scores various programs for example the large increase in fy1981 did not represent higher funding levels but rather the fact that export credit programs began to be counted as appropriations rather than as offbudget items part of the substantial rise in spending in fy1985 came as result of the requirement to appropriate the full amount of military aid loans rather than only the partial appropriation required in the past beginning in fy1992 congress changed how all federal credit programs are scored in appropriation bills which further altered the scoring of foreign aid loans funded in foreign operations all of these factors make it very difficult to present precise and consistent data trend line in foreign operations funding levels nevertheless the data shown here can be regarded as illustrative of general trends in congressional decisions regarding foreign operations appropriations over the past 29 years crs7 arguing that declining international affairs resources seriously undermined us foreign policy interests and limited the ability of american officials to influence overseas events clinton administration officials and other outside groups vigorously campaigned to reverse the decadelong decline in the foreign policy budget foreign aid spending increased slightly in fy1998 but beginning the following year and continuing to the present foreign operations appropriations have trended upward due in large part to the approval of resources for special and in some cases unanticipated foreign policy contingencies and new initiatives while funding for regular continuing foreign aid programs also rose modestly during this period supplemental spending for special activities such as central american hurricane relief fy1999 kosovo emergency assistance fy1999 wye rivermiddle east peace accord support fy2000 counternarcotics initiative in colombia and the andean region fy2000 and fy2002fy2004 aid to the front line states in the war on terrorism and iraqwar related assistance fy2003fy2004 was chiefly responsible for the growth in foreign aid appropriations while foreign operations appropriations had been rising for five consecutive years amounts approved in fy2003 and fy2004 reached unprecedented levels over the past 40 years regular appropriations approved in these two years were roughly on par with amounts of the previous few years but substantial supplementals of 75 billion and 212 billion respectively for assistance to the front line states in the war on terrorism and afghanistan and iraq reconstruction have pushed spending upward the regular foreign operations bill signed by the president on january 23 2004 combined with an earlier iraq supplemental approved in november 2003 pl 108 106 and subsequent emergency relief for darfur sudan pl 108287 brought fy2004 appropriations to 394 billion constant fy2005 dollars the highest level in real terms since the early 1960s the enacted level for fy2005 of 1974 billion while less than the previous two years is the largest foreign operations appropriation in real terms than all other years in over decade moreover the fy2005 total is likely to grow when congress considers supplemental funding for tsunami disaster relief and possibly additional iraq reconstruction needs supplemental resources for foreign operations programs which in fy2004 exceeded regular foreign operations funding have become significant channel of funding for us international activities due to the nature of rapidly changing overseas events and the emergence of unanticipated contingencies to which it is in the us national interest to respond it is not surprising that foreign aid and defense resources from time to time are the major reason for considering and approving supplemental spending outside the regular appropriation cycle supplementals have provided resources for such major foreign policy events as the camp david accords fy1979 central america conflicts fy1983 africa famine and middle east economic downturn fy1985 panama and nicaragua government transitions fy1990 the gulf war fy1991 and bosnia relief and reconstruction fy1996 crs8 table 2 foreign operations appropriations fy1996 to fy2005

but after period of only one significant foreign aid supplemental in eight years beginning in fy1999 congress has approved foreign operations supplemental appropriations exceeding 1 billion in each of the past six years relief for central american victims of hurricane mitch kosovo refugees and victims of the embassy bombings in kenya and tanzania in fy1999 totaled 16 billion and was followed in fy2000 by 11 billion supplemental largely to fund the presidents new counternarcotics initiative in colombia as part of 40 billion emergency supplemental to fight terrorism enacted in september 2001 president bush and congress allocated 14 billion for foreign aid activities in fy2001 and fy2002 another 115 billion supplemental cleared congress in fy2002 to augment afghan reconstruction efforts and assist other frontline states in the war on terrorism until fy2003 these additional resources accounted for between 7 and 11 of total foreign operations spending the 75 billion iraq war supplemental for fy2003 however went well beyond these standards representing nearly onethird of the fy2003 foreign operations budget and was surpassed as noted above only by fy2004 supplemental appropriations which more than doubled the foreign operations budget for the year crs9 figure 2 supplemental funding for foreign operations 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 supplemental

this report exclude us contributions to the international monetary fund imf proposals that are enacted periodically about every five years in foreign operations bills congress approved 179 billion for the imf in fy1999 the first appropriation since fy1993 including these large infrequent and uniquely scored imf appropriations tends to distort general analysis of foreign operations funding trends although congress provides new budget authority through appropriations for the full amount of us participation the transaction is considered an exchange of assets between the united states and the imf and results in outlays from the us treasury in short the appropriations are offset by the creation of us counterpart claim on the imf that is liquid and interest bearing crs10 foreign operations the fy2005 budget resolution and sec 302b allocations usually appropriations committees begin markups of their spending bills only after congress has adopted budget resolution and funds have been distributed to the appropriations panels under what is referred to as the section 302a allocation process reference to the pertinent authority in the congressional budget act following this house and senate appropriations committees separately decide how to allot the total amount available among their 13 subcommittees staying within the functional guidelines set in the budget resolution this second step is referred to as the section 302b allocation foreign operations funds fall within the international affairs budget function function 150 representing in most years about 65 of the function total smaller amounts of function 150 are included in four other appropriation bills how much international affairs money to allocate to each of the four subcommittees with jurisdiction over the international affairs programs and how to distribute the funds among the numerous programs are decisions exclusively reserved for the appropriations committees nevertheless overall ceilings set in the budget resolution can have significant implications for the budget limitations within which the house and senate foreign operations subcommittees will operate when they meet to mark up their annual appropriation bills on may 19 2004 house and senate conferees agreed to budget framework for fy2005 sconres 95 that included 821 billion in discretionary budget authority the discretionary budget authority target for the international affairs function out of which foreign operations programs receive their funding was 2928 billion 22 billion or 7 less than the presidents request if the conference recommendations were followed during the appropriation process it was likely that the administrations proposal for foreign operations could not be fully met the house and senate appropriations committees however can choose to allocate the 2928 billion among the four subcommittees proportionally different than what the president proposed or to alter the overall amount for foreign policy activities depending on other competing priorities the final allocations can diverge significantly from those assumed in the budget resolution complicating decisions related to the 302b allocation process was the lack of final vote on the fy2005 budget resolutions conference agreement the house passed the measure on may 19 216213 and deemed the 821 billion discretionary budget authority cap included in the budget resolution as guidance for the appropriations committee the resolution however remained pending in the senate where disagreements focused on the size of the deficit budget enforcement mechanisms and extending existing tax cuts matters unrelated to international affairs funding issues while congress can and did proceed with consideration of appropriation bills without finalizing the budget resolution the lack of broad consensus on overall spending levels can make it more difficult to pass each of the 13 appropriation measures crs11 on june 2 the house appropriations committee released its 302b allocations providing 1939 billion for foreign operations the amount is 193 billion or 91 less than the presidents request the senate appropriations committee announced its subcommittee allocations on september 8 making available the identical amount for foreign operations as approved by the house panel the reduction for foreign operations in both houses was the largest for any of the 13 subcommittees when compared to the administrations recommendation4 as approved in hr 4818 the omnibus consolidated appropriation act 2005 the final total amount for foreign operations exceeds the level previously allocated for the bill this is largely the result of white housecongressional agreement to add funds for the millennium challenge account and to include 93 million in emergency funding an amount that does not count against the allocation cap for relief and peacekeeping activities in the darfur region of sudan the final regular foreign operations measure provides 1964 billion this compares with the 1939 billion allocated under the earlier 302b allocations for foreign operations foreign operations appropriations request for fy2005 and congressional consideration request overview on february 2 2004 president bush asked congress to appropriate 2132 billion for fy2005 foreign operations the budget proposal was 205 billion or 106 higher than foreign operations appropriations for fy2004 excluding funds approved for iraq reconstruction including iraq reconstruction funds the fy2005 request is significantly smaller than the fy2004 total of 387 billion foreign operations together with requests for defense and homeland security were areas proposed for the largest growth in spending under the fy2005 appropriation request despite the large overall increase for foreign operations much of the added funding was concentrated in few areas the fy2005 budget continued to highlight foreign aid in support of the war on terrorism as the highest priority with onethird increase for antiterrorism programs in addition two recently launched foreign aid initiatives the millennium challenge corporation mcc and the presidents emergency plan for aids relief pepfar were slated for significant funding 4 in issuing the subcommittee allocations house and senate committees also compared fy2005 levels with amounts enacted for fy2004 in the case of foreign operations the committees compared their 1939 billion recommendation for fy2005 with the 1748 billion total approved in the regular foreign operations appropriation bill enacted in pl 108199 using this point of measurement the fy2005 allocation was 19 billion or 109 higher than fy2004 levels however because congress approved large foreign operations supplemental prior to enactment of the regular various baselines for fy2004 could be used in drawing comparisons between the two years since the fy2004 supplemental included some amounts that had been previously earmarked in house and senatepassed regular pakistan and afghanistan aid for example one method would be to include those levels in the fy2004 regular baseline crs12 increases the mcc would grow from 994 million in fy2004 its first year of operation to 25 billion for fy2005 pepfar also in its first year would rise from 16 billion in fy2004 to 22 billion in the fy2005 request additional pepfar funds were proposed in the laborhhs appropriation measure bringing the total fy2005 pepfar request to 282 billion after failing to win congressional approval the past two years for new complex foreign crises contingency fund the white house again proposed 100 million the fy2005 request further included substantial increases for the peace corps and for debt reduction primarily for the democratic republic of the congo combined funding for these major elements of the foreign operations request totaled 523 billion or nearly 75 higher than for fy2004 by contrast the 161 billion proposed for all other foreign operations activities was 183 million or 11 less than fy2004 amounts table 3 foreign operations significant increases fy2005 fy2004 fy2005 fy2005 enacted request fy2004

the terrorist attacks in september 2001 american foreign aid programs have shifted focus toward more direct support for key coalition countries and global counterterrorism efforts in total congress has appropriated approximately 4074 billion in fy2002fy2004 foreign operations funding to assist the approximately 30 frontline states in the war on terrorism implement antiterrorism training programs and address the needs of postconflict iraq and other surrounding countries roughly half of all foreign operations appropriations the past three years has gone for terrorism or iraq warrelated purposes crs13 the fy2005 budget continued the priority of fighting terrorism with 53 billion or 25 of foreign operations resources assisting the frontline states this total was down slightly from the roughly 57 billion appropriated for fy2004 although fy2004 included sizable supplemental for afghanistan and few other frontline states antiterrorism training and technical assistance programs also would rise by 33 above fy2004 levels there were funds requested however for iraq reconstruction the millennium challenge corporation the largest funding increase for fy2005 was for the millennium challenge corporation mcc new government entity established on february 2 2004 the mcc is designed to radically transform the way the united states provides economic assistance concentrating resources on small number of best performing developing nations the request for fy2005 was 25 billion with promise that the mcc will grow to 5 billion by fy2006 and remain at least at that level in the future congress appropriated 994 million for the mccs first year of operations in fy2004 below the presidents 13 billion request the administration said that the added mcc funding would be in addition to and not substitute for existing us economic aid number of international development advocates however remain concerned that given the tight budget environment tradeoffs between regular economic programs and the mcc might be required the mccs board of directors announced on may 6 that 16 countries had qualified for fy2004 mcc resources and will be invited to submit program proposals the selection for fy2005 took place on november 8 adding one additional country presidents emergency plan for aids relief pepfar in his january 2003 state of the union address president bush pledged to substantially increase us financial assistance for preventing and treating hivaids especially in the most heavily affected countries in africa and the caribbean the president promised 15 billion over five years 10 billion of which would be money above and beyond current funding most but not all pepfar funds are included in the foreign operations bill the balance is provided in the laborhhs appropriation measure for fy2005 the president requested in total 28 billion for this international hivaids initiative 22 billion in foreign operations up from the 24 billion enacted for fy2004 16 billion in foreign operations some observers continued to express concern that the fy2005 request like fy2004 fell short of the anticipated 3 billion per year implied in the presidents speech some further questioned the administrations proposal that only 200 million of the total would go to the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria congress boosted the presidents 200 million request in fy2004 for the global fund to 550 million although 877 million could not be transferred because of congressional requirement that the us contribution cannot exceed one third of total donations to the fund crs14 peace corps the 401 million request for the peace corps 30 more than in fy2004 was an effort to continue the presidents longterm plan of having 14000 americans serving in the peace corps by fy2007 while supportive of the multiyear initiative congress has not fully funded the phasedin expansion the past two years the fy2005 request would keep the presidents program on pace for the 14000 volunteer level in fy2007 the us emergency fund for complex crises the administration proposed to establish within the executive office of the president 100 million contingency fund allowing the united states to respond quickly to unforseen complex foreign crises the resources would not be used to address victims of natural disasters but rather would support peace and humanitarian intervention in conflict situations including acts of ethnic cleansing mass killing or genocide in the past congress has been reluctant to approve this type of contingency fund over which it can apply little oversight the administration had asked lawmakers to launch the complex crisis fund with 150 million as part of the fy2003 iraq war supplemental congress however chose to defer consideration of establishing the fund until the fy2004 appropriation cycle in which the funding was also denied debt reduction the administration proposed to double the amount enacted for debt reduction in fy2004 there were three components to the request 105 million to cancel portion of bilateral debt owed by the democratic republic of the congo under the heavily indebted poor country hipc initiative 75 million as contribution to the hipc trust fund to make up for unanticipated shortfalls in implementing the program and 20 million for the tropical forestry conservation debt relief activity congress approved in fy2004 the same amounts for the hipc trust fund and the tropical forestry conservation program but rejected debt relief funding for the congo other key elements of the fy2005 request beyond these specific and prominent issues the foreign operations proposal for fy2005 sought to increase aid activities in few areas while cutting resources for several programs significant appropriation increases included exportimport bank resources would increase from 39 million to 167 million allowing the bank to guarantee about 1198 billion in loans compared to an estimated level of 115 billion in fy2004 foreign military financing funds would increase by about 400 million or 9 largely due to increases proposed for israel and pakistan poland and the philippines crs15 contributions to the world bank and other international financial institutions would grow by 110 million or 8 covering all scheduled us payments to the multilateral development banks plus clearing 59 million of us arrears owed to these institutions for few foreign operations accounts comparisons between fy2005 and fy2004 were affected by amounts approved in fy2004 supplemental spending in these cases the fy2005 request was less than totals provided in fy2004 but higher than levels enacted in the regular foreign operations bill in other words supplemental spending approved in pl 108106 largely for iraq and afghanistan reconstruction pushed fy2004 amounts higher than the fy2005 submission the economic support fund economic aid to strategically important countries was set at 25 billion for fy2005 18 less than the fy2004 but 19 higher than provided in the regular foreign operations measure likewise international narcotics and law enforcement spending of 359 million proposed for fy2005 was 13 less than fy2004 totals but nearly 50 more than enacted in the regular appropriation for several other foreign operations accounts the fy2005 submission represented reduction below amounts approved in fy2004 in which supplemental appropriations were not factor assistance to former soviet states and eastern europe collectively would decline by 65 million or 6 from fy2004 levels the request reflected reorientation in the former soviet aid account to focus more on central asian states linked to the war on terrorism and to continue the process of graduating russia and ukraine from us aid roles bilateral development assistance assessing the administrations request for bilateral development and health assistance was complicated due to the addition of new core development aid account for international hivaids funding and the transfer of resources into this new account from the child survivalhealth line item collectively the three core bilateral development aid accounts development assistance child survivalhealth and the global aids initiative would increase in fy2005 by about 500 million or 14 but because hivaids resources would grow by roughly 600 million the fy2005 request for most other development and health activities was below fy2004 enacted amounts further complicating comparisons between fy2005 and fy2004 was the millennium challenge corporation mcc that may add considerable amounts of bilateral development aid resources for non hivaids programs once mcc compacts are signed and funded in short overall development aid spending including the mcc rose about 43 under the fy2005 request although the impact on specific development programs could not be determined due to the uncertainty over how mcc allocations would affect specific sectors at the country level however it was clear that nations which had been named as hivaids focus countries or are selected for mcc support 27 countries in all would see sharp increase in bilateral development assistance from the united states uganda and zambia for example two hivaids focus countries were crs16 projected to receive in fy2005 double and triple the amounts of us assistance provided in fy2003 respectively mozambique nation that was also an hivaids focus country and had qualified to submit an mcc program proposal could also see us aid triple between fy2003 and fy2005 but for the more than 40 other bilateral development aid recipients levels would remain mostly unchanged under the fy2005 budget and in some cases decline from fy2003 and fy2004 amounts table 4 summary of foreign operations

largest current recipient of us assistance israel and egypt remain the largest regular us aid recipients as they have been for many years in the aftermath of the september 11 terrorist attacks the war in iraq and the initiation of the presidents emergency program for aids relief pepfar foreign aid allocations have changed in several significant ways the request for fy2005 continued the patterns of aid distributions of the past two years with the new feature of several pepfar countries joining the list of top recipients table 5 lists those nations that have received an average of more than 100 million from the united states in fy2004 and requested or earmarked for fy2005 countries are listed in the order of the combined amounts for those two years since september 11 the administration has used economic and military assistance increasingly as tool in efforts to maintain cohesive international coalition to conduct the war on terrorism and to assist nations which have both supported us forces and face serious terrorism threats themselves pakistan for crs17 example key coalition partner on the border with afghanistan had been ineligible for us aid other than humanitarian assistance due to sanctions imposed after india and pakistan conducted nuclear tests in may 1998 and pakistan experienced military coup in 1999 since lifting aid sanctions in october 2001 the united states has transferred over 19 billion to pakistan jordan turkey indonesia the philippines and india also are among the top aid recipients as part of the network of frontline states in the war on terrorism another major cluster of top recipients are those in the andean region where the administration maintains large counternarcotics initiative that combines assistance to interdict and disrupt drug production together with alternative development programs for areas that rely economically on the narcotics trade new dimension in us aid allocations the impact of the presidents international hivaids initiative can also be seen in amounts allocated for fy2004 and proposed for fy2005 uganda ethiopia kenya zambia south africa and nigeria all pepfar focus countries are now among the leading recipients of us assistance this list will further change once the administration announces aid packages for millennium challenge account qualifying countries perhaps adding several additional countries that receive more than 100 million in us assistance missing or falling at the bottom of the list of top recipients are several countries in the balkans and the former soviet union serbia and montenegro kosovo russia ukraine armenia and georgia which have seen levels decline in recent years turkey leading recipient in most years over the past 25 years also falls well down the list as

effort to cancel significant amount of iraqs outstanding debt and to use previously appropriated iraq reconstruction funds to cover the cost of any such debt relief the bill further reconstituted the coalition provisional authority inspectors general office that has been monitoring iraq reconstruction resources the cpa ig expired with the transfer of authority in iraq on june 28 and the

july 15 members considered number of amendments some controversial and strongly opposed by the administration of particular concern to the administration was proposal by representative lantos to shift 570 million in military aid funds for egypt to economic assistance proponents of the amendment argued that external security threats facing cairo did not warrant such large 13 billion annual military aid package from the united states and that economic challenges confronting egypt were of more immediate concern in letter to house members secretary of state powell expressed strong opposition arguing that us military support of egypt is cornerstone of the camp david accords and contributes to regional peace efforts to combat terrorism usegyptian military cooperation the reduction of us military grants that are anticipated to be used for the purchase of previously ordered americanmade defense items might result in the cancellation of some prior contracts by egypt according to the

the senate bill included crs23 1939 billion in discretionary budget authority representing the measures funding allocation plus 225 million in emergency appropriations for global hivaids programs and to strengthen the african unions peacekeeping mission in darfur sudan hr 4818 as passed by the senate was about 22 billion higher than the fy2004 regular foreign operations spending measure excluding supplemental appropriations but only 340 million larger than total foreign operations for fy2004 when iraq reconstruction funds are excluded fy2005 totals for foreign operations were augmented by an emergencydesignated 95 million in pl 108 287 the dod appropriation bill for fy2005 providing additional humanitarian aid to refugees in the darfur region of sudan and 100 million for hurricane relief

million more than the presidents request another 150 million for the global atm fund was included in s 2810 bringing the total in both bills to 550 million key funding levels for other bilateral development assistance the senate measure provided 446 billion for the three core bilateral development aid accounts including emergencydesignated funds up by 411 million from the request and by nearly 1 billion from fy2004 levels set basic education programs at 335 million slightly below the 338 million request restored funding for vulnerable children programs to 30 million from the child survival account 19 million more than proposal for fy2005 increased by about 75 to 275 million funds for other infectious diseases including malaria and tuberculosis above the request s 2812 earmarked 200 million for other infectious diseases from regular child survivalhealth account funds plus an additional 75 million of the emergency designated money for malaria control programs family planningreproductive health on population aid and reproductive heath matters the senate bill set bilateral family planning assistance at 450 million 50 million above the request the senate further included 34 million for the population fund unfpa s 2812 however modified two controversial provisions associated with family planning funding that could have had the effect of reversing current administration policy the first amended the kemp kasten restrictions that resulted in the withholding of us funds to unfpa the past three years the amendment would have narrowed somewhat the grounds on which the administration could find unfpa in violation of the restrictions by stating that crs24 an organization must directly support coercive abortions or involuntary sterilizations in order to be denied us support the senate measure further added new text stating that organization could be denied funds solely because the government of country engages in coercive practices s 2812 also revised the presidents socalled mexico city policy that prohibits foreign nongovernmental organizations ngos from receiving us funds if they perform or promote abortion as method of family planning whether or not such activities are supported with usprovided resources the senate language stipulated that foreign ngos could not be declared ineligible for us aid for conducting any health or medical services with nonus government funds so long as the practices did not violate laws in the country in which the services were provided or would not violate us law the provision sec 599c of s 2812 further provided that foreign ngos would not be subject to conditions associated with the use of nonus government funds for advocacy and lobbying activities that were more restrictive than those applied to american ngos iraq the president did not request additional reconstruction funds for iraq and the senate bill did not include any further appropriations the senate proposal however authorized the use of 360 million from previously appropriated iraq reconstruction funds to cancel about 4 billion or roughly 95 of debt owed by iraq to the united states the authority to use 360 million was requested on september 14 as part of larger package to transfer 346 billion approved last year for water and electrical projects in iraq in order to augment resources for security and law enforcement oil production employment generation election support and other development activities because congress placed limits on how much of the 184 billion iraq reconstruction supplemental pl 108106 could be reprogrammed for other purposes the administration also sought changes in existing transfer authorities changes to reallocation limits recommended in the senates version of hr 4818 would have permitted some but not all of the administrations proposed reprogramming specifically the senate bill increased from 10 to 20 the amount that any particular program sector could be reduced in order to add resources to another activity the white house proposed however to transfer nearly 45 of the original amount of funds for water and sewage provided in pl 108106 darfur hr 4818 as passed by the senate provided over 615 million for humanitarian and other relief assistance to the darfur region of sudan plus 75 million for the rapid expansion of the african unions monitoring and peacekeeping mission in darfur the latter funds designated as emergency spending were added during floor debate as an amendment offered by senator corzine the administrations request had assumed roughly 394 million for relief aid drawn from the refugee and disaster aid accounts senate increases in these humanitarian aid accounts plus authority to transfer up to 150 million from unspent iraq reconstruction funds supporting relief efforts in darfur raised the estimated total for the region in the senate bill to 690 million 615 million for humanitarian programs 75 million for peacekeeping

hr 4818 the president signed the measure on december 8 pl 108447 as passed the act provides 1964 billion after adjusting for required 08 acrosstheboard rescission although this is 168 billion or nearly 8 below the presidents request pl 108447 increases amounts passed earlier by the house 1939 billion and the senate 1961 billion additional funds were added for the millennium challenge account and 93 million was designated as an emergency appropriation for relief and peacekeeping support in the darfur region of sudan the emergency funds do not count against the regular foreign operations allocation the enacted level is about 23 billion 13 more than the regular fy2004 foreign operations level but far less than the 3878 billion total appropriation in fy2004 that included 212 billion for iraq reconstruction and other supplemental needs fy2005 totals for foreign operations were augmented by an emergency designated 100 million for hurricane relief aid for caribbean nations approved in pl 108324 the fy2005 military construction and supplemental measure unless noted otherwise amounts for specific programs and countries discussed below are the levels specified in the foreign operations division d of hr 4818 and are subject to an acrosstheboard reduction of 08 as also provided in hr 4818 hivaids and other development aid the foreign operations portion of pl 108447 provides 228 billion for the presidents emergency plan for aids relief pepfar after applying the rescission roughly 80 million higher than the request and the housepassed level but 139 million less than passed by the senate crs27 funding for international hivaids included elsewhere in pl 108447 as part of other appropriation bills brings the total to 292 billion 100 million more than the request although both house and senate bills required that 400 million of the total hivaids funding in foreign operations be provided to the global fund for hivaids tuberculosis and malaria the conference agreement includes 250 million this level will be supplemented with the carryforward of 878 million from fy2004 and 100 million from the laborhhsed appropriation measure thus bringing the total us contribution to the global fund to 4878 million in fy2005 less the 08 rescission the carryforward appropriations could not be transferred to the global fund in fy2004 due to congressionallyadded requirement that us support to the fund could not exceed onethird of total contributions from all donors without the authority to use these funds in fy2005 the 878 million would have become available for bilateral hivaids programs for other key bilateral development assistance programs pl 108447 provides 436 billion for the three core bilateral development aid accounts after adjusting for the 08 acrosstheboard

family planning aid assistance at 441 million level between house and senatepassed amounts the bill includes 34 million for the population fund unfpa subject to the kempkasten conditions but drops the senate language amending kempkasten that might have narrowed the grounds on which the administration could deny funding to the organization conferees also deleted the senate proposed revision to the presidents socalled mexico city conditions on bilateral family planning assistance in way that may have reversed the policy restrictions darfur pl 108447 provides 404 million for relief and peace and security activities in sudan including the darfur region this level falls between the 311 million and over 690 million included in house and senatepassed bills respectively although the enacted agreement deletes the senate proposal to provide 75 million in emergency funding for the african unions peacekeeping mission in crs28 darfur and authority to transfer up to 150 million from unspent iraq reconstruction funds for relief efforts in the region the conferees intend that 75 million of the total be used in support of african union operations in darfur previously congress approved an additional 95 million in emergency sudan funding in pl 108287 the defense department appropriation bill for fy2005 country and regional aid levels the conference agreement to greater extent than previous foreign operations measures sets out specific country allocations from several economic and military aid accounts in most cases conference allocations match the presidents request although with some modifications higher and lower than proposed hr 4818 further specifies that funding for africa that is drawn from the development and child survival accounts should be restored to levels provided in fy2004 rather than the lower amounts proposed for fy2005 selected country aid levels include egypt 184 billion as requested but with the addition of senateproposed language that democracy

funding measures operated through november 20 under the terms of hjres 107 continuing resolution in addition to temporarily funding foreign operations programs for the next seven weeks the continuing resolution enacted into law several provisions that had been pending in house andor senate passed versions of hr 4818 the most significant was the approval of september 14 request by the white house to reallocate 346 billion of the 184 billion iraq reconstruction aid package passed by congress last year pl 108106 in this earlier appropriation measure congress had limited the extent to which the administration could shift funds among major reconstruction sectors among other changes the president proposed adding 18 billion for security and law enforcement 360 million to cover the costs of cancelling about 4 billion of iraqi debt owed the united states and 180 million more for governance and election support programs offsetting these additions the reallocation called for reductions in the electrical and water sectors house and senatepassed versions of hr 4818 had authorized the use of funds for debt relief and the senate measure which was approved after the september 14 reallocation request accommodated some but not all of the reallocation proposal the continuing resolution effectively approved the administrations full request including the debt relief authorization and the reallocation of funds in other foreign operationsrelated matters addressed in hjres 107 the continuing resolution increased usaid operating expenses for managing the iraq reconstruction operation from 29 million in pl 108106 to 119 million authorized the overseas private investment corporation to operate in iraq and allowed the millennium challenge corporation to extend assistance in fy2005 to countries that narrowly missed qualifying for the program in hopes of strengthening their chances for selection in the future existing law approved this authority only for fy2004 selected major issues in the fy2005 foreign operations debate while the foreign operations appropriations bill can include virtually any foreign policy issue of interest to congress the annual debate usually focuses on several major policy and spending issues for fy2005 substantial debate focused on the following crs31 foreign aid to combat terrorism since the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks and the initiation of military operations in afghanistan and iraq combating global terrorism has become one of the top priorities of american foreign assistance secretary of state powell has continued over the past two years to emphasize at numerous congressional hearings that fighting terrorism is the most important objective of the foreign operations budget requests although there is disagreement regarding the extent to which foreign aid can directly contribute to reducing the threat of terrorism most agree that economic and security assistance aimed at reducing poverty promoting jobs and educational opportunities and helping stabilize conflictprone nations can indirectly address some of the factors that terrorists use in recruiting disenfranchised individuals for their cause foreign aid can be programmed in number of ways that contribute to the war on terrorism assistance can be transferred as has occurred in pakistan and afghanistan to bolster efforts of coalitionpartner government to counter domestic dissent and armed attacks by extremist groups and to promote better health care education and employment opportunities to its people security assistance can finance the provision of military equipment and training to nations facing threats from their own internallybased terrorist movements as illustrated in table 6 below the united states provided through fy2004 more than 194 billion to 26 socalled frontline states in the global war on terrorism since the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks frontline states are those nations cooperating with the united states in the global war on terrorism or are facing terrorist threats themselves when combined with roughly 21 billion appropriated for iraq reconstruction assistance enacted in fy2003 and fy2004 supplementals total funding for bilateral terrorismrelated country assistance is more than 40 billion this is slightly more than half of the nearly 79 billion approved by congress for worldwide foreign operations spending since september 11 for fy2005 the administration requested 545 billion for the frontline states based on passage of the fy2005 appropriation the estimated level for this year will be slightly less largely due to reductions in aid to turkey although increased levels of foreign aid are only one sign of the importance the united states assigns to the support provided by these frontline states the amounts allocated since september 11 are in sharp contrast to the 34 billion provided to these 26 countries prior to the attacks in regular fy2001 appropriations the fy2005 proposal for example was 60 higher than foreign aid allotted prior to september 11 additional economic and military assistance has been particularly evident in few countries including jordan pakistan afghanistan turkey the philippines kyrgystan tajikistan uzbekistan oman yemen and djibouti for fy2005 pakistan the philippines georgia indonesia and morocco are scheduled to receive the largest increases among the frontline states congress has been supportive of additional foreign aid resources aimed at countering terrorism nevertheless some warn that the united states needs to be crs32 cautious about the risks of creating close aid relationship with governments that may have questionable human rights records are not accountable to their people and are possibly corrupt some members have been especially critical of administration efforts to include in aid proposals for frontline states legislative language that would waive all existing restrictions and prohibitions on the transfers instead these critics argue the administration should specifically identify any obstacles to proceeding with country aid program and seek congressional waiver for those particular problems for example in late 2001 the administration wanted to provide pakistan with 600 million in fastdisbursing economic aid instead of providing blanket waiver of legislative obstacles congress approved in pl 10757 specific waivers of aid prohibitions that applied to countries that engaged in missile proliferation whose leaders came to power through military coup and which were behind in debt payments to the united states beyond substantial amounts of bilateral aid for frontline states the foreign operations appropriation bill funds several global programs specifically aimed at antiterrorism efforts overseas antiterrorism assistance ata since fy1984 the state department has maintained the ata program designed to maximize international cooperation in the battle against global terrorism through training equipment transfers and advice the ata program is intended to strengthen antiterrorism capabilities of foreign law enforcement and security officials since its initiation in 1984 over 23000 officials from 112 countries have participated in ata projects ata funding is included within the foreign operations account of nonproliferation anti terrorism demining and related programs nadr resources for the ata program rose sharply following september 11 growing from 38 million in fy2001 to 96 million in regular fy2004 funding congress further provided 35 million in fy2004 supplemental appropriations for expansion of ata programs in afghanistan including protection of afghan president karzai for fy2005 the state department sought 1283 million for ata programs up onethird from regular fy2004 levels most of the new request 105 million would continue ongoing training programs for officials from the frontline states an afghan presidential protection activity and special programs in pakistan and

to conduct senior official policy workshops and multilateral conferences in order to better respond to terrorist incidents involving weapons of mass destruction overseas with 3 million from emergency fy2002 supplemental spending the state department conducted workshops in 18 countries as well as several regional conferences congress did not approve any additional resources the past two years but the administration sought 500000 in fy2005 to continue conferences and other bilateral engagements with allies in the war on terrorism terrorist financing in december 2001 an interagency review group identified 19 countries where significant terrorist financing threat existed and with 3 million allocated from the emergency response fund launched training and technical assistance program the state department allocated 10 million out of the fy2002 supplemental appropriation to expand the program complemented with treasury department contributions of about 5 million each of the past two years state department funds are included in the foreign operations nadr account while treasury department resources are drawn from the technical assistance program also funded in foreign operations counterterrorism financing activities would expand significantly under the fy2005 request with 75 million proposed from the state departments nadr budget and approximately 85 from treasurys technical assistance program aid restrictions for terrorist states annual foreign operations spending bills routinely include general provisions prohibiting us assistance to countries engaged in terrorist activities or providing certain types of support to terrorist groups included in the fy2004 funding measure were two sec 527 prohibited bilateral us assistance to any country that the president determines grants sanctuary from prosecution to any individual or group which has committed an act of international terrorism or otherwise supports international terrorism the president could waive the restrictions for national security or humanitarian reasons crs35 sec 543 prohibited us aid to government which provides lethal military equipment to country that the secretary of state has determined is headed by terrorist supporting government the president could waive the requirement if it is important to us national interests despite these restrictions however certain types of humanitarian foreign assistance can be provided notwithstanding other provisions of law which would override the terrorism restrictions disaster and refugee relief child survival and hivaids programs

and foreign military financing fmf conferees set levels for frontline states 58 million below requested amounts most of the reduction comes from the elimination of 50 million in economic aid proposed for turkey conferees also cut direct fmf funding for pakistan from 300 million requested to 150 million although with the authority to transfer up to an additional 150 million from prior year funds these decisions track generally with recommendations made in the house passed version of hr 4818 which also reduced amounts for turkey and pakistan with transfer authorization for the latter the senatepassed measure on the other hand proposed increasing military aid totals for several east asia and pacific front line states to over twice as much as proposed by the executive branch for example under the senate plan the philippines would have received 55 million in fmf assistance compared with 30 million proposed indonesia which was not slated by the administration for fmf aid in fy2005 would have received 6 million under crs36 certain conditions the conference agreement sets philippine fmf at 30 million and indonesia fmf at 1 million subject to restrictions counterterrorism programs hr 4818 as passed by congress on november 20 also funds each terrorismspecific program as noted in table 2 at or near the requested level the conference agreement reduces antiterrorism assistance to

from prosecution terrorist individuals or groups or otherwise supports international terrorism sec 527 the approved measure further prohibits aid which can be waived to government providing lethal military equipment to country that the secretary of state has determined is headed by terrorist supporting government sec 542 other war on terrorism provisions the conference agreement also retains with modifications two terrorismrelated provisions added during house floor debate and opposed by the administration in their original form the first which had been sponsored by representative nethercutt and approved 241166 during debate in july prohibits economic support fund esf assistance to countries that are party to the international criminal court icc and do not sign an article 98 agreement with the united states pledging that american soldiers serving in their country will not be surrendered to the icc current law the american servicemembers protection act title ii of pl 107206 prohibits us military aid to such countries although with waiver that has been used by president bush for reasons of national interest and for countries that are in the process of considering the ratification of article 98 agreements the nethercutt amendment did not include waivers regarding esf aid cutoffs the conference measure however inserts waivers exempting nato members major nonnato allies group that includes jordan and taiwan critics of the amendment when it passed the house in july were especially concerned about the status of jordan key arab state receiving substantial amounts of esf assistance but has not ratified an article 98 agreement the conference agreement further stipulates that this restriction will not affect countrys eligibility to receive millennium challenge account funding bolivia lesotho and mali are potential mca recipients but do not have ratified article 98 agreement even with these exemptions several countries including cyprus ecuador and peru might face esf aid suspension due to this provision the second provision included by conferees bars any aid for saudi arabia unless the president certifies that the saudis are cooperating in efforts to combat terrorism and that us assistance will help in that effort the house had passed similar aid prohibition sponsored by representative weiner and approved 217191 but without including presidential waiver hr 4818 includes 25000 in military training funds for the saudis token amount that allows the saudis to purchase additional crs37 military training under the international military education and training imet program supporters of the amendment argued that given saudi arabias oil revenues and their view that the saudi government is not reliable partner in the war on terrorism the united states should not be providing any form of foreign assistance opponents of the amendment as originally drafted including the administration contended that this largely symbolic cutoff of foreign aid would undermine counterterrorism cooperation with the saudis and more general middle east peace efforts millennium challenge account5 in speech on march 14 2002 president bush outlined proposal for the united states to increase foreign economic assistance beginning in fy2004 so that by fy2006 american aid would be 5 billion higher than three years earlier the funds referred to as the millennium challenge account mca is managed by new millennium challenge corporation mcc providing assistance through competitive selection process to developing nations that are pursing political and economic reforms in three areas ruling justly promoting good governance fighting corruption respecting human rights and adhering to the rule of law investing in people providing adequate health care education and other opportunities promoting an educated and healthy population fostering enterprise and entrepreneurship promoting open markets and sustainable budgets if fully implemented the initiative would represent one of the largest increases in foreign aid spending in half century outpaced only by the marshall plan following world war ii and the latin americafocused alliance for progress in the early 1960s it would also represent fundamental change in the way the united states invests and delivers economic assistance mcc background the concept is based on the premise that economic development succeeds best where it is linked to free market economic and democratic principles and policies and where governments are committed to implementing reform measures in order to achieve such goals the mcc differs in several fundamental respects from past and current us aid practices the size of the 5 billion commitment the competitive process that will reward countries for past actions measured by 16 objective performance indicators the pledge to segregate the funds from us strategic foreign policy objectives that often strongly influence where us aid is spent and the requirement to solicit program proposals developed solely by qualifying countries with broadbased civil society involvement 5 for more indepth discussion of the original mca proposal and issues debated by congress in 2003 see crs report rl31687 crs38 the new initiative which congress authorized in january 2004 division d of pl 108199 would phase in over threeyear period beginning in fy2004 during the first year mcc participation was limited to the 74 poorest nations with per capita incomes below 1415 and that are eligible to borrow from the world banks international development association the list expanded in fy2005 to include all countries with per capita income below 1465 adding another 13 nations beginning in fy2006 and beyond all lowermiddle income countries with per capita incomes below roughly 3035 may compete for mcc resources country selection is based largely but not exclusively on the nations record measured by 16 performance indicators related to the three categories of good governance economic freedom and investing in people countries that score above the median on half of the indicators in each of the three areas qualify emphasizing the importance of fighting corruption the indicator for corruption is passfail test should country fall below the median on the corruption indicator it will be disqualified from consideration unless other more recent trends suggest otherwise see table below for complete list of the 16 performance indicators administration officials since announcing the mcc initiative in 2002 said that the selection process would be guided by but not necessarily bound to the outcomes of the performance indicators missing or old data general trends and recent steps taken by governments might also be taken into account when annual decisions are made eligibility to receive mca assistance however does not necessarily result in an aid grant once selected countries are required to submit program proposals referred to as mca compacts that have been developed through broadbased national discussion that includes input from civil society the focus of program submissions may vary among countries in size purpose and degree of specificity and will be evaluated by the corporation for among other things how well the compact supports nations economic growth and poverty reduction goals only those compacts that meet the mcc criteria will be funded it is expected that successful compacts will support programs lasting three to five years providing level of resources roughly equivalent to the largest providers of assistance in the country this will most likely result in significant increase of us economic assistance to mca participant countries to manage the new initiative the administration proposed and congress authorized the creation of millennium challenge corporation mcc an independent government entity separate from the departments of state and the treasury and from the us agency for international development usaid the mcc plans for an eventual staff of about 200 drawn from various government agencies nongovernmental organizations and the private sector and led by ceo confirmed by the senate board of directors chaired by the

administration sought 13 billion for the mcas first year level reduced by congress to 994 million the fy2005 budget proposed 25 billion with commitment for 5 billion program in fy2006 mcc implementation steps and issues the passage of legislation on january 23 2004 authorizing and funding the mcc for fy2004 division d of pl 108199 launched period of at least 90 days during which the new corporation would form issue required reports consult with congress and the public and select first year participant countries within 10 days of enactment the board of directors held its initial meeting to establish the program and over the following weeks the corporation identified candidate countries for fy2004 published the criteria and methodology to be used for country selection solicited public comments issued guidelines for compact proposals and on may 6 2004 selected 16 countries to participate in the mcas first year of operations this was followed on november 10 with the selection of fy2005 eligible mca countries an action that added one new participant to the fy2004 list an additional 13 countries have also been named as threshold nations those that just missed qualifying as eligible countries continuing implementation matters that will unfold in the months ahead will include the relationship of mcc programs with those operated by usaid how the corporation and usaid will support threshold countries to better prepare for future performance reviews and the awarding of mca grants in the form of compacts to mca eligible countries establishing the millennium challenge corporation on february 2 2004 the board of directors met agreed to corporation bylaws and approved undersecretary of state larson as the interim ceo subsequently the president nominated paul applegarth to be the permanent mcc ceo an individual confirmed by the senate on may 5 ceo applegarth has held various international and development positions over the past 30 years primarily in the private sector most recently he was the managing director of emerging markets partnership serving as the coo of emerging africa infrastructure fund in 2002 naming fy2004 candidate countries also on february 2 the mcc board issued list of 63 candidate countries that would be reviewed for possible selection as mca participants in fy2004 these countries according to authorizing legislation must be eligible for assistance from the world banks international development association have per capita income of 1415 or less and not be otherwise ineligible to receive us assistance the latter condition eliminated twelve countries burma burundi cambodia central african republic cote divoire guineabissau liberia serbia somalia sudan uzbekistan and zimbabwe that were statutorily barred from receiving american aid publishing the selection criteria and methodology pursuant to reporting requirements set in the mcc legislation the corporation on march 5 2004 sent to congress an overview of the criteria and methodology that would be used to determine the eligibility of the 63 candidate countries in fy2004 the report suggested that there would be relatively few and only minor changes to the criteria and methodology that had been outlined 15 months earlier the same 16 performance indicators as listed in table 8 below would be utilized in few cases crs40 data sources shifted from international institutions to national governments this was especially true in cases where existing data for an indicator were old or incomplete although the corporation did not alter any of the original 16 performance indicators it attempted to address additional criteria added by congress in pl 108 199 through the use of supplemental data and qualitative information while the legislative authorities broadly match criteria proposed by the administration lawmakers included four additional matters on which to evaluate countrys performance these relate to the degree to which country recognizes the rights of people with disabilities supports sustainable management of natural resources respects worker rights and makes social investments especially in women and girls given the range and diversity of suggestions offered throughout the public and congressional debate of the mcc many observers were surprised that the corporation did not propose more substantive changes to the criteria and methodology some questioned how seriously the administration considered alternative approaches and whether the corporation would be open to future revisions6 during the public comment period and at congressional oversight hearings some suggested that existing data sources needed to be refined or new surveys created in order to specifically measure countrys commitment on the four criteria added by congress after further study of the criteria and methodology the corporation announced on august 26 2004 revised set of performance indicators that will be used for the fy2005 selection process the mcc will lower the inflation rate threshold from 20 to 15 making it somewhat more difficult to pass this test only 6 of the 63 candidate countries failed this test for fy2004 an indicator measuring girls primary education completion rates will replace broader measure used in fy2004 that did not disaggregate primary education graduation by gender as noted above including the means to measure country performance on key women and girls issues is one of the requirements added by congress during deliberation on mcc authorizing legislation the corporation further indicated that it will explore additional criteria and methodology changes for fy2006 under consideration are options to lower the inflation level to 10 identify measurement related to natural resource management the mcc has created working group to study possibilities review other possible indicators that would better measure trade barriers that are linked with economic growth 6 see for example steve radelet et comment on the millennium challenge account selection process center for global development march 9 2004 crs41 develop more comprehensive indicator than the current days to start business to gauge governments commitment to entrepreneurship and privatesector ownership consider additional genderrelation indicators country selection for fy2004 on may 6 the mcc board of directors determined that 16 countries would be eligible for fy2004 mca funding and invited each to submit program proposals armenia madagascar benin mali bolivia mongolia cape verde mozambique georgia nicaragua ghana senegal honduras sri lanka lesotho vanuatu as expected the selection process raised number of questions and concerns the administration had previously said that the board would be guided by but not entirely bound to the outcome of the performance indicator review process that board members could apply discretion in their selection performance trends missing or old data and recent policy actions might come into play during selection deliberations officials noted the final selection reflected decisions that both strictly followed the performance indicator outcomes and applied board discretion to take into account other factors ten of the countries complied with the stated criteria performing above the median in relation to their peers on at least half of the indicators in each of the three policy clusters and performing above the median on corruption the board also examined whether country performed substantially below average on any single indicator and whether their selection was supported by supplemental information each of the ten countries also passed these additional tests for ten other countries however some discretion was applied by the board in three cases cape verde lesotho and sri lanka the countries met the criteria but fell significantly below average on one indicator yet were still selected by the board due to recent policy changes or positive trend lines for three others bolivia georgia and mozambique the board deviated from strict application of the selection criteria because of evidence that the governments were taking corrective actions in the deficient areas on the other hand the mcc board chose not to select four countries that technically met the performance criteria but fell substantially below the median on one or more indicator in each of these cases the board did not believe that the government was taking any action to improve its performance although bhutan mauritania and vietnam passed the corruption hurdle and half of the ruling justly indicators they scored very low on the measurements for political rights and civil liberties and in vietnams case on the voice and accountability indicator fourth crs42 country guyana was also not selected despite passing the necessary hurdles it scored particularly low on the fiscal policy measurement it has been long assumed by mcc officials and close observers of the mca initiative that when the country selections were announced there would be disagreements and possible surprises in the final list especially if the board exercised its discretionary authority as it did for fy2004 participants representative lowey for example expressed her view at may 13 house appropriations committee hearing that east timor which failed to pass the economic freedom hurdle in part due to missing data on two of the indicators should have been selected ceo applegarth responded that east timor is new nation and that it was premature to conclude that it was highperforming country he acknowledged however that east timor should be given close consideration in the future if the current trend lines continue besides east timor some suggested that kenya should have been included because of its new governments commitment to education and anticorruption efforts usaid administrator natsios acknowledged at the hearing that albania was close call failing because it scored slightly below the median on corruption like albania malawi and moldova would have qualified on the basis of performance if not for slightly failing scores on corruption several small island states including kiribati sao tome and tonga were not selected even though the absence of data for several categories may have played role despite these questions over specific country eligibility the selection process appeared to have satisfied two major concerns that have been consistently expressed over the past year based on earlier analysis some argued that africa would be underrepresented in the final selection process with perhaps as few as three regional states participating in fact eight or half of the first year qualifying nations were from africa selection of countries that would give the appearance of geostrategic considerations was concern of many who view the absence of securityrelated factors from mca decisionmaking as one of the most attractive features of the initiative had the board used its discretionary powers to select indonesia for example some critics would have likely charged that the decision stemmed more from jakartas role in the war on terrorism than on strict policy performance indonesia passed all necessary hurdles except for corruption country selection for fy2005 meeting on november 8 the mcc board of directors made its selection of fy2005 eligible countries armenia mali benin mongolia bolivia morocco georgia mozambique ghana nicaragua honduras senegal lesotho sri lanka madagascar vanuatu crs43 the board chose one new country for fy2005 morocco while 15 of the 16 nations included for fy2004 were determined eligible again for fy2005 cape verde was not selected due to the fact that its per capita gni exceeded the 1465 ceiling cape verde however remains eligible for mca support using fy2004 funds board selections represent both high degree of continuity between fy2004 decisions as well as sharp difference in the degree to which it applied its discretionary authority for qualifying or denying countries for fy2005 the fact that each country except cape verde selected for fy2004 mca participation was also declared eligible for fy2005 should not be surprising given the nature of the mca concept the board identified in may 2004 what it determined to be the 16 best performers based on the assumption that these countries had and would continue to express strong commitment to the types of economic governance and social policy reforms measured by the mcc absent substantial negative development since may there was presumed expectation that these same countries would score well in subsequent performance comparison with their income peers moreover except in some extreme situations evidence of slide in policy performance as measured through the various data sources would likely lag behind the actual policy shift and not be reflected in the immediate data updates in addition two other factors that may not apply in future years seem to have affected the outcome for fy2005 first with the selection dates for fy2004 and fy2005 coming only six months apart rather than one year as should be the case in the future it was likely that the data would indicate less change than might be the case if the comparisons occurred over longer period between may and november several of the data sources upon which the 16 performance indicators are based did not update or revise their figures as result the review of countries for fy2005 was based on much of the same data and rankings as had been the case for the fy2004 selection moreover the addition of 13 new countries for consideration in the fy2005 round had the effect for at least six of the indicators of lowering the median against which countries were compared because of this if country scored well above the median in the fy2004 selection decision it was likely that it would score the same or better in the review for fy2005 where medians declined for example in may bolivia fell exactly at the median on the corruption indicator but in november when the median for corruption dropped somewhat after new countries were added bolivia scored above the median even though bolivias score on corruption did not change this phenomena is unlikely to be repeated again to the same extent since countries in the lowincome group will be added or subtracted only if their economy grows beyond the per capita income ceiling or us foreign aid sanctions are applied or lifted since the last review the net effect is that the core set of lowincome countries competing for mca selection is unlikely to change as much as it did in fy2005 thereby reducing the extent to which the median will be altered simply because of the addition of new countries despite the degree of continuity between fy2004 and fy2005 in the selection of eligible countries the mcc board departed somewhat from the previous round by not selecting large number of countries that technically met the mca crs44 performance criteria many observers may raise questions over the fy2005 selections regarding the countries that were not selected rather than those that were as noted above in may 2004 the board chose not to select four countries bhutan guyana mauritania and vietnam although each passed the minimum number of indicators the board decided to exclude these four because they scored substantially below the median on one or more measurements although without defining precisely what represented mark substantially below the median for fy2005 the board did not select 10 countries that met the criteria including three of the four left out of the fy2004 round mauritania did not meet the minimum qualifications in addition for fy2005 burkina faso china djibouti egypt nepal the philippines and swaziland met the minimum standards but were not selected thus far the corporation has offered little explanation as to why these countries were not chosen it appears however that scoring substantially below perhaps in the lowest 25th percentile has become defacto criteria for exclusion for example the corporations ceo paul applegarth commented that the philippines country that passed 13 of the 16 indicators did not qualify because manilla scored substantially below the median on tests for health expenditures and fiscal policy and that more recent trends indicated the fiscal policy situation was deteriorating further each of the other nine nations that met the minimum qualifications but were not selected also had one score in the 25th percentile although the corporation has not commented on whether this was the reason for not choosing them another possible reason for limiting the number of qualifying countries in the fy2005 round might be due to anticipated funding reductions the administration had requested combined fy2004fy2005 appropriations of 38 billion but may have available 2530 less depending on the outcome of congressional debate on the fy2005 budget corporation officials have said that reduced funding would lead to fewer countries assisted andor smaller grants per country situation that would be complicated further by qualifying additional nations instead the board of directors invited three of these 10 countries to participate in the threshold program intended to help nearmiss nations take steps to strengthen areas that would help them qualify for full mca assistance in the future burkina faso guyana and the philippines may now apply for threshold program assistance another board departure in the fy2005 selection process was to avoid using its discretionary authority to qualify countries that did not meet the minimum performance indicators in may the board chose three nations bolivia georgia and mozambique that did not pass the socalled hardhurdle of corruption the latter two again qualified despite falling below the median on corruption while bolivia did not require an exemption after the median dropped below its score with the addition of new countries for fy2005 five nations malawi moldova paraguay tanzania and ukraine passed the required number of performance indicators except corruption although malawi paraguay and tanzania are threshold countries none of the five were chosen for full mca status crs45 threshold countries and us assistance in order to encourage non qualifying countries to improve in weak areas the united states will help governments that are committed to reform to strengthen performance so that they would be more competitive for mca funding in future years congress provided in authorizing legislation that not more than 10 of mca appropriations 994 million in fy2004 could be used for such purposes stating that the funding could be made available through usaid the mcc set aside up to 40 million for countries that just missed qualifying for fy2004 funding and will announce an amount for fy2005 following enactment of new appropriations the corporation has made two announcements regarding the selection of threshold countries on september 30 the corporation named seven participants albania east timor kenya sao tome and principe tanzania uganda and yemen five weeks later on november 8 the mcc added six more nations for fy2005 burkina faso guyana malawi paraguay the philippines and zambia according to the threshold program policy guidance issued by the corporation the program will assist countries make policy reforms and institutional changes in areas where they failed to meet the mca performance criteria if the corporation in consultation with usaid determines that the concept paper shows sufficient commitment to reform and promise of success the country will prepare threshold country plan that specifically establishes program schedule the means to measure progress and financing requirements among other considerations usaid is charged with overseeing the implementation of threshold country plans including working with countries to identify appropriate implementing partners such as local us and international firms ngos us government agencies and international organizations like regular mca compacts funding is not guaranteed for each country selected for the threshold program but will be based on the quality of the country plan role of usaid and the future of agency programs in mca countries as noted above how usaid would participate in the mca initiative has been continuing concern of congress and various policy analysts legislation authorizing the mcc requires the corporations ceo to coordinate with usaid and directs the agency to ensure that its programs play primary role in helping candidate countries prepare for mca consideration corporation and usaid officials have said there will be close collaboration between the two entities although the precise nature of the relationship has yet to be made public usaid maintains missions in 14 of the 17 eligible countries might be expected to support mcc programs through contracting procurement and monitoring tasks another question is how usaid will adjust its own programs in mca countries especially where the agency maintains relatively small activities in relation to other donors since the goal is to provide resources that will make mca programs among the largest aid operations in country it is likely that usaid spending will fall well below amounts provided through mcc compacts for example in mongolia where us aid programs have totaled 1012 million annually in recent years the united states was the fourth largest bilateral donor in 2002 representing less than quarter of the size of japans economic aid disbursements in ghana senegal and sri lanka usaid maintains larger programs but spends far less than other countries and multilateral agencies crs46 like other issues involving usaid this question remains under review usaid administrator natsios told the house appropriations committee on may 9 2004 that the agency would not withdraw from or cut programs in mca countries but would not increase spending either he said however that usaid would work to ensure that its programs operate in an integrated way with mcafunded activities funding issues and the fy2005 mcc request as mentioned above congress appropriated 994 million for fy2004 mcc programs and considered 25 billion request for fy2005 this was by far the largest increase sought by the administration in the foreign operations appropriations proposal and viewed by many observers as one of the most vulnerable items in an increasingly difficult budget environment growing concern raised by some members of congress was whether sufficient funds would be available to support mcc programs in every country selected especially if the board continues to make exceptions and qualifies more countries than meet the strict criteria representative kolbe chairman of the house foreign operations subcommittee speculated at may 9 hearing that based on recent board decisions by 2006 as many as 40 countries might have qualified this he believed could not be fully supported with likely funding levels and might raise country expectations that could not be met thereby undermining program incentives mcc officials point out that qualification for the program does not mean that government will receive funding that decision will be based on the quality of the compact proposals and it is possible that the corporation will not finalize agreements with all eligible countries march 2004 gao report estimated that the mcc could adequately fund 813 compacts with an appropriation of 35 billion the combined fy2004 enacted and fy2005 amounts this suggests that even if congress fully funds the pending proposal the corporation will not be able to support programs in all 16 countries approved for fy2004 and those selected for fy2005 if congress reduces the 25 billion request the mcc may face increasing difficulties funding compacts of sufficient size that will have meaningful impact on countrys economic growth and poverty reduction goals this may lead to further congressional examination of the boards selection process and consideration of ways to limit the number of countries selected in the future congressional action foreign operations bills passed in both the house and senate hr 4818 made substantial reductions to the presidents mcc request for fy2005 the bill as approved by the house reduced by half the presidents 25 billion proposal in cutting the mcc proposal the house appropriations committee noted that its decision resulted solely from the constrained budget environment in fy2005 and the need to address other administration and congressional priorities the executive branch in its statement of administration policy on hr 4818 issued prior to house debate expressed its disappointment over the level of mcc funding and urged congress to increase resources during floor consideration on july 15 the house defeated 41379 an amendment by representative paul to eliminate all mcc appropriations the house committee in its report on hr 4818 also expressed concern over corporation plans to enter into multiyear compacts without committing total crs47 funding for these programs in the year the compact is signed this the committee believed would obligate future congresses to fund prior year contracts consequently the bill requires the mcc to only sign compacts for which complete funding is available from existing appropriations the house committee also recommended that compacts be limited to 34 year period rather than 35 year duration envisioned by the mcc the senate measure proposed more significant cut to the presidents mcc request to 112 billion despite the reduction the senate appropriations committee noted its strong support for the program and reemphasized some aspects of the mcc set out in authorizing legislation the senate panel requested report on how the mcc will monitor and evaluate program compacts recommended that the corporation use funds to identify source of data to measure country performance with respect to people with disabilities and urged the mcc to use the expertise of higher education institutions and to eliminate from compact proposals elements that would have an adverse environmental impact the senate committee further noted that rural electrification should be regarded as significant part of countrys rural development goal following strong pressure from the white house to increase mcc funding above house and senatepassed levels conferees settled on 15 billion for the mcc in fy2005 like the house bill the conference agreement requires that the mcc fully fund multiyear compacts selected in fy2004 and fy2005 the measure further amends mca authorizing legislation adding more specific definition of the performance criteria related to investing in people in the future this category will extend to government policies promoting health education and other factors contributing to the wellbeing and productivity of its citizens including access to affordable housing the combination of reduced appropriation and the requirement for funding fy2004 and fy2005 compacts with existing appropriations may significantly limit the number andor size of program proposals the corporation can

priorities and hivaids continuing source of disagreement between the executive branch and congress is how to allocate the roughly 3 billion core budget for usaid development assistance and global health programs among the top congressional development aid funding priorities in recent years have been programs supporting child survival basic education and efforts to combat hivaids and other infectious diseases the administration has also backed these programs but officials object to congressional efforts to increase funding for children and health activities when it comes at the expense of other development sectors more recently during the fy2003 and fy2004 budget cycles some members of congress argued that it has been the executive branch that has added funds for administration priorities by cutting resources for other development activities in years when congress has increased appropriations for its priorities but not included corresponding boost in the overall development aid budget resources for other aid sectors such as economic growth and the environment have been substantially reduced this was more problematic during the midtolate 1990s when worldwide development aid funding fell significantly in more recent years and especially for fy2003 and fy2004 congress increased overall development assistance so that both congressional and executive program priorities could be funded without significant reductions for nonearmarked activities nevertheless administration officials continue to argue that such practices undermine their flexibility to adjust resource allocations to changing global circumstances in 2001 the bush administration set out revised usaid core goals for sustainable development programs focused around three spheres of emphasis or strategic pillars that include global health economic growth and agriculture and conflict prevention and developmental relief the administration further introduced new initiative the global development alliance gda in an effort to expand publicprivate partnerships in development program implementation under the initiative usaid identifies good development opportunities being conducted by private foundations nongovernmental organizations universities and forprofit organizations and provides parallel financing to leverage resources already committed to these activities usaid officials envisioned that the agency would become much more of coordinating and integrating institution to expand and enhance development efforts of these nongovernmental development partners although it started out as much more ambitious project usaid requested 160 million for fy2002 the gda has received relatively modest funding allocations with high of 20 million in fy2002 declining to 15 million in fy2004 usaid seeks 10 million for fy2005 underscoring the importance of the debate over funding allocations of development aid resources has been an elevation by the administration of the value of foreign economic assistance as an instrument of us foreign policy since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 congress has approved two presidential foreign aid initiatives the millennium challenge account mca and the presidents emergency program for aids relief pepfar that are increasing crs50 funding significantly for development assistance programs moreover the presidents september 2002 national security strategy established global development for the first time as the third pillar of us national security along with defense and diplomacy for fy2005 the president proposed another substantial increase in overall development assistance although the programs were configured differently than they have been in the past and the additional resources were heavily concentrated in few activities where about 30 countries would receive the greatest benefits although development activists including numerous nongovernmental organizations ngos strongly support these rising foreign aid budgets they have also raised questions about the degree of resource concentration and whether the administration is committed to broadbased worldwide development strategy while country participants in the two new foreign aid initiatives pepfar which concentrates resources in 15 focus countries and the mca for which 17 have been selected in fy2004 and fy2005 are likely to see development aid from the united states grow significantly the outlook for the other 3040 recipients of american economic assistance is projection of flat or slightly lower levels of aid the administration further has said that mca funding would be in addition to not substitute for continuing core development activities critics have charged that the fy2004 and fy2005 budget requests violated that pledge by cutting amounts for core programs

appropriations bills crs51 development activists and policy analysts have further expressed concern regarding the recent diffusion of development aid policy implementation among multiple agencies to some this raises questions over the ability to coordinate foreign aid activities present coherent policy approach and design an overall development assistance strategy see for example testimony on evolving us foreign aid policy before the house international relations committee on february 26 2004 number of analysts note that large segments of policy making and implementation responsibilities have shifted from usaid the principal american aid agency for over 40 years to new state department office that will coordinate pepfar and to the millennium challenge corporation that was established in february 2004 and manages mca resources fy2005 development assistance request for core development assistance programs that match the current structure of usaids strategic pillars and foreign operations appropriation accounts for development assistance and child survival and health program fund the administration proposed 275 billion as shown in table 9 this represented 455 million or 14 reduction from amounts for fy2004 this comparison on its own however is somewhat misleading it does not reflect the large amount of funds 145 billion requested for the state departments global aids initiative office large portion of which in previous years would have been counted within usaid core development aid budget it also does not include the 25 billion request for the millennium challenge corporation adding these amounts to the traditional usaid core accounts the total development aid request for fy2005 was 67 billion or 43 higher than fy2004 perhaps more informative analysis of the fy2005 proposal is to look below the total figures and compare funding levels recommended for individual components of development assistance this comparison as illustrated in table 2 presents mixed picture of the fy2005 budget proposal under the category of economic growth agriculture and trade funding for agriculture and environment would decline in fy2005 basic education programs have been an especially high priority for congress during the past decade the administrations proposal would cut basic education slightly from current the development assistance budget and overall taking into consideration other economic aid accounts proposed 314 million or 10 million less than enacted for fy2004 the category for democracy conflict and humanitarian programs was also reduced slightly for fy2005 under the third category of global health which corresponds to the foreign operations appropriation account of child survival and health the fy2005 request was mixed although hivaids funding was reduced by over 300 million this cut was more than compensated by 145 billion proposal for the state departments global aids initiative the administration however proposed sizable reduction in the us contribution to the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria 400 million in fy2004 to 100 million in fy2005 for funds drawn from foreign operations for all other programs under the global health category the fy2005 represented reduction sizable cuts were proposed for vulnerable children activities and for other infectious diseases including malaria and tuberculosis family crs52 planning and reproductive health were also reduced representing the first time the bush administration had proposed funding level less than its budget request the previous year across all foreign operations accounts including child survival economic support fund east europe and former soviet states the fy2005 request was 3992 million down about 30 million from estimates for fy2004 in his three previous budget submissions president bush had requested 425 million for family planning activities international hivaids by far the largest growth area for development assistance was for hivaids prevention treatment and care programs table 3 resources requested under the foreign operations bill for hivaids in fy2005 including funds for malaria and tuberculosis totaled 22 billion 37 increase over 16 billion appropriated for fy2004 moreover the administration sought another 623 million for international hivaids from nonforeign operations accounts most importantly for the centers for disease control and prevention funded under the laborhhseducation appropriation bill the total request across all appropriation measures for fy2005 was 282 billion contentious issue that has arisen during congressional debates in the past two years has been the presidents proposal for an annual 200 million contribution to the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria 100 million each from foreign operations and laborhhseducation for fy2003 congress increased the us contribution to 350 million and subsequently authorized up to 1 billion for fy2004 in pl 10825 the united states leadership against hivaids tuberculosis and malaria act of 2003 the fy2004 appropriation for the global fund was 550 million while the president proposed 200 million in fy2005 crs53 table 10 core

particularly among health and education programs reduced flexibility in providing sufficient resources for other development activities especially in the area of economic growth the house panel said it regards economic growth as usaids most important longterm goal and that while the committee continues to recommend higher spending for health programs in the nearterm it encourages usaid to increase funds for economic growth activities international family planning and unfpa funding us population assistance and family planning programs overseas have sparked continuous controversy during foreign operations debates for nearly two decades for fy2005 the administration requested 3992 million for bilateral international reproductive health and family planning programs an 8 decrease from the 432 million fy2004 appropriation the request also proposed 25 million placed in reserve as part of the foreign operations spending bills international organizations and programs account that could be made available to the crs59 population fund unfpa unfpa could receive the funds however only if the president determines that the organization meets certain conditions although funding considerations have at times been heatedly debated by congress the most contentious family planning issues addressed in nearly every annual congressional consideration of foreign operations bills have focused on two matters whether the united states should contribute to the population fund unfpa if the organization maintains program in china where allegations of coercive family planning have been widespread for many years and whether abortionrelated restrictions should be applied to bilateral usaid population aid grants commonly known as the mexico city policy unfpa funding the most contentious issue usually concerns the abortion restriction question but most recent attention has focused on unfpa and white house decision in july 2002 to block the 34 million us contribution to the organization during the reagan and george hw bush administrations the united states did not contribute to unfpa because of concerns over practices of forced abortion and involuntary sterilization in china where unfpa maintains programs in 1985 congress passed the socalled kempkasten amendment which has been made part of every foreign operations appropriation since barring us funds to any organization that supports or participates in the management of program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization in 1993 president clinton determined that unfpa despite its presence in china was not involved in the management of coercive program from 1993 through the end of the decade in most years congress appropriated about 25 million for unfpa but added directive that required that the amount be reduced by however much unfpa spent in china consequently the us contribution has fluctuated between 215 million and 25 million for fy2002 president george w bush requested 25 million for unfpa congress provided in the fy2002 foreign operations bill not more than 34 million for unfpa while members of the appropriations committees said it was their intent to provide the full 34 million the language allowed the president to allocate however much he chose up to 34 million ceiling the white house placed hold on unfpa funds in january 2002 because new evidence suggested that coercive practices were continuing in chinese counties where unfpa concentrates its programs september 2001 investigation team sponsored by the population research institute concluded that consistent pattern of coercion continued in model unfpa counties including forced abortions and involuntary sterilizations refuting these findings unfpacommissioned review team found in october 2001 absolutely evidence that the population fund supports coercive family planning practices in china or violates the human rights of chinese people in any way see house international relations committee hearing coercive population control in china new evidence of forced abortion and forced sterilization october 17 2001 see also testimony of josephine guy and nicholaas biegman before the senate foreign relations committee february 27 2002 although most observers agree that coercive family planning practices continue in china differences remain over the extent to which if any unfpa supports involuntary activities and whether unfpa should operate at all in country where crs60 such conditions exist given the conflicting reports the state department sent its own investigative team to china for twoweek review of unfpa programs on may 13 2002 the team which was led by former ambassador william brown and included bonnie glick former state department official and dr theodore tong public health professor at the university of arizona made three findings and recommendations in its report dated may 31 2002 findings there is evidence that unfpa knowingly supported or participated in the management of program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization in china china maintains coercive elements in its population programs and chinese leaders view population control as high priority and remain concerned over implications of loosening controls for socioeconomic change recommendations the united states should release not more than 34 million of previously appropriated funds to unfpa until china ends all forms of coercion in law and practice us government funds should be allocated to population programs in china and appropriate resources possibly from the united states should be allocated to monitor and evaluate chinese population control programs despite the teams recommendation to release the 34 million secretary of state powell decided on july 22 2002 to withhold funds to unfpa and to recommend that they be redirected to other international family planning and reproductive health activities the state departments analysis of the secretarys determination found that even though unfpa did not knowingly support or participate in coercive practice that alone would not preclude the application of kempkasten instead finding that the recipient of us funds in this case unfpa simply supports or participates in such program whether knowingly or unknowingly would trigger the restriction the team found that the chinese government imposes fines and penalties on families that have children exceeding the number approved by the government practice that in some cases coerces women to have abortions they would not otherwise undergo the state department analysis concluded that unfpas involvement in chinas family planning program allows the chinese government to implement more effectively its program of coercive abortion the full text of the state departments analysis is online at the state departments website httpwwwstategovgprmrlsother12128htm the state departments assessment team report is also online httpwwwstategovgprmrlsrpt 200212122htm critics of the administrations decision opposed it not only because of the negative impact it may have on access to voluntary family planning programs by persons in around 140 countries where unfpa operates but also because of the crs61 possible application of the determination for other international organizations that operate in china and to which the us contributes for fy2003 the president proposed funding for unfpa although 25 million was requested in reserve for the account from which unfpa receives its funding presumably this could have been made available to unfpa if it was found not to be in violation of kempkasten following several legislative attempts to reverse the administrations denial of unfpa in both fy2002 supplemental appropriations and regular fy2003 foreign operations measures congress approved in pl 1087 the consolidated appropriations act for fy2003 provision allocating 34 million to unfpa the same as in fy2002 so long as several conditions were met the most significant requirement was that the president must certify that unfpa is longer involved in the management of coercive family planning program following the july 2002 determination the administration transferred to usaid 34 million from fy2002 appropriations and 25 million from fy2003 that would have otherwise been provided to unfpa in order to fund usaid bilateral family planning programs for which unfpa has involvement the state departments justification of its september 25 2003 letter to congress regarding the fy2003 resources noted that the factual circumstances do not support making determination that unfpa longer supports or participates in the management of program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization section 572 of the fy2003 foreign operations appropriations required the president to issue such statement before restoring us funding to unfpa these transferred funds however remained unspent due to holds placed on them by members of congress the intent in placing the holds by some members was to keep the money available for unfpa in the event that circumstances changed and the administration would make unfpa eligible once again in the fy2004 foreign operations enacted bill division d of pl 108199 congress earmarked 34 million for unfpa subject however to the kempkasten conditions the conference agreement further directed how the previously withheld money would be disbursed thereby resolving longstanding dispute over whether to commit these resources to other development programs or place them in reserve account in case unfpa again became eligible for us support the fy2004 appropriation specified that the 34 million withheld in fy2002 shall be used for family planning programs in twelve countries including congo ethiopia uganda haiti and russia the 25 million in fy2003 funds that was earmarked for but not transferred to unfpa would be made available for vulnerable children and for new initiative within the child survival and health account assisting young women mothers and children who are victims of trafficking in persons on july 16 2004 the state department announced that it had again found unfpa to be in violation of the kempkasten amendment and would not provide the 34 million designated in the fy2004 appropriation measure in statement the department said that the united states has been urging unfpa and china to modify the organizations program in manner that would permit us support to resume the state department found that key changes had occurred in unfpas programs crs62 that would permit resumption of us funding under the conditions of the kemp kasten provision mexico city policy the debate over international family planning policy and abortion began nearly three decades ago in 1973 when congress added provision to the foreign assistance act of 1961 prohibiting the use of us appropriated funds for abortionrelated activities and coercive family planning programs during the mid1980s in what has become known as the mexico city policy because it was first announced at the 1984 mexico city population conference the reagan administration and later the george h w bush administration restricted funds for foreign nongovernmental organizations ngos that were involved in performing or promoting abortions in countries where they worked even if such activities were undertaken with nonus funds several groups including international planned parenthood federationlondon ippflondon became ineligible for us financial support in some subsequent years congress narrowly approved measures to overturn this prohibition but white house vetoes kept the policy in place president clinton in 1993 reversed the position of his two predecessors allowing the united states to resume funding for all family planning organizations so long as us money was used by those involved in abortion related work between 1996 and 2000 the house and senate took opposing positions on the mexico city issue actions that repeatedly held up enactment of the final foreign operations spending measures the house position articulated by representative chris smith nj and others supported reinstatement of the mexico city policy restricting us aid funds to foreign organizations involved in performing abortions or in lobbying to change abortion laws or policies in foreign countries the senate on the other hand rejected in most cases house provisions dealing with mexico city policy favoring position that left these decisions in the hands of the administration unable to reach an agreement satisfactory to both sides congress adopted interim arrangements during this period that did not resolve the broad population program controversy but permitted the stalled foreign operations measure to move forward the annual compromise removed houseadded mexico city restrictions but reduced population assistance to 385 million and in several years metered the availability of the funds at rate of onetwelfth of the 385 million per month in fy2000 when the issue became linked with the separate foreign policy matter of paying us arrears owed to the united nations reluctant president clinton agreed to modified version of abortion restrictions marking the first time that mexico city conditions had been included in legislation signed by the president enacted in the foreign operations act for fy2000 hr 3422 incorporated into hr 3194 the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 pl 106113 because the president could waive the restrictions for 15 million in grants to organizations that refused to certify there was major impact on usaid family planning programs in fy2000 other than the reduction of 125 million in population assistance that the legislation required if the white house exercised the waiver authority crs63 when congress again came to an impasse in fy2001 lawmakers agreed to allow the new president to set policy under the fy2001 foreign operations measure none of the 425 million appropriation could be obligated until after february 15 2001 subsequently on january 22 2001 two days after taking office president bush issued memorandum to the usaid administrator rescinding the 1993 memorandum from president clinton and directing the administrator to reinstate in full all of the requirements of the mexico city policy in effect on january 19 1993 the president further said that it was his conviction that taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortions or to advocate or actively promote abortion either here or abroad separate statement from the presidents press secretary stated that president bush was committed to maintaining the 425 million funding level for population assistance because he knows that one of the best ways to prevent abortion is by providing quality voluntary family planning services the press secretary further emphasized that it was the intent that any restrictions do not limit organizations from treating injuries or illnesses caused by legal or illegal abortions for example post abortion care on february 15 2001 the day on which fy2001 population aid funds became available for obligation usaid issued specific policy language and contract clauses to implement the presidents directive the guidelines are nearly identical to those used in the 1980s and early 1990s when the mexico city policy applied critics of the certification requirement oppose it on several grounds they believe that family planning organizations may cut back on services because they are unsure of the full implications of the restrictions and do not want to risk losing eligibility for usaid funding this they contend will lead to higher numbers of unwanted pregnancies and possibly more abortions opponents also believe the new conditions undermine relations between the us government and foreign ngos and multilateral groups creating situation in which the united states challenges their decisions on how to spend their own money they further argue that us policy imposes socalled gag order on the ability of foreign ngos and multilateral groups to promote changes to abortion laws and regulations in developing nations this would be unconstitutional if applied to american groups working in the united states critics note supporters of the certification requirement argue that even though permanent law bans usaid funds from being used to perform or promote abortions money is fungible organizations receiving americantaxpayer funding can simply use usaid resources for permitted activities while diverting money raised from other sources to perform abortions or lobby to change abortion laws and regulations the certification process they contend closes the fungibility loophole since reinstatement of the mexico city policy in early 2001 several bills have been introduced to reverse the policy but except for language included in the senate fy2004 foreign operations appropriations bill s 1426 none has passed either the house or senate and measure has been enacted into law congressional action the conference agreement on hr 4818 provides 441 million for bilateral family planningreproductive health programs between crs64 levels passed earlier by the house 432 million and the senate 450 million the approved amount for fy2005 is 42 million or about 10 higher than the administrations request conferees further earmarked 34 million for unfpa 25 million drawn from the international organizations and programs iop account and 9 million drawn from the child survivalhealth account the entire 34 million is subject to kempkasten restrictions if the president determines that unfpa is ineligible for us funding under kempkasten the conference agreement directs the administration to transfer the 25 million iop account funds to the child survivalhealth account for usaidmanaged family planning maternal and reproductive health programs conferees further specified that fy2004 funds previously earmarked for unfpa be spent on antitrafficking programs 125 million and family planning and maternal and reproductive health activities 125 million after declaring unfpa ineligible for fy2004 funds the administration had signaled that it would reprogram the entire 25 million for antitrafficking programs previously house and senatepassed foreign operations bills had provided 25 million and 34 million respectively for unfpa the senate measure also directed that the 25 million withheld from unfpa for fy2004 shall be available for usaid bilateral family planningreproductive health activities in 15 specific nations in addition floor amendment sponsored by senators leahy and bingaman specified that if unfpa is not eligible for us funds in fy2005 the 34 million earmark may not be available for any other purpose unless specified in subsequent legislation an earlier attempt in the house sponsored by representative lowey to make the unfpa contribution available only for programs in iraq afghanistan tanzania jordan kenya and pakistan countries which restrict or prohibit abortion was defeated by the house appropriations committee 2632 conferees also rejected two senate provisions that were strongly opposed by the administration and which in previous years prompted veto threats by the president the first provision passed by the senate but dropped in conference amended the kempkasten language in way that would narrow somewhat the grounds on which the administration could find unfpa in violation of the restrictions the senate text stated that an organization must directly support coercive abortions or involuntary sterilizations in order to be denied us support adding the word directly to the condition the amendment further included new text stating that organization can be denied funds solely because the government of country engaged in coercive practices this presumably was an indirect reference to china intending to establish policy that unfpa could be declared ineligible for us funding exclusively because of coercive practices by chinese family planning officials the second senate amendment would have revised the presidents mexico city policy that prohibits foreign nongovernmental organizations ngos from receiving us funds if they perform or promote abortion as method of family planning whether or not such activities are supported with usprovided resources the senatepassed language stipulated that foreign ngos could not be declared ineligible for us aid for conducting any health or medical services with nonus government funds so long as the practices did not violate laws in the country in crs65 which the services were provided or would not violate us law the provision further provided that foreign ngos would not be subject to conditions associated with the use of nonus government funds for advocacy and lobbying activities that were more restrictive than those applied to american ngos it is generally assumed that the mexico city policy ban on advocacy and lobbying would be found to be constitutional violation of the right of free speech if it were to be applied to us ngo afghanistan reconstruction7 the conditions in afghanistan for reconstruction represent challenging mix of ongoing security concerns infrastructure destruction and humanitarian needs that require robust and sustained intervention while the hunt for qaeda forces within afghanistan continues transitional and reconstruction assistance are well underway so far the international community has continued to provide large amounts of aid and resources for the reconstruction effort longterm commitment will likely be necessary to ensure that stable democratic afghanistan emerges the outcomes of international donors conferences since january 2002 indicate continued strong willingness on the part of the international community to assist in the restoration of afghanistan however reconstruction costs are estimated by some to be more than 1530 billion over the next decade the 911 commission report praises the us efforts in afghanistan thus far but emphasizes the need for sustained longterm commitment by the united states and the international community to afghanistans stability and security recognizing that afghanistan remains vulnerable to illicit drug production and terrorism the commission is farreaching in its recommendations which include call for greater security and participation by international forces more effective robust counternarcotics activities and increased flexibility in allocating money for relief and reconstruction current operating environment key developments since september 11 2001 and the collapse of the taliban focus on three main pillars first the development of plans for security including military operations by us and other coalition forces in afghanistan the presence of an international security assistance force isaf the establishment and training of an afghan national army and police force the demobilization of private militias and the formation of provincial reconstruction teams second establishing the political framework through the bonn conference and afghanistan interim administration aia the loya jirga and islamic transitional government of afghanistan itga the constitutional loya jirga and approval of new constitution presidential and parliamentary elections and renewed diplomatic ties with the international community third the creation of strategy for reconstruction beginning with the tokyo reconstruction conference in january 2002 the current operating environment continues to highlight the importance of these three themes and the work that remains to be done to assure afghanistans recovery 7 this section was prepared by rhoda margesson crs66 the most serious challenges facing afghanistan today are the lack of security and growing trafficking in narcotics an ongoing insurgency involving remnants of the taliban particularly in the southeast has created insecurity and slowed reconstruction there moreover former commanders maintain control over their own areas throughout the country and continue fighting with their rivals making

2004 elections with 2500 additional troops sent from spain and italy the supplementary italian troops are currently attached to the nato response force nrf but the nrf as an entity will not deploy nato assumed command of isaf in august 2003 the core of isaf is the kabul multinational brigade which is now led by eurocorps rapid response force within nato composed of forces from france germany spain belgium and luxembourg because of ongoing threats to afghanistans internal security there were calls for isaf expansion and deployment to other cities in october 2003 the security council formally backed an expansion of isaf outside of kabul by adopting resolution 1510 us forces with other nations are continuing to train new afghan national army ana that it is hoped will ultimately allow the kabul government to maintain security on its own and enable foreign forces to depart afghanistan the targeted size of the army is 70000 but it is expected to take number of years to achieve full strength the ana had 15000 troops deployed in time for the presidential elections on october 9 2004 the ana has established presence in 16 of afghanistans 34 provinces with the continued fighting and insecurity the japan and unled process of demobilization and integration of up to 100000 private militiamen has also been slow estimates of the number of fighters to be disarmed under the program

with heavier military presence of more than 250 military personnel nato expressed an intent to take over another 5 prts in the north and northeast of the country and made specific commitments at the june 2004 istanbul summit germany has set up an isaf prt in faizabad to operate as satellite to the prt in konduz the ukled prt in mazar which originally operated under the coalitionoef is now part of

in baghlan and led by the netherlands in total there are three new isafnato prts over the existing konduz and mazar prts and several new satellites with approximately 500 additional personnel although nato nations appear committed to the afghanistan mission personnel and equipment shortages plague the organizations ability to build up its presence in afghanistan the new pledges for isaf operations to address staffing and equipment shortages originally announced in december 2003 have not yet been met although the first military transport plan for isaf contributed by portugal arrived in late july 2004 the united states is focused on prts in the south and east us plans call for up to 34 coalition or isaf prts one in each province with the possibility of satellite prts within some provinces regional development zones rdzs grouping several prts are also under discussion the prt concept has received mixed reviews from the aid community some organizations see positive impact on security and as result an increase in reconstruction activity in the prt area of operation others accept the prt concept as practical reality of providing assistance in afghanistan albeit with some concerns about the civilmilitary relationship and still others do not want to associate with any military force because doing so might compromise their neutrality and impartiality and increase the possibility of targeted attack factional fighting and increased criminal activity have undermined relief and reconstruction operations in some cases where operations were directly targeted this has led to the temporary suspension of activities or withdrawal of aid agencies from certain areas the afghan nongovernmental organization security office anso keeps database to record national security incidents and to provide more effective timely information and situation assessments to the aid community the strength and influence of the central government is viewed as key factor that will determine the success of the intervention and assistance on the part of the international community the road map of the political transition was laid out in united nationssponsored conference of major afghan factions held in bonn germany in late november 2001 the transitional government appears stable but there are major tensions within factions of the national government and between the central government and provincial leaders the constitutional loya jirga adopted new constitution in january 2004 karzai sought to hold timely national elections crs68 to validate his leadership and counter charges that he sought to monopolize power northern alliance leaders sought simultaneous parliamentary elections so that parliament could serve as check on presidential authority in keeping with the bonn agreement national elections were scheduled for june 2004 after several postponements the presidential election took place on october 9 2004 and the parliamentary elections are expected to take place in april 2005 joint afghanunited nations committee with the assistance mission in afghanistan unama registered voters through the joint election management body jemb an afghanun committee established in july 2003 as of the close of the registration process in september 2004 unama reported that 105 million voters had registered number equal to the original assessment of the number of eligible voters about 42 of those registered were women early on the pace of registration was greatly affected by insecurity particularly in the southeast the registration rates then took sharp jump increasing concerns that some afghans may have registered more than once on may 25 2004 president karzai endorsed the major election law to govern the elections eighteen candidates were certified by the jemb to run in the presidential elections apparently afghan refugees in pakistan and iran were registered and included in the national elections fears of electionrelated violence and voter intimidation by factional commanders made election security key concern of the united states and international community election security missions involved the coalition isaf the ana and afghan national police force on october 9 2004 the vote was conducted under tight security and observed by about 400 international monitors from the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce and other groups such as the international republican institute iri there were only minor scattered insurgent attacks during the voting far less violence than was expected and turnout was reported to be heavy and the voting orderly fears of widespread intimidation of voters by factional militiamen were not realized although there were some reports of such activity on election day the major threat to the election was an announcement on election day by 15 challenging candidates that they would boycott the results due to widespread fraud primarily an alleged failure of indelible ink to prevent multiple voting after day of discussions and refutations by some of the international observers most of the challengers including the most prominent challenger yunus qanooni agreed to drop their objections and allow an independent commission to investigate the alleged irregularities on november 3 karzai was declared the winner with 554 of the vote thereby avoiding runoff in parts of the country humanitarian and reconstruction assistance still operate on parallel tracks highlights of the progress on reconstruction achieved in afghanistan so far include the return of 3 million refugees the enrollment of 29 million children in school the participation of some women in the workforce and politics and the completion of phase i of the kabulkandahar highway just to name few the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr continues to assist refugees and the internally displaced although some have raised concerns that the infrastructure may not yet be able to support this many returnees crs69 apart from security problems the current operating environment presents number of other urgent challenges the collapsed infrastructure rugged terrain and extreme weather are significant factors with regard to access food aid health care and basic logistics reconstruction efforts must be understood in the context of the differences among the regions and the political and security situation throughout the country the international recovery and reconstruction effort is immense and complicated involving the afghan government numerous agencies bilateral donors many international organizations and countless nongovernmental organizations ngos intended outcomes of the reconstruction process identified by the international community and the afghan government include political stability and security access to basic services and adequate standard of living for the afghan people economic growth and in the long term independence from foreign aid so far the international community has continued to provide significant amounts of aid and resources for the reconstruction effort among contributions by other countries italy is providing advice on judicial reform and the united states japan and saudi arabia have together been financing the rebuilding of the kabul qandaharherat major roadway discussions continue about how to assess the progress pace and effectiveness of reconstruction efforts and whether sufficient aid is available some experts are concerned about absorption capacity and whether additional funds can be allocated quickly and effectively others argue that the lack of human capacity combined with insufficient security rather than the amount of funding are the main obstacles us assistance for afghan reconstruction since september 11 the united states has provided nearly 33 billion for reconstruction efforts in afghanistan making kabul one of the largest recipients of american foreign aid at the international

the eventual cost of this iraq reconstruction are provided in an october 2003 world bank and development group needs assessment of 14 sectors of the iraqi government and economy prepared for the benefit of the international donors conference held in madrid on october 2324 2003 it established the targets by which the adequacy of available resources will be judged the world bankun assessments put the cost of reconstruction for the 14 sectors at 36 billion over four years figure that does not include 194 billion estimated by the coalition provisional authority cpa for security oil and other sectors not covered by the bankun assessments total world bankcpa projected reconstruction costs through 2007 amount to 55 billion9 several potential spigots are available to fund iraq reconstruction

derived from oil export profits have been employed largely to cover the normal operating costs of the iraqi government but where sufficient amounts are available have been used to address

education and rule of law the legislation gave the president control over the fund and amounts could be transferred only to the department of state the agency for international development usaid the department of the treasury the department of defense and the department of health and human services subject to the usual notification procedures the fy2004 emergency supplemental pl 108106 signed on november 6 2003 added 184 billion to the irrf and allowed funds to go directly to the cpa in addition to the above named agencies while earlier funds had been used to support broad range of humanitarian and reconstruction efforts the fy2004 appropriation was largely intended to have an immediate impact on the two greatest reconstruction concerns raised since the occupation of iraq began security and infrastructure the reconstruction funds were provided entirely as grants after the administration threatened to veto any measure that provided aid in the form of loans the legislation established an inspector general office to monitor the use of funds by the cpa and included extensive reporting requirements regarding expenditures projects and other sources of revenue the bill also provided 983 million for operating expenses of the cpa exceptions to the rule of full and open competition for contracts have to be justified and notified to congress on september 14 2004 the administration asked congress to approve significant reallocation of 346 billion of the 184 billion see reconstruction priorities below because the desired changes were greater than the supplementals

persuasion by ambassador negroponte with leverage provided by the security support of the us military and billions of dollars in reconstruction aid us efforts to remake iraq have been facilitated in

become consultants reportedly about 150 americans remain attached to iraqi ministries13 reconstruction priorities reconstruction priorities have changed over time the cpas reconstruction priorities were reflected in the fy2004 supplemental appropriation approved by congress in october 2003 by the time of the transition about 22 of total funds were targeted on improving the security capabilities of the iraqi government including training and equipment for police army and customs personnel about 67 of funds were aimed at improvements in infrastructure including electricity oil production water and sewerage transportation and telecommunications in order to stabilize the country by creating jobs and stimulating the economy technical assistance and smallscale grants in such areas as democratization civil society microenterprise education economic policy and health account for the remainder of the appropriated fy2004 funds about 10 the november 2003 agreement to accelerate the handover of sovereignty to iraqis led the administration to revise plans in january 2004 for the use of appropriations with the exception of the oil sector where emergency supply efforts were cut by nearly 200 million the broad categories of assistance were largely unaffected however number of funding changes were made within sectors the most significant change was an increase in the democratization effort from 100 million to 458 million reflecting the more intensive plan to prepare iraqis to take over increases were made as well in funding for border enforcement from 150 to 11

children has nearly doubled since the coalition invasion in 200315 particular congressional concern has been the rate of implementation16 one administration argument for the 184 billion appropriated in november 2003 was the need to demonstrate progress so as to employ iraqis and win their hearts and minds however as of end of march 2004 only about 22 billion of that 184 billion had been obligated let alone expended as of november 17 89 billion 48 had been obligated and 18 billion 10 expended17 among reasons for the slow progress were pressures to employ open and competitive bidding for most of the new reconstruction contracts last years interagency disputes over control of the funds and variety of federal regulations security concerns however have been chiefly responsible for delaying reconstruction further18 to speed up the reconstruction process in april cpa ambassador bremer initiated the accelerated iraqi reconstruction program airp which utilizes iraqi dfi funds 383 million to get work underway in ten cities the airp effort is coordinated with the use of cerp funds see below19 the recent reallocation of reconstruction funds is in part intended to speed up implementation

political policy reforms promoted by the cpa stirred controversy in iraq especially as they were viewed as imposed by an occupying administration for example in move to establish an open and free market economy and obtain revenue to meet development needs ambassador bremer approved new laws in september 2003 abolishing all curbs on foreign direct investment except in natural resources according to the financial times the reforms were near universally unpopular iraqi businessmen and unions fearing they would be unable to compete22 such laws and regulations could face resistance and reversal under the new sovereign government although the interim constitution requires approval of majority of the governments ministers president and vice presidents to overturn existing laws according to the press cpa administrator bremer issued 97 legal orders in the last two weeks of the occupation23 on the other hand as result of the continuing instability and the accelerated agreement to turn over sovereignty some controversial positions which were favored by ambassador bremer and his staff privatization of stateowned business elimination of crop subsidies and an end to the oil for food programs free food baskets were put off entirely iraqi government officials would reportedly have preferred that the cpa bear the burden of such potentially destabilizing decisions rather than leave them to new iraqi government24 new reconstruction concern is the effort to rapidly rehabilitate areas such as fallujah which have been the scene of intense military operations against insurgent forces us officials argue that the postbattle reconstruction effort is as important as the military effort to insure longterm iraqi government control of these cities nevertheless some observers have criticized the glacial pace of the rehabilitation effort in najaf in the case of fallujah according to state department officials humanitarian supplies were prepositioned and assessments were made of how to restore essential services electric power and water prior to the completion of the military operation these basic assistance efforts will be followed by small projects to repair clinics and

additional funds for the cerp roughly 685 million 546 million from iraqi resources had been made available for this purpose provided in the form of small grants over 34512 such projects totaling 578

activities related to social services civil society and policy reform continuing security concerns in the unpredictable iraqi environment pose problems for firms interested in reconstruction work firms security plans are factor in awarding contracts as noted earlier substantial proportion of contract costs are being diverted to providing security to employees one concern of contractors has been the legal status of workers in the postoccupation period especially with regard to efforts to protect themselves from attack prior to the turn over of sovereignty cpa administrator bremer signed an order providing legal immunity to contractors while they are in the course of performing work in support of iraq reconstruction efforts27 seeking to encourage economic growth and decrease unemployment the cpa made special efforts to insure that iraqi business had an opportunity to participate in contracts including putting contract solicitations on its website and appointing business liaison representatives the extent to which firms plan to utilize iraqi services has been factor in the awarding of new contracts although us government requirements could be waived for iraqi contractors most work for iraqi business has come in the form of subcontracts the pco claims that over 315 iraqi firms are currently working on usfunded reconstruction projects and that roughly 73000 iraqis are employed28 an administration decision applied to the fy2003 reconstruction contracts to waive the normal competitive bidding requirements and request bids from specific companies which were seen to have preexisting qualifications received considerable attention by the business community in 2003 us officials explained then that only few select firms possessed the particular skills that would qualify them for the job specifications for iraq reconstruction and that time and security clearances were also critical factors other us firms and foreign entities potentially excluded by buy america provisions of law they noted could participate as subcontractors to the selected american firms most fy2004funded contracts are being competitively solicited and the fy2004 supplemental contains provision requiring notification and justification to congress of any waiver of competitive rules on december 5 2003 deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz issued determination and findings report essentially limiting eligibility for prime contracts using fy2004 funds to us firms and those of 62 countries including iraq coalition partner and force contributing nations his rationale for barring other countries firms including germany and france was that it was necessary for the protection of the essential security interests of the united states countries excluded from prime contracts could still participate as subcontractors in what has been interpreted as an effort to gain greater 27 immunity provision extended for us firms with reconstruction contracts washington

contracting and later reports suggesting that us and iraqi funds are being squandered disturbed number of legislators the fy2004 supplemental established an inspector general for the cpa the cpa

kellogg brown and root kbr subsidiary of halliburton whose former chief executive is vicepresident cheney that was the focus of media attention raising concerns of favoritism and reinforcing

announced that remaining oil repair work would be competitively bid however kbr continued to carry out work orders on non competitive basis pending decision finally reached on january 16 2004 on two new contracts collectively worth up to 20 billion32 one of the new contracts worth up to 12 billion was awarded to kbr kbr has also been the focus of two dod audits one related to its work providing logistics support to the us military under its competitivelybid logcap contract and the other for the importation of fuel for use by iraqis under the rio project in the latter case kbr is suspected of

reconstruction there have been dozens of reports and articles during the past year that have sought to analyze criticize and recommend action regarding the progress of reconstruction aid two of the most recent ones are indicative of the others reconstructing iraq september 2004 report from the international crisis group examines the gamut of mistakes that many agree were made prior to and during the occupation these include the lack of reconstruction plan the failure to adequately fund reconstruction early on unrealistic application of us views to iraqi conditions by for example emphasizing privatization policy the organizational incompetence of the cpa shifting deadlines such as the november decision to end the occupation seven months later and the inadequate utilization of iraqis both in making policy and in implementing reconstruction projects the report draws on these failures to inform its recommendations for the future recommendations for the us government include the suggestion that staff with expertise in postconflict situations be utilized and encouraged to serve in iraq longer than six months that iraqis representing range of views participate in design and implementation of us reconstruction projects that development of the iraqi private sector be emphasized through greater use of iraqis as subcontractors and that prime contractors be required to employ iraqis as much as possible36 progress or peril measuring iraqs reconstruction from the center for strategic and international studies september 2004 and updated on november 12 uses polling and personal interviews to attempt to measure the status of reconstruction from the iraqi point of view it finds that security is the predominant issue in iraqi minds and that governance is largely negative picture it suggests that us efforts are too focused on national level politics and that efforts to support local political bodies are not backed by sufficient funding lack of economic opportunity fuels anger and security problems and the level of social services is also undermining public confidence an improvement in social wellbeing health and education the only bright spot that the original report highlights is less positively portrayed in the update the healthcare system is now viewed as deteriorating recommendations include accelerating training of security forces increasing more direct assistance to iraqis giving priority to iraqs employment crisis supporting the return of the to provide election assistance giving precedence to aid for iraqs 33 continued

reconstituted the coalition provisional authority inspectors general office that has been monitoring iraq reconstruction resources as separate unit within the state department the cpa ig expired with the transfer of authority in iraq on june 28 and the administration had planned on merging these oversight responsibilities into the state departments office of inspector general the house measure would have placed the iraq reconstruction ig in the department of state but as an entity reporting directly to the secretary of state transferred from omb to the secretary of state responsibility for preparing and submitting to congress the section 2207 quarterly reports on the status of iraq reconstruction activities expressed disappointment over the slow pace of world bank project disbursement in iraq and directed the treasury secretary to report by january 1 2005 on the status of such disbursements and the deployment of personnel to staff the banks offices in iraq the administration in its statement of administration policy on hr 4818 expressed several concerns regarding iraq reconstruction provisions in the bill the letter from omb said the administration opposes placement of the cpa ig responsibility under the direction of the secretary of state it noted that the departments of state and defense usaid and the cpa ig had reached an agreement that would assure effective oversight of the reconstruction funds and that the house language would not be consistent with that arrangement the administration further expressed concern that its proposal to permit greater flexibility in the use of the reconstruction funds to shift resources from one purpose to another in larger degrees than allowed in the fy2004 supplemental appropriation was not included in hr 4818 37 center for
