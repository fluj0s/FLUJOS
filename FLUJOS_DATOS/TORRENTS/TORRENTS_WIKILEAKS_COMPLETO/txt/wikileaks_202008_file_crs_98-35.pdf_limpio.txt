annually or upon legislative activity background social security monthly benefits are computed by applying formula to an average of persons earnings from work subject to the social security tax the formula applies three progressive factors 90 32 and 15 to three di fferent levels or brackets of average monthly covered earnings these earnings brackets change each year to reflect changes in national wage levels the resu lt is known as the primary insurance amount or pia and is rounded down to the nearest 10 cents the formula is designed so that workers with low average career earnings receive pia that is larger proportion of their earnings than do workers with high average earnings for persons who reach age 62 die or become disabled in 2008 the pia is determined thus factor average career monthly earnings 90 first 711 plus 32 711 through 4288 plus15 over 4288httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9835crs2 1 social security act 215a7 2 for determining years of coverage after 1978 for individuals with pensions from noncovered employment the amount is 25 of what the cont ribution and benefit base otherwise would have been if the 1977 social security ame ndments had not been enacted in 2008 the oldlaw taxable wage base is equal to 75900 and thus to earn credit for one year of substantial employment under the wep worker would have to earn at least 18975 in social security continueda different social security benefit formula referred to as the windfall elimination provision wep applies to many workers who also are entitled to pension from work not covered by social security eg work under the federal civil service retirement system1 under these rules the 90 factor in the first band of the formula is replaced by factor of 40 the effect is to lowe r the proportion of their earnings in the first bracket that are converted to benefits th following table illustrates how the provision works in 2008 table 1 monthly pia for worker with average monthly earnings of 1000 regular formula windfall elimination formula 90 of first 711 63990 40 of first 711 28440 32 of 711 through 4288 9248 32 of 711 through 4288 9248 15 over 4288 0000 15 over 4288 0000total 73238 total 37688 thus under the windfall elimination formul the benefit for the worker is 35550 73238 37688 less per month than under the regular formula note that once average monthly earnings exceed the first level in the formula of 711 the amount of the reduction remains at 35550 per month because th lower replacement f actor of the first level longer applies for example if the worker had 2000 of average monthly earnings instead of 1000 the windfall reduction still would be 35550 per month however because the dollar re duction is limited to the first bracket of the pia formula the percent reduction in benefits relative to the regular pia formula varies by aime for example if we applied the wep formula to worker with an aime of 4000 this worker would still see dollar reduction of 35550 per month however this worker would experience 21 reduction in benefits under the wep compared to the regular pia formula while the worker with 1000 aime would experience 49 reduction in benefits under the wep compared to the regular pia formula the provision includes guarantee designe d to help protect workers with low pensions that the reduction in benefits caused by the windfall elimination formula can never exceed more than onehalf of th pension based on noncovered work the provision also exempts workers who have 30 or more years of subs tantial employment covered under social security ie having earned at least onequarter of the old law social security maximum taxable wage base for each year in question2 also lesserhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9835crs3 2 continued coveredemployment 3 these are the most recent estimates available poverty rates were calculated by david weaver of the social security administrations ffice of retirement policy using the march 2001 current population survey cps poverty status is taken directly from the cps and is thus subject to errors in the reporting of income the sample for the wep poverty rate only includes persons for whom ssa administrative records coul d be matched the sample size for the wep poverty rate is relatively small 230 cases the poverty rates for the social security beneficiary population age 65 and over and for the general population do not require matched data and are based completely on cps datareductions apply to workers with 21 through 29 years of substantia l covered employment as follows years of social security coverage 20

covered by social security on january 1 1984 because of the 1983 amendments eg the president members of congress 2 to workers who reached age 62 became disabled or were first eligible for pension from noncovered employment before 1986 3 in com puting survivor benef its 4 to benefits from foreign social security systems that are based on totalization agreement with the united states and 5 to people whose onl noncovered employment that resulted in pension was in military service before 1957 or is based on ra ilroad employment according to the social security admin istration ssa as of december 2007 about 1 million recipients were affected by the wep of these approximately 65 were men ssa estimates that in 2000 35 of recipients affected by the wep had incomes below the poverty line for comparison purposes at that time 85 of all social security beneficiaries age 65 and older had income s below the poverty line and 113 of the general population had inco mes below the poverty line3 legislative history and rationale this provision was enacted in 1983 as part of major amendments designed to shore up the financing of the social security progra m its purpose was to remove an unintended advantage that the regular social security benefit formula provided to persons who also had pensions from nonsocial securitycovere d employment the regular formula was intended to help workers who spent their wo rk careers in low paying jobs by providing them with benefit that replaces higher pr oportion of their earnings than the benefit that is provided for workers with high earnings however the formula could not differentiate between those who worked in lowpaid jobs throughout their careers and other workers who appeared to have been low paid because they worked many years in jobs not covered by social security these years are shown as zeros for social security benefit purposeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9835crs4 thus under the old law workers who were employed for only tion of their careers in jobs covered by social security even highly paid ones also received the advantage of the weighted formula becau their few years of covered earnings were averaged over their entire working career to determine the average covered earnings on which their social security benefits were based the new formula is intended to remove this advantage for these workers arguments for the windfall elimination provision proponents of the measure say that it is reasonable means to prevent payment of overgenerous and unintended benefits to certa in workers who otherwise w ould profit from happenstance ie the mechanics of the social security benefit formula furthermore they maintain that the provision rarely causes hardship because by and large the people affected are reasonably well off as most of them also receive government pensions arguments against the windf all elimination provision some opponents believe the provision is unfair because it substa ntially reduces benefit that workers had included in their retirement plans others criticize how the provision works they say the arbitrary 40 factor in the windfall elimination formula is an imprecise way to determine the actual windfall when applied to individual cases for example they say it overpenalizes lower paid workers with short careers or with full careers that are fairly evenly split they also say it is regressive because the reduction is confined to the first bracket of the benefit formula and causes re latively larger reduction in benefits for low paid workers recent legislation in the 110th congress five bills have been intr oduced to repeal or alter the wep hr 82 was intr oduced by representative berman and s 206 the companion bill to hr 82 in the senate was introduced by nator feinstein under hr 82 and s 206 social security benefits paid after decem ber 2007 would longer be reduced by the wep the social security administrations office of the actuary has estimated that full repeal of the wep would cost approx imately 401 billion between 2008 and 2017 in the long run they estimate that eliminati on of the wep would co st 005 of taxable payroll causing an increase in social securitys longra nge deficit of about 3 hr 726 introduced by representative ba rney frank would eliminate the wep for those whose combined monthly income from social security and the noncovered pension was less than 2500 in 2007 indexed annually to the national average wage the bill would gradually phase in the provision for those who have combined monthly income of 2500 through 3334 for those with combined monthly incomes exceeding 3334 the wep would remain fully applicable ssas office of the actuary estimates that this bill would cost 19 billion between 2008 and 2017 and in the long run would cost 002 of taxable payroll causing an increase in social securitys longrange deficit of about 1httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9835crs5 4 for additional information on the psr pa please refer to crs
