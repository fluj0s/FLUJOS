fighter jsf program background status and issues summary the defense departments f35 lightning ii joint strike fighter jsf is one of three aircraft modernizati on programs in tactical avia tion the others being the air force f22a fighter and the navy fa18ef fighterattack plane in november 1996 the defense department selected two major aerospace companies boeing and lockheed martin to demonstrate competing designs for the jsf jointservice and multirole fighterattack plane lockheed martin won this competition and was selected to develop and produce the jsf family of aircraft in cluding conventional takeoff and landing ctol carriercap able cv and short takeoff vertical landing stovl versions for the us ai r force navy and marine corps the united kingdom as well as other allied services originally designated the joint advanced strike technology jast pr ogram the jsf program has attracted considerable attention in c ongress because of concerns bout its cost effects on the defense industrial base nd implications for us national security in the 21st century the jastjsf program is designed to address the high cost of tactical aviation the need to deploy fewer types of aircra ft to reduce acquisition and operating costs and projections of future threat scenarios and enemy capabilities the programs rationale and primary emphasis is jointservice development of nextgeneration multirole strike aircraft that can be produced in affordable variants to meet different operational requirements developing an affordable triservice family of aircraft with different but similar combat missions poses major technological challenges if the jsf is to have jointservice support the program must yield affordable aircraft that can meet such divergent needs as t hose of

bottomup review bur of us defense policy and programs having affirmed plans to abandon devel opment of both the a12afx aircraft that was to replace the navys a6 attack planes and the multirole fighter mrf that the air force had considered to replace its f16s the bur envisaged the jast program as replacement for both these programs in 1995 in response to congressional direction program led by the

of the airframe former s ecretary of defense william cohen stated that the jsfs joint appro ach avoids the three parallel development programs for serviceunique aircraft that would have otherwise been necessary saving at least 15 billion10 the jsf will be powered by the pra tt whitney f135 engine which was derived from the f22as pratt whitney f119 power plant consistent with congressional direction in 1996 dod estab lished an alternative engine program f136 with the general electricrollsroy ce fighter engine team to compete with the f135 for jsf production and operations nd support contracts in addition to teaming up with ge on the f136 engine rollsroyce is contracted to develop and produce the stovl lift fan system that will be used with both the f135 and f136 engines the net costbenefit of an alternate engine for the jsf program has periodically been debated and dod has attempted to liminate funding for the f136 removing funding for the engine in the fy2007 fy2008 and fy2009 budget requests11 congress has acted multiple times throughout the programs history to ensure continued dod support for the f136 all jsf planes will be fifthgeneration si ngleengine singleseat aircraft with

cost with the latter being critical factor program officials have emphasized that cost and performance tradeoffs are critical elements of the program and were the basis for the jointservice operational requirements that determined the selection of the lockheed martin contractor team for the system deve lopment and demonstr ation sdd phase16 the 1997 quadrennial defence review qdr report observed that uncertainties in prospective jsf production cost warrant caref ul departmental oversight of the cost benefit tradeoffs in design to ensure that modernization and force structure remain in balance over the long term17 in other words production costs must be low enough that these aircraft can be bought in sufficient quantities to maintain desired force levels thus the parameters of the jsfs performance and operational capabilities are subject to refinement for reas ons of cost technological developments and future threat assessments18 program management the jsf program is jointly staffed and managed by the department of the air force and the department of the navy com prising the navy and the marine corps with coordination among the services rein forced by alternating air force and navy department officials in ke management positions for example lt general george muellner usaf was the programs first di rector in 1994 with rear admiral craig steidle usn serving as

responsibilities19 conferees directed that dod submit report on the poten tial efficacy of this change prior to the release of the dod report former air force chief of staff general jumper was quoted as saying that he also supported pu tting one service in charge of jsf program acquisition20 however general jumper highlighted the significant investment the air force was making in the jsf program in response to the congressional language favoring the navy in dods res ponse to congress the report noted the current arrangement ensures one service does not have disproportionate voice when it

the december 2007 pauc and apuc cost estimates ar respectively 388 and 380 higher than cost estimates made in october 2001 since 2002 the jsf program estimate has increased by 100 billion due

recommended block deve lopment approach would extend sdd by up to eight years with an associated cost of approximately 13 billion in then year dollars51 while gaos approach would dela fielding of the f35 osd noted that there was gao analysis as to the costs of legacy fleet extensions or procurement price increases the jsf joint program office noted that program acquisition strategy was desi gned to take advantage of knowledge gained from the f22 program and legacy programs along with improvements in modeling and simulation to reduce the development period52 while this strate gy presents increased program risk proponents note projected cost savings as result of an expedited testing cycle and retirement of legacy syst ems proponents also highlight that fixes discovered during more concurrent ie expedited testingproduction cycle are usually much less expensive than the costs associated with more exhaustive testing period with less overlap and extende d production period this argument is strengthened somewhat by defense aerospace case study that determined continuity in development is the best way to avoid cost overruns53 programs that are able to manage developmen tal issues without lengthy program freezes were more apt to keep production cost growth to minimum midcourse risk reduction plan in december 2007 dod announced that it had decided to cut two test aircraft from the jsf program54 other changes to the test program included foregoing intermediate flight test measurements reducing the number of flight tests and employing ground laboratories and flying st beds nonjsf aircraft instrumented to simulate the f35 instead of actual jsf aircraft55 dod calls these changes to the f35 flight test program the midcourse risk reduction plan the purpose of the plan is to save approxima tely 600 million and replenish management reserves pot of money saved to mitigate unforseen developments in the development program these reserves had been depleted by progra m

program already facing excessive risk due to the overlap between development and production described bove generally speaking opponents believe that this plan is detrimental to the test program and raises the risk that design and performance shortcomings will not be discovered until late in the process when it will be more costly to redress them specifically oppone nts note that the number of jsf flight tests planned has been reduced twice prio r to the midcourse risk reduction plan in october 2005 dod pla nned 6979 f35 flight tests currently only 5147 are planned56 further eliminating two test aircraft it is argued removes an important hedge against potential attrition if something were to go awry with one or more of the test aircraft fewer are available to take up the slack proponents of this move state that st flights would have been reduced regardless of the status of the manage ment reserve account owing to testing efficiencies gained through commonality and lab investments pr oponents also assert that arguments against this plan are base d on old models of test evaluation the jsf they say is implementing stateoft heart technological advances in aircraft instrumentation and simula tion which reduces the need for actual flight tests affordability much has been made about the f35s overall price tag of almost 300 billion ty in addition to the aggregate am ount of funding requi red several other affordability issues stand out first as the production phase of the f35 accelerates the program will require large and sustained expenditures at the same time dod is facing acute budgetary challenges over the next 20 years dod projects spending over 10 billion annually on the f3557 at the same time dod aims to r ecapitalize other airc raft fleets such as tankers increase the army and mari ne corps personnel endstrength and prosecute the wars in iraq and afghanistan in other words the timing of f35 program costs may be as big of challenge as the overall amount second as the competing funding requi rements described above collide both dod and congress may be tempted to re duce the overall number of f35s to be procured experience suggests that reducing multiple defense acquisition programs is more feasible than cancelling one planned procurement quantities of the f22 and the fa18ef for example have been reduced by 70 and 54 respectively procuring fewer aircraft reduces overall co sts but increases the aircrafts perunit cost this would be particularly detrime ntal to program such as the f35 which was designed specifically to be moderately priced

billion in december 2007 some suggest that these figu res are misleading because the largest savings reported by dod in its latest report were not achie ved by improvements in design or manufacture but instead were achieved by moving costs from one category to another58 the gao offered strong critic ism of jsf cost estimates writing that they were not comprehens ive not accurate not well documented nor credible59 in summary gao noted that the jsf cost estimates did not include 7 billion for the f136 engine and that the fficial jsf cost estimates are at odds with estimates made by three inde pendent dod agencies jsf pporters dispute the gaos findings arguing that the program ffices cost models are more reliable than those used by other organizations60 fourth there are number of factors that will influence jsf costs either positively or negatively which are difficult to predict by statute dod must pursue the jsf f136 alternate engine program as mentioned above gao notes that the f136 development costs are not included in current jsf cost estimates the larger question is whether these costs include d or not will be r ecouped by competition between the f135 and the f136 dur ing jsf production and operation61 also the don has not yet deter mined how many of its 680 f35s will be cv variants and how many will be stovl variants thes aircraft have di fferent operational capabilities and different production and operating cost s finally jsf program officials anticipate major savings becau of high degree of commonality in components and systems among the three versions which are to be built on common production line however the f35 is not meeting its goals for commonality and as the program wrestles with final development challenges commonality could be compromised further which would lead to cost increases62 projected fighter aircraft inventory shortfalls in the late winter and early spring of the fy2009 legislative cycle both air force and department of the

officials have testified that they wish to double f 35 purchases over the next five years to alleviate the projected shortfalls65 although accelerating f35 purchases may appear bene ficial to the programs supporters it might also have negative consequences jsf officials have stated that to meet the current schedule they may be forced to field less capable stovl aircraft and upgrade them at later dates it is not cl ear what effect this block upgrade approach would have on overall costs66 another way to address the projected fi ghter shortfall would be to purchase more f15s f16s fa18efs and f22s all of which are still in production the navy reportedly is consider ing procuring 69 more super ho rnets to close the fighter gap67 this option might be cheaper than purchasing more f35s although these aircraft are less capable than the f35 the f22 is the exception in this comparison because it is more expensive than the f35 and more capable in many dimensions additional purchases of these aircraft howev er especially if at the f35s expense could raise f35 unit cost and potentially lienate foreign partners who are already concerned about cost growth in the jsf program68 similar option would be to execute service life extension slep program for those aircraft that are wearing out prematurely this option may prove to be cheaper than purchasing new aircraft ho wever sleping aircraft keeps them in depot and unavailable for opera tions for months if not ears which can constrain military capabilities and place even greater pr essure on those aircraft still flying final option to address the projected fighter gap would be to do nothing by sticking with the current fighter airc raft procurement plans dod may end up reducing the overall inventory of combat airc raft

implications for us defense industry as dods largest single weapon system acquisition program the jsf is focal point for discussions regarding the us defense industrial ba the october 2001 award of the jsf engineering manufactur ing development emd contract to single company lockheed martin raised concerns in congress and elsewhere that excluding boeing from this program would reduce that companys ability to continue designing and manufacturing fighter aircraft this in turn would have negative effect on the us fense industrial base69 similar concerns were raised in 2006 when dod proposed terminating the f136 alternate engine in this case some worri ed that if the f136 were cancelled general electric ge would not have enough busin ess designing and ma nufacturing fighter jet engines to continue competing with pratt whitney the manufacturer of the f135 engine in the future this would leave the united states dependent on only one domestic manufacturer of this class of engine others argued that ges considerable business in both commercial and military engines was sufficient to sustain ges ability to produce this class of engine in the future70 the jsf program could also have str ong impact on the us defense industry through export most obser vers believe that the jsf could potentially dominate the combat aircraft export market much as th f16 has like the f16 the jsf appears to be attractive because of its relatively low cost flexible design and promise of high performance also analysts note that durin g his first stint as defense secretary donald rumsfeld played an instrumental role in launching the f16 program by including foreign partners in the aircrafts development71 many competitors including frances rafale swedens jas gripen and the european typhoon are positioned to challenge the jsf in the fighter export market or take its market share if the program is cancelled also few count ries have expressed interest in buying either the f22a or the fa18ef the one country that has expre ssed interest in the f22a japan will most likely be unable to procure the f22 because of proposed clause in the fy2008 appropriations bill upholding ban on f22 exports72 instead japan is being redirected towards the f35 it can also be argued that the demand for civilian transport aircraft after 2000 will be strong enough to sustain robust us aviation

economic conditions may preserve an adequate us defense industrial base for the development and production of combat airc raft is debatable however given the significant differences between civilian and military aircraft requirements and technologies others fear that by allowing foreign companies to participate in this historically large aircraft acquisition program dod may be inadvertently opening up us markets to competitors who enjoy direct government subsidies these government subsidies could create an unfair advantage for them relative to us companies it is argued and the result could be the beginning of longe rterm foreign penetration of the us defense market that could erode the health of the us defense industrial base in may 2004 the gao release report that found the jsf program could significantly impact the us and global i ndustrial base74 the gao found that two laws designed to protect segments of th us defense industry the buy american act and the preference for domestic speciality metals clause would have impact on decisions regarding which foreign co mpanies would participate in the jsf program this is because dod has decided that foreign companies that
