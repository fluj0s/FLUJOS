market existing mortgage markets varied greatly by locality much of the lending industry was concentrated in large metropolitan areas like new york and chicago leaving credit in short supply outside of those areas of concentration these geographic barriers constrained the operation of supply and demand for the home mortgage market and spurred the need for secondary market to create national mortgage market as way to meet this goal congress enacted the national housing act of 1934 which created fannie mae as purely public governmental agency in 1954 fannie mae was rechartered into mixed private and public institution congress in 1968 split fannie into two distinct entities one serving the secondary mortgage market function which retained the fannie mae name and the other called ginnie mae government national mortgage association to carry out government subsidy functions this legislation transformed fannie mae into the privately owned gse it is today congre ss originally chartered freddie mac in 1970 as subsidiary of the federal home loan bank system to serve different purpose than fannie however congress in 1989 turned freddie into privately owned corporation just like fannie mae and also aligned freddies mission to that of fannie 3 in exchange for providing their public policy missions of stabilizing and correcting problems in the us mortgage market fannie mae and freddie mac receive number of government benefits most notably the presumption by investors of government backing prior to the passage of pl 110289 the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 and the naming of the fhfa as their conservator on september 7 2008 this government backing was merely presumed yet the presumption of federal backing generally allowed these two gses to borrow money at rates just slightly higher than that of the federal government in response to widespread concern that the two enterprises were insolvent and subsequent sharp downturn in their stock values in the second quarter of 2008 pl 110289 made the government guarantee much more explicit by temporarily au thorizing the secretary of the treasury the discretion to extend credit to or buy any obligatio ns of the two enterprises subject only to the federal debt limit 4 basically if fannie or freddie could not sell their debt securities or raise capital in the private market this law authorizes the treasury to buy unmarketable debt securities or recapitalize the firms by purchasing the gses stock prior to the appointment of the fhfa as conservator spokespersons for the treasury had stated that there were plans to use this authority rather it should be interpreted as prudent preparedness measure and nothing more 5 however the treasury changed course upon fannie and freddie entering conservatorship one response to the appointment of the fhfa as conservator made by the treasury is the establishment of new secured lending credit facility which will be made available to fannie mae freddie mac and the federal home loan banks which is intended to serve as an ultimate liquidity backstop in essence implementing the temporary liquidity backstop authority granted by congress in pl

senior preferred stock in each of the enterprises7 the treasury also unveiled plans to begin purchasing gse mortgagebacked securities at such time and in such amounts as determined by the treasury secretary8 in addition to authorizing the treasury to support fannie and freddie in these ways pl 110289 dissolved the office of federal housing enterp rise oversight ofheo the gses former regulator and established the fhfa as their new regulator and afforded it greater authority to deal with financially troubled fannie or freddie in contrast to ofheos authority as conservator to resolve failed fannie or freddie prior to the enactment of pl 110289 the fhfas authority is broader and more flexible having been modeled on the federal deposit insurance act fdi act 9 to understand the fhfas new

g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 the fdic administers federal deposit insurance under the authority of the fdi act it is federal agency that administers the deposit insurance fund which is comprised of premiums assessed on the basis of the amount of insured deposits held by an institution10 if any bank or thrift with fdicinsured deposits fails the fdic must see to it that insured deposits are protected ie that any insured deposits in the failed bank or thrift are either paid off or transferred to another institution this process generally requires significant disbursements from the deposit insurance fund and results in the fdic being the largest creditor of the failed institution federal deposit insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states 11 therefore if the deposit insurance fund is exhausted the funds of the federal government are at risk this means that if there were multiple bank or thrift failures that exhaust the deposit insurance fund federal appropriations would be necessary to supplement the deposit insurance fund and protect insured depositors 12 because of the possible threat to the federal fisc13 and for other reasons14 7

billion treasury borrowing limit 12 usc 1825 14 the general assumption has been that the pivotal role banks and thrifts play in mainstream economic life justifies government control of bank and thrift insolvencies see eg david skeel jr the law and finance of bank and insurance insolvency regulation 76 tex l rev 723 1998 hereinafter skeel it has also been suggested that the risk of insider abuse is

insolvencies are not handled according to the procedures available in the case of other corporate bankruptcies15 they are subject to separate regime prescribed in federal law called conservatorship or receivership rather than being subject to bankruptcy court or state court proceedings under this regime the conservator or receiver which generally is the fdic is provided substantial authority to deal with virtually every aspect of the insolvency conservator is appointed to operate the institution conserve its resources and restore it to viability receiver is appointed to liquidate the institution sell its assets and pay claims against it to the extent available funds allow and in accordance with priorities established in federal law receiverships are more common than conservatorships in receivership the fdic wears two hats it functions both as receiver and in its corporate capacity as administrator of the deposit insurance fund in its corporate capacity it is generally the largest creditor of the institution because from the deposit insurance fund it will have either paid off the insured deposits directly or paid another bank or thrift to assume the deposit liabilities and thus have claim against the receivership for the amount of the insured deposits when an insured bank or thrift become s insolvent the institutions charterer 16 its primary federal regulator or the fdic is authorized to act ex parte ie without notice or hearing to seize the institution and its assets and install the fdic as conservator or receiver17 unless time is of the essence prior to taking such action however there is consultation between the institutions regulator and the fdic concerning the imminent failure this gives the fdic time to investigate the situation and determine resolution strategy before releasing information to the public of the looming insolvency generally the fdic chooses among three possible resolution strategiesa deposit payoff closing the bank or thrift assuming its assets and liabilities and paying off insured deposits open institution assistance providing some financial assistance in the form of loan assisted merger or purchase of assets or purchase and assumption pa finding one or more institutions to take over part or all of the institutions assets and liabilities the fdic must choose the resolution strategy that is least costly to the deposit insurance fund 18 for this reason the pa approach is chosen most often19 continued p swire bank insolvency law now that it matters again 42 duke l j 469 1992 15 see robert r

the fdic may take any action authorized by the fdi act which the corporation determines is in the best interests of the depository institution its depositors or the corporation20 the basic difference between conservatorship and receivership is that conservatorship involves operating the institution as going concern to protect its assets until it stabilizes or is closed and receiver appointed21 receiver is charged with liquidating the institution and winding up its affairs conservatorship may indicate that the fdic aims to restore the in stitution to solvency or that the fdic had to act quickly without the usual lead time for investigation in either case conservatorship may be followed by receivership if determination is made that the institution is not viable bank or thrift in

insured portions of their deposits or protect creditors other than depositors there is however provision that permits the fdic to arrange purchase and assumption transactions in which the acquirer may take on uninsured deposit liabilities if the insurance fund does not incur any loss with respect to them that is greater than it would have been had the institution been liquidated 62 to determine

serious adverse effects on economic conditions or financial stability and that action or assistance under this provision would avoid or mitigate such adverse effects64 subject to the leastcost resolution requirement the fdic generally has three options for resolving bank or thrift insolvencies depositor payout open institution assistance or purchase and assumption pa the most common of these has been the pa because it has usually been the least costly and least disruptive to the community it generally involves the purchase of assets and assumption of liabilities of the failed institution by one or more healthy institutions whatever assets or liabilities remain are the responsibility of the fdic as receiver if acquirer is found the fdic must undertake depositor payoff and liquidate all of the failed institutions assets third option open institution assistance involves the fdic providing financial assistance to improve the capital position of an undercapitalized institution and keep it from failing in exercising any of these options the fdic must consider the potential adverse economic effect of any resolution on the local community and the vi ability of other depository institutions in the same community and issue guidelines and take certain actions to alleviate this impact 65

method for resolving failed depository institution is the deposit payoff71 when depository institution is closed the fdi act requires that the fdic pay insured deposits as soon as possible either by cash or by making available to each depositor transferred deposit in new insured depository institution in the same community or in another depository institution72 if the fdic is unable to find an acquirer for the assets and liabilities of closed institution it may decide upon deposit payoff in such cases the fdic will calculate the amount of insured deposits for each customer and make those funds available to them either by direct payments from the fdic or by transferring the deposit accounts and an equal amount of cash from the deposit insurance fund to healthy institution it will notify customers where their funds will be available to them in straight payoff the checks will be written by the fdic and available either at the closed bank or thrift or by mail in an insured deposit transfer the funds will be available at the healthy bank or thrift which will be acting as the fdics agent another option available to the fdic to handle closed depository institution is to create temporary national bank or federally chartered thrift 73 and transfer the failed institutions insured deposits to it to do so the fdic must calculate the amount owed to each account holder based on standard maximum deposit insurance amount of 10000074 disputes about claims for insured deposits are to be resolved first by the fdic in accordance with its regulations subject to judicial review under the ad ministrative procedure act75 the fdic uses the deposit insurance fund to pay depositors up to the insurance limit or to transfer deposit liabilities to another insured depository institution it therefore steps into the shoes of the depositors and by virtue of what is known as subrogation assumes their claims 70 12 usc 1815e7 71 according to the fdic deposit payoffs occur more often in smaller banks rather than in large banks and from 1980 through 1994 the fdic managed 120 straight deposit payoffs out of total of 1617 failed and assisted banks fdic resolution handbook at 43 httpwwwfdicgovbankhistoricalreshandbookindexhtml from 1980 through august 1 2008 the fdic used the deposit payoff option 248 times out of 3001 closings and assistance transactions from 2000 through

other insured depository institution is required to recognize as owner of deposit account anyone other than person whose name or interest as owner is on the failed banks records if the recognition would increase the aggregate amount of insured deposits79 there is also provision permitting the fdic to withhold payment of such portion of the insured deposit of any depositor as may be required to provide for the payment of any liability of such depositor to the depository institution in default or its receiver which is not offset against claim due from such depository institution pending the determination and payment of such liability80 depositors have 18 months to claim their deposits from the fdic or the transferee depository institution provided that the fdic has followed the specific procedures for notifying deposit holders after 18 months unclaimed deposits are turned over to the appropriate state if unclaimed after 10 years they revert to the fdic if state refuses to accept the unclaimed property it will remain with the fdic and the depositors will be able to claim it until the receivership is terminated thereafter depositors rights will be barred81

institutions or of insured depository institutions possessing significant financial resources82 the assistance which is designed to keep the institution or institutions from failing may take the form of loans deposits asset or security purchases or assumption of the liabilities of an insured institution83 this method of resolution protects uninsured depositors and at least to some extent

those of the fdic as subrogee of the insured depositors whom it has made whole have priority over all other unsecured claims except those involving administrative expenses of the receivership 103 the fdi act specifies the order in which uninsured and unsecured claims are to be discharged ie paid from the receipts of the liquidation104 the statute specifies the following priority for payment of unsecured claims that are proved to the satisfaction of the receiver105 administrative expenses of the receivership deposit liabilities any other general or senior liability any obligation subordinated to depositors or general creditors which is not an obligation owed to shareholders as shareholders obligations owed to shareholders arising as result of their status as shareholders106 one of the effects of the depositor preference re quirement is that in combination with the least cost resolution requirement it limits the fdics resolution options prior to depositor preference when deposits were paid on the same prorata basis as other unsecured claims the fdics reimbursement from deposit payoff was likely to be less than it would be under todays rule that requires all deposit claims including that of the fdic as subrogee for the insured deposits that it has paid have to be paid off before any other unsecured claims other than the administrative expenses of the receivership

the biggest issues with ofheos ability to help financially troubled fannie or freddie was the dearth of explicit statutory authority this section addresses the powers that were expressly provided to ofheo and the legal uncertainty that would have arisen had ofheo taken measures not expressly provided for in the code as way to help failed gse prior to the effective date of pl 110289 there was statutory only for the appointment of conservator for troubled fannie or freddie not receiver 110 the director of ofheo could appoint conservator if he or she determined that there was other satisfactory alternative available and that the enterprise is not likely to pay its obligations in the normal course of business covering losses would deplete substantially all of its core capital111 and would not likely be able to build the core capital back up in reasonable amount of time 108 superpowers is the term used for the tools available to the fdic to deal with insolv ent depository

enterprise that are material to the discharge of the directors responsibilities or refused to submit such materials for inspection to the director upon request or there exists willful violation of cease and desist order112 the conservator could have been the director any agency of the government or any disinterested person that had the knowledge and expertise necessary to run the gses113 review of the legislative history of this provision offered little by way of elaboration as to whom other than the director of ofheo congress contemplated rving as conservator within 20 days of conservators appointment fannie and freddie had right to contest the appointment in federal district court114 pursuant to the law in effect before enactment of pl 110289 conservatorship would continue until the director deemed that its termination would be in the public interest and would be safely accomplished or until the enterprise reached its minimum capital requirements115 conservators were granted all the powers of the shareholders directors and officers of the enterprise116 the prior law also gave conservators the authority to avoid any security interest taken by creditor with the intent to hinder delay or defraud the enterprise or its creditors117 finally conservator had the ability to enforce certain contracts and seek temporary stay of judicial proceedings to which the enterprise or the conservator was party118 that was basically the extent of the conservators express statutory authority this authority was far less expansive and it provided far less guidance than that bestowed upon the fdic to deal with troubled banks and thrifts some of th more notable differences are 1 ofheo was limited exclusively to conservatorship 2 the circumstances in which conservator could be appointed arguably would only arise when fannie or freddie was in financial condition so dire that the only hope of saving the institution was with federal funding and 3 conservator for fannie or freddie had authority to reorganize bt ie pay only parts of debts or restructure payments over longer period of time than the existing pay schedule the dearth of guidance provided was also troublesome for example the law prior to pl 110 289 did not list the priority of unsecured creditor s and even did not make clear who could serve as conservator consequently conservator for fannie or freddie would have had difficulty returning an enterprise back to solid financial footing using only the powers it was explicitly given and any actions taken outside of its explicit authority would have been wrought with legal uncertainty which could have undermined the effectiveness of taking such actions 112 formerly 12 usc 4619a1 repealed by pl 110289 the director also could have appointed conservator upon majority

other things it largely revamped the statutory authority for handling financially troubled fannie or freddie by closely modeling the fdi act and giving the fhfa largely the same powers over failed fannie and freddie that the fdic has over failed banks and thrifts including the authority to act as receiver the following sections highlight some of the more important differences between the fdi act and pl 110289 and briefly describe and cite those provisions that are similar

the differences between the fdics authority and that of the fhfa primarily seem to stem from the variant roles performed by the two types of institutions being regulated one of the main goals of receiver or conservator of failed bank or thrift is to protect its fdicinsured deposits as fannie and freddie are not lenders and do not hold deposits the fhfa as conservator or receiver does not have to be concerned about fdicinsured deposits the lack of insured deposits held by fannie and freddie appears to account for the majority of the differences in the two regulatory regimes for example the fhfa does not have to adhere to leastcost requirement like that imposed by the fdi act c onsequently the resolution strategies for dealing with failed fannie or freddie likely would differ from the insured deposit focus of the strategies generally applied for failed banks and thrifts another major difference is the fact that the director of the fhfa as fannie and freddies sole regulator is granted the exclusive authority to appoint conservator or receiver over the enterprises the authority to appoint conservator or receiver over failed bank or thrift on the other hand may rest in state chartering authority one of the multiple federal regulators or the fdic depending on the type of bank or thrift and its charterer additionally there are situations in which the director of the fhfa must appoint the fhfa as receiver over fannie or freddie whereas the appointment of receiver over failed bank or thrift is always discretionary

the discretionary grounds for appointing the fhfa as conservator or receiver over fannie or freddie are virtually identical to those provided to the fdic for thrifts and banks the only significant difference is that pl 110289 does not include the termination of deposit insurance coverage as ground for appointment as it is inapplicable to the enterprises 119 in addition to the discretionary grounds pl 110289 does include two mandatory grounds for the appointment of the fhfa as receiver one mandatory ground is if the enterprises debts exceeds its assets during the previous 60 days the other is if the enterprise generally has not been paying the debts other than debts that are the subject of bona fide dispute as such 119 pl 102550 1367a3 as amended by pl 110289 1145a

powers are also provided for each of these capacities pl 110289 makes clear the powers assigned to the fhfa as conservator or receiver are not exclusive but are in addition to any other powers conferred on conservators or receivers of the enterprises and that in exercising its conservatorship or receivership authority it shall not be subject to the direction or supervision of any other agency or department of the united states or any state in the exercise of the fhfas rights powers and privileges 122

insured depository institutions provisions that are required by the fdi act are not applicable to fannie and freddie 137 pl 102550 1367b12 as amended by pl 110289 1145a 138 pl 102550 1367b2d as

not be less than 90 days from the date of the notice 143 within 180 days of receiving claim the fhfa must notify the claimant of whether or not it will allow the claim144 the fhfa has authority to
