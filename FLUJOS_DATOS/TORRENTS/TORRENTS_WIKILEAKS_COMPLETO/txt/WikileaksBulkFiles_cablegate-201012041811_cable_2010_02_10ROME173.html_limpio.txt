secdef meeting with italian foreign minister franco frattini february 8 2010 rome 00000173 0012 of 003 classified by ambassador alexander vershbow for reasons 14 b and d 1 snf summary secretary of defense robert gates secdef met with italian minister of foreign affairs franco frattini during an official visit to rome on february 8 on afghanistan frattini was eager to move beyond the london conference and work to produce practical results for the afghan people he proposed better civilmilitary coordination at senior levels in nato and raised the prospect of coordination on local projects across the afghanistaniran border secdef thanked frattini for italys pledge of more troops for operations in afghanistan and explained where gaps in civilmilitary cooperation existed frattini believed the international community was lining up against iran and encouraged better coordination with countries outside the p5plus1 secdef warned that nuclear iran would lead to greater proliferation in the middle east war or both secdef agreed with frattini that united nations conference highlighting security challenges in the horn of africa was good idea end summary afghanistan 2 snf frattini opened by telling secdef that the us can count on italys full support on afghanistan iran and fighting terror he had recently talked with general jones and secretary clinton and relayed the same message he expressed desire to focus on the comprehensive approach in such way to improve the daily lives of afghans he asserted need to press president karzai on delivering improved governance or risk losing support for the mission in coalition parliaments frattini wanted to get beyond just talking referencing the london conference and noted concrete italian projects to convert poppy cultivation to olive oil production and to create national high school for public administration 3 snf secdef commended romes efforts to increase italian contributions asking whether even more carabinieri might be available for training the afghan security forces he observed that general mcchrystals emphasis on protecting afghan civilians has changed attitudes among allied publics secdef said he is pushing the comprehensive approach noting need for all stakeholders in afghanistan to share information effectively he said he hoped that natos new senior civilian representative ambassador mark sedwill could facilitate this secdef recommended focus on better governance below the level of the national government which would take decades to turn into modern government taking advantage of traditional institutions and competent governors at the regional and subregional levels and leveraging them into local success stories at the national level however our priority should be to develop those ministries most critical to our success such as defense interior finance agriculture and health noting gen mcchrystals recent statement that the situation in afghanistan is longer deteriorating secdef said that much of the challenge is psychological convincing afghans that we can win and that we will not abandon them 4 snf frattini agreed that civilianmilitary integration is the weakest part of the afghan strategy he expressed frustration that nato foreign ministers only discuss issues like agriculture and education while defense ministers only discuss security the problem frattini suggested is that they dont talk to each other he proposed joint meeting of foreign and defense ministers beginning with talks at the expert level secdef responded that gen mcchrystal and ambassador eikenberry do civilianmilitary collaboration at the national level on the basis of joint campaign plan as do local ground commanders with leaders of prts what is missing is the level in between the regional commands and secdef expressed desire for sedwill to appoint subordinates to address this in each rc building on the rome 00000173 0022 of 003 example of the civmil cell in rcsouth the effect would be cascading civilmilitary coordination at the national regional and local levels secdef noted that similar efforts by unsrsg kai eide had been hamstrung by resourcing and the uns aversion to working with the military as nato representative sedwill should not have these problems 5 snf frattini also asked about practical cooperation across the afghaniranian border local incentives for cooperation might undermine weapons and drug trafficking and help coopt reconcilable taliban secdef noted that iran is playing both sides of the street trying to be friendly with the afghanistan government while trying to undermine isaf efforts he noted that intelligence indicated there was little lethal material crossing the afghanistaniran border secdef suggested that trade route protection from afghanistan into eastern iran which is important for local economies on both sides of the border might be place to start secdef noted that any effort will need to be coordinated with kabul frattini agreed this would be good starting point iran 6 snf frattini supported recent public statements by secdef raising the pressure on iran he declared that ahmadinejad cannot be trusted especially after contradicting recent constructive statements by his own government frattini citing recent conversation with russian foreign minister lavrov said he believed russia would support the sanctions track the challenge was to bring china on board china and india in frattinis view were critical to the adoption of measures that would affect the government without hurting iranian civil society he also specifically proposed including saudi arabia turkey brazil venezuela and egypt in the conversation he expressed particular frustration with ankaras double game of outreach to both europe and iran frattini proposed an informal meeting of middle east countries who were keen to be consulted on iran and noted that secretary clinton was in agreement 7 snf secdef emphasized that unsc resolution was important because it would give the european union and nations legal platform on which to impose even harsher sanctions against iran secdef pointedly warned that urgent action is required without progress in the next few months we risk nuclear proliferation in the middle east war prompted by an israeli strike or both secdef predicted different world in 45 years if iran developed nuclear weapons secdef stated that he recently delivered the same warning to pm erdogan and he agreed with frattinis assessment on saudi arabia and china noting that saudi arabia is more important to both beijing and moscow than iran 8 snf secdef urged frattini to reconsider planned visit to italy by prominent iranian parliamentarian in the wake of recent executions of students in opposition to the government at the same time we needed to ensure we did not discredit the opposition by creating the impression that they are the tools of foreign partners horn of africa 9 c frattini expressed concern about deteriorating conditions in somalia and yemen he noted recent conversation with president sharif of somalias transitional federal government tfg in which sharif said that he would be unable to pay his security forces by the end of february frattini said that italy was encouraging the eu presidency to focus on somalia and yemen and had proposed united nations conference addressing horn of africa security issues italy was providing funding to the tfgs national budget secdef concurred that the region deserved more focus rome 00000173 0032 of 003 10 u secdef has cleared this cable drafted by osd staff dibble
