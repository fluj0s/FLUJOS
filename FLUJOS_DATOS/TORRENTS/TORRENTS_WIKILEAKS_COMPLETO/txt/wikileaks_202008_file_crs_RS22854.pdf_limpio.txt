laid aside given that the presiding oﬃcer traditionally aﬀords the senate majority leader or his designee priority over all others in being recognized majority leader can repeatedly secure recognition and ﬁll the amendment tree himself by sequentially oﬀering all of the amendments permitted under applicable circumstances by doing so leader can freeze the amendment process in place blocking additional ﬂoor amendments at least temporarily majority leader might ﬁll the tree in this way to prevent the oﬀering of or voting on of nongermane amendments to try speed consideration of measure or

christopher m davis analyst on the congress and legislative process government and finance division summary amendment trees are charts that illustrate certain principles of precedence which guide the senate amendment process when all of the amendments permitted simultaneously by these principles have b een offered and are pending an amendment tree is said to be filled and additional amendments may be offered until one or more of those pending is disposed of or id aside given that the presiding officer traditionally affords the senate majority leader or his designee priority over all others in being recognized majority leader can repeatedly secure recognition and fill the amendment tree himself by sequentially offe ring all of the amendments permitted under applicable circumstances by doing so leader can freeze the amendment process in place blocking additional floor amendments at least temporarily majority leader might fill the tree in this way to prevent the offering of or voting on of nongermane amendments to try speed consideration of measure or to control the subject or sequence of amendments that may be offered background on the amendment trees the amendment trees have developed over decades of senate practice as way of visualizing certain principles of precedence that govern the offering of and voting on amendments in the chamber these prin ciples of precedence are reflected in four amendment tree charts published in the official compilation of senate precedents which depict the maximum number and type of amendments that may be offered and simultaneously pending under various circumstances durin g consideration of bill1 which of the four amendment tree charts w ill be applicable at given point during consideration of measure is dictated by the form of the first amendment that is offered be it motion to insert to strike to strike and insert or in the nature of substitutehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22854crs2 2 ibid p 1093 3 action includes ordering the yeas and nays on the amendment adopting rejecting or tabling it amending it or entering into unanimous consent request specific to that amendment an amendment tree is said to be filled when all of the amendments permitted by these principles of precedence have been ffered and are pending depending on which tree applies in given floor situation an amendment tree might be filled by as few as three or as many as 11 amendments when an amendment tree is full the amendment process is in effect frozen additi onal floor amendments may be offered until action is taken to dispose of one or more of those alread pending pending amendments might be disposed of by being voted upon w ithdrawn by their sponsor or tabled the senate might also lay aside pending amendment or amendment tree by unanimous consent so that senator may offer anothe r amendment notwithstanding those pending recognition and the senate majority leader under paragraph 1a of senate rule xix the presiding officer shall recognize the senator who shall first address him in keeping with rule xix senators offer amendments to pending bill in the order they obtain recognition to do so under traditions and practices observed since at l east the late 1930s however in the event that several senators seek recognition simultaneously priority of recognition shall be accorded the majority leader and minority leader th majority bill manager and the minority manager in that order2 this priority in recognition afforded the majority leader or his designee is relevant to the amendment tree because the order of recognition can affect opportunities in the amendment process when senator has offered an amendment he or she has the right to withdraw or modify the amendment after action has been taken on the amendment such as ordering the yeas and nays however its author loses the unilateral right to withdraw or modify it but gains the right to amend it3 accordingly if senator offering an amendment on which action has been taken can again s ecure recognition he or she may offer an amendment to their own amendment so long as the new amendment complies with the principles of precedence described above thus while any senator or group of sena tors acting in concert might potentially fill the amendment tree the custom of grantin g the majority leader or designee priority recognition means that determined majority leader will always be recognized before other senators and as result the majority leader alone is guaranteed the ability to fill the amendment tree by being repeatedly recognized in turn to offer amendments to pending measure and to their own amendments until more are in order possible strategic reasons for filling the tree senator particularly the majority lead er might pursue strategy of filling the amendment tree for several reasons including preventing nongermane and perh aps politically controversial amendments to measure fro m being offered or voted uponhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22854crs3 attempting to expedite overall senate consideration of legislation by limiting the overall number of amendments offered obtaining advantage in the negotia tion of unanimous consent request for the further consid eration of measure obtaining the first recorded vote on policy provision in the exact form desired or instituting some measure of leadership control over the subject or sequence of floor amendments offered after filling an amendment tree the majority leader may file cloture petition either on pending amendment or on the underlying measure if cloture is invoked on the measure not only does it establish 30hour limit for further consideration of the bill it limits amendments that may be offered to those that are germane and any pending non germane amendments fall by keeping tree full until cloture is invoked majority leader may be able to prevent action on pending nongermane amendment prevent all nongermane amendments from being offered or limit the cons ideration of additional amendments altogether majority leader might also fill the tree in an effort to require the senate to complete action on an amendment tree that includes an amendment in the nature of substitute or substitute for portion of measure once substitute for measure or section has been adopted fu rther amendments to that text are in order because it is not permitted to amend only text that has previously been amended finally leader might fill the tree in an attempt to allow only those amendments acceptable to him to be offered to measur this could be accomplished by filling an entire tree and agreeing to unanimous consent request to lay aside pending amendment only for the offering of favored amendments majority leader might also fill some but not all of the available limbs on an amendment tree and use his right of first recognition to call up and offer amendments that he finds acceptable possibly including filed amendments authored by other senators implication of filled trees as noted above when majority leader f ills the amendment tree he freezes the amendment process in place limiting opport unities for other senators to offer amendments while the tree remains pending and potentially after the amendments are adopted as well wh ile the leaders ability to fill the tree gives him at least some temporary control over the senate floor it also means that floor proceedings are largely frozen for him as well unless the sena chooses to invoke cloture measure is regulated by statute which limits overall debate or the majority leader is able to negotiate unanimous consent agreement re gulating the further consideration of the legislation majority leader is subject to th same procedural stalem ate as other senators in addition the tactic of blocking am endment opportunities in chamber which by long tradition places few limits on the ability of individual senators to amend legislation may create negative reaction which impairs majority leaders future ability to managehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22854crs4 the senate floor these considerations may help explain why filling the amendment tree has been visible and often politicallyc harged occurrence even though it has been comparatively infrequent
