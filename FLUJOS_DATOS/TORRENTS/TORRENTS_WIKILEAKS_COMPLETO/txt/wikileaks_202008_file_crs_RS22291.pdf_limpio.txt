realignments in the 2005 brac round the department of defense dod recommended 190 closures and realignments of this number the brac commission approved 119 with changes and accepted 45 with amendments these figures represented 86 of the depa rtment of defenses overall proposed recommendations in other words only 14 of dods list was sign ificantly altered by the commission of the rest the commission rejected 13 dod recommendations in their entirety and significantly modified another 13 it should be pointed out that the brac commission approved 21 of dods 33 major cl osures recommended realignment of 7 major closures and rejected another 5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22291crs2 costs and savings over the next 20 years the total savings of the commissions recommendations are estimated at 356 billion significantly smaller than dods earlier estimate of 478 billion the difference between commission and dod estimates has proved controversial results of jointness according to the commission dod achieved only minor success in promoting increased jointness w ith its recommendations most of the proposed consolidations and reorganizations were within not across the military departments air national guard among the most difficult issues faced by the 2005 brac commission were dods proposals to close or realign air national guard bases thirty seven of 42 dod air force proposals involved air national guard units commission process according to the commission its process was open transparent apolitical and fa ir commissioners or staff memb ers made 182 site visits to 173 separate insta llations it conducted 20 regional hear ings to obtain public input and 20 deliberative hearings for input on or discussion of policy issues differences between current and prior rounds in 2005 dod adopted an approach supportin g an emphasis on joint operations the 1988 1991 and 1993 rounds did not include joint crossservice element the 1995 round did utilize joint crossservice groups in its analytical process but the three military departments we re permitted to reject their recommendations in 2005 the joint crossservice groups were elevated to become peers of th military departments the 2005 commission consisted of nine mbers rather than eight thereby minimizing the possibility of tie votes for the 2005 round the time horizon for assessing future threats in preparing dods force struct ure plan was 20 years rather than six the 1995 selection criteria stated th at the environmental impact wa s to be considered in any base closure or realignment the 2005 criteri required the departme nt of defense and ultimately the commission to consider the impact of costs related to potential environmental restorations waste manageme nt and environmental compliance activities existing brac law specifies eight in stallation selection criteria the 2005 commission emphasized the sixth which direct ed consideration of economic impact on local communities in prior rounds homeland defense was not considered selection criterion it is now significant element among the military value selection criteria the 1991 commission added 35 bases to the dod list of recommendations the 1993 commission added 72 and the 1995 commission added 36 where as the 2005 commission added only 8 finally prior brac rounds did not take place in the face of the planned movement of tens of thousands of troops from abroad back to the united stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22291crs3 subsequent commissionrecommended legislation overview the 2005 defense base closure and realignment commission recommended various changes to the existing statute governing its creation organization process and outcome the proposed revision of the governing act if enacted would arguably represent significant change in scope of the brac law it would expand the commissions lifespan and mission it would explicitly link reconsideration of the defense infrastructure footprint to security threat analysis by the new director of national intelligence dni and the periodic st udy of the nations defense strategy known as the quadrennial defense review it w ould also formalize brac consideration of international treaty obligations undertaken by the united st ates such as the scheduled demilitarization of chemical munitions by passing legislation containing the commissions recommended lang uage congress would authorize the secretary of defense to conduct 20142015 brac round s hould he or she deem it necessary other recommended provisions would able the commission to suggest new vehicles for the expeditious transfer of title of real property designated for disposal through the brac process in addition recommended legislativ language suggests expanding the requirement for department of defense release of analytical data and strengthens the penalty for failure to do so it would increase the responsibilities of the commissions general counsel and would exempt the commission from the federal advisory committee act faca while retaining conformity with the freedom of information foia and government in the sunshine acts the recommended legislation would also make permanent the existing temporary authority granted to the department of defense to enter into envi ronmental cooperative agreements with federal state and local entities including indian tribes finally the recommended legisl ation while it retains many of the features new to the 2005 round such as the super majority requirement it repeals others such as statutory selection criteria placing brac in the broader security context the 2005 brac round was the fourth in which an independent co mmission reviewed recommendations drawn up by the department of defense amended them and submitted the revised list to the president for approval while the 2005 process rese mbled the previous three rounds it was profoundly different in many respects for example the dods anal ytical process attempted to reduce former rounds emphasis on individual military departments by enhancing the joint and crossservice evaluation of installations brac analysis in 2005 also attempted to project defense needs out to 20 years whereas previous rounds used much shorte r sixyear analytical horizon this encouraged dod analytical team s to base their assessments on assumptions of the needs of transformed military services not formations created for the cold war these assumptions were embodied in the force structure plan and in frastructure inventory submitted by the secretary of defense in its legislative recommendation the commission suggested that potential 2014 2015 brac round be placed in strategic seque nce of defense review independent threat analysis and base realignment the new statute would couple th existing quadrennial defense review qdr currently required ever four years with consideration of newhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22291crs4 2 brac recommendations dealing with certain inst allations are driven by chemical weapon and other international treaty obligations extern to the brac process itself the proposed legislation would have authorized the commission s executive director to request staff detailees from

defense to initiate new brac round the dni would produce and forward to cong ress an independent threat assessment brac commission under the 2005 statute the brac commission was terminated on april 16 2006 the proposed gislation would have extended the life of subset of the commission chairman executiv director and staff of not more than 50 which would have mainta ined the commissions documentation and formed the core of an expanded staff for possible 20142015 commission in addition the continued commission would ve been tasked to monitor and report on 1 the use of brac appropriations 2 the implementation and savings of 2005 brac recommendations 3 the execution of privatizationsinplace at brac sites 4 the remediation of environmental degradation and its associated cost at brac sites and 5 the impact of brac actions on international treaty obligations of the united states2 commission reports the proposed law would have required the prolonged commission to prepare and submit three reports to congress and the president an annual report special report due on june 30 2007 and fina l report due on october 31 2011 annual reports the commission would have repor ted not later than

necessitating longterm management and oversighthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22291crs5 3 see crs report rl31039 military housing privatization initiative background and issues by daniel h else for more informationthe 2005 commission report proposed that this study examine freeing the department after set peri od to withdraw from unsuccessf ul title transfer negotiations with local redevelopment authorities in order to seek other partners it also envisioned potential department contracts with private environmental insurance carriers after the completion of remediation in order to mitigate risk of future liability the study could have considered the advisability of crafting financial toolbox similar in concept to the special authorizations granted to the department of defense in the creation of the military housing privatiz ation initiative in order to expedite the disposal of challenging proper ties other alternatives studied were the creation of public private partnerships limit edliability corporations or inde pendent trusteeshi ps to take title to and responsibility for properties3 the commission would have consulted closely with the department of defense the military departments the comptroller general of the united states the environmental protection agency and the bureau of land ma nagement department of the interior in preparing its study and report final report existing law requires all brac implementation actions to be completed not later than six years after the date that the president transmitted the current commissions report or september 15 2011 the recommended legislation would have required the commission to submit final report on the execution of these actions not later than october 31 2011 other noteworthy considerations the recommended legislation included other provisions suggested by the experience of the 2005 round submission of certified data the proposed legislation would require the secretary of defense to rel ease the supporting certified data not later than seven 7 days after forwarding his or her base closur and realignment recommendations to the congressional defense committees and the commission failure to do so would terminate the brac round prolongation of commission analysi s and recommendation period the 2005 commission report notes that the four months allotted by statute for the commission to complete its work was shortened considerably by delays in staffing the commission the appointment of commissioners and the release of defense department certified data among other considerati ons the commission proposed legislation to extend the period to seven 7 months commission subpoena power the 2005 commission suggested that future body be granted the commission the power to subpoena witness for its hearings commission general counsel as sole ethics counselor t h commission recommended statutory designa tion of the commissions general counsel as its sole ethics counselor the 2005 commission found that questions concerninghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22291crs6 recusal from consideration potentia l conflicts of intere st etc were not materially assisted by consultation with other
