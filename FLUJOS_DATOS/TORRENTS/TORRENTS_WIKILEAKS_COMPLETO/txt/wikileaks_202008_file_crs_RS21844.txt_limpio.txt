fy2007 ccf appropriations request is 100 million but the house and senate fy2007 appropriations measures hr 5647s 3708 would provide only 5455 million the fy2005 amount s 6 the family and community

reflect new data and budget figures major program changes and legislation congressional research service the library of congress crs2 what is the compassion capital fund ccf the ccf is federal program it is not trust fund advanced by the bush administration that 1 provides grants to match nonfederal support with federal dollars to help experienced organizations aid small faithbased and community groups to better serve social needs 2 gives funding directly to smaller groups to expand or to emulate model programs and 3 provides research technical assistance and other support for these efforts it is key element of the administrations faithbased initiative announced in january 2001 to expand the use of faithbased and community groups as providers of social services1 its expenditures depend on how much congress chooses to appropriate for any given year ie it is discretionary program just as important many federal agencies eg the departments of agriculture health and human services housing and urban development justice labor veterans affairs make grants to faithbased and communitybased organizations as part of their regular activities these can look like ccf grants in that they provide money to faith based and community groups as well as others but are not ccffunded in addition number of specific activities closely associated with the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21844 administrations faithbased initiative and often linked to faithbased and community providers receive federal money outside the ccf prisoner reentry program project for mentoring children of prisoners the access to recovery substance abuse treatment program an initiative supporting maternity group homes abstinence education support for healthy marriages and responsible fatherhood and assistance for the homeless and in resettling refugees how much has congress appropriated for the ccf to date appropriations for the ccf have totaled almost 232 million 299 million fy2002 the funds first year 348

three parts grants to intermediary organizations under demonstration initiative direct awards minigrants to grassroots groups for 1 for related information on the presidents faithbased initiatives see crs report rl32736 charitable choice rules and faithbased organizations by joe richardson 2 these appropriation amounts do not reflect acrosstheboard rescissions in recent years and special additional discretionary cut made by the secretary of health and human services in fy2006 eg 1 650000 rescission and further 44000 discretionary reduction in fy2006 crs3 targeted capacitybuilding initiative and

demonstration initiative this effort offers matching funds for competitive grants to relatively large intermediary organizations that have established relationships with faithbased and community organizations these intermediary organizations are seen as forming bridge between the federal government and grassroots groups funding is aimed at helping small faithbased and community organizations

aid to small faithbased and community organizations and 2 make subawards to faithbased and community organizations for training technical assistance and capacitybuilding eligible groups for
