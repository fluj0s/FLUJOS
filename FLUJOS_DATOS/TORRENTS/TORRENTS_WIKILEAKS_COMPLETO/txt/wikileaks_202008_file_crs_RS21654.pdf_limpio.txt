school 2 in its secondary meaning madrasa is an educational institution offering instruction in islamic subjects including but not limited to the quran the sayings hadith of the prophet muhammad jurisprudence fiqh and law historically madrasas were distinguished as institutions of higher studies and existed in contrast to more rudimentary schools called kuttab that taught only the quran1

nizamiyah was built in baghdad during the eleventh century ad offering food lodging and free education madrasas spread rapidly throughout the muslim world and although thei r curricula varied from place to place it was always religious in character because these schools ultimate ly were intended to prepare future islamic religious scholars ulama for their work in emphasizing classical traditions in arabic linguistics teachers lectured and students learned through rote memorization during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in the era of western colonial rule secular institutions came to supersede religious schools in importance throughout the islamic world however madras as were revitalized in the 1970s with the rising interest in religious studies and is lamist
