reverberate through the body politic within three days of thecourts ruling in engel more than fifty constitutional amendments to override or otherwise limit that decision had been in troduced in congress and during the 88th congress after abington one hundred sixty were offered two decades later in the 98th congress the issue precipitated five ts of hearings in the house and senate an extended senate debate on presiden tial proposal to amend the constitution four committee reports and the enactment of two stat utes relevant to the issue three and half decades after engel the issue was still central part of an ambitious effort in the 105 th congress to alter the supreme court s churchstate jurisprudence by means of constitutional amendment during these three and half decades c ongress has considered several types of legislation in response to the courts school prayer decisions 1 constitutional amendments every congress since engel has witnessed the introduction of numerous proposals to ove rturn or limit the courts decisions and their judicial progeny by amending the constitution the proposals have taken avariety of forms and have been the subject of numerous hearings see appendix i the senate has voted four times on such measures in 1966 1970 and twice in 1984and the house twice in 1971 and 1998 bu t only in the senate vote in 1970 did constitutional amendment garner the twothirds majority necessary for adoption andthat vote was perceived less as vote on school prayer than as vote to kill themeasure to which the school prayer amendment was attached the equal rightsamendment in the 104 th and 105th congresses debate about constitutional amendment on the subject broadened to include the question of whether other aspectsof the courts churchstate jurispruden ce should also be addressed and in the 105 th congress the house voted on such broad based proposal hjres 78 the vote fell substantially short of the twothirds majority necessary for adoption however 2 limitations on fed eral court jurisdiction in every congress from the 93d through the 103d proposals were introduced to strip the federal courts of alljurisdiction over cases

groups in public uni versities have constitutional right to meet in school facilities on the same basis as other studentinitiated groupsthat decision gave rise to congressiona l proposals to ensure studentinitiated religious groups at the high school level the same extracurricular rights andprivileges as nonreligious student groups several hearings were held on thesubject and in 1984 congress enacted into law the equal access act 4 for the text see appendix ii 4 appropriations riders beginning in 1980 efforts were made to attach riders to the appropriations acts for the department of education barring the use of funds to prevent the implementation of programs of voluntary prayer and meditationin the public schools neither the house nor the senate has ever taken recordedvote on the matter but the rider known as the walker amendment has beenincluded in all of the measures funding th department of education since fiscal 1981 efforts to attach the same rider to the appropriations bills for the department of justice for fiscal years 1982 1983 and 1984 and to supplemental appropriations bill for fiscal 1982 failed nd have not been renewed despite favorable recorded votes in both the house and the senate on the first measure 5 funds cutoff proposals since 1984 both the house and the senate have voted periodically on amendments to cut ff federal education funds from any state or local educational agency that prevents individuals from participating in voluntary prayer such proposals have been pproved twice in both the house in 1989 and 1994 and the senate both in 1994 and rejected once in each body in 1984 in thehouse in 1994 in the senate limited version of funds cutoff proposal thekassebaum amendment was enacted into law in 1994 as part of the improving americas schools act of 1994 5 for text see appendix ii in addition congress modified two senatepassed funds cutoff proposals to the goals 2000 educateamerica act in 1994 to bar funds under th act from being used by state or local educational agencies to adopt policies th at prevent voluntary prayer and meditation in public schools 6 6 senseofthecongress resolutions number of resolutions have been introduced since engel that would express congress view on what devotional activities in the public schools remain perm issible under the courts decisions the resolutions have sometimes been perceived as an alternative to constitutionalamendment but they have not won extensiv support the senate rejected two such proposals in 1966 while adopting one in 1994 but the latter proposal was deleted in conferencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96846crs3 7for detailed summary of the supreme courts decisions concerning religious activities in the public schools and comprehens ive narrative overview of the legal standards that govern the conduct of religious activities in the public schools see crs report 93 680 prayer and religion in the public schools what is and is not constitutionally permitted by david m ackerman7 miscellaneous in 1979 the house voted to amend the bill creating the department of education to provide that one of its purposes would be to permit in all public schools daily opportunity for prayer or meditation but theamendment was deleted in conference in 1984 the house voted for an amendment providing generally that state or local educational agency shall denyindividuals the opportunity to participat in moments of silent prayer but the amendment was again deleted in conference in 1994 the house defeated proposalbarring funds in an education bill from be ing used by state and local educational agencies to adopt policies to prevent vol untary prayer and meditation in 1992 the senate rejected resolution urging the supreme court to overturn engel and abington thus the political furor over the school pr ayer issue during the past thirtysix years has not precipitated the adoption of constitutional amendment or theelimination of federal court jurisdiction over the issue but it has led to theenactment of the following four statutory measures 1 requirement that public secondary schools which receive federal financial assistance afford studentinitiated religious philosophical andpolitical groups the same opportunity to meet during the school day as is afforded other studentinitiated extr acurricular groups the equal access act 2 prophylactic rider to the appropriations acts for the department of education added since fiscal 1981 providing that none of the fundsmay be used to prevent the implementation of programs of voluntaryprayer and meditation in the public schools 3 an amendment to the goals 2000 educate america act barring state and local education agencies from using funds under the act toadopt policies that prevent voluntary prayer and meditation in publicschools and 4 an amendment to the impr oving americas schools act of 1994 cutting off federal education funds to any state or local education

later total of fiftyseven constitutional amendments had been introduced the senatejudiciary committee held two days of hearings on the matter 8 but further action was taken 88th congress 196364 on june 17 1963 public opinion on the issue was further aroused by the supreme courts decision in abington school district v schempp supra that decision held unconstitutional government sponsorship of daily readings from thebible and unison recital of the lords pr ayer in the public schools the resulting public furor led to the introduction of one hundred sixty constitutional amendmentsin the house and the senate to overturn engel and abington rep emmanuel celler dny the chairman of the house judiciary committee strongly opposed theamendments and initially chos not to convene any hearings on the matter but record amounts of constituent mail and growing number of signatures on discharge petition on the beck er amendment hjres 9 9 led him to organize and hold 18 days of hearings in april june

foundation the national association of evangelicals project amer ica the american legion etc testified in favor of constitutional amendment but the net effect of the hearings seemed to be to dissipate the public fervor for immediate action and other legislative activity on the matter occurred in the 88th congress 89th congress 196566 the number of constitutional amendments introduced to overturn the courts decisions declined to 55 in the 89th congr ess but the issue came to vote in the senate for the first time on march 22 1966 senator dirksen rill proposed constitutional amendment on prayer sjres 148 and announced his intention tobring the measure to vote sometime during the session the operative section ofhis amendment provided as follows nothing contained in this constitution shall prohibit the authority administering any school school system educational institution or other public buildingsupported in whole or in part through the expenditure of public funds from providing for or permitting the voluntary pa rticipation by students or others in prayer nothing contained in this article shall authorize any such authority toprescribe the form or content of any prayer subcommittee of the senate judiciary committee held six days of hearings on the proposal10 but took further action on september 19 1966 therefore sen dirksen proposed his constitutional amendment as substitute for minor pendingbill designating october 31 of each year as national unicef day senator bayh dind in turn proposed as substitute for the dirksen proposal senseofthe congress resolution

oct 13 1970it is the sense of the congress that 1 notwithstanding the recent supreme court decisions relating to the reading of the bible and the offering of prayer in thepublic schools any public school system if it so chooses may provide time duringthe school day for prayerful meditation if public official prescribes or recitesthe prayer which is offered and 2 providing public school time for prayerfulmeditation in way violates the constitution because each individualparticipating therein would be permitted to pray as he chooses but that such practice is consonant with the free exercise of religion protected by the firstamendment to the constitution after brief debate in which the pr oposal was criticized by both opponents and supporters of the supreme courts decisions the amendment was tabled by voicevote 12 90th congress 196768 in this congress 56 constitutional amendments and 3 senseofthecongress resolutions were proposed but further legislative action occurred 91st congress

abridge the right of persons lawfully assembled in any public building which is supported in whole or in part through the expenditure of public funds to pa rticipate in nondenominational prayer after brief debate the senate added this amendment to the era by vote of 502013 this vote was widely perceived however as vote not solely on the merits of the prayer issue but as part of strategy to so encumber the era with extraneousmatters that its supporters would let it die when the senate also added anamendment to the era exempting women from the draft this strategy wassuccessful thus neither the era nor the amendments added to it went any further in that congress 92nd congress 197172 the number of constitutional amendments proposed on the school prayer issue dropped to 41 in the 92nd congress but the i ssue came to vote in the house for the first time in 1971 the focus of house action was hjres 191 sponsored by rep wylie rohio an amendment identical to the baker amendment that had

report any of the proposed measures on the prayer issue thatwere referred to it the supporters of the wylie amendment resorted to the littleused tactic of discharge petition 14 after an extensive lobbying and grass roots campaign by such groups as the prayer campaign co mmittee the back to god movement and the national association of evangelical s the discharge petition on september 21 1971 obtained the requisite 218 signatures to take the wylie amendment from the judiciary committee and bring it to the floor of the house for vote house rules however prevented the debate and vote from occurring until november 8 197115 giving both proponents and opponents of the wylie bill time to mount intensive lobbying and grass root s campaigns on november 8 the house easily adopted the petition

word voluntary for nondenominational and adding meditationas permissible activity an amendment that its sponsors thought would answerthe primary arguments against the resoluti on and would eliminate the danger that state might prescribe religious activity thus as amended the wylie proposalprovided as follows nothing contained in this constitution sha ll abridge the right of persons lawfully

act or any other act shall be denied to any state or local educational agency because it has adopted constitutional policy relative to prayer in public school103 that amendment the senate also adopted by voice vote104 the house did not have any provisions relating to school prayer in its version of the goals 2000 legislation but prior to the conference on the bill rep duncan rtenn offered motion to

followshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96846crs25 106h conf rept 103446 title x 1011 march 21 1994 the conference report explained the provision as follows students do not shed their right to religious liberty at the schoolhouse gate just as they do not lose other constitutional rights in addition private reflection isvaluable in permitting children to draw strength from their personal values and beliefs so that they are prepared to learn and grow children would do well totake time each day to consider what they hope to accomplish and how their actions will affect themselves and others around them this section promotes these important values by providing that funds made available under this act may not be used to adopt policies designed to prevent students from engaging in constitutionally protected prayer or silent reflectionthe conferees do not intend that this section confer new legal rights instead thesection respects our long tradition of local control over educational decisions while
