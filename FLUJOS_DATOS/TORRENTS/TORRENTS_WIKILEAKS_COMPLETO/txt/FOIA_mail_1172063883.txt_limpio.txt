from kevin trenberth trenbertucaredu to melinda marquis marquisucaredu kristen averyt averytucaredu subject re copyedited ch 3 files date wed 21 feb 2007 081803 0700 cc phil jones pjonesueaacuk martin manning mmanningalnoaagov susan solomon ssolomonalnoaagov hi all i have ftpd the updated cleaned up files from chapter 3 back onto your ftp site the notes accompanying these are attached and are unchanged from yesterday there are two references that may not be quite final these are from global and planetary change and we have dois for them as they are published online but page numbers as they do not seem to have appeared yet in print by the way there was one notable error in the copy editing which was confusion over significance and confidence levels i removed all the references to confidence levels when it was about significance of trends etc i suspect this could affect other chapters though so you may want to check that carefully the main concerns we have are with the figures please see the comments on the figure files and the brief comments in the attached if you would like to make any of these changes kristen or assemble the panels please let know regards kevin phil jones wrote melinda et im happy with the chapter once all the mods mainly to the figures are undertaken i wont get chance this weekend nor the next two days as im away i might have some more time next week but i too have spent about 6 hours on sunday and another 23 hours on monday so kevin can send back the acceptedtracked version of the chapter the captions and appendix 3b on the figures will we get chance to see the chapter mockedup with figures in their final positions and sizes as we would do with journal papers there are number which wed like to check to make sure the colours are ok i think by the way that you have caught all the spellings correctly i noted fall changing to autumn and the doubling up of letters in words like modelling i hear also from keith briffa that ch 6 now spells the word palaeoclimatic although we normally drop the extra even in english journals cheers phil at 2314 20022007 kevin trenberth wrote melinda thanks phil and i have made preliminary pass through the material as kristen is now considering the figures i have attached preliminary list of the problems this also includes some material for you acronyms more detail is given on the full figure file we have left usa as is in the main text but i note that the appendix b was not copy edited and we have left united states there we have accepted most other changes even though i would not do them this way we can send the material back now but i will wait for last check by phil i spent over 12 hours on this over the weekend kevin melinda marquis wrote hi kevin thank you for reviewing your copyedited chapter files thoroughly and promptly ill try to answer each of your questions about the convention for referring to the united states as this document is published under the auspices of the united nations we are required to use official country names the united states of america is to be abbreviated as usa for such publications regarding the lower case antarctica we have capitalized arctic and antarctic when they are nouns and have used lower case arctic and antarctic when they are adjectives we used the ams word list 1httpwwwametsocorgpubsauthorsguidepdf_vsauthguidepdf to supplement our style guide the ams list cites arctic flow adj and arctic circle noun we thought it appropriate to treat antarctic analogously to arctic the adjectival form about suggested revisions that seem pedantic if you feel that inserting the period before things like 1961 to 1990 would decrease clarity or change the meaning from what is intended then you may of course reject such changes thank you for your careful review kristen will be replying to you about the figures please let us know if you have further concerns we want everything to be correct cheers melinda kevin trenberth wrote melinda there appear to be changes that i do not agree with for instance everywhere we had united states it has been changed to usa that is not the practice in ams or agu journals i have also found several instances of antarctic changed to lower case which is surely not right some changes are very pedantic inserting the period before things like 1961 to 1990 kevin melinda marquis wrote dear clas thank you very much for your invaluable assistance during the recent spm plenary meeting as you will realise there are few remaining steps that need to be completed before final completion of the wg1ar4 but these should now be straightforward this is to ask for your help in the next of these steps which is to check the copyedited version of your chapter professional copyeditor has reviewed all chapters of the ar4 and made some revisions in most cases her suggestions implement our style guide see attached for consistency in punctuation spelling grammar and language style across all chapters points at which acronyms are spelled out etc etc in few cases she has suggested revised wording for the sake of clarity improved grammar or such all these changes that might have some effect on the meaning of sentence are shown in trackchanges mode we would be grateful if you would now go through these edited chapter files and either accept reject or modify the copyeditors tracked revisions and return cleaned up files to the tsu during this step you should also make any remaining necessary and minor corrections to text or tables ensure that any corrections or updates provided to the tsu since the distribution of the final draft in october 2006 have been included update references that have been published recently by inserting volume and page numbers etc add any adjustments to your chapter that arose from the spm approval process in paris please return checked file to us with all tracked changes removed please also remember to check your figures and figure captions carefully including the axis labels units used etc annotated text should already have been edited to follow the styles used in the text where appropriate in some cases we will be doing further improvements to the text fonts used in figures but this is your last chance to ensure that the wording is correct in all places if you wish to make any small revisions to figures please contact kristen averyt 2averytucaredu as soon as possible please remember that substantive changes or new references can be made to your chapter at this stage the time line for delivering the cameraready copy to the publisher is quite tight we ask that you please return your final text and figures files to the tsu by friday march 9 you may access your chapter files at the following ftp site server 3ftpjossucaredu account wg1_gnrl password eq0kw0wg please note that these are zeros not letters directory pubar4_copyeditfinalchxx the file names currently
