the types of policies used by the canadian australian and eur opean governments to determine the price of drugs reference pricing price ceilings parallel trade profit sharing and value based pricing it should be noted that th is paper focuses on po licies used for brand name nongeneric pharmaceuticals as th policies are more pertinent to the current debate than those used for ge neric pharmaceuticals generics are less expensive and have more price competiti on than brandname pharmaceuticals and thus have not been the focus of debates in the us medicare pharmaceutical pricing under current law prescription drugs for medicare beneficiaries are provided through prescription drug plans pdps and medicare advantage prescription drug mapd plans unlike mapds which cover the costs of the entire set of medicare benefits parts b and d the pdps onl cover the costs of prescription drugs part d the part d plans have contracts w ith the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms to

10 for more information see hrept 108391 p 461tools arrange network of pharmacies to dispense the drugs and negotiate rebates and drug prices with the pharmaceutical manufacturers8 the success of each individual plans ability to negotiate lower prices has direct impact on the amount enrollees pay enrollees are required to make copayments which is the entire price if the drug is not covered9 and pay premiums that are directly affected by the negotiated drug prices ie the lower the prices paid by the plan the lower the amounts the plan must charge much of beneficiaries satisfaction with their drug plan may be tied to the amount they pay for drugs negotiation as stated before the greatest legal impediment to changing the way medicare drugs are priced is the noninterfere nce provision in mma specifically this provision forbids the secretary of h ealth and human services hhs from negotiating the price of prescription drug s on behalf of medi care beneficiaries section 1860d i of the mma states i n order to promote competition under this part and in carrying out this part the secretary 1 may not interfere with the negotiations between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and pdp sponsors and 2 may not require particular formulary to institute price structure for the reimbursement of cove red part d drugs the conference report adds that conferees expect pdps to negotiate price concessions directly with manufacturers10 most of the policies used by other nations as disc ussed later in this report could not be implemented in the us wit hout repealing this provision repealing the noninterference clause ma lead to changing the drug pricing policy for medicare although not stric tly necessary if congress repeals the provision and allows the secretary of hhs to negotiate drug prices it may also wish to provide some guidance as to what type of drug pricing policy it wants the secretary of hhs to negotiate since the number of different po licies is innumerate examining policies that have been applied in other settings may help in exploring the options in theory the federal government may be able to leverage its market share to negotiate lower prices the extent to which the federal government could negotiate lower prices than the part d drug plans is unknown without this knowledge it is impossible to predict whether new pricin g policy would lead to lower costs for medicare beneficiaries the federal g overnment or other us consumers importantly any new drug pricing policy for medicare may have ripple effects on manufacturers research and development of new pharmaceuticals part d drug planshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33781crs4 11 note that these countries use mixture of pricing mechanisms and reference pricing is only one of the mechanisms used by these c ountries for more information see christine huttin drug price divergence in europe regulatory aspects health affairs vol 18 3 mayjune 1999 p 245249 12 france italy portugal and spain are also among the many european countries that use reference pricing especially in patentexpired products 13 for more information see christine huttin op citrole and ability to compete pharmacies profits as well as other us consumers the size of these ripples will depend upon the type of pricing polic selected and the extent to which the federal government negotiates lower prices other policies examining and understanding the policie s of canada aust ralia and european nations could help to inform the discussi on of drug pricing po licies for the medicare drug benefit these policies are used in ot her nations not just to price drugs but also to determine reimbursement rates and manage utilization like medicare these governments policies affect the prices paid for pharmaceuticals consequently the pharmaceutical pricing policies in these c ountries have noticeable impact upon the pharmaceutical sales revenues similarly any change in drug pricing policies for medicare could have noticeable impact upon total pharmaceutical sales in the us canada australia and european nations use reference pricing price ceilings parallel trade profit sharing or valueba sed pricing policies to mitigate increases in pharmaceutical expenditures due to price increases nations may rely on more than one of these methods and other methods ar typically used to control pharmaceutical utilization moreover these c ountries also use policies currently used by part d drug plans medicaid and other us health pa yers such as price negotiating rebate negotiation and pricevolume discounts reference pricing germany and the netherlands11 are examples of countri in which reference pricing is used for pharmaceuticals12 prices are often deter mined by clustering drugs by class and setting uniform rate for all drugs in the cluster the reimbursement rates are determined throug h crosscountry or jurisdic tion comparisons or within country comparisons of similar therapies the crosscountry comparisons result in regulation prices in one c ountry directly affecting pr ices in another country the drug clusters are controversial because they may ignore differences in safety profiles efficacy and application forms across drugs13 for example manufacturer may argue that its drug is an improvement over others in the same cluster because it causes fewer side effects and can be administered as pill rather than an injection however the value of these improvements ma not be fully captured by pricing drugs in clusters to deal with such nuances new or innovative products may be excluded from clustershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33781crs5 14 canada uses prices in france germany italy sweden switzerland the uk and the united states to establish canadian benchmark pr ices for drug sales for more

medicines pr ices review board pmprb sets the maximum price manufacturers may charge distributors hospitals retail pharmacy chains and others who purchase drugs in canada directly from the manufacturer the price ceiling14 pharmaceutical manufacturers may be fined by the pmprb if they attempt to charge prices higher than the price ceiling canadian purchasers can negotiate prices lower than the price ceiling with manufacturers in the us medicare system the equivalent arrangement would be for the secretary of hhs to ban manufacturers from setting prices higher than the price ceiling and allow the part d drug plans to negotiate prices lower than the price ceiling reimportation parallel trade reselling pharmaceuticals to people in other nations commonly occurs in europe and is termed parallel trade manufacturers can not prevent the movement of pharmaceuticals from one european country to another due to the absence of trade barriers among the countries of the european union us legislation on the issue has used the term reimportation in recognition of the fact that the us is the largest exporter of pharmaceuticals importing pharmaceuticals into the us would be for the most part tantamount to reimporting them reimportation implies importing foreign pharmaceutical prices as well as the products and would allow the us to tac itly use other countries pricing systems it is one of the few pricing policies that would not require repealing the noninterference provision in the mma reimportation of pr escription drugs is currently illegal in the united states the federal food drug nd cosmetic act ffdca15 prohibits anyone from importing prescription drugs into the unite d states unless they are the original manufacturer of the drugs consequently it is illegal for someone to import drug from pharmacy in another country even if the drug was originally manufactured in the united states all drugs sold in the us must be manufactured and packaged for us sale the rationale for prohibitin g reimportation is that the food and drug administration fda can not guarantee the safety of the drug once it has left the agencys regulatory control moreove r the version produced by us drug manufacturers for foreign markets may not meet all of the requirements for us sales and marketing approvalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33781crs6 16 for more details on the legality of

18 2006 19 the risk corridors designed for the medi care part d plans are an example of profit sharing used in the us health care system and limit both the profits and losses of the medicare part d drug plans the plans receiv what is essentially an actuarially based premium for each medicare enrollee that is ba sed on expected cost at the end of the calendar year the cms compares the expected and actual costs of drug plans if the actual costs exceed the expected costs by the pre determined percentage then the plans are partially compensated with add itional federal payments on the other hand if the expected costs exceed the actual costs by the predeterm ined percentage then the plans share these excess profits with the federal government 20 note that the uk uses the term prof it controls rather than profit sharing the mma includes provision that circum vents the ffdca it authorizes the fda to allow drug reimportation from canada if the secretary of hhs certifies that importation of prescription drugs is both safe and costsaving16 the present secretary has chosen not to exercise th is option the provision does not permit drug reimportation from any countries other than canada even if secretary of hhs deems importation to be safe and costsaving and allows reimportation from canada medicare benefici aries may encounter drug supply limits while the mma provi sion was being discussed in 2003 pharmaceutical manufacturers announced th at they would respond to any law permitting reimportation by limiting the suppl of drugs available to canadian distributors and pharmacies17 profit sharing another drug pricing method that may be used by payers is profit sharing whereby manufacturers share all or part of the profits that are predetermined to be in excess this type of pricing thod operates well in systems where pharmaceutical manufacturers can accurately ascertain what portion of the profits are derived from the payer in question the rgest challenge in pr ofitsharing schemes is defining the appropriate profit limit one example of profit sharing is the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme pprs18 in the united kingdom uk19 the pprs regulates the pharmaceutical pr ices and profits of branded non generic drugs in the uk for the national health service nhs20 price and profithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33781crs7 21 the latest scheme of prices came into effect in january 2005 22 individual manufacturers can choose whether or not to participate in the negotiated scheme but nonparticipants do not have their drugs covered by nhs the uk system does not dictate the manufacturer s drug prices rather pha rmaceutical manufacturers can set any price for their product at the beginning of scheme term but the uk department of health must agree to any price increases during the term 23 for the current scheme the allowable returnoncapital is 21 year 24 the current scheme specifies that any ma nufacturer with total nhs sales less than 5 million per year is not required to provide financial information any manufacturer with total nhs sales between 5 and 25 million per year is required to provide copy of its audited accounts which provides the breakdown of nhs and nonnhs sales manufacturers with sales for the nhs in excess of 25 million are required to submit to the department of health all data on sales costs assets and profitability 25 costeffectiveness is typically assessed by dividing the additional dollars drug costs by the additional quality adjusted life years qalys drug provides to arrive at qaly ratio 26 costbenefit is assessed by first determinin g the monetary value of the benefits gained from the drug and then subtracting the co sts of the drug from the benefits 27 for more information see james c r obinson

are arrived at through negotiations every five years21 between the pharmaceutical industry represented by the association of the br itish pharmaceutical industry and the uk department of health22 the profitsharing scheme specifies that any profits in excess of the agreed upon returnoncapital threshold23 must either be repaid to nhs or the company must lower existing and future prices this type of profit sharing provides strong incentiv for manufacturers to set their prices so that profits do not exceed the returnoncapital threshold to help enforce the return oncapital limits the current scheme creates tiered system of profit reporting and financial transpar ency requirements24 valuebased pricing valuebased pricing sets drug prices using relative value metric where each drug is compared to other drugs to asse ss whether the improve d safety profile or efficacy is worth the additiona l cost costeffectiveness25 and costbenefit26 analysis are both examples of relative value metrics while valuebased pricing is not traditionally used in other countries as method of pricing drug s and instead has greater role in formulary velopment the term valueb ased pricing is nonetheless used in this report so as to be consistent with other papers and reports on the topic other reports and academics in particular have suggested valuebased pricing as way for manufacturers specifically bi otechnology companies to price their products27 countries have primarily used va luebased pricing in conjunction with other pricing methods yet in theory this method coul d also operate singly and be used by governments to establish drug prices httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33781crs8 28 the recommendations can be found in marthe r gold et costeffectiveness in health and medicine oxford university press

way to determine the status of drug ie preferred restri cted use excluded in the countrys health coverage and reimbur sement scheme drug prices are typically set prior to evaluating drugs status on formulary but in theory prices also could be set using valuebased pricing discussions of valuebased pr icing have been raised in the us with particular regard to pric ing of biotec hnology pr oducts such as the 50000 costs per patient per ear for new cancer products the crux of the problem with this met hod is that the definition of value can be subjective it requires establishing how much the payer will pay for improvements in health and drug safety profiles valueba sed pricing also requires defining an appropriate comparison drug cancer dr ug that costs 35000 per patient per year would appear to be bargain if compar ed to the drugs costing 50000 per patient per year would this be an appropriat comparison how many additional years of life would the 50000 drug need to provi in order to justify its cost the us public health service convene d panel of experts in 1993 to provide recommendations for conducting costeffec tiveness analyses and assessing the value of new medical tec hnologies including drugs28 the panel of experts included physicians economists philos ophers as well as other prominent researchers the panel provided good guidance on what shoul d and should not be included in costeffectiveness analyses but only suggested an appropriate amount to pay for improvements in health and drug safety profiles they also left the door open for researchers to use any drug or other medical technol ogy as the comparison drug the recommendations from the panel set the standard for highquality academic research in the costeffectiveness of medical technologies and with only minor revisions the same standards ar used today 14 years later despite its prolific use in the academic literature co steffectiveness analysis nd other valuebased decision tools have struggled to gain strong foothold as tool for drug coverage and reimbursement decision making in us government programs29 part of the struggle to use valuebased decision tools in this manner stems from the difficulties in defining value and appropr iate comparison groups australia addressed this challenge of defining the appropriate comparison drug by allowing pharmaceutical manufacturers to select the comparison drug specifically manufacturer that wishes to list its drug on the australiahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33781crs9 30 for more details on pbs see australian gove rnment department of health and

but nice has not defined strict cutoff ratio for distinguishing drugs that add valu from those that do not instead nice recommendations use costeffectiveness as one factor in their recommendations even though nice recommendations weigh the drug costs compared to the benefits the recommendations do not explicitly f actor in affordability and nhs budget constraints thus drug costing 50000 may receive positive nice recommendation if it provide s enough benefit to pr oduce favorable ratio the explicit separation between nhs budget constraints and nice recommendations may partially explain the less authoritative role nice has in the uk compared to the role pbs has in australia in contrast to the pbs nice only recommends and does not determine whet her the treatments should be included in the nhs formulary regardless of the nice recommendation treatments can not be denied to uk patients who are shown to n eed them one of the goals noted by the uk pprs is to promote the uptake of
