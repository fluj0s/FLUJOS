sources in the 109th congress thr ee pairs of bills have been introduced to repeal the existing import restrictions and provide for limited forms of importation of prescription drugs current law and the bills all seek to balance the availability of imported prescription drugs both for commercial and personal use and the assurance that those imports would be safe and effective an underlying goal

ation act of 2003 mma p l 108173 effectively do not allow the commercial or personal use importation of prescription drugs congress with the mma continued the major legal obstacle to importation the requirement that the secretary of health and human services first certify that imports are safe and offer cost savings to us consumers something secretary has been willing to do this report which will be updated briefly discu sses major differences among current law and the introduced bills and presents sidebyside comparison of their provisions the bills are the ph armaceutical market access act of 2005 s 109 hr 328 the safe importation of medical products and other rx therapies act of 2005 the safe import act of 2005 s 184 hr 753 and the pharmaceutical market access and drug safety act of 2005 s 334 hr 700 although all three pairs of bills seek to make lowerpriced prescription drugs available to us consumers by allowing importation while also ensuring that the drugs are safe and effective they take different approaches the proposed bills use extensive registration licensing facility inspection and records requirements to document an imported shipments chainofc ustody requirements rather than the mmas use of mandated laborat ory testing of imported drug s to verify their content potency and labeling current law and the bills each have different lists of countries from which imports could be imported and they provide th secretary with different time frames and criteria for determining whether to permit commercial or personal use importation secretarial reporting requirements vary as do mechanisms to fund the import activities curre nt law relies on ppropriations alone while the proposed bills each create specific use rfee provisions the proposed bills also address the regulation of internet pharmacies s 109hr 328 and s 334hr 700 propose links to patent law to influence industry behavior while current law does not specify when importation could begin s 109h r 328 requires regulations to allow personaluse and commercial imports 180 days after enactment s 184hr 753 provides for personaluse imports at actment and commercial imports one year later s

109th congress three pairs of bills have been introduced to repeal the existing import restrictions and provide for limited forms of importation of prescription drugs current law and the bills all seek to balance the availability of imported prescription drugs both for commercial and personal use and the assurance that those imports would be safe and eff ective an underlying goal is to reduce or restrain the growth of the financial burden that pr escription drugs place on us consumers current law bars importation unless the s ecretary of health and human services hhs certifies that imports are safe and offers cost savings to us consumers congress reaffirmed this requirement first established by the medicine equity and drug safety meds act of 2000 most r ecently in the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act mma pl 108173 in december 2003 the three bill pairs each would eliminate this requirement and inst ead include other potential safeguards regardin g drug safety and effectiveness they all would act primarily by replacing or amending s ection 804 of the federal food drug and cosmetic act ffdca which had been initially added to the ffdca by the

dorganemerson bills in july 2005 senator dorgan successfully offe red the drug importation provisions as an amendment to the federal trade commission reauthorization bill s 1392 ordered to be repo

attempts to influence industry behavior so drugs are available for impor t by us consumers at cost savings to current domestic prices and administrative arrangements safe and effective drugs relationship to fda approval current law and language proposed by the vittergutknecht and greggbradley bills explicitly require that an imported drug be approved for us sale by the fda the dorganemerson bills would allow different administrative requirements for importation while maintaining the substantive elements of fda approval the dorganemerson bills require that manufacturer notify the hhs secretary when drug that could be imported differs from the version fda had approved for sale in the united states the us label drug the bills require extensive information about whether the difference if it were to be made to us bel drug would require supplemental application to fda and whether fda would require that the application be processed before the drug could be marketedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33175crs3 3 in one of the very few differences between s 109 and hr 328 the gutknecht bill restricts european union members to t hose included as of dec 31 2003permitted countries the three bills and current law vary in the countries from which they would permit drug importation the most in clusive are the vittergutknecht bills3 which include australia canada israel japan new zealand switzerland south africa members of the european union iceland liechtenstein and norway these bills also would allow the secretar to designate additional count ries that have equivalent regulatory requirements regard ing safety and effectivene ss or to remove country that does not the dorganemerson bills differ from the vittergutknecht bills by excluding israel south africa and members of the european economic area that are not also members of the european union excluded are iceland liechtenstein and norway and for european union countries by adding reference to their annex to the treaty of accession that essentia lly disqualifies the 10 countries admitted to membership in may 2004 excluded are cypr us the czech republic estonia latvia lithuania hungary malta poland slovenia and the sl ovak republic the gregg bradley bills would include canada and allow the secretary three years after enactment to designate as eligible any members of the european union as of december 2003 current law includes only ca although it allows the secretary to grant waivers permittin g personaluse importati on from other countries ensuring drug identity sponsors of all three pairs of bills are concerned about the potential for entry of adulterated or counte rfeit drugs into the us market consequently they call for variety of procedures covering the re gistration of exporters or importers chainofcustody documentation inspections of manufacturing storage and shipping facilities laboratory testing of drug samp packaging and labeling of shipping containers and c onsumer products registration current law requires that canadian establishment involved in importing prescription drugs to the united states register its name and place of business and the name of its us agent with the secretary all three bills have extensive registration requirements th specifics vary and cover extensive recordkeeping monitoring inspections and fees the vittergutknecht bills would require all exporters to register the greggbradley and dorganemerson bills require all exporters and all commercial importers to register monitoring inspecting and testing while current law relies on laboratory testing of samples of every ship ment of imported drugs to verify their content potency and labeling the three proposed bills focus on documentation of monitored uninterrupted chain of custody from manufacturing facility to importer the requirements related to registra tion involve ongoing and onsite physical monitoring of the facilities of drugs ma nufacturer exporter or importer if the secretary determines it necessary these would include the inspection of any facility and its records that handles the product along the chain of custodyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33175crs4 packaging and labeling in addressing c ounterfeiting and product tampering all three bills promote meas ures intended to ensure that the drug dispensed to the individual consumer is th same product that wa s tested monitored or inspected at the manufacturing shipping or storage facility the vittergutknecht bills would require that the packaging of all prescription drugs not just those being imported incorporate overt optically variable counterfe itresistant technologies that provide visible identification of the product and be similar to those used to secure us currency in addition manufacturer s must incorporate the technologies into multiple elements of the packaging including blister packs shrink wrap package labels package seals bottles and boxes also shipping containers of prescription drugs must have labels that incorporate technologies that enable inspectors to verify the authenticity of the shipment the greggbradley bills would direct the secretary to require the use of elect ronic trackandtrace technology at the case and pallet level that would identify each sale purchase or trade of each case or pallet the dorganemerson bills require that the exporter and importer agree to mark each shipping container to identify its compliance with all registration conditions the markings must include anti counterfeiting or trackandtr ace technology taking into account their economic and technical feasib ility and must be designed to prevent unauthorized affixation internet pharmacies current law does not address use of the internet to sell or purchase imported prescription drugs the vittergutknecht bills have provisions specifically related to internet pharmacy procedures but include qualified internet pharmacies among other registered exporters and the extensive associated requirements the greggbradley and dorganemerson bills do address internet sales their provisions ddress registration posted info rmation prescriptions and relationship to medical care the greggbradley bills present an extensive statutory and regulatory structure for internet pharmacies placing it in the ffdca but set apart from the importation sections in addition to registration the bills would require th at internet pharmacies provide specific professional services in cluding confidential patient medication profiles interactive and meaningful c onsultation by licensed pharmacist and verification of prescription validity th ey require advance notice of commercial shipments of prescription drug s and include licensing fee providers of interactive computer services would be liable if they accept advertising for prescription drug from an unlicensed internet pharmacy or accept advertising stating that physicians prescription is not needed to obtain prescription drug the greggbradley bills also require policies and procedur to prevent payments for unlawful internet pharmacy requests the dorganemerson bills would require that detailed information be accessible on the internet site covering pharmacist credentials address and telephone contacts and the name and professiona l licensure

cost savings to us consumers impetus to amend current law goes bey ond the concern with drug safety even were the secretary to issue the certification necessary to begin the drug importation section in the ffdca many analysts and members of congress anticipate manufacturer resistance the vittergutknecht and dorganemerson bills contain specific provisions designed to influence industry behavi or the greggbradley bills do not discrimination and unfair acts the vittergutknecht bills and the dorganemerson bills would make it unlawful for manufacturer directly or i ndirectly including being party to licensing or other agreement to discr iminate or act unfairly against an exporter importer or person who distributes sells or uses an imported prescription drug by charging higher price denying restrictin g or delaying supplies or refusing to do business drug differences the vittergutknecht and dorganemerson bills would make it unlawful for manufacturer to make drug for distributi on in permitted country so that it differs from the drug made for us distribution for the purpose of re stricting importation of the drug provisions describe i nvolvement of the federal trade commission and the state attorneys general the extensive notification requirements in the dorganemerson bills regarding differences between drug manufacturer produces for sale in permitted country and the dr ug it produces for us distribution could serve in addition to addressing sa fety to influence industry decisions patent law the vittergutknecht and dorganemerson bills would insert new subsection in the patent and trademark act that would reverse judicial precedent holding that sales of patented goods out side the united states do not exhaust the us patent under this provision goods that were the s ubject of authorized foreign sales by the us patent holder may be im ported into the united states without regard to the us patent administration of importation provisions the timing and funding of importation activ ities vary across current law and the proposed bills funding current law includes explicit funding mechanism other than authorizing appropriations of such sums as necessa ry to implement the prescription drughttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33175crs6 importation provisions the vittergutknecht bills would not only authorize appropriations but also provide for exporter fees to cover the cost of administering the import provisions the greggbradley and dorganemerson bills provide for both exporter and commercial importer fees designed to cover all costs of the program all three bills link the aggregate total of all fees to the estimated costs of the importation program setting limit of 1 of the total price of drugs imported the secretary would collect fro m each exporter and importer except in the vitter gutknecht bills both flat registration f ee and proportional registration fee each individual importer or exporter would pay the latter fee base d on the extent of its own activity and calculated to timate its proportion of the aggregate amount the bills would require that these fees be used onl for the administration of the importation provisions that the bills would add effective dates current law does not specify when impor tation could begin other than linking it to the required safety and cost certification by the secretary it directs the secretary to exercise discretion to permit importation by an individual for personal use if it does not appear to present an unreasonable ri sk to the individual the three proposed bills stipulate various time frames for commercial and personaluse importation with varying times for different countries the vittergutknecht bills would require that the hhs secretary in consultation with the united states trade representative and the commissioner of customs issue regulations not later than 180 days after enactment permitting pharmacists pharmacies wholesalers nd individuals to import qualifying drugs from permitted countries the greggbrad ley bills section on personal importation would take effect on the date of actment and their section on commercial importation would take effect one year after enactment both without regard to whether the secretary has promulgate d regulations the dorganemerson bills would require that the secretary promulgate final rule for implementing the importation provisions not later than one year after promulgating an interim rule it also states that the importation provisions shall permit the importation of qualifying drugs without regard to the status of the issuance of implementing regulations from registered exporters 90 days after enactment and from pe rmitted countries by registered importers one year after enactment sidebyside comparison the
