ding priorities in appropriations bills on the house floor is through offset amendments house offset amendments generally change spending priorities in pending appropriations measure by increasing spending for certain activities or creating spending for new activities not included in the bill and offsetting the increase with funding decreases in other activities in the bill offset amendments are needed to avoid the congressional budget act 302f and 311a points of order enforcing certain spending ceilings there are two types of house offset amendments considered in the committee of the whole house on the state of the union committee of the whole clause 2f and reachback or fetchback amendments as provided under house rule xxi clause 2f offset amendments consist of two or more amendments considered together or bloc that would change amounts by directly adding text or changing text in the body of the bill taken as whole the amendment does not increase the amount of funding in the pending bill such amendments 1 must provide offsets in both new budget authority and outlays 2 may contain certain unauthorized appropriations 3 can not add new appropriatio ns or spending set asides and 4 must not contain legislation reachback offset amendments are generally offered at the end of the bill and change funding amounts in the pending bill by reference these amendment 1 must provide offsets in new budget authority but not necessarily offsets 2 can not include unauthorized appropriations 3 may add new appropriations and spending set asides 4 can not contain legislation and 5 may provide acrosstheboard spending reductions as offsets parliamentary rules governing consideration of offset amendments may be suspended or waived typically by house adoption of special rule but also by unanimous consent the significant advantages of clause 2f amendments over reachback amendments is that clause 2f amendments may contain certain unauthorized appropriations and are typically considered before reachback amendments sometimes limiting offset opportunities for reachback amendments the main advantages of reachback amendments are they may add new appropriations and include acrosstheboard spending reductions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31055g10g152g158g156g142g561g17g143g143g156g142g157g561g3 g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g156g561g157g152g561

common methods for redistributing spending priorities in appropriations bills on the house floor is through offset amendments house offset amendments generally change spending priorities in pending appropriations measure by increasing spending for certain activities or creating spending for new activities not included in the bill and offsetting the increases by decreasing or striking funding for other activities in the bill for example an amendment increasing funding for one agency funded in the bill by 3 million and decreasing funding for another agency by the same amount in the same bill would be an offset amendment 1 these amendments may transfer funds between two activities or among several activities in addition certain offset amendments may reduce funding with acrosstheboard spending reductions representatives use offset amendments for variety of reasons three are to 1 ensure that proposals increasing funding for certain activities in an appropriations bill do not violate parliamentary rules enforcing certain spending ceilings2 2 garner support for efforts to reduce funding for certain activities by transferring those funds to popular programs and 3 provide focal point for discussion of particular issue this report is an introduction to selected house rules and practices governing the consideration of offset amendments to appropriations measures considered in the committee of the whole house on the state of the union or committee of the whole3 issues analyzed below are spending ceilings and offset amendments two types of offset amendments clause 2f and

the upcoming fiscal year once these figures are finalized the new budget authority and outlays are allocated among the house committees with jurisdiction over spending and each committee is given specific spending ceilings referred to as the 302a allocations 5 the house appropriations committee receives separate allocations for discretionary and mandatory spending6 and in turn subdivides their 302a allocations among their 12 appropriations subcommittee7 providing each subcommittee with their spending ceilings 302b allocations in the case of the appropriations committee these allocations are only established for the upcoming fiscal year because appropriations measures are annual two congressional budget act points of order 302f and 311a points of order enforce selected spending ceilings8 first the 302f point of order prohibits in part floor consideration of any appropriations measure and related amendments9 providing new budget authority for the upcoming fiscal year that would cause the applicab 302a or 302b allocations of new budget authority for that fiscal year to be exceeded in effect the application of this point of order on appropriations legislation is generally limited to discretionary spending if for example the 302b allocation in new discretionary budget authority fiscal year is 24 billion and the reported bill would provide the same amount for the same fiscal year any amendment proposing an increase in new discretionary budget authority for activities in the bill or creating new discretionary budget authority would violate the 302f point of order an offset amendment however that also includes commensurate decrease in new discretionary budget authority for activities in the bill would not violate the rule the second rule the 311a point of order prohibits in part floor consideration of any appropriations measure and related amendments providing new budget authority for the upcoming fiscal year that would cause the applicable total budget authority and outlay ceilings in the budget resolution for that fiscal year to be exceeded 10 as the amounts of all the spending 4 budget authority does not represent cash provided to or reserved for agencies instead the term refers to authority provided by federal law to enter into contracts or other financial obligations that will result in immediate or future expenditures or outlays involving federal government funds most appropriations are form of budget authority that also provide legal authority to make the subsequent payments from the treasury 5 the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 congressional budget act 2 usc 621 et seq established this process the terms 302a and 302b allocations refer to sections 302a and 302b of the act 6 congress divides spending into two categories discretionary and mandatory or direct spending discretionary spending is controlled by annual appropriations acts which are under the jurisdiction of the house and senate committees on appropriations mandatory spending is controlled by legislative acts under the jurisdiction of the authorizing committees principally the house committee on ways and means and senate committee on finance all discretionary spending and some mandatory spending are included in the annual appropriations measures for more information see crs report 97684 the congressional appropriations process an introduction by sandy streeter 7 each house appropriations subcommitt ee has jurisdiction over single regular appropriations bill there are three major types of appropriations measures regular appropriations bills supplemental appropriations measures or supplementals and continuing resolutions of the three types regular appropriations bills generally provide most of the funding either as separate acts or in omnibus acts supplemental appropriations measures or supplementals generally increase funding for selected activities previously funded in the regular bills although r ecently s upplementals have provided funds for the wars in iraq and afghanistan continuing resolutions extend funding for agencies if any regular appropriations bill does not become law by the oc tober 1 deadline the house typically agrees to prohibit amendments to continuing resolutions 8 the 302f and 311a points of order refer to sections 302f and 311a of the congressional budget act 9 both the 302f and 311a rules also apply to conference reports to appropriations measures 10 this rule exempts in part appropriations measures and related amendments that would not cause the 302a allocation to be exceeded referred to as the fazio exception httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31055g10g152g158g156g142g561g17g143g143g156g142g157g561g3 g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g156g561g157g152g561

reach or exceed these ceilings this point of order would typically affect the last spending bills to be considered such as supplemental appropriations measures or the last regular appropriations bills if representative raises point of order that an amendment violates either rule and the presiding officer sustains the point of order the amendment falls appropriations measures considered on the house floor are typically at or just below the level of the subcommittees 302b allocation and in some cases the committees 302a allocation and the total spending ceiling as well as result amendments that would increase new budget authority in an appropriations measure must typically include offsets g3g153g153g155g152g153g155g146g138g157g146g152g151g156g561g15g142g138g156g158g155g142g156g497g561g21g142g149g142g140g157g142g141g561g5g152g151g157g142g151g157g561 the structure of appropriations measures has direct impact on the form of offset amendments regular appropriations bills and supplementals generally include several lumpsum and lineitem appropriations so that adding new appropriati on or increasing funding for an appropriation in the bill typically requires an offset the procedural necessity of an offset for funding set asides within lumpsum appropriation is dependent on the structure of the appropriation in the bill g14g158g150g153g556g21g158g150g561g138g151g141g561g14g146g151g142g556g11g157g142g150g561g3g153g153g155g152g153g155g146g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 regular appropriations bills and supplemental appropriations measures generally contain numerous unnumbered paragraphs most paragraphs provide lumpsum amount usually an appropriation for similar programs projects or activities such paragraphs are referred to as lumpsum appropriations few paragraphs provide an appropriation for single program or project referred to as line item appropriation 11 most appropriations correspond to unique budget account the total net spending levels provided in an appropriations bill includes all lumpsum and line item appropriations provisions cancelling previously enacted budget authority as well as other provisions affecting spending appropriations bills considered on the house floor are typically near or at the level of the subcommittees 302b allocation an amendment increasing lump sum appropriation or adding new appropriation th erefore could increase the amount of funding in the bill causing it to exceed this limit so that it typically requires an offset g8g158g151g141g146g151g144g561g21g142g157g561g3g156g146g141g142g156g561 within lumpsum appropriation separate amounts are sometimes included in the bill that set aside spending for specified programs projects or activities for purposes of this report they are referred to as funding set asides congressional earmarks or congressionally directed spending items included in appropriations bills are typically funding set asides12 11 each large agency whether under department or independent are typically funded by several appropriations all programs projects and activities under small agency may be funded with single lumpsum appropriation 12 for more information on congressional earmarks see crs report rl34462 house and senate procedural rules concerning earmark disclosure by sandy

lumpsum appropriation that has been entirely set aside in the bill would procedurally require commensurate offset in the example below the three set asides total 200000000 which is the total lumpsum amount an amendment proposing an increase in any of the three set asides that does not include an offset in one of the other set asides would require an increase of the lumpsum amount for necessary expenses including salaries and related expenses of the executive office for yyy to implement program activities 200000000 of which 100000000 is for the yellow program 50000000 for the green program and 50000000 for the blue program by contrast certain set aside amendments would not increase lumpsum amounts if bill contains lumpsum amount with set asides for example an amendment designating part or all of the funds for particular purpose would not increase spending in cases in which the lump sum appropriation includes set asides that does not affect the entire amount an amendment setting aside only the remaining funds or tion of those funds would also not increase spending if enacted the effect of either case would be reductions in funding for activities that was not set aside in order to accommodate funding in the bill that was specified as set asides to avoid such reductions amendments may include offsets from other appropriations in the bill

offset amendments consist of two or more amendments considered together or bloc14 that would change amounts by directly adding text or changing text in the body of the bill as opposed to reachback offset amendments which are generally offered at the end of the bill that change funding amounts by reference the clause 2f offset amendment transfers funds among appropriations or activities in the

the house floor are typically at or just below the 302b allocations an example of clause 2f offset amendment follows this amendment would have decreased the lumpsum appropriation for the bureau of the census periodic censuses and programs account by 10 million increased the lumpsum appropriation for the office of justice programs state and local law enforcement assistance account by 10 million and increased set aside within the latter appropriation for southwest border prosecutor initiative by the same amount page 6 line 23 after the dollar amount insert reduced by 10000000 page 42 line 8 after the dollar amount insert increased by 10000000 page 43 line 8 after the dollar amount insert increased by 10000000 15 these offset amendments typically change spending level by inserting after the amount parenthetic increase or decrease see example above under house rules an amendment generally cannot amend text previously amended16 changing monetary figure by parenthetic increase or decrease placed after the amount text rather than changing the amount text however is allowed 17 under house rules clause 2f offset amendments must be offered when the first portion of the bill to be amended is pending but the committ ee of the whole may waive this requirement by unanimous consent18 in committee of the whole appropriations bills are generally read for amendment sequentially by paragraph after the reading clerk reads or designates paragraph the presiding officer entertains points of order against that paragraph and then members propose amendments to it after the clerk has designated or begun reading the next paragraph amendments to the former paragraph are not in order 19 prior to consideration of proposed clause 2f offset amendment the presiding officer asks if any member wants to raise point of order agai nst any provision the bloc amendment would change if point of order against such provisi on is sustained the provision is stricken from the bill and is longer amendable therefore the offset amendment would fall as well unless appropriately modified or am ended by unanimous consent four additional procedural requirements regarding clause 2f offset amendments are discussed below 15 rep capito remarks in the house congressional record daily edition vol 153 july 25 2007 p h8435 the amendment was offered to the fy2008 commerce justice and science appropriations

rule xxi clause 2a generally prohibi ts unauthorized appropriations in certain committeereported appropriations bills and amendments to such bills25 certain amendments such as clause 2f offset amendments however may increase the level of funding for certain unauthorized appropriations already in the bill under clause 2a legislation must generally be enacted authorizing subsequent appropriations for program or an agency account project or activity before appropriations for that program can be considered on the house floor an authorization for program may be derived from specific law providing authority for that particular program or from more general existing law organic lawauthorizing appropriations for such programs26 the rule prohibits floor consideration of appropriations for program whose authorization has expired or was never authorized or whose budget authority exceeds the ceiling authorized appropriations violating these restrictions are unauthorized appropriations 27 while this prohibition applies to general appropriations bills regular appropriations bills and supplemental appropriations measures which provide funds for more than one purpose or agency it does not apply to continuing resolutions28 appropriations bills frequently include unauthori zed appropriations such appropriations are allowed to remain in an appropriations bill when the house adopts special rule waiving points of order against the appropriation or less frequently when one raises point of order against it29 under house precedents germane amendment that merely perfects an unauthorized appropriation permitted to remain in the bill is allowed30 an example would be an amendment that would only increase the unauthorized amount and would do it by either amending the amount text or by inserting parenthetical increase after the amount such as an bloc clause 2f offset amendment would could be allowed scenario providing the stages of action 1 an authorization act provided an authorization of appropriations of 2 million for program yellow through fy2008 as of the close of fy2008 the authorization had expired 2 subsequently an fy2009 regular appropriations bill

by the 302f and 311a points of order as well as by house rule xxi clause 2f clause 2f amendment may not propose to increase an authorized appropriation in an appropriations bill beyond the authorized level in the scenario above for example the authorization act included 2 million authorization for fy2009 and the regular appropriations bill provided the full amount an offset amendment increasing

ization law provides an agency head with the authority to allocate funds within particular lumpsum appropriation an amendment proposing new set aside would alter the agency heads authority and would be out of order where new set aside would violate the rules an amendment sponsor frequently does not include the set aside in the amendment instead the sponsor discusses it during debate on the amendment this approach is used to avoid the point of order against the amendment during conference on the bill the amendment sponsor may urge the conf erees to include the set aside in the conference report or accompanying joint explanatory statement

clause 2f offset amendments reachback amendments may not increase unauthorized appropriations permitted to remain in the bill since they do not change the text of the bill the section added by reachback amendment is considered adding further unauthorized appropriation as opposed to merely perfecting the text40

under house rule xvi clause 541 member may demand separate consideration of two or more individual portions of an amendment if each portion identified when standing alone is separate substantive proposition and is grammatically separate so that if one proposition is rejected separate proposition will logically remain because reachback amendments are potentially subject to demand for division

these rules typically by house adoption of special rule however this approach has been used infrequently there are certain procedural advantages of clause 2f amendments over reachback amendments as

generally three limited opportunities to suspend or waive the rules governing consideration of an offset amendment 1 if one raises point of order the rules would implicitly be waived 2 if the house adopts special rule explicitly waiving points of order against the amendment or 3 if the house agrees by unanimous consent to waive the rules otherwise if the presiding officer sustains point of order against an amendment for violating the parliamentary rules previously discussed the amendment falls first house rules are not generally selfenforcing representative must raise point of order that an amendment violates specific rule if one opposes an amendment point of order does not have to be raised second under current practice the house committee on rules usually reports special rule setting additional procedural parameters for the consideration of appropriations measures the house typically adopts the special rule and then considers the particular appropriations measure pursuant to it as well as any subsequent unanimous consent agreement 42 if an offset amendment would violate one or more parliamentary rules the sponsor may ask the rules committee to include waiver protecting the amendment from the points of order while special rules generally do not provide special protection for offset amendments to regular appropriations bills they have sometimes protected those to supplemental appropriations measures the rationale for protecting clause 2f amendments is that the opportunity to offer 42 see crs report rs22711 considering regular appropriations bills on the house

g343g345g561offset amendments is otherwise extremely limited the 302f point of order requires that funding increases and offsets are under the same subcommittee clause 2f amendments and generally reachback amendments must include offsets fr om the pending bill supplementals may not include funding for accounts in each subcommittee or most subcommittees furthermore they often include limited number of accounts under subcommittees included as result there are relatively few offset opportunities third member might ask to consider an amendment violating the rules by unanimous consent single member however can prevent such consideration by simply objecting to the unanimous consent request in order to attain their policy objectives sponsors of controversial offset amendments generally select either clause 2f or reachback amendment and work within the rules governing their consideration

unauthorized appropriations generally the house rules committee reports special rule adopted by the house waiving the prohibition against unauthorized appropriations for most or all unauthorized appropriations in reported bill clause 2f amendments can increase those unauthorized appropriations allowed to remain reachback amendments however can only increase authorized appropriations in the bill to their authorized level if there is one in some cases entire bills or significant portions of bills have consisted of unauthorized appropriations as result reachback amendments could not increase those amounts for example many of the lumpsum appropriations provided in the committeereported regular defense appropriations bills have typically been unauthorized because of the timing of consideration of the annual defense authorization bill the house has adopted special rules regarding each bill waiving the application of house rule xxi clause 2 as result clause 2f amendments to those bills were in order while reachback amendments were limited to the few if any authorized appropriations g5g152g151g156g146g141g142g155g142g141g561g7g138g155g149g146g142g155g561 the timing of clause 2f amendments is sometimes an advantage over reachback amendments since clause 2f amendments are offered earlier in bills consideration by the time reachback amendments are considered there may be fewer politically appealing offset options available amendments including clause 2f amendments may have already been adopted that reduced the account reachback amendment sponsor selected for
