participation and representation in elective office kevin coleman analyst in american national government government and finance division summary as one of the fastest growing segments of the population asian pacific americans apas have seemed to be on the verge of greater political activity as yet the steep increase in the asian pacific american population during the last 35 years has not resulted in corresponding increase in the level of political participation voter turnout for asian pacific americans apas has lagged behind that of whites and blacks while asian pacific american and hispanic turnout rates are similar 45 for hispanics in the 2000 election compared with 43 for asian pacific americans data for 2004 are not yet available from the census bureau asian immigration to the united states began in the 1840s and continued throughout the settlement of western and pacific coast states most early immigrants were chinese laborers whose destinations were the railroads and the mining camps that transformed the western frontier but restrictive immigration policies and native hostility toward asian workers sometimes erupting into riots followed the settlement period resulting in self segregation and the formation of chinatowns in many cities the adoption of the chinese exclusion act in 1882 which barred entry to contract laborers for 10 years 22 stat 58 and the gentlemens agreement with japan in 1908 whereby japan agreed to withhold passports from laborers bound for the us virtually closed off immigration from asia new immigration laws were adopted in 1952 and 1965 that modified earlier restrictions on immigration from asia the mccarranwalter act of 1952 66 stat 163 eased some restrictions on gaining citizenship and abolished the category called alien ineligible for citizenship which applied to many immigrants from asia in 1965 the immigration and nationality act 79 stat 911 was amended to eliminate the national quota system and establish new limits of approximately 20000 immigrants from each asian country after that renewed flow of immigrants began arriving from asian countries whereas most earlier asian immigrants arrived from china and japan the 1965 changes to immigration laws resulted in sharp increase in the number of congressional research service the library of congress crs2 immigrants from india korea the philippines vietnam

foundation 1993 pp 2526 because the study of asian pacific american electoral involvement is recent phenomenon little is known about apa political participation historically asian immigrants were subject to official and unofficial hostility after they began arriving in the 1840s antiasian immigration laws discrimination and mob violence barriers to citizenship and the internment of japanese americans during world war ii such attitudes may have discouraged political activity but the social and political dynamic has changed within the asian pacific american population due in part to recent immigration patterns in 1960 asian pacific americans numbered 900000 006 of the total population by 2000 the apa population exceeded eleven million 42 of the population making it one of the fastestgrowing populations in the country because of this dramatic change in the size and composition of the population political observers within and outside the apa community anticipate greater political activity voter turnout national voter turnout rates for asian pacific americans apas have been available only since 1992 and these data suggest that their participation is lower than that of whites and blacks and similar to hispanic turnout see table 2 below observers offer number of reasons to explain the comparatively low rates of voting participation 1 nearly 70 of asian pacific americans were born outside the us and those who are not yet citizens are not eligible to vote 2 for some immigrants fear or distrust of political involvement carried over from their home countries may inhibit participation 3 immigrants who do not speak or understand english or do so only with difficulty may crs3 be discouraged by an official activity such as registering and voting 4 the apa population is comparatively young apa median age is 30 years compared to national median of 33 years and turnout is traditionally lowest among younger voters1 table 2 voter participation rates in

california apas were about 5 of the electorate in recent elections according to exit polls from the angeles times but turnout spiked in 2004 when apas accounted for 9 of all voters in comparison latinos accounted for between 8 and 14 of voters in statewide elections since 19942 despite the potential difficulties immigrants face with respect to voting number of factors could work to offset the low rate of participation among apas 1996 national study by the asian american studies center at ucla found that more than 80 of asian immigrants become citizens step necessary to meet the citizenship requirement for voter registration poll of san franciscos ethnic groups found similarly high rate of naturalization for apas 76 which favorably compared with 61 naturalization rate for hispanics in
