public sector economics government and finance division summary the valueadded tax vat is type of broadbased consump tion tax imposed in about 136 countries around the world domes tically it is often mentioned in policy discussions as potential new or supplemental funding source for such largescale social programs as social security medicare national health insurance etc an example of such proposal is hr 15 introduced in the 110th congress in addition the vat figures prominently in most funda mental tax reform discussions the key determinant of the vats revenueraising potential is the size of its taxable base this report timates its size under two frequently used generic policy options broadbased vat and vat with certain frequently mentioned exemptions under the assumption of th broadbased vat the poten tial revenue base could be equal to 86 trillion in 2007 exempting certa in expenditures such as food housing healthcare and others would reduce the taxable base to 46 trillion in 2007 these estimates are likely to overstate the sizes of the taxable bases somewhat as they assume behavioral re sponses and perfect compliance with the law this report briefly discusses these important caveats and their implications for further policy analysis this report will not be updated valueadded tax vat is type of br oadbased consumption tax even though it is levied on firms value added at all st ages of the production chain the value added by firm is the difference between the total value of the firms sales and its purchases from all other firms about 136 countries around the world impose some form of the vat1 there are several ways to impose the vat the so called credit method is the most widely used while different in form all methods are econo mically equivalent to each other but may vary in terms of simplicity administrative costs and compliancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22720crs2 2 the methodology follows with modifi cations congressional budget office reducing the

often men tioned in policy discussions as potential new funding source for such largescale social programs as social security medicare national health insurance etc in the 110th congress representative john dingell introduced hr 15 which proposes levying 5 vat to pay for national health care system in addition the vat figures pro minently in most fundamental tax reform discussions this report estimates the size of the vats taxable base the key factor determining the taxs reve nueraising potential under tw frequently considered generic policy options option 1 generic broa dbased valueadded tax conceptually the vat is type of cons umption tax imposed on sales of goods and services even though it is collected at all stages of the production chain thus the vat taxable base can be estimated as the value of all consumption spending taking place in the economy table 1 presents calculations of the br oadbased consum ption tax base2 table 1 taxable base for broadbased vat 2007

billion is personal consum ption expenditures pce private real estate investments in owneroccupied structures add an estimated 3967 billionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22720crs3 4 for examples of similar but not identical estimates see congressional budget office reducing the deficit spending and revenue options march 1997 p 391 or william g gale and c eugene steuerle tax policy solution in alice m rivlin and isabel sawhill eds restoring fiscal sanity 2005 washington brookings institution press 2005 p 113the deductions from the base include the imputed rental valu of owneroccupied housing and farm dwellings 10633 billion nd 152 billion respectively these are the amounts homeowners would have had to pay if they had rented an identical property from somebody else it is easier to understa nd this concept by considering homeowner in dual capacity an owner of the property and tenant at the same property the tenant homeowner consumes housing serv ices provided by him or herself bea includes this value in pce because from an economic sta ndpoint this transaction is different from regular explicit housing rental actua l monetary exchange occurs in this case however and therefore unlike regular explicit housing rental these hypothetical transactions would be nontaxable state sales taxes 4365 billion are also deducted from the base because presumably vat would be imposed on the pr ice net of state sales taxes pce data report the amounts consumers pay including th state sales taxes the estimate also accounts for net foreign trav the difference between expenditures in the united states by nonresidents and foreign tr avel spending by us residents this estimate has an important limitation it does not incorporate the likely taxable base reduction triggered by changes in taxpay ers behavior the effect would be more pronounced if the vat rate were higher it would also depend on the comprehensiveness of the taxable base and ot her specifics of the law to make the estimate more realistic it would be necessa ry to account for taxpayers noncompliance and lawful change in behavior socalled tax avoidance in the absence of specific proposal and historic data on the vat in the united states however making reliable quantitative predictions about the magnitude of th taxable base reduction is problematic international experiences range widely and therefore cannot serve as proxy on the other hand it would be reasonable to expect the size of the taxable base to grow with time in proportion to nominal econo mic growth the estimates in this report do not incorporate such growth after 2007 the rate of economic growth also might depend on the vats taxable base and rate as well as the eventual use of the collected revenues option 2 valueadded tax with certain exemptions another policy option would be vat with narrower taxable base which exempts for example food dical care housing higher education and religious and welfare activities4 in selecting the set of potential exemptions we attempted to choose the most frequently proposed ones of c ourse any specific proposal does not have to incorporate all of themhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22720crs4 table 2 shows the estimated taxable base of this policy option given these exemptions the vat taxable base w ould be 46 trillion 45633 billion in 2007 or about 53 of the above estimated broad base similar to the estimates of the previous section noncompliance and tax avoidance would reduce the taxable base in this case as well in addition as exemptions add complexity to the tax system the reduction in revenue might be somewhat more pronounced compared to the broadbased vat in addition the categories in table 2 are quite broad depending on the implementation exemptions from the vat under the act ual law might encompass less than the whole segment of the economy for example the housing exemption might apply only to owneroccupied housing but not to the housing rental payments if so the vat taxable base would be larger than th is estimate indicates on the other hand if some additional categories such as the fina ncial sector were ex cluded from the base it would be smaller table 2 the vat taxable base after certain exemptions 2007 descriptiontaxable base 2007 billions of dollars broadbased vat taxable base 85830exemptions food excluding alcoholic beverages 11638 medical care 16811 housing

add due to rounding revenue projection us ing these estimates revenues from vat would equal as first approximation the vat rate multiplied by the taxable base there are however number of issues that make revenue projection more complicated first this simple calculation works reasonably well only for low vat rates as the rate gets higher the discrepancy between this simple projecti on and the real revenue yield would likely grow due to various feedback effects in more sophisticated analysis the level of the vat rate affects the size of the taxable base through economic agents behavioral responses economic theory sugge sts that there would be some kind of revenuereducing response to imposition of the vat but its magnitude is highly speculative beyond the rate per it would depend to great extent on specifics of the vats implementation second the estimates presente d above are based on sing year of observation 2007 and thus depend on the specific economic situ ation that year for example to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22720crs5 5 for an overview of the issues please see crs report rl32603 the flat tax valueadded tax and national retail sales ta x overview of the issues by jane g gravelleextent housing values were above their longt erm trends in 2007 the absolute value of all estimates involving housing woul d be above the trend too third any revenue projections should so account for any transitional or cash flow issues which may be significant there would also be some administrative costs involved finally estimates of the vat taxable base size might serve as starting point for calculating the taxable bases of other consum ption taxes such as national retail sales tax it is important to remember however that behavioral res ponses and other issues discussed in this section may be even more pronounced with nationa l sales tax or other consumption taxes the analysis may yiel d misleading picture of the revenueraising potential of tax if such f eedback effects were overlooked5
