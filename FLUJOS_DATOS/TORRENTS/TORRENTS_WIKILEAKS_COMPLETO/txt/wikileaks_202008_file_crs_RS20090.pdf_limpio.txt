changes to tax law made in the taxpayer bill of rights 3 enacted as title iii of the irs reform and restructuring act of 1998 pl 105206 this report describes and analyzes the liability of spouses for taxes due on joint returns the recent changes in that law and its historica l development it will be updated as necessary shortly after the enactment of the modern income tax law it wa s amended to permit joint returns for spouses irs soon took th position that when joint returns were filed spouses were to be treated as one for tax purposes including liability later congress specifically provided for joint and several liability for joint returns incidents of inequitable results prompted an attempt to moderate the impact of joint spousal li ability through enactment of the socalled innocent spouse provisions under the law as it existed prior to the 1998 amendments however it was possible to qualify as an innocent spouse and avoid the operation of the joint and several liability rules only if taxpayer satisfied very stringent conditions this s tringency led to some harsh results and considerable criticism congre ss responded to this criticism by including in the irs restructuring an d reform act of 1998 provisions designed to ease the requirements that must be met to qualify for the innocent spouse exception to eliminate the monetary thresholds fo r claiming relief to modify the requirement that an understatement of tax liability be the result of grossly erroneous item of the other spouse and to permit separate liability election by taxpayers who are

see srept 801013 80 cong 27 th nd sess reprinted in 1948 us code cong ad news at 1163 11841191 there the committee said under th existing law the treatment accorded families earning the same amount of income is very different if they happen to live in st ates using the communityproperty continuedbackground when the modern incom tax was enacted in 1913 there was provision allowing married individuals to file joint returns separate r eturns were required five years later1 in 1918 the statutes were amended to permit but not require the filing of joint returns2 at that time there were special rates for married taxpayers filing jointly the mos t significant benefit may have been convenience for the taxpayers and collectors th statute did not address the question of the nature of the tax liability imposed and on might presume that the old ru were not changed by allowing joint filing nevertheless the internal revenue bureau predecessor of the irs soon took the position that spouses filing jointly were single taxable unit and jointly and severally liable for taxes owed on the joint return while that interpretation was rejected by the courts congress eventually3 4 accepted the bureaus position and amended the tax law to impose joint and severa l liability on joint filers in 1938 at this point there were separate rates for marrie d5 taxpayers and the primary beneficiary of joint filing remained the tax collector thirty years after the enactment of the optional joint return provision and ten years after the adoptio n of the joint and several liability provision congress acted to provide separate rate structure for married taxpayers filing jointly in effect incorporating income splitting into the rate structure that provision was part of 1948 statutory overhau l6 intended to equalize the treatment of taxpayers from common law and community property states in 1969 apparently in response to complaints from single taxpayers that the y7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20090crs3 continued7 system or in states which use common law chiefly this is due to the fact that under the communityproperty system the earnings of married couple are considered to be onehalf the property of each in come arising out of an accumulation which took place during the marriage is divided in the same manner and in some communitypropert states the same division is made of income from assets which are the separate property of one of th spouses similar division takes place under common law th earnings of the husband are his own and taxed to him the income from his property is his income and is taxed as such at 1184 your committee believes that the best answer to the problem of geographica l equalization is the splitting of the combined income of the husband and wife income splitting is effected und er hr 4790 as amended by giving husbands and wives in all states the option to file joint returns in these returns their combined net income and their combined exemptions are divided by 2 tax is computed on this basis an d multiplied by 2 income splitting will produce the same result in commonlaw states which now obtain in communityproperty state when the entire income of both spouses i s community income i f however spouses in communityproperty states have separate income they may split their income by electing to file joint return under existin g law separate income in communityproperty states is taxed in full to the spouse who receives it thus the type of solution embodied in hr 4790 as amended benefits residents of both common law and communityproperty states at 1186 tax reform ct of 1969 pl 91172 803 83 stat 487 678709 for an explanation of this8 provision see staff of the joint comm on taxation general explan ation

married persons filing jointly is the price they pay for the advantages of filing jointly history shows that joint and several liability was urged by the irb before the enactment of income splitting that congress adopted the joint and several liability rule before enactment of income splitting and that the benefits of income splitting wer substantially reduced by the 1969 changes indeed for many

bill of rights 3 prior to the adoption of the 1998 amendments the innocent spouse rules wer codified at irc 6013 b riefly the prerequisites were 1 the making of joint return 2 substantial understatement of tax liability due to grossly erroneous items attributable to t he not so innocent spouse 3 knowledge of and reason to know of the substantial understatement by the innocent spouse when signing the return 4 and inequity under all the facts and circumstance s to hold the innocent spouse liable for the tax deficiency resulting from the understatement the burden of proof for all thes elements was on the party claiming innocent spouse status one potential difficulty especially when the spouses subsequently separated or d ivorced was that the one claiming innocent spouse status might well not have access to the data needed to determine th liability and establish the claim not surprisingly the not so innocent spouses did t always prove cooperative the innocent spouse rule was oft criticized as hard inconsistent and inequitable i n application and exwives continued to pay for former husbands tax indiscretions in many cases irc 6013e2 defined grossly erroneous items as any omitted item f11 income and any claim of deduction credit or basis in an amount for which there is basis in law or fact if t he spouse succeeded in establishing that there was basis in law or fact for deduct ion and thus satisfied the second standard the tax collector might counter that the spouse proved that she he knew or should have known about th substantial understatement and thus could not qualify for innocent spouse status12 mounting criticism of the innocent spouse rule led to calls for congressional review of the rule congress acts 105 congressth reacting to these concerns the 105

ding to what appears to have been broad consensus congress made substantial changes in the rules governing joint an d several liability of spous filing joint returns in the internal revenue service reform and restructuring act of 199815 innocent spouse taxpayer bill of rights 3 the new statutory provisions provide three avenues of relief 1 for married taxpayers filing jointly more liberal standards for innocent spouse status than were available under prior law 2 for those who have since separated or divorced the opportunity to elec t separate liabili ty and 3 for taxpayers who fail to qualify for innocent spouse or separate liability relief discretionary authority for equitable relief16 those who filed joint returns ca n seek innocent spouse status under more liberalized rules than were imposed by prior law under the new law such relief is available for any understatement of tax liability under the ld law relief was available only for substantial understatements and those were defined by dollar amounts 500 or percentage f income the prior law requirement that the understatement be attributable to grossl erroneous items attributable to the other spouse has also been eliminated it is enough now that there is an understatement attributable to the other spouse those claiming the status must still establish that they did not know and had reason to know of th ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20090crs6 the conference committee report discussed the anticipated uses of this equitable authority17 the confere nce agreement does not include the portion of the senate amendment that could pro vide relief in situations where tax was shown on the joint return but not paid with the return the conferees intend that the secretary will consider using th grant of authority to provide equitable relief in appropriate situations to avoid th inequitable tre atment of spouses in such situations for example the conferees intend that equitable relief be available to spouse that does not know and had reason to know that funds intended for the payment of tax w ere instead taken by the other spouse for such other spouses benefit the conferees do not intend to limit the us of the secretarys authority to provide equitable relief to situations where the tax is shown on return but not paid th conferees intend that such authority be us ed where taking into account all the facts and circumstances it is inequitabl to hold an individual liable for all or part of any unpaid tax or deficiency arising from joint return the conferees intend that relief b available

still be found unfair to hold claimant liable for the taxes due spouse pursuing innocen t spouse status may be entitled to refund the new law permits those who are divorced legally separated or have live d separate and apart for year to request separation of liability if the taxpayer filed joint return and is now divorced legally separated or has lived separate and apart for at least year prior to filing the request shehe will qualify for such tr eatment and tax liability will be determined in much the same manner as if separate retur ns had been filed special rules were included to prevent the improper use of the election thus even if otherwis qualifying request for separate liability may be refused if irs proves that the spouses or former spouses transfe rred assets as part of fraudulent scheme or to avoid taxes or the payment of taxes or if irs proves actual knowledge that items giving rise to th deficiency and attributable t spouse or former spouse were incorrect this provision would have benefitted ms cockr ell and the other women who testified before the senate committee on finance with her only the hard to attain innocent spouse exemption was available to former

spouse status includi ng spouses from community property states who file separately the secretary ma make such relief available when under all the facts and circumstances it would be unfair to hold the taxpayer liable for the understatement r underpayment of tax this is the one remedy available for an underpayment of taxes under prior law if spouse took funds intended for taxes for his or her own use ther was escape from joint and several liability17
