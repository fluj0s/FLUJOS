while gym today my elbow is sore again i actually look good i dress good am cleanshaven bathe touch of cologne yet 30 million women rejected over an 18 or 25year period that is how i see it thirty million is my rough guesstimate of how many desirable single women there are man needs woman for confidence he gets boost on the job career with other men and everywhere else when he knows inside he has someone to spend the night with and who is also friend this type of life i see is closed world with specifically and totally excluded every other guy does this successfully to degree flying solo for many years is destroyer yet many people say i am easy to get along with etc looking back i owe nothing to desirable females who ask for anything except for basic courtesy usually looking back over everything what bothers most is the inability to work towards whatever change i choose december 30 2008 while driving i radio surfed to talk show the caller was 30ish black man who was describing the despair in certain black communities according to him life is cheap there because you are going to die anyway when you get old it is the quality of life that is important he said if you know the past 40 years were crappy why live another 30 crappy years then die his point was they engage in dangerous behavior which tends to shorten the lifespans to die now and avoid the next 30 crappy years using my example the host got sarcastic and ended the call instead of trying understanding his point agreement wasnt necesary i put music back on but it was an interesting and useful point for to hear december 31 2008 my anger and rage is largely gone since i began lifting weights lifting drains but i still have energy somebody else suggested running but that did not help i guess strenuous exercise is necesary for man so i just learned that now at 48 maybe 30 httpgeorgesodinicom20090804htm 2 of 1105082009 224335httpgeorgesodinicom20090804htm years later than i would have liked my dad never not once talked to or asked about my lifes details and tell what he knew he was just useless sperm doner dont know why find it fun talking to young kids when i visit someone brother was actually counterproductive and would try to embarase or discourage my efferts when persuing things esp girls early on teen years useless bully result is i am learning basics by trial and error in my 40s followed by discuragement seems odd but thats true writing all this is helping justify my plan and to see the futility of continuing too embarassed to tell anyone this at almost 50 one is expected to just know these things i hope it doesnt snow on tuesday just thought of that the crowd will be thin so i would postpone shit now that i am on the topic of family and people i k now i might as well

her adult children we used to be close until her control of l d caused conflict never the same after david neph siss girlfriend mallory squires good young guy though lisa niece siss daught attractive smart emotional all good yw qualities idiots andy pulkowski i have been in barrooms and church groups the worst people by far are the religious types especially rightwing stifffaced fundie like andy condescending demeaning passiveaggresive person frigid rigid linear and totally inflexible being very serious person he cannot hide his frownlined face he better not try to smile lest his face might crack i knew children of parents who grew up in strict religious homes religion has certain stink to it of guilt shame fear and that moral standard that always contradicts the natural tendencies and desires of person therin lies the conflict young person cannot experiment with things to decide on their own and establish their own parameters so they tend to cut loose and really rebel much worse than the average young person ma and pa never know what goes on they easily bs their parents because they want to believe their little one is an angel andy has young daughter bethany pulkowski away at college high point university i saw her picture on his desk shes your basic attractive young girl please reread my entry made on nov 5th thats only one thing she can do you andy types out there need to further strengthen your strict resolve and do more of the same thing because those girls were great when i recall my college years she is someones or many guys little hoe now i am sure another point about andy how can someone be cold vicious sarcastic and generally nasty all the time and then make the claim about their church life and how good they are total hypocritical idiots thats all for now that felt good lets continue january 5 2009 was at the gym to lift very crowded tomorrow should be good there is woman httpgeorgesodinicom20090804htm 4 of 1105082009 224335httpgeorgesodinicom20090804htm there that gives certain look every time i am there i decided to walk over and make comment about the crowds but she left when i finished the exercise better that i do not get sidetracked from tomorrows plan anyways life is just playing games one or two dates with her then the end matter how many changes i try to make things stay the same every evening i am alone and then go to bed alone young women were brutal when i was younger now they arent as much probably because they just see just as another old man i see twenty something couples everywhere i see twenty something guy with nice twentyish young women i think those years slipped right by for why should i continue another 20 years alone i will just work come home eat maybe do something then go to bed alone for the next day of the same thing this is the auschwitz syndrome to be in serious pain so long one thinks it is normal i cannot wait for tomorrow january 6 2009 i can do this leaving work today i felt like zombie just going thru the motions get on the bus get the car drive homemy mind is screwed up anymore i cant concentrate at work or think at all this log is not detailed it is only for confidence to do this the future holds even less than what i have today it is 640pm about hour and half to go god have mercy i wish life could be better for all and the crazy world can somehow run smoother i wish i had answers bye it is 845pm i chickened out shit i brought the loaded guns everything hell april 24 2009 early last month we had our second general layoff i survived first one was in november when i began 10 years ago that used to be nice place to work i understand the need to reduce staff when times sour but this is out of proportion to the economic problems at this time the economy is shrinking by about 45 they decided not to pay christmas bonus for staff that amounts to about 8 of yearly pay well ok plus yearly merit raise another 35 that totals to about 11 cut plus two layoffs of 5 staff in each case do the math i know this firm is using this downturn as an excuse to take advanage of bad situation and kill jobs unnecessarily the second layoff people who actually did work were let go we all need to pick up the slack so the company can cut beyond what is necesary wasnt going to mention it because of all this shit it is kl gates the large law firm headquartered here in pittsburgh just call it kl gates corporation most people there are ok and i would never have shoot em up there they paid for 10 years so far httpgeorgesodinicom20090804htm 5 of 1105082009 224335httpgeorgesodinicom20090804htm i predict i wont survive the next layoff that is when there is point to continue right now life is bearable and i can get by indefinitely something bad must happen the paycheck is all i have left the future holds nothing for twenty five years of nothing fun i never even spent one weekend with girl in my life even at my own place also unlikely to find another similar job i guess then is when i take care of things i dont have kids close friends or anything just here if you have nothing you have nothing to lose i enjoy writing these entries i have plans to go back and edit or even read most stuff already written if you get bored just click that x at the top right corner of your browser bye may 4 2009 i was so eager to do this last year the big problem on my mind now is that my job will end soon one project is being transistioned to another the other one i am solely responsible but is being fast tracked to production i estimate maybe month i am not ready for the job market i am ok what i do net software developer not at the top of the class but i do good job i survived two general layoffs and other little layoffs they are having but keeping quiet about i hear things the problem is i feel too good now to do this but too bad to enjoy life i know i will never enjoy life this is an over 30 year trend some people are happy some are miserable it is difficult to live almost continuously feeling an undercurrent of fear worry discontentment and helplessness i can talk and joke around and sound happy but under it all is something different that seems unchangable and permanent part of my being i need to realize the details of what i never accomplished in life and to be convinced the future is merely continuation of the past which it always has been i am making list of items that will provide motivation to do the exit plan it wont be published i always had hope that maybe things will improve especially if i make big attempts to change my life i made many big changes in the past two years but everything is still the same life is over even though i look good dress well well groomed nails teeth hair etc who knows what is it like to be dead i always think i am forgetting something thats one reason i postponed similar to when you leave to get in your car to go somewhere you hesitate with thought what am i forgetting in this case i cannot make return trip i like to write and talk ironic because i havent met anybody recently past 30 years who i want to be close friends with or who want to be close friends with i was always open to suggestions to what i am doing wrong brother or father mine are httpgeorgesodinicom20090804htm 6 of 1105082009 224335httpgeorgesodinicom20090804htm useless or close friend to nudge and give it bluntly yet tactfully wtf i am doing wrong personal coach or someone who knows what he is doing would be perfect money is highly secondary for solution may 5 2009 to pull the exit plan off it popped into my mind to just use some booze i want to do this before i get laid off for reasons not worth mentioning but dont seem to have the balls after the gym i stopped at shop n save and got fifth of vodka and small bottle of jack daniels i havent had drink since september 1 1988 just over 20 years it doesnt matter now i need to use it to take the edge off of carrying out the exit plan i will be taking some every now and then to get used to it and see if the alcohol effects will embolden weed would be fun to try again i dont know who has any life is over who cares i just need to use common sense cant drink and drive etc this idea just hit at point in time and i immediately acted on it same thing happened when i decided to go back to pitt full time first day was monday may 8 1989 and to buy the house that closed on friday september 30 1996 to name two examples i remember so well the list idea yesterday is working i carry it in my wallet and add to it i am feeling to good to do carry this out but too bad to enjoy anything my lifes dilema may 6 2009 i started the jd about one ounce with some tea to get started big deal may 7 2009 went to the gym and did mostly cardio my heart rate was 117 just from walking on the treadmill at 34 this should be done few times week for maybe 15 mins or so to keep the heart active i sprinted few times to push the limits may 18 2009 i actually had date today it was with woman i met on the bus in march we got together at two ppg place for lunch the last date for was may 1 2008 women just dont like there are 30 million desirable women in the us my estimate and i cannot find one not one of them finds attractive i am looking at the list i made from my may 4th idea i forgot about that for several days that tells where i stand these problems have gotten worse over 30 year period i need to expect nothing from or other people all through the years i thought we had the ability to change ourselves i guess that is incorrect looking at the list makes realize how totally alone deeper word is isolated i am from all else i longer have any expectations of myself i have options because i cannot work httpgeorgesodinicom20090804htm 7 of 1105082009

brother we have common parents thats all is still boss repetition only for emphasis he is only bully even at 50ish never forget that because he exudes confidence people believe bull shit if delivered with confidence get it on the same thought things occured to today michael never had an attractive girlfriend debbie barb kim then i lost track not to say i had any execpt pam who was about 725 he married chinesedescent petite woman with body ass chest and personality she never laughs or smiles neither does he but she is highly intelligent and an excellent cook i can testify to that she home

august 2 2009 httpgeorgesodinicom20090804htm 9 of 1105082009 224335httpgeorgesodinicom20090804htm the biggest problem of all is not having relationships or friends but not being able to achieve and acquire what i desire in those or many other areas everthing stays the same regardless of the effert i put in if i had control over my life then i would be happier but for about the past 30 years i have not august 3 2009 i took off today monday and tomorrow to practice my routine and make sure it is well polished i need to work out every detail there is only one shot also i need to be completely immersed into something before i can be successful i havent had drink since friday at about 230 total effort needed tomorrow is the big day unfortunately i talked to my neighbor today who is very positive and upbeat i need to remain focused and absorbed completely last time i tried this in january i chickened out lets see how this new approach works maybe soon i will see god and jesus at least that is what i was told eternal life does not depend on works if it did we will all be in hell christ paid for every so how can i or you be judged by god for when the penalty was already paid people judge but that does not matter i was reading the bible and the integrity of god beginning yesterday because soon i will see them i will try not to add anymore entries because this computer clicking distracts also any of the practice papers left on my coffee table i used or the notes in my gym bag can be published freely i will not be embarased because well i will be dead some people like to study that stuff maybe all this will shed insight on why some people just cannot make things happen in their life which can potentially benefit others miscellaneous 1 probably 99 of the people who know well dont even think i was this crazy told by at least 100 girlswomen over the years i was nice guy not kidding 2 lee ann valdiserri had my baby in early 1991 havent seen her since she was about
