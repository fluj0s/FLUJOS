rl33151 committee controls of agency decisions november 16 2005 louis fisher senior specialist in separation of powers government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33151committee controls of agency decisions summary congress has long history of subjecting certain types of executive agency decisions to committee control either by committees or subcommittees especially with the beginning of world war ii the executive branch agreed to committee controls as an accommodation that allowed congress to delegate authority and funds broadly while using committees to monitor the use of that discretionary authority these committeeagency arrangements took th form of different procedures simply notifying the committee obtaining committee approval coming into agreement understandings and using the congressional distinction between authorization and appropriation to exercise committee controls by the 1930s the white house and the ju stice department began to object to committeeapproval arrangements as an encroachment into executive duties and violation of separation of powers litigation in the 1970s supported by the administration resulted in the supreme courts decision ins v chadha 1983 striking down every form of legisla tive veto twohouse onehouse committee subcommittee and chairman the court ruled that whenever congress intends to exercise control over any action outside the legislative branch it must comply with the regular constitutional requirements for lawmaking action by both houses bicameralism and submission of bill or joint resolution to the president for his signature or veto p resentation clause notwithstanding this decision agenci continue to fashion accommodations that settle some decisions at the level of committees and subcommittees this type of arrangement is seen frequently in reprogramming procedures where agencies seek committeesubcommittee approval be fore shifting certain types of funds within an appropriations account num ber of

presidents in their signing statements but in agency budget manuals as well that is despite constitutional objections raised by presidents and the justice department executive departments and agencies have found it both practicable and n ecessary to submit certain pr oposals to designated committees for their review and approval the presentation clause committee veto requires an executive ag ency to submit proposed action to designated committees before placing the program in operation this procedure obviously departs from the customary rout of having congress pass bill and present it to the president article i section 7 of the constitution provides that every order resolution or vote to which the concurrence of the senate and house of representatives may be necessary ex cept on question of adjournment shall be presented to the president for his signat ure or veto legislative actions short of public law have included va rious types of legislative vetoes twohouse concurrent resolution onehouse simple resoluti on and committeesubcommittee controls even before the development of legislative vetoes the constitution permitted some exceptions to the presentation cl ause congress adopted constitutional amendments in the form of resolutions and referred them directly to the states rather than through the president for ratificati on the procedure following the language of article v of the constitution was sa nctioned by the supreme court in 17981 also from an early date congress passed simple and concurre nt resolutions for internal housekeeping matters since thes were not regarded as legislative in effect there was need to submit them to the president many of them were adopted pursuant to congressional powers under article i to determine procedural rules in each house and to punish or expel members of congress committee subpoenas and the power of either house to hol d an executive official in contempt are other actions not considered to be legislative in

form of resolution but on its s ubstance if it contained matter that was legislative in its character and effect it had to be presented to the president2 however executive officials at times recognized that the legislative effect of suchresolutions could be change d fundamentally by having their use sanctioned in public law in 1854 attorney general caleb cushing stated that simple resolution could not coerce department head unless in some particular in which law duly enacted has subjected him to the direct action of each and in such case it is to be intended that by approving the law the pr esident has consented to the exercise of such coerciveness on the part of either house 3 for example legislation in 1867 pl aced the following restriction on appropriations for public buildings and gr ounds to pay for completing the repairs and furnishing the executive mansion thirtyfive thousand dollars provided that further payments shall be made on an accounts for repairs and furnishing the executive mansion until such accounts shall have been submitted to joint committee of congress and approved by such committee4 president andrew johnson could have objected that the lawmaking process established by the constitution requires action by both chambers and submission of bill to the president for his signature or veto however he ma have concluded that obta ining approval from joint committee would be easier than getting legislation through the entire congress early twentieth century attorney general cushings opinion c overed certain types of onehouse and twohouse actions used to direct executiv officials in 1903 congress resorted to simple resolutions to direct the secretary of commerce to make investigations and to issue reports5 two years later congress relied on concurrent resolutions to direct the secretary of war to make investig ations in rivers and harbors matters6 in 1920 president woodrow wilson vetoed bill because it provided that government publication could be printed issued or discontinued unl ess authorized under such regulations prescribed by the joint committee on printing he objected that congress had right to endow joint committee or committee of either house with power to prescribe regulations under which executive departments may operate7 other presidents were willing to agree to committee controls if congress

executive agencies subject to the approval of joint committee of congress8 when congress passed legislation for reorganization authority in 1932 it allowed eith er house to disapprove presidential proposal9 constitutional disputes administrations objected to committee involvement in certain kinds of executive matters in 1933 attorney gene ral william mitchell issued an opinion that regarded as unconstitutional bill that authorized the joint committee on internal revenue to make the final decision on any tax refund that exceeded 2000010 previous legislation had allowed the committee to decide all tax refunds over 75000 apparently executive officials had lived with the higher threshold without objec tion by lowering the amount political accommodation was somehow transformed into unconstitutional interference with executive decisions11 despite mitchells opini on congress continues to require the treasury department to notify the joint committee on taxation of refunds above certain level prior to 2000 the amount was 100000012 in 2000 congress increased the amount to 200000013 it would be possible for president or administration official to raise constitutional objection that the committees disapproval of refund beyond th statutory ceiling would be merely advisory and not binding but the political cost of that position might we ll exceed any perceived benefits of pure version of separated powers come into agreement provisions unique type of committee veto emerged during world war ii to handle military construction and the acquisition of land by the military services administration officials raised some cons titutional questions bout this involvement of congress in executive decisions but political accommodations were worked out between the branches because of the magnitude of wartime construction it was considered impracticable to follow the customary practice of having congress authorize each defense installation or pub lic works project discretion had to be granted to executive officials but congress was also intent on establishing effective legislative controls beginning with an informal system in 1942 all proposals for acquisition of land and lease arrangements we re submitted in dvance to committees of jurisdictionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33151crs4 14 89 cong rec 1218 1943 15 id 16 id at 1219 17 id remarks by rep cole 18 id at

apprehension relative to the military services going into the realestate business the committee felt while we must allow discretion to the navy in the lection of sites that at least we should know what they are doing14 the bill therefore required the secretary of the navy to report to the house and senate naval affairs committees on all prospective acquisitions of land by lease or otherwise15 in letter of february 17 secretar of the navy frank knox wrote to representative carl vinson chairman of the house naval affairs committee about concerns that had been expressed with re spect to the proposed construction of certain facilities for the development of the naval air transport services it was knoxs understanding that the committee accepted the n eed for these projects and that when the details have been worked out they will be discussed with the committee before final commitments are made this arrangement is satisfactory to me16 would the navy department merely re port to the committees in advance and then proceed with its plans some legislators thought that the committees would have to first grant their approval to the specific projects as one member noted th department would have to come back to the committee for further approval17 other lawmakers believed that if the committees objected to the proposed project s congress as whole would have to disappr ove by regular legislation18 secretary knox clarified the situation with another letter to the house naval affairs committee this one dated februa ry 22 concerning the bill language requiring the secretary of the navy to report to the naval affairs committees on all prospective acquisitions of land by lease or otherwise knox explained the political accommodation that would eliminate the need for congress to vote on each specific acquisition it is my understanding that this amendment has been proposed in order to avoid the necessity of having specific legislative authorization for each individual acquisition of land i understand further that the committee understands from the wording of the ame ndment that the department will come into the agreement with the naval affairs committees of the house and senate with respect to acquisitions before fina l commitments are made this procedure is acceptable to me19 that informal system was replaced by statutory directives in 1944 statute governing the construction of public work s for the navy the statute provided prior to the acquisition by l ease or otherwise of any land under authority of this act the secretary of the navy shall report to the senate and house naval affairshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33151crs5 20 58 stat 8 1944 21 id at 190 22 63 stat 66 1949 65 stat 365 601 1951 23 64 stat 1223 407 1951 24 public papers of the

congress tightened the statutory language replacing the merely report language to mutual agreement between the secretary of the navy and the naval committees the new language read prior to the acquisition or disposal by lease or otherwise of any land acquired for naval use under the authority of this or any other act the secretary of the navy shall come into agreement with th naval affairs committees of the senate and of the house of representatives with respect to the terms of such prospective acquisitions or disposals and recital of compliance with this proviso in any instrument of conveyance by the secretar of the navy under authority of this or any other act shall be conclusive evid ence of the secretarys compliance with this proviso as to the property conveyed21 in return for the administrations agreement to abide by committee objections congress consented to enact general aut horization statutes providing lumpsum amounts rather than trying to specify i ndividual projects both sides found it reasonable compromise additional come into agreement provisions were added in 1949 and 1951 requiring the approval of the armed services committees for acquisition of land and real estate transactions22 in january 6 1951 statute authorizing military and naval construction congress stated in section 407 that the military services may not grant or transfer to another government department or agency other than military department or to any other party any land or buildings of permanent nature except as authorized by an act of congress enacted subsequent to the date of enactment of this act23 presidential objections nine days after signing the january 6 1951 statute president harry truman sent special message to congress objecting that the language in section 407 may seriously impede our mobilization effort by causing unnecessary and unwarranted delay in the transfer for other government uses of property excess to the needs of the military departments24 he cautioned congress to avoid getting involved in the details of management it seems to unwise at time when the congress will be fully concerned with matters of greatest national importance to go through the process of reviewing in deta il transaction by transacti on the sale or disposition to the general public of such few pieces of prope rty as may be determined to be

repeal the section congress did repeal section 407 but in its place adopted committeecontrol mechanism on may 15 1951 president truman vetoed the bill objecting that it would require the army navy air force and federal civil defense administration to come into agreement with the committees on armed services of the senate and house of representatives with respect to th acquisition or dispos of real property including leases involving an annual rental in excess of 10000 and including transfers of real property between the military departments or to other federal agencies or to states with certain minor exceptions he acknowledged that congress or its members have special interest in number of real estate transactions by the executive branch of th government and that full information with respect to those transactions has in the past and will in the future be made readily available to the interested committees of the congress however he said that legal requirement to submit real estate transactions to congressional committees would result in the impos ition of severe and unnecessary administration burden on the department of defense26 subjecting administrative proposals to committee review might cause serious delays on agency execution and planning in addition he argued rather th an have real estate transactions handled largely in the field they would have to be centralized in the pentagon leading to potential waste of time and money the points raised by president truman concerned administrative not constitutional problems yet he also expressed his concern by what appears to to be gradual trend on the part of the gislative branch to participate to an even greater extent in the actual execution and administration of the laws under the us constitution it is contemplated that the congress will enact the laws and will leave their administration and execution to the executive branch the delays he identified in the vetoed bill testify to the wisdom of that constitutional policy he regarded it as particularly inappropriate to depart from that policy in the field of military emergency when expeditious action may be vital to the survival of our nation27 congressional override debate the house overrode the veto handily by vote of 3126828 representative carl vinson explained that the bill had passed his committee on armed services unanimously had passed the house unanimous ly and had passed th senate with the change of single word the purpose of the bill he said was to take the april 4 1944 statute requiring the navy to come into agreement with the naval affairshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33151crs7 29 id at 5435 30 id 31 id at 5436 32 id 33 id 34 idcommittees and to extend the same principle to the army and the air force29 all 35 members of the house armed services committee recommended that the veto be overridden30 representative vinson also disputed the charge that the bill would lead to excessive delays or heavy administrativ burdens on the defense department experience over the previous nine years two years by informal agreement and seven by statutory requirement had not revealed such problems substantial sums he said had been saved as result of close committee review moreover there was objection from the department of justice as to the constitutionality of this question of committee veto31 ironically vinson looked for support to the work done by truman in 1944 when he headed senate investigation committee uncovering many injustices by the war department in acquiring hotels nator truman compared those problems with the experience of the navy department which advises the legislative committees of its real estate acquisitions in advance and keeps those committees advised of its situation32 vinson said that when the armed services committee held hearing on the draft bill in 1951 general from the corps of engineers representing the defense department objected that the bill would cause too much trouble and delay the committee told him general you can write the bill to suit yourself he exempted rivers and harbors and flood control projects and exempt ed leases on agricultural grazing permits as to the balance of the bill that he drafted vinson said of course he is against it because ll departmental officials ar against congress knowing what goes on33 as an example of savings realized through the committee review process representative vinson described 30000000 proposal by the navy department to construct new plant to manufacture aircraft engines after house armed services asked the navy to make furthe

this responsibility will go back home and tell your people that you are sent to washington only to appropriate money that the department of defense wants and you know nothing about it until the time

agencies especially on the transfer of government land and buildings why should we permit the department of defense wh enever it makes up its mind to sell this piece of property or sell that piece of property it is government property and congress should have some c ontrol over government property36 several members of the house including abraham multer boyd tackett chet holifield and wright patman argued that congress had right to administer the laws that it enacts some of these obj ections came from members who thought that the armed services committee was encroach ing upon the jurisdiction of their own committees such as expenditures in executive departments and banking and currency37 after the house overrode president tr umans veto the senate tabled the presidents message and did not take it up again38 committee veto resurfaces having failed to override tr umans veto lawmakers decided to write new bill and included within it the disputed come into agreement provision the bill became law on september 28 1951 instead of the earlier dollar threshold of 10000 the new language increased it to 25000 for five specified categories39 president truman signed the bill and did not make separate signing statement commenting on the committee veto house and senate debate sheds some light on the compromise language and the determination of congress to vest control in the armed services committees notwithstanding constitutional objections bout the separation between the branches representative vinson managing the bill in the house explained that the authority given to the armed

the committeeveto provision in the defense appropriations bill engrafts executive functions upon legislative members and thus overreaches the permitted sweep of legislative authority at the same time it serves to usurp power confided to the executive branch58 congress as whole retains the right to legislate on contractual authority but it is quite clear that committees of the congress do not have the legal capacity to enact legislation59 brownell reviewed the provisions of ar ticles i and ii of the constitution and cited previous cases by th supreme court on the doctrin of separation of powers

the president to participate in the legislative process and also permits mere handfuls of members to speak for congress which is given opportunity to participate as whole69 rogers reviewed the

major critique of legislative vetoes came from president jimmy carter in message to congress on june 21 1978 he object ed to the proliferation of this type of congressional control he said that in the previous four years at least 48 of these provisions have been enacted more than in the preceding twenty years91 he regarded as unconstitutional all forms of the legislative veto twohouse onehouse and

regardless of whether committees disapproved or failed to approve some exceptions allowed the carter challenge to legislative vetoes contained few exceptions an opinion by attorney general griffin

up in committee or fail to act and amendments were permitted congress had to act up or down within fixed time period in justifying this type of legislative veto and other attorney general bell reasoned that the procedures for legislative action prescribed in article i 7 are not exclusive94 he found most legislative vetoes unconstitutional because they did not respect the constitutional checks on legislative power and threatened to shift the balance of power to congress and thus permitting the legislative branch to dominate the executive95 however if statutory procedures did not affect the constitutional balance between the branches that is the power of presidential veto is effectively preserved and the principle of bicameralism is respected the fact that the procedure is not explicitly authorized by the language of artic i is not enough to render the statute constitutional96 what bell drew from this analysis was the fact that congressional onehouse veto of reorganization plan did not alte r executivelegislative relations or the law if one house decided to disapprove the pres idents reorganization plan the structure of government remained as before the reorganization process allowed the president to retain control the president will submit to congress only plans which he approves and rather than be forced to accommodate the demands of congress as to the shape of the plan he can decide to submit plan at all97 in bells judgment presidential control ove r other legislative vetoes was not the same if one house or both houses decided to disapprove an agency regulation or reprogramming of funds within an appr opriations account the matter was closed bell was also concerned that those legi slative vetoes involved congress in the administration of continuing programs by contrast the reorga nization statute does not involve creation of new substantive program or congressi onal interference with authorized administrative discretion in an ongoing program the doctrine of separation of powers is not violated98 on the day that president carter issued his statement regarding legislative vetoes as unconstitutional two officials from his administration appeared at press conference to explain the scope of his policy reporters wanted to know how carters position applied to the procedur governing arms sales which congress under law could veto by concurrent reso lution attorney ge neral bell was asked whether president carter would feel bound if congress by twohouse veto disapproved the pending mideast arms sale s package bell replied

disapproval107 the same approach was used on legisl ation concerning export administration108 number of legislative vetoes had been used in the past to deal with federal pay increases congress converted those to joint resolution of disapproval109 after chadha some members of congress introduced legislation to change the war powers act of 1973 to remove the concurrent resolution and repl ace

reagan administration turned to deferrals to satisfy the deficit targets in the grammrudmanhollings act affected parties went to court to contest the legality of presidential pr oposals they argued that if the onehouse veto was invalid under chadha the presidents deferral authority was inextricably tied to the unconstitutional legislative veto according to the argument of plaintiffs congress

of the appropriations committees presidents regularly sign them into law objecting that they are invalid under chadha and thus legal nullity these signing statements interpret the statutory language to require only that designated committees by notified of pending agency action118 the extent to which the statutory language actually functions as committee veto depends on committeeagency relations

other than subsequent separate legislative enactment these ceilings c ould seriously impact the ability of nasa to meet unforeseen technical change s or problems that are inherent in challenging rd

and that it would not be the normal practice to include either mechanism in fu ture appropriations bills further the agreement would assume that the future program ceiling amounts would be identified

property on or after 35 days135 the us claims court found th procedure to be tantamount to committee disapproval and ther efore unconstitutional under chadha 136 the us court of appeals for the federal circuit reversed finding nothing unconstitutional about the decision of agencies to voluntarily bind themselves by regulation to defer to committee objections there is nothing unconstitutional about this indeed our separation of powers ma kes such informal cooperation much more necessary than it would be in pure system of parliamentary government137 reprogramming of funds an area where committee and subcommittee controls over agency actions persist after chadha is reprogramming reprogramming consists in moving funds within an appropriation account since the money remains within the account there is legal violation unless some provision of law makes it so to move the funds outside the account to another account an agency mu st receive specific statutory authority this type of

to this shifting of funds during world war ii as necessary emergency measure as the practice persisted however members of the appropriations committees grew restive and began to reassert legislative spending prerogatives this attitude was par ticularly pronounced in 1949 when congress adopted the concept of the performan ce budget which endorsed trend toward lumpsum appropriations the nati onal security act amendments of 1949 authorized the secret ary of defense to prepare the budg et estimates in such form and manner so as to account for and report the cost of performance of readily identifiable functional programs and activities 141 subsequent reductions in the number of appropriations accounts for the defense department increased executive spending flexibility

number of appropriations accounts for the defense department was cu t by half from 104 accounts in 1948 to 48 by 1955142 this shift of responsibility to committees coincided with the development of other forms of committee vetoes during this period including the come in to agreement procedure the first specific legislative guideline appeared in 1954 in reporting out the defense appropriations

start construction on five additional polaris submarines without first seeking and obtaining the approval of the appropriations committees149 the committee responded by adopting four changes to tighten up reprogramming procedures in letter to defense secretary robert s mcnamara dated ma rch 20 1961 chairman george h mahon asked that specific committee approval be required for the following categories of reprogramming 1 procurement of items omitted or deleted by congress 2 programs for which specific reductions in the original request s were made by congress 3 programs which had not previously been presented to or considered by congress and 4 quantitative program increases proposed above the programs originally presented to congress150 secretary mcnamara accepted the first two points but not the last two the department was worried that committee prior approval would come to include the armed services committees because of the trend toward nnual authorizations section 412

the defense department regularly produ ces the most detailed instructions on reprogramming and the procedures and thresholds for notifying committees and receiving their approval other agency documents are less elaborate the budget execution manual for the department of ener gy explains that congressional controls over reprogramming depend on the approved program baseline and are generally delineated in the department s base table and relate d documentation congress requires the department to ensure that the appropriate committees are promptly and fully notified whenever necessary change to the approved program baseline is required notifications of such ch anges are provided to congress through submission of formal reprogramming propos als and the department shall comply with subsequent directions in the responses from the congressional committees154 stated here is the requirement to not merely notify the committees but to comply with their directions failure to follow this understanding will not only violate the trust and latitude granted the depa rtment but could translate into stringent statutory constraints and limitations imposed on the department by

provides that reprogramming proposals submitted to the appropriations committee for prior approval shall be considered approved after 30 calendar days if the committee has posed objection161 it appears in many cases that if the agency does not hear within the prescribed period of time it does not move forward instead it will contact the committee or subcommittee and ask whether there are any objections often the proposed reprogramming is not impleme nted until explicit committee approval is granted committee vetoes over veterans affairs va activities are currently vested in the appropriations committees regarding reprogramming but earlier statutes gave the authorizing committees veto role pr ior to 1992 it was not in order in either house to consider bill resolution or am

through resolution of approval was deleted164 current va procedures for reprogramming explain that any shift of funds within an appropriations account for purpose other than that contemplated at the time of appropriation is generally preceded by consultation between the federal agencies and the appropriate congre ssional committees it involves formal notification and in some instances opportunity for disapproval by congressional co mmittees165 all reprogramming actions will adhere to the requirements of the committee on appropriations166 obligation of funds for which reprogramming

and elements 2 any reprogramming that changes an agencys funding requirement in future years 3 any reprogramming that changes the funds for programs or projects specifically cited in committee report and 4 any reorganization of offices programs or activities168 upon approval by the department the subcommittees must be informed prior to implementation169 as to the type of action that must be pproved by the appropriations committees details are set forth in the joint statement of managers in the annual appropriations conference report dollar thresholds are sp ecified in addition the conferees expect the appropriations committees to be promp tly notified of all reprogramming actions below the thresholds if the actions would have the effect of significantly changing an agencys funding requirements in futu re years or if programs or projects specifically cited in the statement of the managers or accompanying reports of the house and senate are affected by the reprogramming the reprogramming must be approved by the appropria tions committees regardless of the amount proposed to be moved170 conclusions committee controls over agency actions have long history they have proved to be helpful device in permitting the delegation of discretionary authority to the agencies while at the same time retaining close legislative review the supreme courts decision in chadha striking down all types of legislative vetoes including committee vetoes has not eliminated the ty pes of committeeagency agreements that guide the reprogramming process and other executive actions moreover these committee vetoes have not been litigated and subjected to judicial review and possible invalidation nor is there any i ndication that someone is likely to gain standing to bring these committee vetoes into court
