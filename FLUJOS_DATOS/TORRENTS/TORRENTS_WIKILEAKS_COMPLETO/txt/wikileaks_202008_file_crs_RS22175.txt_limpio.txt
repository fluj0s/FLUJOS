background since 1988 congress has passed several laws concerning television reception via satellite the 1988 satellite home viewer act shva pl 100667 amendments to the act in 1994 the satellite home viewer improvement act of 1999 shvia pl 106 1131 and the most recent law the satellite home viewer extension and reauthorization act shvera shvera was passed as division j of title ix of the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act hr 4818 pl 108447 in december 2004 number of changes were made to provisions affecting consumers who receive analog distant network signals and localintolocal network signals2 three factors are 1 for more on these laws see crs report rs20425 satellite television historical information on shvia and local by marcia s smith 2 shvera sets other provisions for distant digital signals which are outside the scope of this report for information on these provisions see crs report rs21990 satellite television and digital white areas provisions of the 2004 satellite home viewer extension and reauthorization act by marcia s smith crs2 important in understanding the eligibility criteria for these different signals signal strength distant and local signals and unserved households signal strength signal strength can be visualized as two concentric circles around tv stations transmitter points in the inner circle close to the transmitter can receive strong grade television broadcast signal via an overtheair antenna rooftop or rabbit ears points in the outer circle can receive weaker grade b signal3 beyond the outer circle where signal can be received are white areas overtheair signal strength is the guiding factor in determining which households are eligible to receive distant network signals via satellite distant vs local network signals network broadcast signal is one received by household located within network television affiliates local area when retransmitted by satellite back into the same local area such signals are called localintolocal distant network signal is one received from outside the local network affiliates area it is referred to as distant network signal because it originates in one place and is received in another httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22175 localintolocal signals were first offered to satellite television subscribers in 1999 under the satellite home viewer improvement act shvia it permitted but did not require satellite television companies to offer localintolocal signals subscribers who were eligible for distant network signals under shvia could also receive localintolocal if offered in their area unserved households households are generally defined as either served or unserved under shvera based on the signal strength they can receive4 under the law only unserved households are eligible to receive distant network television signals via satellite unserved households include those that are unable to receive grade b signal via an overtheair antenna or were grandfathered per may 1998 federal court ruling see below have satellite tv dishes mounted on recreational vehicle or commercial truck that are not fixed dwellings in the late 1990s some satellite television companies broadcast distant network signals to subscribers who were not eligible to receive them broadcasters filed suit against those satellite television companies in may 1998 federal court ruled that 3 see crs report rs20425 satellite television historical information on shvia and local by marcia s smith 4 some cband subscribers are defined as being as an unserved household under shvera any cband subscriber who was getting distant network signals via their cband antennas before october 31 1999 may continue getting those signals over those antennas cband subscribers use the original large backyard satellite dishes that are about 7 feet in diameter the number of c band subscribers is diminishing as many of them transition to the newer smaller rooftop satellite dishes used by the two major us satellite television companies echostar communications and directv and the wider variety of programming they offer crs3 company called primetime 24 had violated the satellite home viewer act shva by retransmitting broadcast network television signals to both served and unserved households5 the court ruled in favor of the broadcasters meaning that many satellite tv subscribers would have lost access to distant network signals however congress was debating satellite tv legislation shvia at the time and chose to allow some of those subscribers called grandfathered subscribers to continue to receive the signals for five more years until december 31 2004 provisions in shvera under shvia subscribers receiving distant network signals could also subscribe to localintolocal when it became available in 2004 congress again deliberated satellite tv legislation ultimately passing shvera sections 103 and 204 of shvera differentiated three groups of subscribers grandfathered other and future subscribers in areas where localintolocal service was available some had to choose between distant network signals or localintolocal each subscribers situation was unique complicating efforts to understand how the new provisions affected particular household httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22175 grandfathered subscribers this group consists of households that had been receiving distant network signals illegally per the 1998 miami court ruling under shvera if localintolocal was offered in their area or became available later this group was required to choose between retaining distant network signals or receiving localintolocal signals within 60 days of being notified by their satellite company they could longer receive both other subscribers this group consists of households who received distant network signals legally under shvera if satellite company offered localintolocal in subscribers area on january 1 2005 these subscribers could receive both distant network signals and localintolocal signals6 if satellite company did not offer localintolocal service in the subscribers area on january 1 2005 but it became available later the subscriber would then have to choose between distant network signals or localintolocal future subscribers this group consists of households that subscribe to satellite television after december 8 2004 the date of enactment of shvera if localintolocal service is offered in their area they may not receive distant network signals if localinto local is not offered when they subscribe and they are eligible for distant network signals ie they are unserved they may receive distant network signals until such time as localintolocal is offered 5 cbs inc v primetime 24 joint venture 9 f supp2d 1333 sd fl 1998 echostar communications was also charged with violating the satellite home viewer act shva in similar manner see communications daily vol 18 216 nov 9 1998 p 9 6 as long as the satellite carrier made notifications required by shvera to the networks affiliate by mar 1 2005 crs4 impact of local signal availability on subscribers to summarize if localintolocal is offered in particular area subscribers who were receiving distant network signals at the time shvera was enacted december 8 2004 because they were grandfathered in could continue to receive distant network signals but could not receive localintolocal at the same time they had to choose one or the other subscribers who are receiving distant network signals because they cannot get grade b signal may continue to receive distant network signals if their satellite tv provider was not offering localintolocal on january 1 2005 if localintolocal becomes available after january 1 2005 they will have to choose between distant network signals and local intolocal subscribers to satellite television after the date of enactment of shvera httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22175 december 8 2004 may receive distant network signals if they are eligible for them and localintolocal is not offered if localintolocal later becomes available they must subscribe to localintolocal recent developments as noted above in the section unserved households echostar communications also known as the dish network was charged with violating the satellite home viewer act in 1998 echostar chose to defend its actions and the companys distant network signals have been unaffected during the eight years the issue has been litigated in may 2006 an atlanta appeals court ordered permanent injunction on echostars carriage of all distant signals including those provided to eligible consumers who cannot receive grade b signal7 in order to avoid circumstance in which customers would lose access to distant signals they were eligible to receive negotiations were undertaken between echostar and the four major broadcast networks abc cbs nbc and fox to set the terms under which echostar could continue to carry those signals for eligible customers negotiated settlement was reached with three networks but not with fox8 echostar claims that fox chose not to negotiate settlement because it is part of vertically integrated company that is partial owner of directv which would stand to gain customers at the expense of echostar if echostars eligible customers could longer receive distant fox signals fox on the other hand counters that it was involved in this litigation for five years before its parent company took operational control of 7 communications daily vol 26 101 may 25 2006 p 1 8 echostar agreed to pay 100 million and terminate distant signals to ineligible subscribers some fox affiliates agreed to terms of the settlement others did not satellite today vol 5 159 aug 30 2006 crs5 directv and having won the case in court had responsibility to negotiate settlement that differed from the courts decision9 on october 20 2006 florida district court upheld the injunction and voided the proposed settlement reached by abc cbs nbc and echostar the court set december 1 2006 as the effective date of signal cutoff10 seven pieces of legislation were introduced that would have lessened the impact of the injunction s 4067 and hr 6402 s 4068 and hr 6340 s 4074 s 4080 and hr 6384 but none were passed before the december deadline11 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22175 9 multichannel news vol 27 35 sept 4 2006 p 27 10 cbs broadcasting inc v
