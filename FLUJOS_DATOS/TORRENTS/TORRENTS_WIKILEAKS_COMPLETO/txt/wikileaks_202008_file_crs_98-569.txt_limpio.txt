analysis of the current status james k jackson specialist in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division summary the multilateral agreement on investment or the mai was expected to be comprehensive agreement when it was negotiated by ministers from the most economically developed countries in the world the organization for economic cooperation and development the oecd the agreement would have established an international set of rules on foreign investment1 dissatisfaction with number of provisions in the agreement sparked intense opposition among various nongovernment organizations and in april 1998 spurred ministers from the united states and elsewhere to postpone additional discussions on the agreement france withdrew from the negotiations in october 1998 and the oecd ministers announced on december 3 1998 that the oecd had ceased all negotiations on the agreement at september 20 1999 oecd conference on investment policy representatives from developed and developing countries sparred over the prospects of new round of investment talks perhaps at the world trade organizations ministerial meeting in seattle november 30 1999december 3 1999 this report will be updated as events require overview the united states is the largest investor abroad and the largest recipient of foreign investment in the world as result it potentially has the most to gain or the most to lose from international investment agreements depending on ones point of view in the case of the mai there have been two quite distinct points of view one group has viewed the mai as milestone development in international investment while another group has characterized the mai as an illconceived agreement that could have undermined national sovereignty and degraded workers rights this contrary viewpoint also argued that an 1 for additional information see crs report 97469 multilateral agreement on investment implications for the united states by james k

national standards affecting the environment and could have handed international corporations largely unchecked influence over international economic developments beginning in may 1995 oecd ministers negotiated over various principles of international investment that eventually comprised the mai the oecd ministers were attempting to build on the existing legal regime to create strong and comprehensive international legal framework that could have reduced restrictions on foreign investment and expanded opportunities for firms seeking to invest abroad this agreement was intended to be standalone agreement and to be accessible to any country developed or developing that would have been willing to abide by its precepts oecd members also sought to reduce barriers and discriminatory treatment of foreign direct investment and to increase the legal security for investments and investors to give this agreement some teeth the mai was intended to be legally binding and to contain provisions for settling disputes as whole the oecd favors eliminating most of the national rules governing inward and outward direct investment although oecd members want to retain exemptions for industries or sectors that individual countries deem to be important to their national security or of special national importance most oecd countries including the united states favor excluding some economic sectors from the standards of international investment agreements although the united states wants the number of such exclusions kept small and the vast majority of sectors left open and accorded national or unbiased treatment2 existing arrangements the mai would not have been the only international accord on foreign investment multilateral and bilateral agreements date back to at least the 1960s at the multilateral or multination level there are various arrangements the united states and other countries use to protect their investments abroad one type of arrangement is characterized by the treaties establishing the european community and the north american free trade agreement nafta second type of arrangement covers only foreign investment this group includes the oecd code of liberalization of capital movements and the code of liberalization of current invisible operations aside from these arrangements the oecd has issued two basic statements on foreign investment the declaration on international investment and multinational enterprises and the oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises the united states has also signed large number of bilateral friendship commerce and navigation treaties and bilateral or nationtonation investment treaties3 bilateral investment treaties generally are established on the principles of mostfavorednation mfn or nondiscriminatory treatment and national treatment for both the admission 2 oecd investment agreement unlikely to include major liberalization inside us trade january 23 1998 p 1 3 for additional information see crs report 9839 foreign investment treaties impact on direct investment by james k jackson crs3 and the subsequent treatment of investments but they include exceptions for industries or areas that are reserved for national security or for other national objectives scope of the mai despite various multilateral and bilateral arrangements the administration has supported the concept of new comprehensive investment agreement because not all of these investment treaties contain provisions for settling disputes moreover us and other multinational firms still encounter barriers discriminatory treatment and legal and regulatory uncertainties abroad despite the general trend toward reducing national restrictions on foreign investment also the lack of comprehensive agreement on investment means that investors face different legal regimes across borders which increases investors uncertainties and hampers the flow of investment funds some negotiators also apparently believed the mai could have spurred the development of an uptodate set of international rules that was intended to build on and reform the existing set of international principles unresolved issues over the course of their negotiations on the mai oecd ministers grew increasingly divided over various provisions which ultimately undermined the negotiations citizen and consumer groups also raised chorus of concerns over various provisions in the draft mai agreement and used the rapidly expanding communications afforded by the internet to band together and to persuade key negotiators and legislators in canada the united states france and other countries in europe to back away from the draft agreement political involvement by nongovernment groups or ngos in international economic issues is not unprecedented although their opposition to the mai seems to have been particularly intense in part this opposition was driven by concerns over the increased trade and financial ties that are developing among nations or the phenomenon of globalization also since number of international trade agreements including the world trade organization wto and the nafta incorporate such issues as intellectual property rights services and investments some of the ngos argued that the wall has been breached to address consumeroriented issues as well in international negotiations oecd members remained divided over number of other provisions of the agreement that undermined prospects for settlement issues of greatest concern involved technical legal questions and only indirectly involved economic issues of the perceived costs and benefits of joining an international agreement on investment within the united states us negotiators backed away from the draft mai agreement for number of reasons including uncertainty over the impact the dispute resolution process and the definition of national treatment would have had on state and local governments and concern over the way the mai would have incorporated the helmsburton act which prohibits investing in expropriated property4 national treatment one objective the negotiators had in drafting the mai was to create legal regime that would provide similar and fair treatment for investors across national borders as result the mai would have required the signatory countries to 4 us still engaged in mai exercise washington trade daily march 6 1998 p 3 crs4 apply national treatment and mfn treatment similar to the fundamental obligations nations adhere to in bilateral investment treaties and in such treaties as nafta within the context of the mai the definitions of national treatment and mfn treatment are that the parties to the mai will treat foreign investors less favorably than they treat their own investors national treatment and the parties will not discriminate among the investors or investments of different mai parties mfn treatment5 some critics argued that this definition harbored vast numbers of potential legal problems for state and local governments which could have faced suits from foreign firms that object to state consumer and environmental legislation and nationtonation disputes that involve economic sanctions some critics contended that applying the standard of national treatment would have challenged the current practice by state and local governments of discriminating between firms based on their environmental labor and other corporate practices thereby sharply curtailing the ability of these jurisdictions to exercise control over events within their own borders these and similar consumer concerns gained widespread exposure through the internet and coalesced around lobby of nongovernment organizations against the agreement opponents concerns appeared to be heightened by the perception that the agreement was being negotiated in secret although nationtonation trade and investment agreements often are negotiated behind closed doors until the agreement is submitted to congress dispute resolution dispute resolution procedures in the agreement raised concern among some us critics of the mai according to the draft mai agreement the dispute resolution process would have covered both governmentgovernment and investor government disputes while nearly all parties recognize the need for an established legal process to resolve statestate disputes opinions are fragmented and contradictory over the need advisability and legal implications of adopting formal process to resolve investor state disputes for instance some critics argued that the dispute resolution process protected the rights of multinational firms but offered protection or even role for consumers and citizens they believed the mai process could have forced state and local governments to face firms in legal proceedings in unfriendly international arbitral tribunals over state setaside programs for minority groups or targeted economic programs or even over zoning changes which could be challenged as expropriation although some critics disagreed with the procedures outlined in the mai draft for resolving disputes many of the methods are currently in use for one the mai encouraged the parties involved in dispute to settle the dispute by negotiation or consultation if this approached failed an investor could have sought resolution by referring to any competent courts or tribunals of the contracting party in accordance with any dispute settlement process agreed upon prior to the dispute arising6 or by arbitration under the icsid7 international convention on the settlement of investment 5 definitions are taken from the mai site on the world wide web wwwoecdorgdafcmismaifaqmaihtm copy of draft version of the mai agreement is available at

continued crs5 disputes convention the uncitral8 united nations commission on international trade law rules of arbitration or the international chamber of commerce rules of arbitration9 national exceptions major sticking point between the united states and european members was the number and types of exceptions other oecd members were requesting from the agreement10 us negotiators pushed to allow only those exceptions which are based on specific government laws and regulations while european countries leaned towards exceptions for entire sectors of their economies11 the european commission pressed for an exemption for regional economic integration organizations reio that would have allowed european union eu governments to retain preferential treatment for other eu members if the policies had been part of the eus integration program in turn the united states requested an exemption for government procurement policies and for subsidies canada and france also requested broad exemptions for cultural issues this stance in particular caused other oecd members to believe the agreement that was emerging was retreat from rather than an improvement on the current system canada and some of the eu members wanted the whole issue of investment taken up by the wto rather than by the oecd so that developing countries could participate fully in the negotiations us negotiators opposed this move because they believe that it would have reopened the agreement for negotiation thereby jeopardizing agreements reached at that point and that it would have placed the agreement in the even more unwieldy wto where it likely is now headed where disagreements between developed and developing countries would have added to the unresolved issues between the developed countries12 extraterritoriality or the helmsburton act some opponents of the mai expressed concern that the agreement would have allowed foreigners to challenge us foreign policy goals that rely on economic sanctions in particular they argued that the mai could have prevented the united states from adopting such legislation as the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity act of 1996 pl 104114 commonly

that holds liable for monetary damages in us federal court any person or government that traffics in us property confiscated by the cuban government the right to sue under this provision however has been suspended the law also bans foreign executives from the united states if their companies traffic in expropriated former us property in cuba canada and european union members strongly oppose the law because they believe it is an extraterritorial application of us law in late may the united states and the european union announced that they had reached an agreement on the helmsburton act13 under the terms of the agreement the administration reportedly will submit legislative proposal to congress that would amend the helmsburton act to allow the president at his discretion to grant waivers to the act to eu members who have signed onto expropriation guidelines that would have been attached to the mai in return the eu signatories would deter new investments in illegally expropriated properties around the world the two sides agreed to set up an international registry of cases of expropriation including the nearly 4000 cases of expropriation in cuba conclusions the mai likely would have offered both costs and benefits on the benefit side an internationally agreed upon set of investment rules potentially could reduce some of the confusion and uncertainty us firms face as they invest overseas such an agreement likely would help us firms that are investing in both developed and developing countries and would aid them in gaining access to markets abroad while these actions likely will not boost us employment in the short run they may help sustain or even enhance us wages and incomes on the cost side an international investment agreement could stalemate further progress toward reducing national restrictions and controls by setting in place status quo that could become entrenched in practice and less subject to change than the present situation an investment agreement among the developed countries could further add to existing tensions between the developed and the developing economies over foreign investment many of the developing countries often view international investment agreements as protective measures established by the richest economies the oecd members to preserve their economic status relative to the developing economies by limiting the amount of investment that flows to those economies furthermore domestically states and localities might face set of requirements that they are unwilling to assume which could lead to the defeat of an agreement these issues likely will surface more fully if the wto addresses as expected in the year 2000 the issue of an international investment agreement 13 administration to offer
