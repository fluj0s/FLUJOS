cold war the rise of china globalization free trade agreements the war on terror and an institutional pproach to keeping the peace are causing dramatic shifts in relationships among countries in east asia new regional architecture in the form of trade financial and political arrangements among countries of east asia is developing that has significant implications for us interests and policy this report examines this regional architecture with focus on china south korea japan and southeast asia the types of arrangements include bilateral free trade agreements ftas regional trade pacts currency and monetary arrangements and political and security arrangements the east asian regional architecture is supported by two distinct legs the economic leg is strong and growing more intense web of bilateral and regional ftas is developing an east asian ec onomic community with 13 nations an east asian fta with 16 nations and an asia pacific fta with 21 nations are being discussed in contrast the political and security leg remains relatively underdeveloped the most progress has been made with the association of south east asian nations playing the role of convener and has take n the form of the asean security community 10 south east asian nations and asean regional forum 25 nations including the united stat in northeast asia the sixparty talks aimed at resolving the north korean nuclear program are ongoing as us policy toward economic and security arrangements in east asia evolves it is turning on matters of intensity inclusiveness and final structure should the united states intensify its fforts to either hinder or support the architecture who should be included in the arrangements should the groupings be exclusively asian on the economic si current us policy appears to hedge by not trying to block attempts to creat exclusive asian ftas but doing deals to keep from being cut out from their benefits on the security side us interest in stability counterterrorism nd nonproliferation in east asia is so great that the united states has sought seat at the table when asians meet to talk and often leads in attempts to resolve contentious issues the east asian summit excluded the united states but washington has called fo r northeast asia regional forum that would include the united states chin russia japan and south korea at the core of us concern over the developing regional architecture in east asia is the growing influence of china danger exists that if china comes to dominate regional institutions in east asia it could steer them down path inimical to us interests some asian nations however are wary of excessive chinese influence and are hedging and maneuveri ng against possible chinese dominance the final question for the policy liberations on trade and security arrangements in east asia is what form the architecture will take the industrialized world seems to be evolving into three distinct blocs but transpacific trade and security arrangement is possible this report will be updated periodicallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33653contents r s h u f f l i n g t h s i n d c k 5 w h j i n t g t h r 6w h t r r g i n l t r d g r m n t s 9r

2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33653east asian regional architecture new economic and security arrangements and us policy the shrinking of the remnants of the co ld war in asia is causing fundamental rethinking of interests nd relationships among the c ountries and economies of east asia for half century following world war ii east asia was divided into two blocs communism on one side confronting the united states and us allies on the other smaller countries at sundry times we re ensnared in the confrontation and in cases such as in korea and in vietnam the great power rivalry manifested itself in intense but limited warfare international trade patterns tended to follow political alliances with the american market serving both as the anchor of the asia pacific economy and as the preferred export des tination for many of the noncommunist countries now tectonic shift is occurring in the ndscape in east asia five forces are driving these shifts 1 the rise reemergence of china and its jockeying for influence and leadership with japan and south korea and other asian countries 2 globalization and the cross border expansion of corpor ations and supply chains including supplies of energy and raw materials 3 liberalized trade and investment flows 4 the global war on terrorism and 5 the rise of the european security model keeping the peace through progressive institution building and increased stakeholder relationships to challenge balanceofpower realism keeping the peace through confrontational stalem ate among big powers the purpose of this report is to examin the developing regional architecture the growing trade financial and political arrangements among c ountries of east asia and what that implies for us interests and policy the focus is on china south korea japan and southeast asia with so mention of links with australia and new zealand the types of arrangements include bilateral free trade agreements ftas regional trade pacts currency and monetary arrangements and political and security arrangements the east asian regional architecture is supported by two distinct legs the economic leg is strong and growing more in tense web of free trade and regional monetary agreements is devel oping rapidly it is driven primarily by the quest for business profits for economic stability nd for high rates of economic growth while east asia lags behind north america and the european union in the extent and depth of economic integr ation the region is catching up quickly despite strong historical animosities that chill otherwise warm economic relations particularly among northeast asian nations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33653crs2 1 the association of southeast asian nations or asean is an economic and political association that includes its five 1967 foundi ng members indonesia malaysia philippines singapore and thailand plus five countries who joined later brunei vietnam laos burmamyanmar and cambodia 2 the security side of asean 3 the 25 participants in arf include the ten members of asean the united states china japan european union russia australia canada new zealand south korea north korea india pakistan mongolia papua new guinea and east timoreast asia is home to many of the mo st dynamic economies in the world and competition is intensifying to join in regional trade agreements beginning with the asean1 fta in 1992 an agreement that lowered but did not eliminate intraregional tariffs the momentum for c ountries in asia to conclude ftas both among themselves and with countries outside the region has been increasing singapore in particular ready has ftas with ten nations and is negotiating half dozen more indonesia thailand malaysia the philippines and vietnam in asean as well as japan south korea and taiwan also have been reaching out to establish free trade with willing partner countries china also has ridden the crest of fta fever with notable deal with asean the political and security leg of the east asian regional architecture remains relatively underdeveloped the most progre ss has been made with asean playing the role of convener and has taken the form of the asean security community2 and asean regional forum arf3 in northeast asia the sixparty talks aimed at resolving the north korean nuclear program have been operating in fits and starts on an ad hoc basis unlike closer economic ties that tend to benefit both sides positive sum security arrangements may pull in st rategic competitor countries in an attempt to resolve difficult issues that benefit one at the expense of another zerosum political and security fora furthermore usually exclude the very officials most involved with security issues the military in asia military relations tend to be conducted on countrytocount ry basis rather than through regional institutions regional security meetings tend to be attended by foreign affairs ministers or their representatives rather than by defense chie fs and they often result in talk and photo ops rather than in actual problem solving or confidence building still pressures for greater security cooperation are being driv by the boom in economic interchange and its concomita nt requirement for political stability also the transnational character of security threats particularly with terrorism illegal narcotics and weapons proliferation and need to repl ace the cold war structure with something more cooperative and less prone to generating hostility beg for politicalsecurity organization for east asia that is less pr ocessoriented meetings and more directed toward functions and achieving concrete results asia moreover still is rife with nationalism and power riva lries operating in 20th century fashion with interstate conflicts and territorial disputes flaring up on occasion as us policy toward economic and security arrangements in east asia evolves it is turning on matters of intensity inclusiveness and final structure the whole region is moving toward formaliz ing trading and inve stment relationships through free trade agreements or other such preferential trading arrangements thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33653crs3 further development of these ftas is likely to proceed regardless of us action the united states also is in this game with the koreaus fta awaiting legislative approval and negotiati ons ongoing albeit fitfully w ith malaysia and thailand plus existing ftas with singapore and australia the united states further is working toward an fta with asean as whole may consider regional fta with chile new zealand singapore and brunei vari ous interest groups also have pushed for ftas with taiwan and japan any change in us fta policy therefore seems one of intensity rather than direction stion is whether the united states should speed up the work by the us trade representative to conclude more ftas with asian economies continue with the status quo or halt further efforts the questions of intensity and inclusiv eness dovetail with each other as the intensity of fta negotiations rises the question of inclusiveness looms ever larger it is clear that many in asia wish for an asianonly organization that would be counterweight to the european uni on and the north american free trade agreement american interests in asia however are so deeply ingrained and the american presence so large that some argue that american interests need to be represented whenever asians meet if the united states is not there some feel that china will assume the leadership mantle and work at cross purposes to american interests should future asian fta for example include only east asia or should it cross the pacific ocean as the asia pacific economic cooperation forum does for example some are proposing an as ean 3 china japan and south korea fta others may see instead an asean 4 fta to include the united states japan has proposed 16nation asia free trade area to be coordinated by an organization similar to the organi zation for economic cooperation and development the 16 nations would include the ten members of the association of southeast asian nations japan china s outh korea india australia and new zealand current us policy is to conclude bilateral ftas with individual asian countries and work toward both u sasean fta that would serve as counterweight to the chinaasean fta now being implemented and an fta of the asiapacific fta ft aap proposed by the united states in 2007 such trans pacific fta is one of the main goals of the 21nation asia pacific economic cooperation apec forum whose membersh ip includes the united states asean china japan south korea taiwan canada and mexico the reality with asian nations is that some do not have the institutional and industrial development necessary for comprehensive fta that meets us standards with some countries therefor the united states can negotiate toward an fta malaysia and thailand but with ot hers tifa is more appropriate trade and investment framework agreement that may specify areas for improvement needed before considering an fta and with some countries such as vietnam bilateral trade agreement that may establish normal trading relations status and other basic conditions in the relations hip may be more appropriate by relying primarily on bilateral ftas with asian nations the united states seems to be hedging its bets not trying to block attempts to create exclusive east asian ftas but doing deals to keep from being cut out from their benefits the danger seems remote at this time that an exclusive and inward looking trade bloc willhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33653crs4 emerge in east asia the spaghetti strands of the ftas in the region curl around both within asia and across the oceans on the security side the issues of intensity and inclusiveness have more direct bearing on us national interests the united states already is viewed as hegemonic power in asia with as many as 100000 military personnel forward deployed in the pacific command and strong alliance relationships with japan south korea the philippines thailand and aust ralianew zealand plus close security relations with singapore and taiwan east asia includes countries with three of the worlds six largest armed forces those of china north korea and south korea russia also is nearby china is nuclear power and north korea has tested single nuclear weapon in addition japan is upgradi ng its defense forces terrorist attacks are frequent in southeast asia and flashpoi nts exist along the taiwan strait and on the korean peninsula us security interests in east asia are so great that in issues related to asian security the united states has sought seat at the table and often leads in attempts to resolve contentious issues the united states has joined with tokyo and seoul in calling for northeast asia regional forum that would include the united states china russia japan and south korea this forum counterpart to the asean regional forum that also incl udes these countries pl us others could institutionalize cooperation in northeast asia on issues related to security energy or disease there also is some discussi on of linking the major democracies in the region united states japan australia nd india in some form of regional organization at the core of us concern over the developing regional architecture in east asia is the growing influence of china beijing ims to reclaim its position as the leader of asia it already is displacing japan and the united states among southeast asian nations as their primary trading pa rtner and an increasing source of economic assistance it also has pursued charm offensive that appears to be winning the hearts and minds of many people in the countries there china has accomplished this through skillful diplomacy use of aid resources by presenting more friendly face and also through formal trade and other agreements the danger exists that if china comes to dominate regional institutions in east asia it could steer them down path inimical to us interests much as beijing has already done with the shanghai cooperation organization in the future when security issues arise in east asia policymakers may face question will c ountries look toward the united states or toward china for solution chinese recent successes however shoul d not be over emphasized the united states still is the worlds preeminent military and economic pow er and while many global supply chains include china th ey also include the united states particularly in produc t design technology and mark eting although asian nations are seeking to broaden international options with major powers they also engage in continuing round of hedgin g and maneuvering for adva ntage and against possible chinese dominance in this process they are seeking closer ties with each other andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33653crs5 4 sutter robert chinas rise implications fo r us leadership in asia eastwest center washington policy studies 21 2006 p viiixalso with the united states the united states still is seen as the regions security stabilizer and economic partner of choice4 the final question for the policy deliberations on trade and security arrangements in east asia is what form the architecture will take this includes whether the economic and security organiza tions are to be sepa rate or merged how countries are to be groupe d where the center will be located and how much voice each participant will have so far us policy has been to allow the asian nations to take the lead in proposing various orga nizations most have either an economic or security focus or are divided into tw parts one addressing trade and possibly leading to an fta and another to address security issues reshuffling the asian deck the end of the cold war and demise of communism triggered two revolutionary movements the first was political symbolized by the fall of the berlin wall and the breakup of the former soviet uni on the second was economic symbolized by the privatization of stat eowned enterprises the loosening of centralized control and adoption of market principles not only in the former soviet union but in east asian countries such as china and viet nam on the economic side global consensual philosophy is now evolving th at the economic system that provides the highest growth rates greatest consumer sa tisfaction and best st andard of living is marketbased with private ownership access to global markets freedom of capital movement and government interventionregulation primarily in cases of market failure autocratic governme nts moreover have found that they can use the market system and the growth it generates to gain legitimacy repress opposition fund military expansion and build na tionalistic pride in their countries even with the uneven income distribution and potential fo r conflict between the haves and have nots caused by rapid economic growth g overnments increasingly are placing their policy bets on globalization international trade and industrialization to raise standards of living and garner popular political support eventually moreover experts see economic growth as creating middle class and competing power centers wherever it occurs this arguably leads to more democratic societies and less chance of military confrontation with the i ndustrialized countries of the world during the cold war trade patterns followed security relationships the united states became major if not the main trading partner of japan south korea taiwan and several countries of southeast asia communist countries likewise gravitated to china and the soviet union and were rewarded with special trade credits currently however those trade patterns have change d globalization knows political philosophy businesses seek low cost high quality production bases regardless of where they are located china is rapidly becoming the preferred manufacturing

crisscrossed by bilateral and re gional preferential trade agreements during the cold war the security overlay for countries often coincided with the philosophy underlying the organization of government nd their economies communist blocs arose among socialist c ountries while the united states formed explicit and tacit alliances with the more marketoriented economies on one side was usled

with japan south korea taiwan the philippines thailand au stralia and new zealand in type of hub and spoke configuration this usprotected bloc k dominated peripheral asian and pacific ocean countries on the other side wa s communist china that shared hostility toward the united states with the soviet union and dominated the interior of the asian land mass china and the soviet union supported countries with communist governments such as north korea and rth vietnam the result was bifurcation of east asia into usdominated and communistdominated blocs with some countries attempting to follow more inde pendent paths the two sides intersected with balance of power regionally that rived from the cold war balance of terror globally some intraasian or world organizations existed but none of them could effectively deal with overarching secur ity political or economic issues in asia the political and security arrangements that were formed among east asian nations moreover tended to be antichina or anticommunist in nature asean or seato south east asia treaty organization5 are two cases in point currently however the economic and political arrangem ents are crossing philosophical lines and china is emerging as regional hegemon in asia these changes are manifest in intraasian organizations such as the east asia summit asean economic community asean 3 asean plus china japan and

institution with global sovereignty existed now international laws and norms have been established and institutions eg the united nations exist but these institutions wield sovereignty only to the extent that individual countries cede power to them in many cases primary benefit of such institutions is to provide mechanism to resolve international disputes provide non hegemonic peacekeeping forces and to brin g countries face to face in diplomatic setting rather than on the battlefield on the economic side the space above na tional economies also is anarchic but unlike many zerosum security exchanges such as conquering territory international economic transactions are positive sum and usually provide gains for businesses and consumers on both sides in cases however private trading gains may conflict with national policies such as in illicit trade the role of nations in legitimate economic activity is to provide the crucible for it to occur to facilitate it to regulate it and in some cases own it in facilitating trade in the anarchic space among nations for example governments establish trading rule s and cede preferential benefits to other nations through formal mechanisms these include granting normal trade relations mostfavored nation status establishi ng the world trade organization wto adopting free trade agreements or organizing special financial

influence the end of the cold war brought unipolarity with the united states sitting at the t op asian nations recognize that the united states will continue to exercise major influence in the region but beijing in particular sees the formation of an exclusive asian organization as an opportunity to help reclaim what it considers to be its historical position as the regional leader in asia china also would like to weaken the relationships between the united states ja pan and south korea india also and see countries in asia more ac quiescent to its own desires7 asean likewise sees itself as more neutral party in the big power riva lry as this plays out in asia and moving force for regionalism southeast asians obs erve that it matters not whether the big elephants are courting or fighting in th process the surrounding spectators can get trampled east asia also has unique history that plays into the interaction among nations and the composition of any regional organiza tion historically there have been two major models that linked east asian c ountries the first occurred when china considered itself the central kingdom and sat atop hierarchy as superior state whose values and culture spread throughout the region this sinocentric order required surrounding countries to treat chin somewhat like the head of family and to pay respects and tribute to peking the second model came under

scholars have long observe d the relationship between economic interaction and warfare democratic peace hypothesis states that democratic nations particularly liberal democratic nations almost never go to war with one another recent academic studies of the results of economic interdependence and security indicate the following among nations the greater the interdependence the greater the costs of exiting from an economic relati onship the greater the probability that the nations will not seek political demands that could lead to conflict on the other hand econo mic interdependence also can be used as leverage to extract political demands9 the greater the extent that internationally oriented co alitions in country actors with interest in expanding foreign markets or in importing have political clout the more likely that outside economic incentives or sanctions will be effective in influencing policy in the country in question10 the more democratic and market oriented country is the more likely this will occur the expectation of future commercial gains between nations helps to dampen political tensions and deter the onset of hostilities such future gains are enhanced by preferential trading arrangements such as ftas membership in preferential trading arrangements tends to inhibit interstate conflict11 economic and security arrangem ents increase opportunities for

direct diplomacy and backchanne l communications on the other hand economic arrangements may increase competition for domestic industries and invite bl owback from trade liberalization what are regional trade agreements the motivation for trade and financial agreements is usually to gain benefits for exports imports or investments that ar not available through global concessions agreed to multilaterally through the wto under wto rules bilateral and regional trade agreements can lower barriers betw een signatory countries but cannot raise barriers to other economies trade agreements have both trade diversion and trade creation effects they divert existing trade toward the signatory countries but also ma create more trade overall12 free trade and other trade agreements also may lock in market access or other benefits provided by one government in country that are under risk of being withdrawn by successive governments th ey also may induce governments to take politically difficult actions such as opening agricultural markets or providing labor rights or protection for the environment any change in the rules of trade however creates both winners and lose rs those who can take advantage of the new trading regime and those who are hurt by it there usually will be some economic actors particularly declining or noncompetitive i ndustries or certain labor groups that are protected from international competition unde r an existing trade regime that will be worse off if that protection is eliminated by freetrade agreement environmental or other interests also may be threatened by more trade eg logging of old growth forests as with the european union or the north american free trade area preferential trade arrangements usually follow trading patterns ftas do not

to fight terrorism separatism and extremism chinas initial motive for establishing the sco seems to have been to prevent ethnic kazakhs or uighurs in china from using central asian states as haven from which to plan separatist activities in chinas xinjiang uighur aut onomous region formerly east turkestan as the sco has developed how ever it appears now to be vehicle for china and russia to curb us influence in central asia in order to establish joint sphere of influence there this includes access to ener gy resources by china as well as markets for exports and collaboration against islamist movements69 as china russia and other sco members have c onducted war games under the auspices of the sco some observers have pointed out the potential for it to take on military role not unlike that of the north atlantic treaty organization70 as the sco has entered into its fourth and fifth years of existence it seems to have become an effective vehicle fo r beijing and moscow to pursue geopolitical aims it was the first regional bloc to oppose the bid by japan brazil germany and india to enlarge the united nations secu rity councils permanent membership in 2005 the sco called for date certain for us troops to be out of central asia and at the 2006 summit the iranian president while not mentioning the united states by name spoke against the threat of domineering powers and their aggressive interference in global affairs71 in 2007 the sco conducted extensive joint military exercises in russia using the most mode rn weapons and equipment given that beijing plays primary role in giving direction to the sco the way that the sco has developed might provide clue s to the direction other regional organizations such as asean 3 might take if china is able to assume dominant position both china and russia however insist that the sco is not bloc that is directed against any third forces or countries in june 2007 the chinese defense minister emphasized that the sco is

since then this is another venue in which china is able to cooperate with other na tions and take the lead in dealing with an issue directly affecting its national interests and on its border the talks resumed in septembe r 2006 and in 2007 showed considerable progress the talks are yet to succeed in curtailingeliminating north koreas nuclear weapons program but they have brought together the major players in northeast asia to seek solution to the problem73 the proposed northeast asia regional forum some have suggested that the five count ries excluding the dprk in the six party talks formalize this ad hoc grouping into what might be called the northeast asia regional forum nerf as proposed by one group of authors the purpose of nerf would be to organize multilateral diplomatic meetings at regular intervals to consider key security energy health and economic issues in the region the state representatives attending woul d have the same di plomatic level as those in the six

situation this was he ld in lieu of session of the sixparty talks since north korea at the time was refusing to attend them76 major problem in east asia is that differences among china japan russia the united states and south korea are so vast that the only time the countries get together and work toward common end is when they all face single problem large enough that they are willing to put aside thei r strategic rivalries and cooperate to find mutually satisfactory solution the trouble with this approach is that ad hoc organizations such as the sixparty talks come into existence only

disputes also are flaring up over islands or resources in various east asian areas one author points out that every major qaeda plot since 1993 has had some link to radical muslim groups in the philippines82 asia also plays an essential role in americas economic well being globalization and the growth of supply links that cross the pacific ocean have woven the us and asian economies into an intermeshed and interdependent tapestry whose threads are constantly bein g adjusted the population of east asia at 21 billion accounts for third of the total 62 billion pe ople on earth if the indian subcontinent is added asia accounts for more than half of the worlds population these countries both compete with and complement the us economy for the many exporting countries in east asia the united states is the market of last resort and the source of much of their capital technology and id eas for product design the us market however is rapidly being displaced by china and intraregional trade among the asian countries themselves chinas rapi d growth also is generating huge demand for limited natural resources and pushing up their prices asia is major competitor for global energy supplies and is source of some new infectious diseases avian flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars that can threaten the essential well being of americans another challenge for the united states with respect to east asia is that trans pacific economic and financia l relationships are fundame ntally unbalanced china japan south korea and taiwan alone account for about 40 of the us merchandise trade deficit those same c ountries have become major financiers of us budget and saving deficits many us jobs once thought s ecure also are being outsourced to asia and some asian nations have lax

taiwan strait and on the korean peninsul reducing the terrorist threat working for equitable trade and investment relati ons protecting americans from new threats such as human avian flu pandemic and developing sufficient supplies of energy and raw materials needed for economies to grow85 the policy tools the united states can use include both hard and soft power military threats and action diplomacy po litical and economic alliances trade and investment measures and the spread of ideas and ideals the means to wield the tools include engagement cooperating with but not joining cooptation joining with them or bringing them into an exis ting organization containment hindering progress and rollback seeking to turn back gains already made the means also include wielding an array of military activities including preemptive strikes and an assortment of lawenforcement and di plomatic measures for purposes of this report the focus is on engagement and cooptation through fo rmal international arrangements as means to accomplish us policy goals the importance of considering these changes in east asia was stated by kurt campbell an expert on security affairs he said that while the most important issue facing the united states today is the war on terrorism in 20 or 25 years we may find that the dominant issue of today in retrospect was actually the rise of china and that

chinas charm implications of chinese soft power carnegie endowment for international peace policy brief 47 june 2006international economics and national defense university scholar who long has followed asian security and economic issues stated if the united states continues to downplay asian regional arrangements demonstrating an attitude of benign neglect and preference for bilateral agreements only it will gradually lose influence especially relative to china87 in short the ultimate driver of us concern over east asian regional arrangements lies in us strategic relations with the prc the core question for many analysts ther efore is what to do about the growing influence of china in asia what is clear is that china sees itself as regional economic and military power it is aiming to establish its position as the leader of asia is already displacing japan and the united states among southeast asian nations as the primary trading partner nd source of economic assistance and has pursued charm offensive that appears to be winning the hearts and minds of people in many of the countries there china has accomplished this through skillful diplomacy use of aid resources and by presenting more friendly face but it also has relied on formal trade and other agreements nevertheless the united states still is the dominant military power in asia as one observer noted the danger in this rise of china as friendly economic giant is that countries in the region could subordinate their interests to chinas nd longer reflexively look to the united states for regional solutions88 in the sixparty talks for example some have suggested that the united states is outsourcing its leadership role to china in addressing the issue of growing regionalism in east asia there are first two basic questions 1 what is the us visi on for asia and asian regionalism and 2 does asian regionalism threaten us interests and goals particularly with respect to china visions for east asia currently several visions for east asia are competing for traction as the spaghetti strands expand in the east asian bowl of trade and security arrangements the vision of the united states begins with preeminent position for the country both as the keeper of the peace wellsprin g for economic prosperity an advocate for open markets and role model for social cultural and political values the united states shares leadership with other nations and institutions but it seeks seat at the table when decisions are made affecting its interests in east asia us goals are to prevent any other single power from domin ating asia to maintain peace and stability through combination of military presence alliances diplomatic initiatives and economic interdependence and to increase access for us exports and companieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33653crs31 89 see for example qiang shen new velopments in evolving relationships among major powers international strategic studies 3rd issue 2005 p 54through

attain status in the world community of nations commensurate with its position as one of the five permanent memb ers of the security council and population comprising sixth of global human ity china sees us decline as the corollary to its rise89 and seeks to displace japan as th economic leader of east asia chinas strategy is to foster favorable conditions for continuing its modernization while also reducing the perception that its rise threatens the interests of others china needs peace and stability in the region while it grows and resolves numerous internal economic political and social problems beijing recognizes that the united states is perhaps the only power that can thwa rt its plans to bring taiwan under its sovereign control or can impose system of economic sanctions that could cripple its economic and military rise china prefers an exclusive east asian regional organization that would enable it to take the lead and place the united states and japan in secondary roles paramount in chinas vision is region in which countries respect what it considers to be its territorial integrity including its claim to taiwan allow for flows of trade and investment nece ssary to sustain its high rates of growth and not interfere with what it considers to be its internal affairs japans vision for east asia is one in which the united states continues to provide nuclear umbrella for the regi on and in which tokyo relies on its economic power to exercise leadership it seeks to be normal nation w ithout vestiges of its defeat in world war ii particularly the selfmaintained constraints on its military japan would like to bury its world war ii history and be viewed as peaceful nation and force for betterment in asia through economic progress prior to the resurgence of china japan characterized the countries of east asia as flying in wild geese migrating pattern with japan playing the role of the lead goose tokyo recognizes now that beijing is rapidly assuming the leadership role in east asia and china is becoming the center of gravity for trade and investment activity japan however would like to maintain position of leadership in asia accommodate chinas rise without becoming subservient to it and continue to be at the forefront in economic and financial affairs japan is attempting to establish itself as normal advanced nation in its own right and not as surrogate in east asia for the united states asean s vision for east asia is to deve lop counterweight to the european union and nafta and perhaps nato with asean taking prominent organizational role for regional institutions and providing venues for meetings asean also seeks c ounterweight to china in the region and in general is more inclusive in terms of allowing countries ch as australia and

was to oppose its foundi ng through diplomatic and other means the second was to join with australia in pushing for apec more inclusive organization with the momentum for regi onalism now growing in east asia and world wide opposing the trend toward regionalism seems both unnecessary and futile the important factor some say is to ensure that us interests are protected and adequately represented and to connect the us economy with asian free trade arrangements through bilatera l and other fta agreements asian regionalism and us interests economic interests as for us interests in east asia the new regional trade agreements in and of themselves do not seem to threaten vital us economic interests as state department official put it it is not necessary for the united states to be in every room and every conversation that as ians have with one another the united states does however want to ensure the strongest possible continuing us engagement in the region the united states also holds that the strategic and economic geography through wh ich asia can best build on its successes so far is through transpacific partnerships and institutions in other words the united states would like for asian institutions to straddle the pacific cean rather than stopping at the international date lin in the pacific the united states also looks toward multilatera l structures in the asiapacific region that strengthen existing partnerships particularly bilateral us security alliances and free trade agreements with east asian nations93 the asean fta and the many bilateral ftas may result in some diversion of trade and investment from the united states but to the extent that they represent true liberalization of trade and investment fl ows and as long as the united states continues to ink bilateral fta agreements with asian nations they do not seem to be generating ill effects on us exporters and business interests there if the enlarged asian markets and marketing opportunities divert some asian exports toward the region instead of toward the united states the ftas may result in ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33653crs34 reduction in us bilateral trade deficits with asian nations there is some concern that the proliferation of bilateral and regional ftas will detract from multilateral negotiations under the world trade organizati on while that concern is real given the problems with the doha round and its collapse in mid2006 the opposite case also can be made in this view the ftas represent real progress in liberalizing trade and can serve as backup position if tr ade liberalization under the wto fails the spaghetti bowl problem of multiple agreements all intertwined but each with different provisions can actually hinder rather than facilitate trade by raising transaction costs for businesses calcula ting complicated rules of origin for products with parts from many countries each with different tariff rate s and phasein periods for lowering those tariffs can be costly and bothersome the us approach is to have gold standard template that provides for similar elimination of all tariffs and addresses other barriers to economic interaction such as liberalizing investment flows enforcing intellectual property rights and increasing access for providers of services eventually this gold standa rd template could pr ovide the basis for regional ftas that include the united states us adherence to this gold standard however can create ill will as the united states is perceived to be excessively intrusive in requiring reforms in ftas the asia pacific economic cooperation forum however also is developing best practices and model measures for ftas that are working to standardize agreements problem with any liberalization of tr ade and investment is that each economy will have winners and losers the losing sectors typically are agriculture textiles and apparel in nearly all asia pacific c ountries including the united states they are either protected to some extent or subsidized heavily particularly agriculture the proliferation of ftas threatens the econo mic viability of these sectors since the ftas remove protection although each fta will have phasein periods and exceptions security interests the developing regional s ecurity arrangements in east asia could have mixed effect on us security interests to the extent that they encourage peaceful resolution of conflicts they correlate well with us goals of stability and the maintaining of alliance re lationships in the region they however could have some negative effects they may lead to political and security arrangements in which chinese influence is large and beijing is able to work at cross purposes to the united states they also ma require further consideration of the role of us forces based in japan and south korea as asian populations perceive that external threats to their countries have diminished because of cooperative regional security relations they may question the n eed to continue to support so many us troops stationed in their home countries th sentiments often are reflected in what is called rising nationalism and may take th

regional affairs for example china s joined with the united states in opposing radical muslim terrorism albeit with its own domestic interests at stake performed the function of host and pe nholder to draft the joint statement at the september 2005 sixparty talks and has stopped forcibly claiming dis puted territory between it and southeast asian nations such as mischi ef reef in the south china sea china still has overt disputes with japan nation with which it has refrained from establishing either preferential economic or bilateral security links in some cases moreover beijing has used regional meetings to exacer bate problems with japan at the 2005 apec leaders meeting chin refused to hold bilateral summit with japan and widened the gap between them yet at the july 2006 asean ministerial meeting the foreign ministers of china and japan did meet and narrowed that gap somewhat what can be said is that one know s for certain whether china will be military threat in the future and what effect various regional ties and interaction will have it is clear however that chinese military strategists define grand strategy in broad sense they pursue their grand st rategy by using overall national strength to achieve political goals especially those related to national security and development put another way chinese strategy as they define it is one of maintaining balance among competing priorities for national ec onomic development nd maintaining the type of security environment within which such development can occur beijing uses the concept of comprehensive national power to evaluate and measure the countrys national standing in relation to other nations this includes qualitative and quantitative measures of territory natural resources economic power diplomatic

united states many government elites and growing segment of the public have recently been pushing for more independence of action and for government policies more in line with their not americas national interests the value system of unfettered democracy free trade and human rights buttressed by the ever present threat of intervention and preemption by the us military also seems to be wearing thin in many asian nations there is not the hatred of the united states that is frequently found in the middle east but east asian nations often chafe under the weight of us hege mony and perceived unipolar world and all that this implies for their independence of action and what they view as their traditional values97 for example in june 2006 pew survey of attitudes toward the united states

alliances and forward deployed troops to look to us security interests many feel that regional organizations tend toward being talk shops anyway the united states could disengage from regional institution building without disengaging fro m economic and secur ity ties with asia currently locus of opinion seems to be manifesting itself in the united states on this issue on the economic side however debate is intense over the effects and utility of free trade agreements opposition toward further ftas has been building in congress although congress did approve th usoman fta and usperu trade promotion agreement103 legitimate concerns however were raised with respect to issues such as the large us trade ficit outsourcing of jobs protection of intellectual property rights and labor and environmenta l conditions abroad us debate over future ftas appears to be more between domestic interests opposed to or in favor of more liberalized trade than over the geopolitical and international implications of closer econo mic relations with other c ountries the creation of an asia pacific fta encompassing the 21 apec nations including the united states seems distant an east asian economic community sean 3 fta or east asian fta asean 6 could divert trade away from the us market but the united states can continue to negotiate bilateral ftas with countries belonging to any asian regional trade arrangement system of bilateral ftas and security alliances emanating from the united states as hub should be able to poke s pokes into the various asian regional orga nizations existing and bein g proposed still the united states could use its influence to damp enthusiasm for new asian regional organizations or washington could let the asians wrestle with each other to determine the size shape and reach of any new institution danger of disengagement from institution building on the security side is that asian nations may see that as evidence that the united states is distracted by the middle east and has lost interest in asia disengagement also opens the way for china to assume leadership role and possibly to move the organization in ways that are inimical to us interests continue current engagement another option is to continue current policy of engagement in institution building in asia as pursued by the bush administration and congress this includes seeking bilateral ftas future fta with asean and future asia pacific fta strengthening the asean regional forum and the asia pacific economic cooperation forum holding discussions on establishing security forum for northeast asia and maintaining current stra tegic alliances with certain countries in the regionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33653crs39 104 see for example crs report rl33436 japanus relations issues for congress by emma chanlettavery mark manyin and william h cooper or crs report rl33567 korea uskorean relations issues for congress by larry niksch 105 see crs report rl32882 the rise of china and its effect on taiwan japan and south korea us policy choices by dick k nantocurrent us policy has evolved from hi storical conditions and through the tussle of political military and economic fo rces that drive decision making and provide opportunities for leaders to place th eir patina on the tenor of relations among nations the strategy of the united states at the present with respect to east asia appears to be based on two primary factors the first is the reality that the middle east takes priority over as ia the amount of new resources and energy the united states can devote to issues in east asia is constrained by commitments in iraq and afghanistan and by the war on terrorism the second factor seems to be that peace and prosperity in east asia is possible in the short run only if the united stat maintains strong military and political presence in the region and in the long r only if nations have political and economic systems that allow human ambition to be channeled into constructive and peaceful endeavors the us military presence in east asia is based on series of treaty alliances some of these alliances have required ma jor adjustment recently but they still form the bedrock of us security in asia104 as for the rise of china current us strategy seems to be to engage china but also to place constraints on activities potentially inimical to us security or economic interests both idealism and realism come into play the pentagons military planning of necessity tends to be power and threatbased and built on realism as lens through which to view the world it considers and prepares for several scenarios including the worst case in order to provide for the security interests of the united states these policies stress contingent military planning export controls strong alliance relations with japan and south korea and rising levels of engagement105 other us policies toward china tend to be based on an idea listic view of the world they are aimed at promoting us ideals of democracy liberal market economy and human rights in the long run matters of war and peace depend on actions of national governme nts or the lack thereof in this view conditions favorable for peace are generated most gene rally through political systems in nations with strong democratic institutions nd economic systems that are vibrant and marketoriented with liberal trading nd investment opportunities such economic systems support knowledgeable middle class that in turn forms the foundation for democratic society democratic society is less likely than dictatordominated state to seek to achieve its goals throug h belligerent means country without viable economy and functioni ng representative government also is vulnerable to becoming failed state and home to rrorist organizations this economic democraticpeace hypothesis calls for opening borders to foreign trade liberalizing domestic economies developing representa tive governments establishing the rule of law with court system to back it and reducing corruption this is major rationale for current us policies of liberalizing trade facilitating

information asean knowledge kit march 2005 http wwwas eansecorgtacknowledgekitpdfmembership in the world trade organization and other international institutions encouraging communications at all levels and engaging beijing on multitude of fronts including through regional institutions increase regional efforts third policy option overlaps with current policy somewhat and is more incremental than divergent it would be to increase efforts to energize or join existing organizations and to push harder fo r northeast asia regional forum the united states first could join the east asia summit russia india and australia already have signed the asean treaty of amity and cooperation required for membership so far the united states has not signed the treaty apparently because of its provisions that call fo r renunciation of the use of fo rce to settle disputes and commitment not to participate in any activity that threatens the sovereignty political and economic stability or territorial integrity of another contracting party106 such commitment s if honored potentially could obviate the doctrine of preemptive strikes and hamper other interventi ons based on use of force the united states could do more to reinvigorate apec at the 2006 apec leaders meeting in hanoi the united states did push for the asia pacific fta this would realize the bogor goal of ach ieving free and open trade and investment among the industrialized apec members by 2010 and the remainder of the members by 2020 while the apec working groups seem to be accomplishing considerable trade facilitation the large goal of establishi ng free trade area th at spans the pacific and includes the united states canada mexico japan south korea china taiwan australia singapore and other apec members does not seem even remotely feasible within three years as stated in the bogor declaration with the proposal for an east asia n economic community seeming to be gaining traction the industrialized world app ears to be coalescing into three bloc world three large geographical free trade areas north america europe and east asia how would potential east asian fta affect the united states judging from us relations with the european uni on the formation of the eu as trade bloc meant that the balance of economic power across the atlantic became more equal rather than the united states with its 125 trillion gross domestic product 144 trillion for nafta negotiating with th uk 22 trillion gdp or germany 28 trillion gdp the united states now faces an equal in the eu with its combined gdp of 134 trillion an east asian fta compassing 16 nations not only would constitute half the world population but combined gdp of 114 tr illion that is growing faster than either north america or europe realistically speaking however 16na tion asian fta would be far into the future if at all china and south korea are lukewarm to the idea and japan and south korea currently cannot even agree on an fta between themselves let alone one that includes china and 13 other nati ons more probable path for ftas nowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33653crs41 being implemented between asean and the other three nations to become structure for regional trade the asean fta becomes the center of hub and spoke network of ftas with the spokes japan china and south korea having more weight than the hub the possible inclusion of the united states into the transpacific strategic and economic partnership existing among the four countries of chile new zealand singapore and brunei is one proposal fo r trade and security arrangement that includes countries on both sides of the pacific such an arrangement along with the asean fta could form the nucleus for th fta of the asia pacific that would include the willing among the 21 members of the asia pacific economic cooperation forum on the security side another measure for us policy could be to convene conference to organize the northeast asia regional forum current proposals for membership are to invite countries with str ong interest in northeast asia such as the united states russia china japan south korea and north korea other possible candidates for membership are mongolia canada and taiwan as an observer current proposals are for such forum to be attended by foreign ministers attendance could be expanded to include defense ministers or heads of state as with apec in order to generate interest nd participation in such an organization an expectation would have to be establishe d that the organization would go beyond photoop and talk shop the organization could be aimed at resolving particular problems of common concern those that are tractable build confidence invite high level of participation by members and ma ximize benefits of coordinated collective action it could take up i ssues related to the north korean nuclear program currently the topic of the sixparty talks but also could address issues such as trade liberalization combating terrorism and co rruption energy security and containing the spread of infectious diseases it also could work toward resolving disputes related to history such as sponsoring the joint wr iting of textbooks on sensitive historical topics such as world wa r ii or japans annexation of korea
