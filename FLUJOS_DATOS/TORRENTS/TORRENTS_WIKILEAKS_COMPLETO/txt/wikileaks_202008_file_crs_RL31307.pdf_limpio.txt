funding for the corps civil works prog ram has often been contentious issue between the administration and congress with final appropriations typically providing more funding than requested re gardless of which political party controls the white house and congress for fy2001 for example congress adde d 480 million 12 to the 408 billion requested by the clinton administration similarly the fy2002 house bill funded th corps at almost 15 more than requested by the bush administration and the final act appropriated slightly more than that the fy2003 budget followed si milar pattern the request as presented in february 27 2002 testimony in the house recommended cut from current spending approximately 4 overall but 30 less for investigationstudies and 16 less for construction with virtually new starts in these two accounts during fiscal year 2003 request priorities tinued only projects with administration support not congressionally added projects from fy2002 that lacked favorable executive branch review such as wa ter supply assistance the senate appropriations committee report srept 107220 noted that four projects accounted for 30 of the administration s proposed general construction budget the budget proposal received considerable media attention in the wake of the march 2002 resignation of the assistant secr etary of the army for civil works who sets policy for the corps civil activities the resignation or dismissal by some accounts was reportedly over rift with the white house on the budget proposal the senate committee report noted that the absence of replacement for the assistant secretary resulted in the committee accepting written testimony from the administration in lieu of an oral statem ent the house report did not comment on the resignation per but both the senate and house reports expressed displeasure with the relatively low budget request project construction maintenance backlog the administration estimated the current project backlog for ongoing work at 21 billion and used this backlog in part to justify its new starts stance on construction the senate committee countered that the administration s request would cause the construction backlog to grow from 40 billion to 44 billi on and result in cr itical maintenance backlog of 884 million 182 million increase from fy2002 levels the house appropriations committee noted that many ongoing construction projects would be negatively impacted by the budget proposals it included in its recommendations several new constructi on projects and studies in the belief that the water resources development needs of the nation are grow ing and cannot be met with just the projects currently underway pl 1087 f unded the corps at 11 higher than the administrations request changes in corps operation there are currently two initiatives to change the operation of the civil works and military programs of the army corps of engineers the governmentwide presid ents management agenda pma and an army initiative referred to as the third wave neither initiative specifically targets the corps but both encompass the corps activities httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31307crs6 the pma was undertaken by the bush ad ministration as part of movement toward more entrepreneuria l government one of the five components of the pma is competitive sourcing initiative the pma directed executive agencies to competitively source commercia l activities in order to pr oduce quality services at reasonable cost through efficient and effective competition between public and private sources the administra tion mandated for fy2002 and fy2003 the competition of 5 and 10 respectively of the commercial positions at agencies including the corps the armys third wave initiative is broader than the pma the third wave is searching for ways to not only improve the armys operations but also focus its energies on its core warfighting competenci under the third wave the army is reviewing all its commands including the corps to identify how to focus the agencys activities the third wave reviews all positions and functions ie entire areas of responsibilities and missions such as wetlands regulation that are not part of the armys core competencies options that can be considered under the third wave for noncore functions and positions include compe titive sourcing transfer of responsibilities to other agencies and dives titure significant portion of the corps workforce is included in the current early phase of the third wave because much of the work performed by the corps is not considered as essential to the armys war fighting competencies pl 1087 included language that prohi bits the use of funds to study or implement any plans privatizing dives ting or transferring of any civil works missions functions or respons ibilities without specific direction by congress the continuing resolutions have contained related provisi on since hjres 122 pl 107240 which went into effect on october 11 2002 proposed reforms of corps processes and procedures during the 107th congress the corps came under criticism for the way it evaluates and undertakes projects although the issue r eceived media attenti on it was not directly addressed in consideration of fy2003 appr opriations legislation proposing changes to the project development and authoriz ation process was introduced in the 107th congress eg see hr 1310 and s 1987 however action was taken some have called for major agency refor ms others have called for review of corps programs and policies the 106th congress in passing the water resources development act of 2000 wrda pl 106541 section 216 directed the corps to contract with the national academy of sciences to study the feasibility of establishing an independent review panel for corps studies its july 2002 report recommended that largescale corps projects be independently reviewed by experts outside the agency in response to the criticism the corps initiated during fy2002 an additional internal staff review of pr oject justifications by the office of the assistant secretary of the army for civil works in reporting the fy2002 energy and wate r development appropriations bills the house and senate ppropriations committees acknow ledged criticism of the corps however both committees generally s upported the corps efforts to deal with such criticisms neither committee addressed reform issues in reporting the bills for fy2003 these issues might be addresse d during consideration of biennialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31307crs7 authorization bill for the corps the wa ter resources development act wrda the wrda expected in 2002 did not pass wrda in 2003 is anticipated for more information s ee crs repor t rl30928 army corps of engineers reform issues for the 107th congress pl 1087 did not address corps refo rm directly however it did change authorizations for some activities criticiz ed by those supporting reforms for example the authorization for municipal wa ter infrastructure projects in rural nevada was increased from 25 million to 100 million and 25 million authorization for idaho was added municipal infrastructure is an area that has historically been the responsibility of local government with th federal government providing directed grants and lowinterest loans prior to 1992 the corps involvement in municipal infrastructure was limited to water supply fro m corps reservoirs and was paid for by local project sponsors the increase in authorizations for m unicipal infrastructure has drawn criticism not only from taxpayer groups and fiscal conservatives but also from beneficiaries of projects in the corp s traditional missions who are concerned about dilution of the agencys efforts and funding missouri river water flows the current drought in the missouri river basin has contributed to the ongoing debate on the operations of the basins dams operations of the mainstem dams of th missouri river are managed under master manual and annual opera ting plans in late january 2003 the corps published the 20022003 operating plan nonetheless the flow regime that will be implemented during the nesting season for threatened and endangered species and during the navigation season that begins april 1 s yet to be finalized the corps has proposed two options steady flow release and flow to meet navigation targets the fish and wildlife service has expressed concerns with both the regimes the corps and the fws have renewed consultation on th 20022003 operating plan the revision of the master manual continues to be contentions issue the master manual has been in revision pr ocess for 14 years the master manual guides the operation of the missouri rivers dams the timing of water releases affects competing uses of the river such as barge traffic threatened and endangered species protection and upstream recreatio n in february 2003 coalition of 10 national and regional conserva tion organizations filed suit against the corps and fws due to the adverse impacts of current operations on threatened and endangered species the suit was filed in the us district court for the district of columbia the corps and fws reinitiated formal consultation on the operation of the missouri river mainstem dam system in december 2002 the reconsultation was initiated to review the information that the corps presented in its supplemental biological assessment for the master ma nual published in january 2003 in this document the corps challenged the reco mmended flow regime presented by the fws in its november 2000 biological opi nion the fws had recommended altering dam operations to provide higher springtime water releases to benefit the pallid sturgeon this change was believed by some to also benefit other threatened and endangered species negatively affected by dam operations in the supplemental biological opinion the corps concluded that the changes proposed by fws are not warranted at this time and that research monitoring and evaluation program of the pallid sturgeon is needed httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31307crs8 missouri river management issues ve been taken up in appropriations legislation in recent years after extended debate in both the house and the senate section 116 of the final energy and wa ter development appropriations bill for fy2002 included senate language that prohi bited the use of funds to accelerate the schedule to finalize the record of decisi on for the revision of the missouri river master water control manual and any associated changes to the missouri river annual operating plan the amended provision also direct ed the corps to consider views of other federal and non federal agencies and individua ls to ensure that other congressionally authorized purposes are maintained in addition to endangered species protection the provision represente d temporary compromise of an ongoing issue that had led president clinton to veto the energy and water development appropriations bill for fy2001 neither the house nor the senate appropriations committee fy2003 reports mentioned missouri river operations senator bond offered an amendment to the interior portion of the stevens amendment that would have restricted the use of funds by the fws to require steady release flow and to prevent the corps from relocating bird nests along its banks on the senate floor the amendment sa186 was modified to sense of the congress provision that encouraged agreement on flow regime for 2003 among the member st ates and tribes of the missouri river basin association the language in th congressional record for january 23 2003 on page s1428 was confusing because the nse of the congress language appears alongside part of the fws language that was expected to be removed on january 28 the senate by unanimous consent furthe r modified the amendm ent to contain only the sense of the congress language duri ng conference bond tried again to include language restricting fws actions the final bill included neither the fws restrictions nor the sense of the congress everglades implementation of comprehensive everglades restoration plan cerp was authorized in 2002 by title vi of wrda cerp is one of many efforts to restore the central and southern flor ida ecosystem the annual energy and water development

th fy2003 request for the kissimmee river restoration and the everglades and sout h florida ecosystem restoration was 237 million and 195 million respectively for thes two projects the house and senate appropriations committees and the final bill p l 1087 provided the same funding level as requested for the ce ntral and southern florida project the administration request ed 108 milli on which included 37 million for cerp activities the final appropriations bill funded that project at 90 million the senate and stevens reports explained that the reduction resulted from questions raised about the implementation of the pr oject specifically that it was too heavily weighted in favor of commercia l development of water supplies the final omnibus appropriations bill included language in the department of the interior portion that not only funded everglades restoration activities performedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31307crs9 by interior agencies but also authorized the corps to implement controversial plan know as alternative 6d this plan is being undertaken as part of the modified water delivery project this project seeks to improve water deliveries to everglades national park and to

efficiency and renewable energy eere from 3960 million in fy 2002 to 4070 million in fy2003 excluding funding for programs under the office of science in the 107th congress the senate appropriations committee recommended 4481 million excluding 150 million in prior ear balances for the renewable energy program this is 411 million or 13 more than the request this includes 140 million more for biomassbiofuels 105 million more for geothermal 60 million more for wind 51 million more for hydrogen 41 million more for concentrating solar power and 40 million more for program support in contrast the house appropriations committee sought 3960 million for the renewable energy program this was th same amount not accounting for inflation as the fy2002 appropriati on and it wa s 11 million or 3 less than the administrations request the senate report found that doe has not adequate ly implemented congressionallydirected activities that were specified in the previous years conference report the house report so expressed concern about does slow pace in executing projects directed in the previous years appropriation bill additionally the house report aimed to renew its previous years direction to doe to provide congress with quantitative measures that can be used to evaluate the potential costs and benefits of various renewable energy technologies the house found that doe failed to meet the previous request for this information and thus had objective basis for supporting the ch anges in research emphasis proposed in the fiscal year 2003 budget request in the 108th congress

research nuclear energy is the only expandable largescale electricity source that avoids air emissions and meets the energy mands of growing modern economy according to the doe fy2003 budget justification however opponents have criticized does nuclear research program as providing wasteful subsidies to an industry that they believe should be phased out as acceptably hazardous and economically uncompetitive the house appropriations committee in the 107th congress recommended 2137 million for nuclear energy programs decrease of 361 million from the administration request however the reduction would have come entirely from transferring funds for decommissioning the fast flux test facility fftf from nuclear energy to the environmenta l management program the senate appropriations committee recommended 3241 million including fftf and the advanced accelerator appli cations program previously funded elsewhere in the energy and water bill the final bill in cludes the accelerator activities but transfers fftf to environmen tal management the budget request sought 465 million for nuclear energy technologies which included 385 million for nuclear powe r 2010 and 80 million for generation iv advanced reactor technologies the house appropriations committee recommended cutting the nuclear energy technologie s request to 415 million so that 5 million could be shifted to the nuclear energy plant optimization program nepo which the administration had proposed to terminate the house panel also called for 5 million of the nuclear energy technologie s funding to go toward pursuing the advanced nuclear reactor and fuelcycle recommendations of joint usrussian task force the senate voted to boost the nuclear energy technologies request to 485 million and the final omnibus bill provides 45 million according to the doe budget justifi cation the nuclear power 2010 program which received 305 million increase over fy2002 will identify the technical institutional and regulatory barriers to the deployment of new nuclear power plants by 2010 the program seeks to deploy both watercooled reactor similar to most existing commercial plants and

the requested level the final bill provided 173 llion and encouraged doe to request reprogramming that would provide additional fy2003 funding in re sponse to recent japanese progress in supercomputing the only program to be reduced in the re quest was biological and environmental research which was requested to r eceive 504 million compared with 527 million the previous year the proposed reduction was explained as resulting mainly from the completion of 74 medical applications projects that were f unded at congressional direction in fy2002 funding for the genomes to life

forced to reduce other items in the budget the senate appropriations committee directed nnsa to revise the plan and report to congress before the end of the current fi scal year and then annually the house appropriations committee provided 1945 milli on the requested amount for pit manufacturing and certif ication pl 1087 provides 2220 million for pit manufacturing and certification according to

issue brief ib10091 nuclear nonproliferation issues environmental management the amount of time and money needed to clean up environmental c ontamination resulting from the production of nuclear weapons during the cold war has been long standing issue since the beginning of the us atomic energy program doe and its predecessors have been responsible for administering the produc tion of nuclear weapons and ma naging radioactive and other hazardous waste in later years doe expanded its efforts to include the environmental restoration of radioactive sites and those with other hazardous contamination in buildings soil and water to ensure their safety for future uses in 1989 the bush administration established an environmental ma nagement programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31307crs26 within doe to consolidate the agencys efforts in cleaning up contamination from defense nuclear waste as well as waste from civilian nuclear energy research doe is responsible for complying with num erous federal envir onmental laws and regulations in administering the program and is subject to fines and penalties for violations of these requirements cons equently doe has signed numerous legally binding compliance agreements with the environmental protection agency epa and the states to perform cleanup activities and dispose of waste according to specific deadlines doe reports that there are total of 114 contaminated sites in 30 states where the production of nuclear weapons and ci vilian nuclear energy research and development activities resulte d in radioactive and othe r hazardous contamination together these sites occupy approximate ly 21 million acres which is equivalent to the land area of rhode island and delaware combined doe reports that all response actions were complete at 75 sites as of the end of fy2002 at cost of over 60 billion and that cleanup is expected to be co mplete at two additi onal sites by the end of fy2003 however the sites that have b een cleaned up are relatively small and are among the least hazardous and the site s where cleanup remains underway contain some of the most severely contaminated areas doe has estimated that cleanup at the remaining sites may take 70 years to complete and that total cleanup costs may reach 220 billion if changes to the program are not made doe contends that these costs could be reduced by 50 billion to 100 billion through the use of riskbased approaches to accelerate cl eanup schedules however does past implementation of riskbased approaches has been criticized as ineffective and questions have been raised as to how these goals woul d be accomplished without weakening environmental standards five accounts within the annual appropriati ons bill for energy and water development have traditionally funded does environmental management program the defense environmental restorati on and waste management account funds cleanup and waste management activities at nuclear weapons sites where all response actions are projected to continue beyond 2006 the defense facilities closure projects account supports cleanup and waste management activities at nuclear weapons sites where all response actions are scheduled to be complete by the end of 2006 the defense environmental manageme nt privatization ccount funds cleanup and waste management projects at nuclear weapons sites that are performed under privatization contracts this contracting approach relies on the private sector to construct and operate facilities or conduct cleanup actions on fixedprice feefor service basis the nondefense envir onmental management account funds cleanup and waste management activities at civilian nuclear energy research and development sites lastly the uranium facilities ma intenance and remedi ation account funds the cleanup of uranium and thorium processing sites for fy2003 doe initially requested total of 67 billion for the above accounts approximately th same amount as enacted for fy2002 however 800 million of the in itial request would have been llocated to new environmental management cleanup reform account which would have funded efforts to reduce risk decrease cleanup costs and accelerate cleanup schedul the administration budgeted the majority of the funding for this new account by decreasing support for sites funded under the defense environmen tal restoration nd waste managementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31307crs27 account under this approac h funding would have been restored at these sites only if compliance agreements with the environmental protection agency epa and the states were renegotiated to accelerate cleanup schedules doe has long argued that many of the requirements under its existin g compliance agreements are too costly ineffective and unnecessarily timeconsuming and that its agreements need to be re examined to explore ways to increas the pace of cleanup and reduce costs concerns were raised as to whether epa and the states might agree to weaker cleanup standards rather than face the po ssibility of the loss of funds which may have prevented sites from fulfilling existing agreements to date doe has signed letters of intent with epa and the states to accelerate cleanup at the following sites the hanford site in washington the oak ridge site in tennessee the idaho national engineerin g and environmental laboratory the nevada test site the sava nnah river site in south carolina the pantex site in texas and the alamos national boratory and sandia national laboratories in new mexico on august 2 2002 the president submitted budget amendment to request an additional 300 llion in fy2003 to fulfill these new agreements increasing the request for new envi ronmental management cleanup reform account to 11 billion and the overall reque st for the environmental management program to 70 billion during the 107th congress the subcommittee on oversight and investigations of the house committee on energy and commerce held hearing on does cleanup reform initiative on july 19 2002 jesse roberson assistant secretary for environmental management testified that the objective of the cleanup reform initiative is to identify and implement more riskoriented and efficient cleanup approaches and that the intent is not to weaken any of does compliance agreements the general accounting ffice gao testified on the status of compliance agreements with epa and the st ates at each nuclear waste cleanup site and indicated that doe faces challenges in developing and implementing risk based method to prior itize clea nup activities due to failed ttempts to do so in the past gao also indicated th at does reform initiative in some cases could involve potential changes in technology or approach that would result in leaving more of the waste on site than currently planned nd thus could significantly reduce cleanup costs in other cases it could allocat funding using greater emphasis on risk reduction which could shift f unding among sites representatives from the states of washington idaho and tennessee indicated that the letters of intent to re negotiate cleanup agreements in their stat would not result in weakened cleanup standards but would provide framewo rk for cooperation among the parties involved to establish new cleanup goals as signed by the president the fy2003 omnibus appropriations resolution does not allocate any funding to the pr oposed environmental management cleanup reform account instead the resolution in creased funding for the existing defense environmental restorati on and waste management account by 926 million above the administrations request of 454 billion in order to honor the letters of intent to accelerate cleanup that doe d already signed the increase will be allocated according to the existing structure of site categories within the account during the appropriations deba concerns were expressed bout providing an unallocated sum for the reform account due to uncertainties as to how doe would have divided thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31307crs28 amount among various sites section 315 of the final bill indicates that none of the funding for environmental management activ ities may be obligated at individual sites that would be in excess of the amount obligated in fy2002 or requested for fy2003 whichever is greater unless performance ma nagement plan has been completed for that site that is consistent with the intent of does environmental management and cleanup reform initiative the level of funding to appropriate for fy2003 for th four other accounts was less controversial overa ll pl 1087 appropriated n early 70 billion for all five defense and nondefense accounts that s upport does environmental management program this amount is pproximately the same as th administrations request of 70 billion and is about 290 million more th an the enacted fy2002 funding level of 67 billion civilian nuclear waste the bush administration

extension in the omnibus appropriations bill does not change any other provisions in the priceanderson act under the priceanderson ac t primarily section 170 of the atomic energy act of 1954 42 usc 2210 the owners of commercial reactors must assume all liability for reactorrelated radiological da mages awarded to the public by the court system but their total liability is limited to the amount provided by private insurance and mandatory industry selfinsurance system the priceanderson act also authorizes doe to indemnify contract ors who operate hazardous doe nuclear facilities the limit on doe contractor liability is the same as for commercial reactors except when the limit for commercia l reactors drops because of decline in the number of covered reactors without an extension of the law any commercial nuclear r eactor licensed after august 1 2002 could not have been cove red by the priceanderson system although coverage continued for existing reactors because new us reactors are currently planned missing the deadline for extension had little shortterm effect on the nuclear power industry however any new doe contracts signed during priceanderson lapse would have to use
