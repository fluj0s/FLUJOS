late 1990s the military services we re facing considerable recruiting and career retention problems in responding congress was mindful of how inadequate pay had contributed to decreased recruit quality in the late 1970s it authorized larger pay raises increased special pays and bonuses provided more recruiting resources and repealed planned military retired pay reductions for future retirees in the spirit of national unity follo wing the attacks of september 11 2001 recruitment improved the programmatic chan ges noted above also helped recruiting substantially however the grueling pace of deployments to and from iraq and afghanistan combined with the dangers of combat began to cause longanticipated recruiting problems for the allvolunteer force in 2005 the army army national guard and army reserve all fell short of their recruiting goals an infusion of additional recruiters and congressional increase in the maximum enlistment bonus from 20000 to 40000 contributed to the active army meeting its 2006 2007 and 2008 recruiting targets career retention of servicemembers beyond their initial period of obligated service is difficult to measure due to the suspended separation and retirement of many pe rsonnel since september 11 2001 but so far retention is reported to be more than satisfactory however the services anticipate challenging recruiting year in fy2009 debate

targeted by grade years of service and occupational skill on the other and between cash compensation on the one hand and improvement s in benefits such as housing health care and installation services on the other the issue of pay comparability between military and civilian pay commonly referred to as the pay gap continues to receive emphasis while many analysts believe the gap has been reduced to less than three percent by the fy2009 pay raise others argue that pay and benefit increases since 911 have eliminated the gap the issue persists in part because the numer ous different elements of military pay make it difficult to compare to civilian salaries and other benefits since the early 1990s numerous changes in benefits have greatly favored individual members these include changes in

and afghanistan military pay and associated benefits continue to receive significant congressional interest as concerns continue over military recruitin g and retention this inte rest in military pay bonuses and benefits will probably continue the army missed its fy2005 recruiting goal of 80000 by 6627 soldiers this was the first time in 26 years that the activ army had failed to meet or exceed the annual recruiting mission with the help of approximately 1100 dditional recruiters and an increase in the maximum enlistment bonus from 20000 to 400001 the army met its fy2006 fy2007 and fy2008 recruiting mission of 80000 each year even though there was decline in the number of high school diploma graduates and an increase in the number of waivers required the services anticipate another challenging recruiting year in fy2009 key questions and answers 1 why did the adequacy of ac tive duty military pay become major issue beginning in the late 1990s since the end of the draft in 1972 1973 the adequacy of military pay has tended to become an issue for congress for one or both of two r easons if it appears that the military services are having trouble recruiting enough new personnel or keeping sufficien t career personnel of requisite quality or the standard of living of career pe rsonnel is perceive d to be less fair or equitable than that which demographically comparable civilians in terms of age education sk ills responsibilities and similar criteria can maintain the first issue is an economic inevitability on at least some occasions in the absence of draft the services must co mpete in the labor market for new enlistees and fact often overlooked have always had to compete in the labor market forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33446crs2 more mature individuals to staff the career force there are always occasions when unemployment is low and hence recruiting is more difficult and others when unemployment is high and military service more attractive alternative the second situation while often triggered by the first is frequently stated in moral or ethical terms proponents of this viewpoint argu that even if quantitative indexes of recruiting and retention appear to be satisfactory the crucial character of the militarys mission of national defense nd its acceptance of the professional ethic that places survival below mission accomplishment demands certain levels of compensation beginning in the mid1990s several new factors caused recruiting and retention problems severe enough to move congress once again to deal with this issue among the factors cited by analysts were 1 public impression that the end of the cold war meant that military service was longer interesting relevant or even available as career option 2 the postcold war drawdown in active duty military manpower by 40 which greatly reduced real and perceived enlistment and career retention opportunities 3 the 1990s economic expansion which led to the explosive growth of actual and perceived civilian career options 4 rise in civilian consumer living standards against which military families measure their own economic success or failure 5 concerns over increased family separation due to more operations and training away from home whether home was in the united states or in foreign countries and 6 decreased propensity for military service among young people for other reasons such as antimilitary pa rents and educators 7 skepticism about new missions such as operations other than war peacekeeping or peace enforcement nd 8 the availability of government educational assistance from other sour ces the gi bill without the gi 2 what kinds of increases in military pay and benefits have been considered or used in the past many military compensation analysts have strongly criticized acrosstheboard rather than selective pay raises they argue that acrosstheboard increases fail to bring resources to bear where they are mo st needed percentage increases targeted on particular pay grades and number of ears of service and special pays and bonuses targeted on particular occupational skills they suggest would maximize the recruiting and retention gains for the compensation dollars spent acrosstheboard increases also affect variety of other cost s retired pay for instance is computed as percentage of basic pay however th ere have been proposals to include special pays and bonuses in retired pay calcula tions precisely to provide an add itional incentive for the recipients to stay in service the services already do great deal of such targeting having maintained large system of special pays and bonuses since the end of conscription over 30 years ago personnel managers report i ndication that such targeted compensation has had the deleterious effects on morale and cohesion that some had feared acrosstheboard pay increases however are believed by many to have the advantages of simplicity visibility and equity if everyone gets similar percentage increase nobody can feel or can claim that he or she has been left out it also shows up immediately in the persons next paycheck rather than months or years later when particular individualhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33446crs3 2 basic pay is monthly compensation that all military personnel in the same pay grade and with the same number of years of service receive 3 as defined by section 101 of title 10 usc the term grade refers to step or degree within military rank while rank means an order of precedence among members of the continuedis next eligible for lump sum special pay or bonus some special pays and bonuses are paid monthly or biweekly as part of regu lar pay it is likely that as in the past overall increases in military cash compensation over the next several years will combine both acrosstheboard and targeted increases both of these increases because of their broad appeal may well be sound approaches to improving recruiting and retention as much as possible in ddition many observers believe that the recent enactment of the new post 911 gi bill benefit with its generous benefits and transferability options will have an overall beneficial impact on both recruiting and retention recruiting and retention problems are not necessarily solved by increasing military pay many components of the military compensation system that are important to recruiting and re tention efforts especially the latter do not involve cash pay these include retirem ent benefits health care housing permanent change of station pcs moving costs and policies exchanges commissaries and other retail facilities and recrea tional facilities wide rang of views about existing military personnel management practices suggests that the rvices requirements for both new enlistees and career people could be si gnificantly reduced by changing often longstanding and interrela ted assignment promoti on career development or retirement policies survey research also reveals that the sense of patriotism public service and esprit corps found in capable and combatready armed forces is extremely significant to both new enlistees and career members furthermore there are always limits to what increased compensation whether cash or inkind can do to help any organiza tion cope with personne l difficulties job and career satisfaction public and elite views of the importance and legitimacy of the military as an institution unit morale success in operationa l deployments and especially in combat may well be indepe ndent of compensation variables high scoring in these intangibles especially for unique organization and culture like the armed forces can and frequently does balance perceived issues in compensation however few analysts believe that recruiting and retention rates can be brought up to service target levels w ithout continuing to maintain the momentum of recent pay raises many l ongtime observers seem to feel that money alone cannot keep person in the military for full career if the person does not like the military culture they assert that the lifestyle is too demanding and too arduous for most at the same time it is argued that people can be driven out of the military if their compensation and living standards are not at least somewhat close to those of their demographic and educational c ounterparts in civilian life 3 what is pay table reform the current military pay table displays the amount of monthly basic pay2 which servicemember is entitled to based on the members pay grade3 and length ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33446crs4 3 continued armed forces commissioned officers have been assigned pay grades 01 through 010 warrant officers have been assigned w1 through w5 and enlisted personnel have been designated as e1 through e9 4 some pay grades especially those of lowe r ranking personnel are capped at designated points generally because they should have been promoted to the next higher grade for example the last longevity increase for e5 s ergeant in the army and marine corps staff sergeant in the air force and petty officer s econd class in the navy occurs at over 12 while the final increase of 05 lieutenant colonel in the army air force and marine corps occurs at over 22 5 military compensation background papers compensation elements and related manpower cost items their pur poses and legislative backgrounds sixth edition april 2005 6 section 601 pl 109364 7 section 601 pl 109364 8 section 642 pl 109364service the length of service component of the table ranges from under 2 to over 26 years of service and provides an increm ental longevity pay raise every two years4 as result servicemembers receive their final longevity raise at 26 years of service even though their rank may provide for rvice to or beyond 30 years the current pay table has changed very little since it was introduced in 19585 some analysts have advocated longer military careers rather than the current emphasis on youth and vigor and have argued that the pay tables should be extended or reformed to allow for service be yond 30 years with continuing longevity increases others have described this as the 40year pay table the fy2007 national defense authoriza tion act ndaa included several significant changes to the pay table firs t effective april 1 2007 the pay table has been extended from over 26 to over 40 years of service6 second and also effective april 1 2007 the ndaa provided dditional longevity increases at 30 34 and 38 years of service for the most senior enlisted warrant officer and officer pay grades7 for example the final longevity raise for e8 w4 06 and 07 will occur at over 30 years at over 34 for pay grades e8 w5 and 08 and at over 38 for pay grades 09 and 010 third effective january 1 2007 the ndaa provides additional retirement credit for service bey ond 30 years continuing to accrue at the rate of 25 percent per year8 as result servicemember who retires with 40 years of service will qualify for 100 percent of basic pay in their retirement the cumulative effect of these change s seems to suggest congressional support for longer military careers however the ndaa did not address other cited constraints to facilitating longer careers specifically there were changes to mandatory retirement based on years of service or age and increase in the percentage of e8 e9 and

military basic pay raises linked to employment cost index eci percentage increases permanent law 37 usc 1009 provides that monthly basic pay is to be increased by the nnual percentage increase in the

established by sec 602 of the fy2004 ndaa pl 108136 november 24 2003 117 stat 1498 amending 37 usc 1009 previously the annual military pay raise was li nked to the annual percentage increases in the general schedule gs federal civil service pay scale congress usually sets the amount of the military pay raise despite the statutory formula which coul d operate each year without any further action congress has legislated particular percentage increase in military pay every year since 1980 with the exception of 1982 the percentage increase in military pay was usually identical to that granted gs civilians during the period 19821999 thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33446crs6 exceptions were in 1985 and 1994 when c ongress provided larger increases in military pay however beginning in 2000 congress has provided larger increases in military pay each year even when the pe rcentage increase has been identical for both military and civilian pay in most cases congress has explicitly reiterated the increase in law rather than deferring to the permanent statutor provision therefore although congress may legislate the military pay raise percentage until recently it was pro forma matter and the operation of the permanent formula remains important in determining what the percentage will actually be annual increases in basic allowa nces for housing bah and subsistence bas housing 37 usc 403

are bot h based on surveys of local housing and national food costs respectivel and thus are not affect ed by the annual percentage increase in the eci for many years bah and its predecessors and bas were subject to the annual percentage increase this was not changed until the late 1990s there have been occasional proposals to survey the housing costs on which bah is based more frequently than once year due to rapidly rising housing costs in many areas of the united states particular emphasis is placed by supporters of more frequent surveys on fastrising electricity costs notably for heating and cooling in addition there have been calls to merge ba s with basic pay to reduce the complexity of military compensation and the need for bas computations each year 5 what have been the

is there pay gap between military and civilian pay so that generally military pay is less than that of comparable civilians if so what is the extent of the gap the issue of militarycivilian pay gap raises several questions how can the existence of gap be determined and the gap be measured is there gap with civilians or the military being paid more if sohow much of gap if there is gap does that in itself require action what are the effects of any such gaps wide range of studies over the past several decades has compared military and civilian both federal civil rvice and private sector comp ensation in general the markedly different ways in which civilian public and private sector compensation and benefit systems are structured compared to that of the armed forces make it difficult to validate any generalizations about whet her there is gap between military and civilian pay some advocates for federal ci vil servants argue that federal civilian pay lags behind private sector pay which in turn leads some people given the past linkage between civil service and military pay percentage increases to infer that military pay lags behind private sector pay however because the current statistic used to measure private sect or pay the eci measures annual percentage increases and not dollar amounts such inference is really possible as noted above the debate in recent years over pay parity between the military and federal civil service pay increas involves the percentage amount of the civilian pay raise it has not so far involved the military pay raise proposal at all the issue has been whether the civil serv ice should get percentage raise identical to that of the military or whether the military should get higher raise because of 1 the much greater degree of danger and hardship military service entails compared to most civilian employment especially in time of war and 2 the need to cope with actual or forestall potential military recruiting and retention problems measuring and confirming gap it is extremely difficult to find common index or indicator to compare th dollar values of military and civilian compensation first military compensation includes numerous separate com ponents whose receiving population and taxability va ry widely which of these if any should be included in milita rycivilian pay comparison furthermore total military compensation includes wide range of non monetary benefits retirement annuity after vesting at 20 years of service health care retail stores and recreational facilities few civilians work in organizations where analogous benefits are provided attempts to fac ilitate comparison by assigning cash value to noncashhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33446crs10 benefits almost always f ounder on the large number of debatable assumptions that must be made to generate such an estimate second it is also extremely difficult to establish comparison between military ranks and pay grades on the one hand and ci vilian jobs on the other the range of knowledge supervision and professional judgment requi red of military personnel and civilians perfo rming similar duties in standard p eacetime industrial or office milieu may well be similar when the same military members likely job in the field possibly in combat is concerne d comparisons become difficult third generally speaking with some exceptions the conditions of military service are frequently much more arduous than those of civilian employment even in peacetime for families as well as military personnel themselves this aspect of military service is sometimes cited as rationale for military compensation being at higher level than it otherwise might be on the other hand the military services all mention travel and adventure in exotic places as positive reason for enlistment andor military career so it may be misleading to automatically assume this is always liability fourth comparisons between different ts of compensation statistics and the use of these comparisons to determine what military pay should be can yield very different results comparing dollar amounts may lead to different conclusions than comparing the annual increases in pay for each position the percentage increase in pay over different time periods is more often than not very different different indexes with different components can be used to determine compensation changes finally the level of specificity used in pay comparison can lead to sharply differing results especially when the co mparison is between private sector and federal pay as whole both civil service and military for instance all army colonels may according to some indexes be paid roughly as much as federal civil service gs15s or as much as private sector managers with certain responsibilities thus those occupational specialties that are highly paid in the private sector health care information technology some other scientific and engineering skills are examples are frequently paid considerably less in the military or in the civil service other common subcategories fo r comparison in addition to occupational skill include age gender years in the labor force and educational levels estimates of militarycivilian pay gap numerous comparisons of military and civilian compensation in recent ears have been cited either to illustrate gap that favors civilian pay levels or to refute the existence of such gap many of these reports lack precision in identifying what aspects of military pay were compared with civilian pay what indexes were used to make the comparison or the length of time covered by the comparison alt hough it is difficult to generalize it would appear that most of those estimates which assert that there is pay gap in favor of higher civilian pay find percentage difference of between 3 and 13 in recent years with the fy2009 pay raise the pay gap is estimated at 3 estimates have been made that question the existence of gap favoring civilians these tend to compare speci fic populations of military personnel with equally specific subcategories of civilians analyses of this nature appear to be

almost certainly because they are much more difficult to do11 in 2002 general accounting office gao analysts itemized the components of the military benefit package such as military retirement health care servicemembers group life insurance ba recreational fac ilities and the like and compared them with the private sect or it found that the range of benefits available to military personne l was generally comparable to and in some cases superior to benefits available in the private sector the gao study did not appear to have made dollarfigure comparisons or compared in military noncash benefits such as health care commissaries or ex changes or annual leave with benefits in the private sector either by figuring out their dollar worth or by itemizing their exact provisions in great detail12 this gao report was followed in 2008 by the 10th quadrennial review of military compensation qrmc13 which also addressed the pay gap issue and recommended that new comparative model could be better suited to measuring the difference between military pay and comparable civilian occupations the commission recommended replacing regular military compensation rmc with new measure called military annual co mpensation mac while rmc includes base pay bah bas and th federal tax advantage from the two allowances mac would also factor in the health care be nefit the value of the military retirement annuity and state and social security tax advantages based on the qrmc analysis and using mac as the comparative tool enlisted and officer personnel fare better than their civilian counterparts in cas h compensation according to the economic modeling done by the qrmc this repres ents the first time that qrmc has recommended inclusion of benefits when comparing military and civilian compensation levels while estimating the pay gap continues to be challenge it appears that the substantial increases in milita ry pay and benefits since the late 1990s whatever the existing relative relationship of military to civilian compensation as of that time have probably had the effect of favoring the militaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33446crs12 14 much of this material is taken from crs report rl31334 operations noble eagle enduring freedom and iraqi freedom qu estions and answers about us military personnel compensation and force structure by lawrence kapp and charles henningif there is pay gap does it necessarily matter s m h v suggested that the emphasis on pay gap whet her real or not or if real how much is unwarranted and not good guide to arrivi ng at sound policy they argue that the key issue is or should be not comparability of military and civilian compensation but the competitiveness of the former absent draft the armed forces must compete in the labor market for new enlisted nd officer personnel the career force by definition has always been volunteer for ce and thus has always had to compete with civilian opportunities real or percei ved given these facts some ask what difference it makes whether military pay is much lower the same or higher than that of civilians if the services are having recruiting difficulties then pay increases might be appropriate even if the existing gap favors the military conversely if military compensation is lower than equivalent civilian pay and if the services are doing well in recruiting and retaining suffi cient numbers of qua lified personnel then there might be reason to raise military pay however some believe that explicitly basing military compensation on purely economic competitiveness with civilian pa could have undesira ble consequences for instance in time of economic difficu lty the military might be receiving lower pay than most civilians but still recruiting satisfactorily due to high unemployment for further discussion of the pay gap issue see congressional budget office what does the military pay gap mean june 1999 and association of the us army
