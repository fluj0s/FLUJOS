military death penalty cases promulgated by executive order and included in rule for courtsmartia l rcm 1004 as amended loving contended that fundamental policy determinations with re spect to aggravating factors in death penalty cases must be made by congress through statut ory enactments rather than by the president the court assuming that furman v geor gia 408 us 238 1972 and subsequent cases applied to the crime and sentence before it found that the aggravating factors included in rcm 1004 were necessary from constitutional pers pective to adequately narrow the class of persons eligible to receive the death penalty under the statute under which loving was convicted and sentenced further the court rej ected lovings contention that the presidents promulgation of these aggravating factors by executive order violated separation of powers principles the court found that the congress had the power to delegate the authority to prescribe aggravating factors in military capita l murder cases to the president and had in fact made valid delegation of that aut hority in 10 usc 818 836a and 856 the court also found connection between the delegated authority and the presidents constitutional duties as commander in chief the capital sentencing procedures governing civilian capital cases first added by pl 103322 title vi sec 60002a codified at 18 usc 35913598 as

the congress enacted death penalty st atute for air piracy where death resulted from the commission of the offense and responded to the concerns reflected in furman by including procedures designed to tailor the sentencing discretion of the judge or jury in determining the appropriate sentence to impos in the case before them the substantive provisions were codified at 49 usc 1472i and n 49 usc 46502 in the revised title 49 of the united states code while the procedures for separate sentencing hearing specifying aggravating and mitigating factor s to be considered in the sentencing determination and requiring special verdict finding the existence or nonexistence of each of the factors were codified at then existing 49 usc app 1473c49 usc 46503 the constitutional sufficiency of these procedures was not tested they might have given rise to question as to whether they satisfi ed the constitutional minimum in light of the supreme courts decision in lockett v oh io 438 us 586 604 1978 which held invalid ohios death penalty statute because it failed to permit consideration in capital case of any aspects of the defendants character or reco rd or the circumstances of the offense as mitigating factor the federal air piracy sent encing provisions in former 49 usc app 1473c49 usc 46503 appeared to limit the mitigating factors which may be considered in capital case and

circumstances where the commission of the offense did not result in death might give ri to question as to whether the punishment imposed was disproportionate to the crime committed coker involved the rape of an adult woman by an escaped felon who had been serving sentences for murder rape kidnapping and aggravated assault at the time of his escape where the victim survived the court while acknowledging the seriousness of the cr ime found the death penalty disproportionate to the offense this case has given rise to questions as to whether the death penalty would be found appropriate under eighth amendment cr uel and unusual standards for any offense where death did not result see eg coker 433 us at 621 burger cj dissenting indeed chief justice burger also raised question as to whether the death penalty might also be open to challenge under the pluralitys reasoning for crimes such as treason airplane hijacking kidnapping and mass terro rist activity which although dangerous and constituting serious threat to public safety did not necessarily result in immediate death id similar reasoning might give rise to question as to the constitutiona lity of death penalty for espionage where death did not result from the commission of the offense except with respect to espionage and treas on as addressed in 18 usc 3591a1 and certain controlled substances offenses referred to in 18 usc 3591b the coker issue raised by provision of death pena lty for offenses not involving death may be minimized by the impact of 18 usc 3591a 2 which provides that death sentence may be imposed upon defendant found guilty of 2 any other offense for which sentence of death is provided if the defendant as determined beyond reasonable doubt at the hearing under section 3593 intentionally killed the victim b intentionally inflicted serious bodily injury that resulted in the death of the victim c intentionally participated in an act contemplating that the life of person would be taken or intending th at lethal force would be used in connection with person other than one of the participants in the offense and the victim died as direct result of that act or d intentionally and specifically enga ged in an act of violence knowing that the act created grave risk of ath to person other than one of the participants in the offense such that participation in the act constituted reckless disregard for human life and the victim died as direct result of the act under subsection 3591a1 the death penalty is made available in cases where the defendant has been found guilty of an offense described in 18 usc 794 espionage or 2381 treason without explicitly restricting th availability of capital punishment to those cases in which death results subsection 3591b makes the death penalty available for continued18 usc 241murder with death resulting from conspiracy to violate civil rights also appears to provi for possible capital punishment where acts constituting conspiracy against rights under this section involve kidnapping or attempted kidnapping aggravated sexu abuse or attempted aggravated sexual abuse or attempted killing regardless of whether death results from the commission of the offense but see 18 usc 3591a27httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30962crs7 7continued defendant who has been found guilty of 1 an offense referred to in section 408 c1 of the controlled substances act 21 usc 848c1 committed as part of continuing criminal enterprise offense under the conditions described in subsection b of that section which involved not less than twice the quantity of controlled substance described in subsection b2a or twice the gross receipts described in subsection b2b or 2 an offense referred to in section 408 c1 of the controlled substances act 21 usc 848c1 committed as part of continuing criminal enterprise offense under that section where the defendant is principal administrator organizer or leader of such an enterpri and

another to attempt to kill any public office r juror witness or member of the family or household of such person 8as discussed in greater depth at fn 7 abov it is questionable whether the death penalty may be constitutionally applied in cases where the offense committed does not result in death in light of the supreme court s 1977 decision in coker v georgia supra note that operation of 18 usc 3591a2 would appear to limit the availability of the death penalty where death did not result from co mmission of an offense under 18 usc 242 despite language in the offense statute th at appears to provide for possible capital punishment 9it is questionable whether the death penalty can constitutionally be applied in cases where the offense does not result in death in light of the supreme courts decision in coker v georgia supra as discussed in greater depth at fn 7 above note that operation of 18 usc 3591a2 would seem to limit the availability of the death penalty for offenses under

247murder with death resulting from intentionally damaging religious property or inte ntionally obstructing the free exercise of religionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30962crs8 10as discussed in greater depth at fn 7 supra it is uncertain whether the death penalty may be applied to offenses which do not result in death in light of the supreme courts decision in coker v georgia supra note that operation of 18 u sc 3591a2 would appear to limit the availability of the death penalty for offenses under 18 usc 247 which do not result in death even though the language of the offense provision appears to provide for possible capital punishment 11it is uncertain whether the death penalty may be applied to offenses which do not result in death in light of the supreme cour ts analysis in coker v georgia supra which is discussed in greater depth at fn 7 supra the issue would be whether under the eighth amendments cruel and unusual standard the pe nalty would be deemed disproportionate to the crime but see us v regan 221 f supp 2d 661 ed va 2002 denying defendants motion to strike governments noti ce of intention to seek the death penalty in case where the defendant was charged with attempted espionage and there was allegation of death resulting from the commission of the offense defendant premised his motion not on coker but on an eighth amendment comparative proportionality argument statutory aggravating factors were that in commission of the offense the defendant knowingly created grave risk of substantial danger to the national security and that in commission of the offense the defendant knowingl created grave risk of death to another person 12in light of the courts reasoning in coker v georgia supra as discussed at fn 7 supra death sentence imposed for this offense may be subject to an eighth amendment challenge on the grounds that the punishment is disproportionate to the crime such challenge would appear to have less force if the commission of the offense caused someones death such continuedalso appears to make capital punishme nt available for acts which constitute intentionally damaging religious property or intentionally obstructing free exercise of religion involving kidnapping or attempted kidnapping aggravated sexual abuse or attempted aggravated sexual abuse or attempted killing but see 18 usc 3591a210 18 usc 351assassination of
