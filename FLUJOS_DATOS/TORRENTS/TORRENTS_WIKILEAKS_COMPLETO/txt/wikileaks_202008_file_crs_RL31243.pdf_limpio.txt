sections of the act and the equi valent sections of the statute background as indicated by table 1 the safe drinking water act has been amended several times since enactment of the safe drinking wa ter act of 1974 pl 93523 congress passed this law after nationwide studies of community water systems revealed widespread water quality probl ems and health risks resulting from poor operating procedures inadequa facilities and uneven management of public water supplies in communities of all sizes the 1974 law ga ve the epa substantial discretionary authority to re gulate drinking water conta minants and gave states the lead role in implementation and enforcement the first major amendments pl 99339 enacted in 1986 were largely intended to increase the pace at which the epa regulated contaminants and to increase the protection of ground water from 1974 until 1986 the epa had regulated just one additi onal contaminant beyond the 22 standards previously developed by the public health servi ce the 1986 amendments required the epa to 1 issue regulations for 83 specified contaminants by june 1989 and for 25 more contaminants every three years thereafter 2 promulgate requirements for disinfection and filtra tion of public water supplies 3 ban the use of lead pipes and lead solder in new drinking water systems 4 establish an elective wellhead protection program around public wells 5 tablish demonstration grant program for state and local authorities having designated solesource aquifers to develop groundwater protection programs and 6 i ssue rules for monitoring injection wells that inject wastes below drinking water source the amendments also increased epas enforcement authority congress again amended sdwa with th lead contamination control act of 1988 pl 100572 these provisions were intended to reduce exposure to lead in drinking water by requiring the recall of l eadlined water coolers and requiring the epa to issue guidance document and testing protocol for states to help schools and day care centers identify and correct lead contamination in sc hool drinking water after the regulatory sc hedule mandated in the 1986 amendments proved to be unworkable for the epa states and public water systems the 104th congress made sweeping changes to the act with the sdwa amendments of 1996 pl 104182 as overarching themes the amendments targeted resources to address the greatest health risks added some regulatory flex ibility provided funding for federal drinking water mandates and aimed to improve water system compliance capacity congress revoked the requirement that the epa regu late 25 new contaminants every three years and created riskbased approach for selecting contaminants for regulation among other changes congress added some flexibility to the standard setting process required the epa to conduct health risk reduction and cost analyses for new rules authorized drinking water stat revolving loan fund dwsrf program to help water systems finance projects need ed to meet sdwa requirements added programs to improve small system compliance expanded consumer information requirements increased the acts focus on pollution prevention through voluntary source water protection program and streamlined the acts enforcement provisionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31243crs3 1 epas longstanding policy is to exclude transient systems from drinking water regulations except for those contaminants such as nitrat that the epa believes have the potential to cause immediate adverse human health effect s resulting from shortterm exposure source environmental protection agency national primary drinking water regulation on lead and copper minor revisions january 12 2000 65 fr 1950pl 104182 extended authorizations fo r

act of 2002 pl 107188 title iv of the act included requirements for community water systems serving more than 3300 individuals to conduct vulnerability assessments and prepare emergency respons plans the law also required the epa to conduct research on preventing and res ponding to terrorist or other attacks regulated public water systems federal drinking water re gulations apply to the approximately158000 privately and publicly owned water systems that pr ovide piped water for human consumption to at least 15 service connections or that regularly serve at least 25 people nearly 53000 of these systems are community water systems cwss that serve the same residences yearround these 53000 system s provide water to approximately 282 million people all federal regulations apply to these systems another 19174 public water systems are nontransient noncommun ity water systems ntncws such as schools or factories that have their own water supply and generally serve the same individuals for more than six months but not yearround most drinking water regulations apply to these systems mo re than 86200 other public water systems are transient noncommunity water systems tncws

periods of time such as gas stations and campgrounds only regulations for contaminants that pose immediate health risks eg nitrate and bacteria apply to these systems national drinking water regulations key component of sdwa is the re quirement that the epa promulgate national primary drinking water regulations for contaminants that may pose health risks and that are likely to be present in public water supplies section 1412 instructs the epa on how to select contaminants for regulation and specifies how the epa must establish regulations once contaminant has been selected the regulations apply to the roughly 168000 privately and pub licly owned water systems that provide piped water for human consumption to at least 15 service connections or that regularly serve at least 25 people the epa has issued regulations for more than 90 contaminants including regulations setting new standards for drinking water disinfectants and their byproducts and for microbial contaminants regulation establishing standard for uranium in dri nking water and regulation revising the standard for arsenic contaminant selection and regulatory schedules section 1412 as amended in 1996 directs the epa to select contaminants for regu latory consideration based on occurrence health effects and meaningful opportunity for health risk reduction starting in 1998 and then every fi ve years the epa must publish list of contaminants that may warrant regula tion as of 2001 and every five years thereafter the epa must determine whether or not to regulate at least 5 of the listed contaminants the act requires the epa to evaluate contaminants that present the greatest health concern and to regulate those contaminants that occur at concentration levels and frequencies of public health concern the amendments also included schedules for the epa to complete regula tions for specific cont aminants ie radon arsenic disinfectants and disinfection byproducts and cryptosporidium httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31243crs6 standard setting for each contaminant that the epa determines requires regulation the epa must set nonenfor ceable maximum cont aminant level goal mclg at level at which known or antic ipated adverse health effects occur and which allows an adequate margin of safety the epa must then set an enforceable standard maximum contaminant level mcl as close to the mclg as is feasible using best technology treatment techniques or other means available taking costs into consideration the agency generally sets standards based on technologies that are affordable for larg communities however as amended by pl 104182 the act requires epa when issuing regulation for contaminant to list any technologies or other means that comp ly with the mcl and that are affordable for small public water systems serving popul ations of 10000 or fewer if the epa does not identify compliance technologies th at are affordable for small systems then it must identify small system varia nce technologies or other means that may not achieve the mcl but are protective of public health the 1996 amendments authorized the epa to set standard at other than the feasible level if the feasible level would lead to an increase in health risks by increasing the concentration of other contaminants or by interfering with the treatment processes used to comply with other sdwa regulations in such cases the standard or treatment techniques must minimize the overall health risk also when proposing regulation the epa now must pub lish determination as to whether or not the benefits of the standard justify th costs if the epa determines that the benefits do not justify the costs the agency may with certain exceptions promulgate standard that maximizes health risk reduction benefits at cost that is justified by the benefits new regulations generally become effec tive three years after promulgation up to 2 additional years may be allowed if the epa or state in the case of an individual system determines the time is needed for capital improvements section 1448 outlines procedures for judicial review of epa actions involving the establishment of sdwa regulations and other final epa actions risk assessment the 1996 amendments also added risk assessment and risk communication provisions to sdwa when developing regulations the epa is required to 1 use the best availa ble peerreviewed science and supporting studies and data and 2 make publicly available risk assessment document that discusses estimated risks uncertainties and studies used in the assessment when proposing drinking water regulations the epa must publish health risk reduction and cost analysis hrrca the epa may promulgate an interim standard without first preparing this benefitcost analysis or making determination as to whether the benefits of regulation woul d justify the costs if the ad ministrator determines that contaminant presents an urge nt threat to public health variances and exemptions in anticipation that some systems particularly smaller ones could have difficulty co mplying with every regulation congress included in sdwa provisions for vari ances and exemptions section 1415 authorizes state to grant public water system variance from standard if raw water quality prevents meetin g the standard despite app lication of best technology and the variance does not result in an unr easonable risk to health 1996 provision subsection 1415e authorizes variances specifically for small systems based onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31243crs7 application of best affordab technology when devel oping regulation if the epa cannot identify technology that meets the standard and is affordable for small systems the epa must identify variance t echnologies that are affordable but do not necessarily meet the standard in cases where the epa has identified variance technologies then states may grant sma ll system variances to systems serving 3300 or fewer persons if the system cannot affo rd to comply with standard through treatment an alternative water source or restructuring and the variance ensures adequate protection of public health state may then grant variance to small system allowing the system to use variance technology to comply with regulation with epa approval states also may grant variances to systems serving between 3301 and 10000 persons variances are not available for microbial contaminants the epa has determined th at affordable compliance technologies are available for all existing standards thus small system variances are not available section 1416 aut horizes states to grant public water systems temporary exemption s from standards or treatment techni ques if system cannot comply for other compelling reasons including costs an exemption is intended to give water system more time to comply with regulation and can be issued only if it will not result in an unreasonable health risk qualified system may receive an exemption for up to three years beyond the compliance deadline systems serving 3300 or fewer persons may receive maximum of th ree additional twoyear extensions for total exemption duration of nine years state primacy section 1413 authorizes states to assu primary oversight and enforcement responsibility primacy for public water syst ems to assume primacy states must adopt regulations at least as stringent as national requirement s develop adequate procedures for enforcement adopt author ity for administrativ penalties maintain records and develop plan for providi ng safe drinking water under emergency circumstances currently 55 of 57 states nd territories have primacy authority for the public water system supe rvision pwss program under section 1443 congress author ized appropriations of 100 m illion annually for the epa to make grants to st ates to administer the pwss program this section directs the epa in accordance with regulations to allot the sums among the states on the basis of population geographi cal area number of public water systems and other relevant factors states are au thorized to use portion of their drinking water state revolving f und grant under secti on 1452 to cover the costs of administering the pwss program enforcement consumer information and citizen suits the safe drinking water act requires public water systems to monitor their water supplies to ensure compliance with drinking water sta ndards and to report monitoring results to the states states review monitoring data submitted by public water systems and also conduct their own monitoring to determine system compliance with drinking water regulations the epa monitors public water system compliance primarily by reviewing the violation data submitted by the states httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31243crs8 section 1414 requires that whenever the epa finds that public water system in state with primary enforcement authority does not comply with regulations the agency must notify the state and the system and provide assistance to bring the system into compliance if the state fails to commence enforcement action within 30 days after the notification the epa is aut horized to issue an administrative order or commence civil action in nonprimacy stat the epa must notify an elected local official if any has jurisdiction over the water system before commencing an enforcement action against the system the 1996 amendments strengthened enfo rcement authorities streamlined the process for issuing federal administrative orders increased administrative penalty amounts made more sections of the act clearly subject to ep enforcement and required states as condition of primacy to have administrative penalty authority the amendments also provided that forcement action may be taken against public water system that has plan to consolidate with another system consumer information and reports enforcement provisions also require public water systems to notify customers of violations of drinki ng water standards or other requirements such as monitoring and reporting requireme nts systems must notify customers within 24 hours of any viol ations that have the potential to cause serious health effects additionally community water systems must mail to all customers an annual consumer confidence re port on contaminants detected in their drinking water states are required to prepare annual reports on the compliance of public water systems and to make summaries available to the epa and the public the epa must prepare annual national compliance reports section 1414c citizen suits section 1449 provides for citizen s civil actions citizen suits may be brought against any person or agency allegedly in violation of provisions of the act or against the epa administrator for alleged failure to perform any action or duty which is not discretionary compliance improvement programs the 1996 amendments added two stat eadministered programs aimed at improving public water system compliance with drinking water regulations the operator certification program and the capac ity development program section 1419 required states to adopt programs for trai ning and certifying operators of community and nontransient noncommunity sy stems eg schools and workpl aces that have their own wells the epa is required to wit hhold 20 of states annual dwsrf grant unless the state has adopted and impleme nts an operator certification program relatedly section 1420 require d states to establish capac ity development programs also based on epa guidance congress specified that the programs must include 1 legal authority to ensure that new syst ems have the technical financial and managerial capacity to meet sdwa requirements and 2 strategy to assist existing systems that are experiencing difficulties to come into compliance the epa is required to withhold portion of srf grants from states that do not have capacity development strategies the agency has not had to withhold funds under either of these programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31243crs9 2 according to the epa of roughly 156600 public water systems 142400 rely on ground water and 14200 rely on surface water among roughly 51700 community water systems 40000 rely on ground water and 11700 rely on surface water 3 the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 322 amended sdwa 1421d to specify that the definition of underground injection excludes the injection of fluids or propping agents other than diesel fuels used in hydr aulic fracturing operations related to oil gas or geothermal production activities 4 the wells are classified as follows cl ass i inject hazardous wastes industrial nonhazardous liquids or muni cipal wastewater beneath th lowermost usdw class ii inject brines and other fluids associated with oil and gas production and hydrocarbons for storage class iii inject fluids associated with solution mining of minerals beneath the lowermost usdw class iv inject hazardous or radioactive wastes into or above usdws and generally are banned and class v all other injection wells many of these wells inject nonhazardous fluids into or above usdws and are typically shallow onsite disposal systemsground water protection programs most public water systems rely on ground water as source of drinking water and part c of the act focu ses on ground water protection2 section 1421 authorized the establishment of state underground inj ection control uic programs to protect underground sources of drinking water u sdws in 1977 the epa issued mandated regulations that contained minimum requireme nts for state uic programs to prevent underground injection that enda ngers drinking water sources and that required states to prohibit any underground injection not authorized by state permit the law specified that the regulations could not interfere with the underground injection of brine from oil and gas production or rec overy of oil unless underground sources of drinking water would be affected3 section 1422 authorized ffected states to submit plans to the epa for implementing uic programs and if approved to assu primary enforcement responsibility if states plan has not b een approved or the state has chosen not to assume program responsibility then the ep must implement the program section 1423 for oil and gas injection operations only states with uic programs are delegated primary enforcement authority without meeting epa regulations provided states demonstrate that they have an effective program that prevents underg round injection that endangers drinking water sources section 1425 to implement this program epa placed uic wells in five classes based on simila rity in the fluids injected and construction injection depth design nd operating techniques and issued regulations that establis h performance criteria for each class4 epa has delegated primacy for all classes of wells to 34 states it shares implementation responsibility in six states and implement s the uic program fo r all well classes in 10 states subsection 1424e authorizes the epa to make determin ations on epas initiative or upon petition that an aquifer is the sole or princi pal drinking water source for an area in areas that overlie designated solesource aquifer federal funding may be committed for projects that the epa determines may contaminatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31243crs10 such an aquifer any person may petition for sole source aquifer designation nationwide the epa had design ated 73 sole source aquifers the act contains three additional state programs aimed specifically at protecting ground water added in 1986 sectio n 1427 established procedures for demonstration programs to develop impleme nt and assess critical aquifer protection areas already designated by the administrat or as sole source aquifers section 1428 also added in 1986 established an elect ive state program for protecting wellhead areas around public water system wells if state established wellhead protection program by 1989 and the epa approved the states program then the epa may award grants covering between 50 and 90 of the costs of implementing the program in 1996 congress added secti on 1429 authorizing the epa to make 50 grants to states to develop programs to ensure coordinate d and comprehensive protection of ground water within the states appropriations for these programs were authorized through fy2003 as follows 15 million per year for section 1427 30 million per year for section 1428 and 15 million per year for section 1429 source water assessment nd protecti on programs the 1996 amendments expanded the acts pollution prevention focus to embrace protection of surface water as well as ground water section 1453 required the epa to publish guidance for states to implement source water assessment programs that delineate boundaries of the areas from which systems receive water and identify the origins of contaminants in those areas to determine systems susceptibility to contamination states with approved assessment progra ms may adopt alternative monitoring requirements for water system s as provided for in section 1418 section 1454 authorized source wate r petition program based on voluntary partnerships between state nd local governments states may establish program under which community water system or local government may submit petition to the state requesting assistance in developing voluntary source water quality protection partnership to 1 reduce the presence of contaminants in drinking water 2 receive financial or technical assistan ce and 3 develop longterm source water protection strategy this s ection authorized 5 million each year for grants to states to support petition programs also states may use up to 10 of their dwsrf grant to support various source water protecti on activities including the petition program state revolving funds in 1996 congress authorized drinking water state revolving loan fund dwsrf program to help systems finance improvements needed to comply with sdwa regulations section 1452 the epa is authorized to make grants to states to capitalize dwsrfs which states then may use to make loans to public water systems states must match 20 of the fe deral grant grants are allotted based on the results of needs surveys each state and the district of columbia must receive at least 1 of th appropriated funds drinking water srfs may be used to provide loans for expenditures that the epa has determined will facilitate compliance or significantly further the acts healthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31243crs11 5 for more information see crs report rs22037 drinking water state revolving fund program overview and issues by mary tiemannprotection objectives states must make av ailable 15 of their annual allotment for loan assistance to systems that serve 10000 or fewer persons to the extent that funds can be obligated for eligible projects states may use up to 30 of their dwsrf grant to provide loan subsidies includi ng forgiveness of principal to help economically disadvantaged communities also states may use portion of funds for technical assistance source water protection and capacity development programs and for operator certification the law authorized appropriations of 599 million for fy1994 and 1 billion per year for fy1995 through fy2003 for dwsrf capitalization grants the epa was directed to reserve from annual dwsrf appropriations 033 for financial assistance to several trusts and territories 10 million for health effects research on drinking water contaminants 2 million for the costs of monitoring for unregulated contaminants and up to 2 for technical assistance the epa may use 15 of funds each year for making grants to i ndian tribes and alaska native villages5 drinking water security the 107th congress passed the public hea lth security and bioterrorism preparedness and response ac t of 2002 pl 107188 to address wide range of security issues title iv of the bioterro rism act amended sdwa to address threats to drinking water security ke provisions are summarized below vulnerability assessments under new sdwa section 1433 each community water system serving more than 3300 people was required to conduct an assessment of the systems vulnerability to terrorist attacks or other intentional acts intended to disrupt the provisi on of safe and reliable dr inking water supply this provision established deadlines based on sy stem size for community water systems to certify to the epa that they had conducted vulnerability assessment and to submit to the epa copy of the assessmen t section 1433 exempted the contents of the vulnerability assessments from disclosu re under the freedom of information act except for information contained in the certification identifying the system and the date of the certification and it provides for civil and criminal
