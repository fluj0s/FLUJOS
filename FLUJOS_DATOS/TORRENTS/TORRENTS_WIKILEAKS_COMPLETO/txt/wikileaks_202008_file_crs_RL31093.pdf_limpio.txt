increase to the imf of 12 billion to be used to support monetary stability in member countries thr ough the instrumentality of currency boards what is currency board how does it differ from an alternative monetary arrangement such as central ba nk why was it adopted by countries with histories of chronic inflation eg arge ntina and those emerging from the soviet bloc eg bulgaria and urged upon those suddenly hit by currency speculation eg indonesia what ro did the currency board play in argentinas 20012003 financial difficulties and why was it abandoned alt hough factors affecting the decision to adopt currency board vary from country to country as do outcomes fundamental differences between currency boa rds and central banks remain constant this report focuses on their differences to provide foundation for evaluating disparate cases to understand the differences it should be noted that the most important function of central bank is its ability to lter the supply of money when this power is abused as occurs when central banks must provide the monetary wherewithal to finance government budget ficits it undermines the func tions that money performs in market economy that of unit of account medium of exchange and store of value history is replete with episodes of such an abuse of monetary policy the most egregious consequences of abuse are to be found in episode s of hyperinflation with prices rising daily countries have sought variety of monetary arrangements to curtail abuse in the issuance of money significant example is currency board currency boards now function in bulgaria hong kong djibouti lithuania estonia and brunei and are promoted by some economists as means for developi ng countries to achieve macroeconomic stability the sole function of these boards is to issue currency and coins that are 100 backed by commodity eg gold and silver or by the stable valued currency of another country currency board is forbidden from altering the amount of currency by buying or selling assets denominated in domestic money as result the currency it issues is safe or of stable va lue or as stable in value as the currency to which it is linked and this stability would contribute to the vital role money plays in market economies currency board arrangement is very similar in nature to the formal adoption of another countrys cu rrency popularly known as dollarization using currency board has potential downs ide for country it is exposed to every shock that affects the exchange ra of the country to which it has tied its currency and prevents the use of monetary policy to counter those shocks argentina is recent example of what can happen in currency board c ountry argentina linked its currency to the us dollar the large appreciation of the dollar between mid1995 nd 2002 had severely depressing affect on the argentine economy which led to the abandonment of the curre ncy board and economic crisis unlike central banks currency boards also lack lenderoflastresort function in financial crisis currency boa rds would be unable to lowe r interest rates and lend banks money to quell bank runs this report will not be

federal reserve system of the united states is an example it has variety of powers and functions to perform important among these is the ability to alter the reserve and lending base of commercial banks and in the process the supply of money to act as the lender of last resort to the financial system to provide facilities for clearing checks to serve as fiscal adviser to the federal government and to provide economic advice suppose that the federal reserve were suddenly shorn of all its powers and instead its sole function was to issue curre ncy and coins that were secured or backed 100 by gold silver or other commodities or by the currency of another country such as switzerland or germany whose infla tion rate had been low for considerable period of time further suppose that the exch ange rate of the dollar in terms of the commodity or foreign currency would be fixed immutably and could only be changed under circumstances that were well defined in the law mo reover to ensure that the new system worked as intended major ity of the governors of the reformed federal reserve would be foreigners the in stitutional headquarters and the site where the reserves of the system were deposited w ould be in some foreign safe haven and these reserves would be inaccessible to the government of the united states many informed americans would doubt consider this radical change in the conduct of us monetary policy yet this type of mone tary regime which is called currency board is currently in us in the manner described in this paper in bulgaria hong kong djibouti lithuania estonia and brunei1 it played an important role in argentina between 1991 and 2002 an important role of congress is to wo rk with the administration the federal reserve and international institutions such as

claim that the presence of currency board was central to argentinas 19992002 problems2 this report will describe currency board monetary re gime how it functions how it compares with central bank system and discuss assessments of its strengths and limitations the currency board system in this type of monetary regime an institution is created known as currency board3 whose only function is to issue and exchange local currency and coin on demand at fixed rate of exchange for given quantity of commodity or for foreign currency known respectively as th reserve asset and reserve currency and the country whose assets back the currenc board is known as the reserve country in argentina for example the currency board could only issue the local currency called the peso upon the receipt of us do llars likewise it would exchange dollars for pesos on oneforone basis as result the notes and coins issued by currency boards are secured 100 by commodity or foreign currency in the case of argentina by the us dollar in actual practice currency board would not hold all its assets in the foreign currency rather some of its assets perhaps large pr oportion would be held in anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31093crs3 4 open market operations involve the purchase of government securities or other qualified assets such as commercial paper or foreign exch ange by the central bank when these assets are purchased the effect on the economy is th same as if new currency were created economists say that these open market operati ons create high powered money since this money can serve as the reserves of the banking system and be used to create multiple dollars of deposit money 5 banks in the united states are legally obligated to hold sum equal to 10 of their demand deposits above 428 million 3 below 428 million in the form of currency in their own vaults or on deposit with the federa l reserve against all other deposits banks hold reserves which prudence suggests are adequa to meet sudden withdrawals in the currency board system these reserves would ta ke the form of local currency and would be held either as vault cash or on deposit with government agency other than the currency board the latter would not be depository for bank reservesinterestearning form denominated in the reserve currency eg us treasury bond this helps ensure that the board earns fficient income to offset the expenses of maintaining its currency and coins in circulation as well as build up reserve to cover any possible losses that might be sustained because of adverse movements in the interest rates on the securities it holds or due to defaults it is important to note that cu rrency board would be prohibited from purchasing any assets financia l or otherwise denominated in local currency if it were not so prohibited it could function ex actly as central bank and be able to independently alter the money supply and shortterm intere st rates through socalled open market operations4 thus the use of major policy tool in traditional monetary policy involving variations in the supply of money through open market operations is ruled out the inability to engage in discretionary monetary policy is likely to be major reason why currency boards remain an unattractive alternative for many countries nothing in currency board regime w ould prohibit commercial banks in that country from existing and issuing dema nd saving and time deposits as well as money market accounts thus the existe nce of currency board does not rule out the development of range of liquid fi nancial assets or the development of commercial banking or the financial system in general the deposits of commercial banks however would not be backed 100 by reserve currency the type of fractional reserve banking typical of the united states and othe r developed countries could be feature of currency board regime5 hypothetically unless explicitly prohibited variations in th reserve ratio by some ce ntral authority would make possible some variations in the money supply relative to the base of reserve currency or amount of local currency outstanding the assorted nonmonetary functions of ten performed by central banks would have to be assumed by some other government agency these include serving as depository for bank reserves acting as lende r of last resort to the banking system managing foreign exchange reserves opera ting clearing house serving as fiscal agent for the government administering deposit insurance system regulating financial institutions and offering economic advice to the governmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31093crs4 6 there is one other way for the supply of curre ncy to grow this is from the income earned on the reserve assets held by the currency board these earnings however will be recorded in the countrys international balance of paymentscountries that have currency boards are not precluded from participating in international trade and are likely to be both international lenders and the recipient of international capital flows their participation in the world of international trade and finance is however somewhat indirect the exchange rate between their currency and the currency of the reserve country is fixed even though the two currencies may look different reflecting prefer ences in national design they are exchangeable at fixed rate since they are fixed the currenc board countrys exchange rate with the rest of the world is automa tically determined by the re serve countrys exchange rate with the rest of the world thus if estonia currency board country links its currency to the euro and the euro appreciates in foreign exchange markets by say 25 the estonian currency would also appr eciate by the same amount this means that any change in the exchange rate of the reserve country relative to that of any other country will also be experienced by the currency board country as explained below this can be disadvantage of curre ncy board if the currency of the reserve country appreciates on world financial markets it coul d force deflation on the currency board country money supply growth while excessive money supply growth is the source of excessive inflation some money growth is necessary for stable price level price level stability requires that the growth in money spending match the growth in potential output and the growth in money spending is likely to require some growth in the supply of money in currency board regime money supply growth can come about from either the growth in currency or the growth in those bank deposits counted as money eg deposits on which checks can be drawn for currency to grow the currency board mu st acquire additional reserve currency or reserve assets and this happens primarily through the balance of international payments the currency board country must receive in payment more than is paid out for the trade of goods and services receipts from gifts unilateral transfers and other income and from the sale of capital assets ie an inflow of foreign investment6 this net difference is then settled by an inflow of monies that can be converted into reserve currency the growth in reserve currency will then permit an increase in the local currency issued by the currency board the money supply itself can continue to increase even if the stock of currency remains constant this can and does occur when indivi duals desire to hold less of their liquid wealth in the form of currenc the redundant currency is then deposited in banks where it serves as reserves for multiple increase in the amount of deposit money in addition as noted above some central authority could alter the legal reserve requirement imposed on bank deposits allowing some additional flexibility in the supply of money there are of course limits to the ra nge of variation in reserve requirementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31093crs5 7 there is popular alternative theoretical xplanation for the behavior of the balance of payments the socalled monetary approach it suggests somewhat different chain of events if the currency board countrys mone supply growth is insufficient to accommodate the growth in money demand following grow th in real income according to this approach the growth in real output would in crease the demand for money if the domestic money supply did not expand to accommodate this demand actual money holding would then be less than desired holdings in orde r to build up money balances individuals would be led to refrain from spending some of the decreased spending would fall on imported goods tending to produce balance of payments surplus an inflow of reservable currency and an expansion in the money supply some of the reservable currency would become additional bank reserves on the basis of which additional deposit money could be created this analysis would also be relevant to situ ation in which reservable asset such as gold is used in place of reservable currency if this theory is correct it suggests that from time to time the economy would be placed under deflationary pressure as individuals attempted to build up their money balances similarl the economy would come under inflationary pressure if the domestic money supply grew too rapidly for discussion of this approach see mordechai kreinin and lawrence h officer the monetary approach to the balance of payments survey princeton studies in internati onal finance 43 princeton 1978 the question arises whether currency boa rd regime can provide for rate of growth of the money supply and money sp ending over time that will yield stable price level the answer to the question is that in currency board system money supply growth comes to depend heavily on the monetary policy pursued by the country whose currency is used as reserve as long as inflation in the reserve country is stable the currency board w ill automatically cause similar but not identical inflation rate in the currency boa rd country thus if money supply growth in the currency board country is too rapid so that inflation occurs individuals would shift to buying goods in other countries and people in other countries would refrain from buying the now more expensive goods produced in the currency board country this would produce trade deficit or smaller surplus all else equal this deficit would drain currency reserves from the cu rrency board and brin g about an automatic contraction of the money supply and w ith it fall in the inflation rate alternatively should the money supply and money spending grow more slowly in the currency board country than in the reserve currency country its lower rate of inflation would lead to increased exports to the reserve currency country this would lead to balance of payments surplus an inflow of reserve currency deposit of some of this currency in banks which would augment their reserves and multiple expansion of the money supply and more ra pid rate of growth of money spending7 it is not an uncommon event for econo mies to experience sudden and dramatic changes in the publics willingness to hold bank deposits monetary system should be able to accommodate shifts in th composition of money balances between currency and deposits in way that does not alter the size of the money stock currency board regime may be illsuited to deal with such changes should such sudden desire for currency manifest itself in currency board system there is mechanism by which currency can be s upplied to accommodate the sudden surge inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31093crs6 8 the ratio of currency to deposits has undergone many and sometimes rapid changes in the united states for an examination of the be havior of the currency ratios during the period 19201980 see mark ladenson and gail makinen the currency ratios 19201980 re examination atlantic economic journal dec 1992demand8 instead the money supply must sh rink causing price deflation this phenomenon is what economists have in mind when they say that currency board countries do not have lender of last resort in this instance it is the absence of central authority for supplying the dditional currency dema nded by the public similarities to dollarization currency board is monetary arrangement that most closely resembles the unilateral adoption by country of foreign currency popularly known as dollarization some countries do not i ssue their own local currency but instead use foreign currencies for their domestic tr ansactions for example ecuador and panama use the us dollar in thes countries the money supply grows when citizens receive more dollars through in ternational trade nd investment and unilateral transfers then they send abroad for these purposes these same factors cause the money supply to increase under currency board in dollarized country local credit conditions are altered anytime the federal reserve alters monetary policy just as in country with cu rrency board tied to the dollar the only economic difference between the two is that currency board is way for country to both have the benefits that come from link to large stable valued currency and at the same time earn the income called seigniorage that comes from issuing its own money by contrast th seigniorage of dollarized countries is collected by the us government this profit can be viewed in two ways first each dollar the us government issues enables it to buy dollars worth of goods and services since it uses up some resources to print and maintain the dollar in circulation the net amount of goods and serv ices it can buy is somewhat less than dollar second issuing currency to buy goods and services can be thought of as an alternative to issuing interestbearing debt for the same purposes hence each dollar of currency issued means that the us g overnment saves the in terest it would have to pay if it had instead issued interestbear ing debt the amount of interest saved is not onetime event it is saved year after year the present discounted value of those interest payments is equal to the amount of currency issued less the cost to maintain that currency in circulation by using another countrys currency government gives up seigniorage currency board enables government to capture seigniorage this occurs because the reservable assets held by the currency board as backing for the notes and coins that it issues would not likely be held entirely in foreign currency or metals rather some part potentially large part would be held in highly liquid interest earning assets denominated in the reserve currency the income earned on these assets over and above that re quired to defray the costs of operating the system would be available to the government thus currency board regime can generate seigniorage but perhaps somewhat less th an would be available under comparable central banking regimehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31093crs7 9 the power of central bank and monetary policy is greatly enhanced in world that uses flexible exchange rates however since currency board system is one of fixed exchange rates it would be misleading to compare it to central bank operating in flexible exchange rate world 10 the us occupied special place in the bretton woods system in that it supplied the reserve currency thus the us central bank did not face many of the constraints faced by other central banks the comparison in this section is comparison with nonreserve currency central bankhistorically many countries chose currency boards because they were very small and found central bank an expensiv institution to operate this helps explain why currency boards were used extensively by many british colonial dependencies some of which were small island states or sparsely populated areas these colonial dependencies chose to ope rate currency board instead of simply adopting the british pound because of the desire for seigniorage earnings comparison with central bank to further highlight the characteristics of currency board regime it is useful to compare it to central bank regime to make valid comparison it must be with central bank operating in system of fixed exchange rates9 such monetary regime is compatible with both the gold standard and the so called bretton woods system that evolved after world war ii nd remained fixture of the world economy until the early 1970s10 since the collapse of the bretton woods system many developing countries have operated fixed exchange rate systems and some european countries participated in fixed exchange rate system called the european monetary system before the creation of the euro fixed exchange rate regime imposes substantial limitati ons on the conduct of monetary policy by central bank essentia lly monetary policy is constrained by the necessity to maintain the fixed exchange rate it would be difficult for example in such regime to focus monetary policy on goal designed to maintain high employment to the extent that this requires interest rates below comparable rates elsewhere it encourages the outflow of capital balance of payments deficit and the loss of international reserves either of gold or foreign exchange as the central bank seeks to prevent the exchange rate from preciating the end result of policies that conflict with the need to maintain the exchange rate is change in the balance sheet of the central bank reserves of gold and foreign exchange are lost and replaced by government bonds or other domestic asse ts that are eligible for open market operations moreover the pursuit of goals that conflict with the need to maintain the exchange rate are viable only in the very short run since ultimately the central bank would run out of reserves needed to support the exchange rate in fixed exchange rate system central bank intent on maintaining the exchange rate is little different in its behavior from currency board it must stand ready to convert its money into gold or other foreign currenc ies on demand at the fixed rate of exchange moreover as in currency board regime the monetary system in central bank regime is unlik ely to have its outstanding money supply backed 100 by gold and foreign exchange but unlike currency board ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31093crs8 11 the currency board country would also have to be willing to accep t inflation when the money supply grew too rapidly but the infla tion rate would be far lower than what most countries have historically experienced pr ior to the adoption of their currency boardssubstantial portion of the money stock would be backed by central bank and commercial bank holdings of ssets denominated in domestic money this allows the central bank to alter the money supply in the pursuit of domestic goals such as full employment as long as this goal does not contradict the maintenance of the fixed exchange rate to the extent that it triggers large capital outflows the proponents of currency boards stress crucial difference between the two systems central banks maintain pegged not fixed exchange rates whereas currency boards maintain fixed exchange rates this means that the exchange rates in so called fixedrate central banking system are often subject to unexpected changes history demonstrates that when fixed exchange rate regimes prevailed there were frequent changes in the exchange rates of ten because the central banks were used to promote goals such as high employment that were incompatible with the exchange rate when the rates were changed it wa s often in response to massive speculative attacks on the currency in question the attacks on the british pound and italian lira that occurred in september 1992 and th east asian curre ncies phillippines indonesia thailand and hong kong in 1997 are typical of the circumstances under which pegged exchange rates are changed currency boards on the other hand auto matically defend the exchange rate because they cannot pursue any other econo mic goal than currency convertibility and cannot hold reserves denominated in local currency however opponents of currency boards would argue that the viability of maintaining them when the exchange rate has become unsustainable ultimately comes down to the willingness of the government to accept deflation nd recession regardless of the fact that combating these phenomena are not stated goals of monetary policy11 when the exchange rate becomes misaligned the cu rrency board must be abandoned unless the government is willing to accept the defl ation and accompanying recession necessary for the exchange rate to become competitive again just as is true in fixed exchange rate regime speculators m oved against both the argentine and hong kong currency board in recent years because they doubted that th government would accept deflation in the case of argentina th ey were right not so with hong kong the advantages and disadvantages of currency boards advantages there are both political and economic reasons why countri find currency boards an attractive alternative to central banks currency boards eliminates high inflation politically while it is common to think of currency board as c onstraining nations monetary policy it also exercises considerable restraint on the fiscal activities of government sincehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31093crs9 12 the ability of central bank to print money to finance budget deficit depends on the type of international monetary regime to which it is committed gold standard for example requires that central bank monetary policy be geared to maintaining given price for gold similarly nongold standard fixed exchange rate regime requires that the monetary policy of central bank must be governed by commitment to maintain the exchange rate within prescribed limits both types of regimes substantially limit the ability of central bank to provide financial support to the government any support that it gives must be compatible with the objective to eith er keep the price of gold constant or the exchange rate within prescribed limits in flexible exchange rate regime these constraints are removed as they are in fixed exchange rate regime if the government is not really committed to maintainin g the exchange ratelocal currency can be issued only in exchange for the reserve asset or currency it cannot be issued to purchase government debt and hence government could longer finance budget deficits by recourse to the printing press as it could under some central bank arrangements12 thus countries that have long history of inflation linked to the financing of fiscal deficits by resort to the printing press or who place large premium on relatively stable prices are likely to find currency board regime an attractive alternative to central bank argentina adopted currency board after very troubled history of high and unstable inflation rates the adoption of currency boards by estonia lithuania and bulgaria was motivated by belief that this action would ensure stable valued currency and would facilitate their transition to market economies and serve to enti ce foreign investment when monetary systems function smoothly the important role that stable money plays in market economies is frequently overlooked or neglected money performs three important functions first it fac ilitates exchanges and reduces the time and trouble inherent in barter as result it enables economies to produce and exchange more goods and services than would be po ssible in system that relied on barter second money as common denominator in terms of which all goods and services can be expressed makes possible modern accounting systems and the entire system of contracts that are cornerstone of busine ss third money is said to be store of value which means that generalized purchasing power or wealth either in the form of money itself or financia l instruments denominated in the unit of account are made possible in societies which have money and these fi nancial instruments play major role in the functi oning of market economies when monetary systems do not function well meaning those that experience episodes of high inflation the establishe d money loses these qualities with this development exchange is likely to revert to barter or involve the use foreign currency prices are quoted in variety of different fore ign monies individuals are longer content to hold fi nancial assets deno minated in local currency resources are wasted avoiding inflati on and repricing goods and c ontracts disappear or become very short term furthermore production is hampered by low levels of foreign investment and lack of credit as financial institutions tend to suspend operation or fail to lend except for very short periods of time and unemployment rises in general poorly functioning monetary system can be severe handicap to an economy because of this some countries have opted for currency board in the belief that it will produce for them stable currency and stable monetary system httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31093crs10 table 1 inflation rate before and after the adoption of currency board in the 1990s three years before three years after argentina 30869

political advantage to currency boards is that they are likely to be good way to deal with what economists call the time inconsistency problem the ultimate purpose of economic activity in market economies is the wellbeing of the consumer that well being consists of being able to consume goods and services that come closest to satisfying wants to arrange work and leisur that conforms to individual preferences to enable consumers to divide their inco between consumption and saving in such way that it maximizes their preferences between immediate and future gratification economic activity also requires judicious decisions about choices for investing saving among alternative investment possibilities and so on all of this activity requires information an important part of this information concerns the likely policies of the government especially th monetary policy of the central bank on the basis of expectations about these polic ies individuals make choices and conclude agreements or make contracts time consistent policy regime is one in which the government carries out the polices that it announces in this case individual expectations are fulfilled and the choices they have made lead to an optimum outcome for them and for the economy however there is an incentive fo r the government to cheat or to carry out policies that are different from those expected to prevail by economic agents suppose for example that central bank had as its announced goal stable price level and that economic agents believed th at it would carry out policies to achieve this end these agents would then make c ontracts for example to fix money wages based on the expectation that prices woul d be stable if central bank should suddenly depart from this policy and instea d engineer inflation this would reduce the real wage of labor and encourage busin esses to hire more workers or work the existing employees extra hours this policy might generate more rapid rate of gdp growth and lower unemployment rate at least temporarily until it came time to renegotiate various contacts this chan ge in central bank behavior would not however be optimum from the perspec tive of economic agents it is inconsistent with the optimizing behavior of economic agents and from that perspective it is sub optimal had these agents known what wa s going to happen they would have built this into their expectations and their beha vior the central bank would have fooledhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31093crs11 13 see finn kydland and edward prescott rules rather than discretion the inconsistency of optimal plans journal of political economy v 85 1977 p 473 and robert barro and david gordon rules discre tion and reputation in model of monetary policy journal of monetary economics vol 12 1983 p 101people once but it is unlikely they would be able to fool them again by losing credibility the central banks future policy would then be less effective perhaps it is not surprising that countries who have adopted currency boards are often those in which monetary policy has lost its credibility13 currency board is less likely to engage in timeinconsistent behavior because it cannot engage in discretionary chan ges in the money supply and thus cannot engineer monetary surprises because it is bound by rule to increase currency only to the extent that it acquires reservable assets it has discretion in altering the amount of currency in circulation this is not the case with central bank especially one that operates in country linked to ot her countries by flexible exchange rates thus it can be argued that currency board regime is more likely to ensure time consistent policies than would central bank regime currency boards encourage trade and investment the major economic advantage that currency board has over floating exchange rates is that exchange rate stability encourages international trade and investment it does so by eliminating the exchange rate risk involve d in these transactions under floating exchange rates since many economists believe that international trade and investment are an important source of grow th for developing countries it is argued that currency board could have signif icant effect on the sustainable rate of economic growth traditional fixed exchange rate regimes also eliminate exchange rate risk but to the extent that currency boards are viewed as more durable than fixed exchange rate regimes currency boards do more to encourage international trade and investment currency board proponents tend to argue that the extensive list of fixed exchange rate failures in the 1990s have d investors to believe that currency boards are the only fixed exchange rate regime that can be trusted hence they claim only currency boards significantly increase international trade and investment disadvantages currency boards also have their critics the critics tend to concentrate their attack along several lines central banks can act responsibly first they point out that there is long history of responsible behavior by central banks the central banks in many countries have had great ccess in producing long periods of price stability and high employment the degree to which they are able to achieve this goal depends on several factors important among them are an absence of negative supply side shocks such as those that arise from disr uption in the worlds output of oil and responsible fiscal policy on the part of gove rnment recent studies suggest that the ability of central banks to pursue goal of price stability depends critically on government fiscal policy where fiscal deficits are large even in the best of times where domestic capital markets are poorly developed and where access tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31093crs12 14 it is useful to note that economists have devised wide range of monetary rules compatible with floating exchan ge rates that tie the hands of irresponsible policymakers for examples see us library of cong ress congressional research service formulation of monetary policy by the federal reserve rules vs discretion by marc labonte crs report rl31056 and the federal reserve should its sole m andated goal be price stability by marc labonte and gail makinen crs report 9816e 15 by contrast proponents argue governments will never act responsibly enough to enjoy the benefits making currency boards second best solution 16 this critique draws heavily from small but important literature in monetary economics known as the theory of optimum currency ar eas when currency board is created it automatically ties local economy to the economy of the reserve currency country through fixed exchange rate between the two currencies question arises whether the new larger currency area is an optimum arrangement if the two regions business cycles are well harmonized then the arrangement is optimum business cycles tend not to be well optimized if an economic shock does not affect the two regions economies equally even if the two regions do not have well harmonized business cycles joint currency may still succeed the attributes of an optimum area depend on the degree to which wage and price flexibility characterize the new region if wage s and prices are quite flexible in both the currency board and reserve currency countries then case can be made that they should be linked together with fixed exchange rate or for that matter with common currency because both will respond in the same way to demand and supply shocks it is often said that wage and price flexibility is key to the success of hong kongs currency board if the degree of price and wage flexibility is quite di fferent in the two countries then the case for fixed exchange rate between them is weaker however there are number of factors that can substitute for price flexibility and thus warrant the establishment of common continuedinternational credit is limited central banks are often forced to print money to cover fiscal shortfalls countries in these circumstances ar prone to poor inflation performance this is not the fault of centr bank regimes per rather the fault lies in political process14 basically critics of currency boards argue that floating exchange rates offer valuable benefits and policymakers should focus on ways to convince governments to act responsibly enough to enjoy them15 the critics also question whether currency boards really solve the time inconsistency problem wh ile it is true that curre ncy board itself cannot bring about discretionary changes in the supply of currency and money they are exposed to the time inconsistency tendencies of the reservable asset countries thus for example if the us federal reserve were to engage in time inconsistent behavior it would be communicated to country such as argentina regardless of the fact that argentina has currency board currency boards make country vulnerable to economic shocks another and more forceful line of criticism is that c ountries are often faced by variety of shocks that are most appropriately dealt with by adjusting exchange rates since this is virtually impossible in cu rrency board regime these shocks must be dealt with either by deflation or infla tion most worrisome are the deflationary adjustments the economic travails of argentina which abandoned its currency board have been used by critics to demonstrate problems posed by deflation in such monetary regime16 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31093crs13 16 continued currency area there are four major substitutes first how integrated are the two nations financial systems in other words are intere st rate changes highly correlated between the two nations the more complete the integration the better second what is the degree of freedom with which labor and capital can move within the larger currency region the higher the degree of factor mobility the stronger the case for fixed exchange rate third what is the degree of mutual trade between the two countries the more integrated the goods and services markets and the larger th proportion of trade between the two countries the stronger is the case for fixed exchange ra fourth some individuals have argued that the case for fixed exchange rate embodied in currency board regime is strengthened if the political process in both countries is suppor tive of the fixed exchange rate relationship this requires shared commitment to both fi scal and monetary stability including fiscal transfers when one regions growth falls belo w the others one can see that the 50 us states share all of these qualities making th shared dollar success the literature on optimum currency areas suggests that currency board arrangement whose purpose as explained above is to achieve price stability would not be an optimum arrangement if both countries did not possess high degree of wa ge and price flexibility and the factors that could substitute for or mitigate this difference are not present thus one cannot make general case for or against currency boards they must be evaluated on casebycase basis depending on the degree to which they contribute to an optimum currency area but it can be argued empirically that most currency boa rd countries tie their currency to reserve countries that have economies with very little in common with their own as result the currency board country is frequently stuck with monetary stance inconsistent with the needs of its economy for the seminal article in this literature see robert mundell theory of optimum currency areas american economic review vol 51 september 1961 pp 657665 17 one of the foremost experts on currency boards dr kurt schuler maintains that argentina did not operate an orthodox currency boa rd rather it is more appropriate to call it convertibility system see schuler kurt was argentinas convertibility system currency board unpublished paper november 14 2003the argentine peso was linked on onet oone basis to the us dollar by currency board17 between mid1995 and mid2001 th us dollar appreciated in real or inflationadjusted terms against market basket of 26 currencies by about 33 the increase raised the price of argentine exports in foreign countries and reduced the price of foreign goods in ar gentina by roughly comparable amount as result markets for argentine exports withered and the people of argentina substituted cheaper foreign goods and rvices for compar able goods produced domestically the result was trade deficit an outflow of money to cover the deficit and constant deflationary pressure in ar gentina because of the currency board argentina could not alter the pesodollar exchange rate rather to restore equilibrium with balanced international trade argentina had to rely on an increase in unemployment to cause wages and prices to fall with wages having to fall more than prices when the unemployment ra rose above 15 and the country was threatened by extreme political instability policymakers decided they could longer tolerate the consequences of continued deflation they d ecided to abandon the currency board and revert back to central bank regime typically when the exchange rate is out of equilibrium devaluation can help an economy recover by making expor ts an importcompeting goods more competitive what made argentinas problem s so difficult to solve is that althoughhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31093crs14 the overvalued exchange rate had become hi ghly deflationary the currency board had encouraged economic developments that made abandoning the currency board even more damaging for example the argentine banking system became highly dollar denominated following the devalua tion the entire banking system became insolvent because the banks now needed more pesos to pay off their dollar denominated liabilities the argentine example the critics claim contradicts the claim of currency board proponents that currenc boards eliminate the economic risks that prevent developing countries from receiving foreign investment and enjoying the low interest rates that us borrowers enjoy currency boards only eliminate exchange rate risk in countries such as argentina they ma in fact have increased economic risk leading to higher interest rates economic risk can be increased as in argentina by subjecting the country to exchange rate s hocks that may have little to do with their own economic and financial conditions rather the country is exposed to the international exchange rate behavior of the reserve count ry to which it has linked its currencies and this can have serious dverse economic consequences when the conditions for an optimum currency area do not prevail table 2 illustrates the severity of the economic crisis that argentina underwent before and after the devaluation in 2001 in 2002 gdp shrank by nearly 11 and output is still far below its precrisis level table 2 economic indicators in argentina 2000 2001

august 1998 the critics claim also expose another weakness of currency board the hong kong monetary authority the official body responsible for administering the hong kong currency board alleged that he dge funds and other large investors were partic ipating in what they called double play on hong kong financial markets it was alleged that these hedge funds were simultaneously short selling secur ities on the hong kong stock market and selling hong kong dollars back to the currency board short sale of an equity is financ ial derivative contract whereby the buyer profits if the equity pr ice

the stock market short because of rational fears of the asian crisis spreading to hong kong for more detailed description of this event see financial stability forum report of the working group on highly leveraged institutions march 2000 p 130132 fair shares the economist oct 29 1998 19 proponents of currency boards have argued th at foreign banks would probably come into the market to spur competition and aid in development the incentive to do so would be especially strong for banks from the country w hose currency is used as reserve since there would be exchange rate risk between the local money and the reserve currency they argue that the presence of foreign banks which are branches of banks in the reserve currency country would obviate the need for lender of last resort thus desire to swap local deposits for local currency is met by foreign banks borrowing reserve currency from their head offices and using it to obtain local curre ncy from the currency board in effect the currency board country has had sudden loan from the reserve currency country which continuedvalue at cost of 152 billion with funds from previously accumulated budget surpluses18 currency boards cannot act as lender of last resort another criticism made of currency boa rds is that they cannot fill potentially vital role played by central banks that of lende roflastresort to the nations financial system history is full of examples of bank panics some event causes individuals to fear that banks will not be able to redeem their deposits in currency on demand when large number of depositors sudde nly demand conversion most banks are not in position to honor their requests because banks do not hold large sums of currency however banks us ually make good faith effort to do so and this means trying to raise cash by selling assets or calling in loans this has often involved dealing in markets that are financially distressed with falling prices that do not reflect the underlying value of the assets one wa to forestall panic or prevent it from reaching panic state is for the monetary authority to buy these assets from banks or make loans to them and in the process supply them with currency when the public becomes satisfied that it can get currency for its deposits the panic will subside and the destruction brought about by panic will be minimized all currency issued by currency board is backed by foreign assets but currency boards do not back all bank deposits only the fraction of bank deposits held as reserves are in effect backed by fore ign assets thus ll deposits could not be honored by the currency board in the ev ent of bank run currency boards cannot provide currency to banking institutions in such situations since increased issues of currency depend on the acquisition of the re serve asset or curre ncy which banks are unlikely to possess thus countries with currency boards must ve other financial arrangements for dealing with panics sometimes these are performed by the national treasury depa rtments but only central bank can expand overall liquidity through its control of the money supply treasury can only shift purchasing power from taxpayers or bondholders to the banking system greatly weakening the lender oflastresort function however some ar gue that the lenderofl astresort function has been largely abused in developing c ountries creating moral hazard through the bailout of wellconnected financ ial actors if that should be the case the loss of the lenderoflastresort function may do more good than harm19httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31093crs16 19 continued enables it to meet sudden demand for currency there is guarantee that this loan would occur however the foreign bank may prefer to curtail its lending instead it is also uncertain how demand could be met in the absence of foreign branch banks 20 another possibility is for the currency board to pay slight premium for foreign currency in order to build up its assets the subsequent profit from its portfolio could be used to pay off the cost of the premiumsetting up currency board to establish currency board governme nt must obtain assets on the basis of which currency can be issued the govern ment including any existing central bank may itself have gold stock or be in possession of substantial foreign exchange reserves if not the necessary foreign re serve currency would have to be acquired as gift or grant from the country whose curren cy is to serve as reserve or obtained from an international agency such as the imf relevant to the imf on october 6 1992 president george hw bush signed the foreign operations act pl 102391 which allows the 12 billion us quota incr ease to be used to support monetary stability in member countries through th instrumentality of currency boards20 once the board is established and the assets acquired two basic options are available in the first new currency coul d be introduced and given as gift to the existing population according to prearranged formula at the same time an exchange rate would be established for th reserve currency or reserve asset once the new money were introduced it would become the functioning money of the country it would be used in transactions held as part of liquid wealth and become the unit in terms of which contracts are written and prices quoted should an existing currency be in circulation at the time new currency board money is introduced it could continue to circulate and exchange for the new currency at whatever rate was dictated by the market if the existing currency has legal tender status it is important that similar status be accorded the notes of the currency board presumably as the new currency took hold it would drive the existing currency out of circulation as an alternative an existing currenc could be used which would now become the liability of the currency board all foreign exchange or precious metals held by the government and central bank would simu ltaneously be transfe rred to the currency board and become its assets and would th be valued in terms of the reserve currency under this option as in the other an exchange rate would have to be fixed relative to the reserve currency or asset such that the reserves of the currency board backed 100 of the existing currency in addition since the exchange rate would be the rate at which local prices are converted into world pr ices and vice versa it should not be too high so that exports are disc ouraged and imports encouraged nor too low so that exports are in effect subsidized and imports taxed thus the exchange rate should be one that reflects to the extent possible market conditions to maintain the independence of any cu rrency board and to safeguard the assets held by the board from government conf iscation proponents have argued for two legal safeguards first majority of board members appointed would be foreign nationals second the assets of the board would be deposited in foreign countryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31093crs17 such as switzerland or sweden with the proviso that the governments of the new currency board states would be denied access to the funds concluding comments while the introductory discussion of currency board suggested that it would be radical departure from the way that monetary policy is presently conducted in the united states it may not be such radi cal alternative for countries that are just acquiring control over their own moneta ry arrangements have experienced currency crisis or who have had history of chronic infl ation this may account for its adoption by argentina bulgaria lit huania estonia and explain why indonesia briefly considered adopting it during the asian crisis currency board proponents base their case on an argument that is essentially political countries with profligate pasts need to have their hands tied by currency board to prevent bad policymaking in the future in evaluating the relevance of currency boards for various countries it is useful to avoid comparing them to some ideal monetary system rather pr oponents argue currency boards should be compared to central banking regimes now in operation in these countries whose performance may in some instances serve as an impediment to the development of market economy at that stage of the countrys economic development the case for currency boards is based on their ability to supply currency that is both internally and externa lly convertible and is backed 100 by reserves of either precious metal or foreign curre ncies the case is strengthened when it is pointed out that they cannot alter the domestic mone supply through transactions in assets denominated in local currency as such proponents argue that currency boards are an attractive alternative to central banks for introducing stable valued money that could fulfill the role of unit of account medium of exchange and store of value success in these roles could shore up the development of market ec onomies encourage the development of financial institutions and encourage financial integration with the reserve currency country in addition currency boards would have restraining influence on fiscal policy in these countries essentially they would make it impossible to finance budget deficits through central banking printing press this accomplishment alone would contribute markedly to price level stability which could speed up the process of international investment needed for modernizing and unleashing the productive potential of many nations potential shortcomings of this regime however are several currency boards cannot serve as lendersoflas tresort and the economies of currency board countries are exposed to all the shocks that affect the external value of the currency which serves as the basis of their reserves in the face of these shocks the entire adjustment in currency board countries is placed on real wages and real interest rates if excessive unemployment and slower than normal gdp growth is be avoided in typical monetary arrangements economic adjustme nt could come about through exchangehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31093crs18 rate adjustment but with currency board exchange rate adjustment could only come about by abandoning the currency board which experience shows would likely trigger financial crisis for currency board to deliver stable economic growth the country must tie its currency to country that experiences similar economic shocks and conditions in order to enjoy monetary policy appropria for its economy otherwise as the argentine case illustrates currency board country is likely to experience periods of recession brought on by an incompatible ex change rate the problem here is that most countries currently considering cu rrency boards are developing countries or those emerging from decades of central planning with poor or incomplete fiscal and monetary policy track record since they hope to restore or gain confidence through the adoption of currency board they are seeking reserve country with high degree of monetary credibility most likely one of the worlds major currencies the dollar the euro the swiss franc the british pound or the yen but in most cases the shocks affecting the economie s of developing countries would have very little in common with the shocks affecting the economies of the five major currencies for that reason developing countries that adopt currency board risk experiencing the same problems that plagued argentin and ultimately caused it to abandon its currency board for central bank regime tr iggering economic nd financial collapse in the process
