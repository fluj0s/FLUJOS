trade policy and changing domestic and foreign priorities historical overview raymond j ahearn specialist in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21657 us trade policy involves actions that influence the flow and composition of goods services and investments resting at the intersection of domestic and foreign policy trade policy seeks to promote both domestic and foreign policy objectives economic as well as political viewed in historical perspective foreign policy priorities have dominated us trade policy decisions over long periods of time conversely domestic policy priorities have held sway in other eras in todays post 911 world foreign policy and national security priorities may be gaining increased prominence although many interest groups and members of congress can be expected to push the bush administration also to support policies that more directly benefit domestic economic and political interests this report will be updated as events warrant unique aspects of us trade policy us trade policy involves government measures that affect the direction and composition of imports exports and investments across borders these interventions can take the form of tariffs quotas and subsidies which serve as distortions to trade or they can take the form of negotiations that seek to free up trade and investment flows trade policies provide means for achieving important domestic and foreign policy objectives virtually every major foreign trade decision affects both domestic and foreign economic and political interests these interests may be described as follows domestic political interests involve responsiveness of democratic institutions and leaders to organized interest groups which may seek to achieve broad array of political social and economic outcomes through trade policy decisions domestic economic interests entail the effects of trade policy decisions on the overall domestic economy in terms of gnp growth inflation and employment as well as on the health and vitality of specific regions industries workers and communities that may have divergent if not competing interests congressional research service the library of congress crs2 foreign economic interests involve the support of rulesbased and non discriminatory open world trade system that over time promotes global prosperity and stability but in the shortrun may be costly to maintain and foreign political interests entail the pursuit of foreign policy and national security goals including alliances with friendly countries which can be solidified by trade policies due largely to changing internal and external factors there has been long history where the general thrust of us trade policy has vascillated from emphasizing either domestic or foreign policy goals division of us trade history into five broad eras 17651815 18151934 19341962 1962 2001 and post 911 illustrates this point while the boundary lines between these periods are somewhat arbitrary and exceptions to the general characterization of each period can be found examinations of them in trade context can prove illustrative1 trade policy in the first period 17651820 aimed predominantly at establishing nationhood and sovereignty which are major foreign policy objectives in the second httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21657 period 18151934 the main orientation of trade policy was on the sale of us products abroad and protection of us industry primary domestic objectives in the third period 19341962 trade policy emphasized creating nondiscriminatory and open world trading system as well as other foreign policy objectives in the fourth period 1962 2001 trade policy tilted increasingly towards achieving domestic economic objectives such as protecting us workers and firms from fair and unfair import competition and providing us exporters with equal opportunities to sell in foreign markets propelled by the concerns of the fight against terrorism new post 911 trade policy era may be developing where us priorities again tilt back towards foreign policy and national security concerns brief summary of these eras and trends follows 1765 1820 independence and nationhood trade policy played an important role in promoting both independence and full recognition of the united states as sovereign nation the initial use of trade as an instrument to achieve foreign policy objectives began when the colonists boycotted british goods to protest the britishimposed taxes imposed by the stamp act of 1765 and townsend acts of 1767 massachusetts acted first to boycott most british goods and other colonies soon followed by cutting british exports to the colonies in half the boycott helped persuade the british government to rescind the taxes in the first half of the 1770s the colonists again used boycotts of british goods as response to import duties imposed on tea king george iii refused to budge on the tax despite pleas from merchants fighting ensued in 1775 and the colonies eventually won their independence in part over an issue of trade policy and who should determine it2 1 richard n cooper trade policy as foreign policy in stern robert m us trade policies in changing world economy mit press 1989 p 292 2 richard n cooper trade policy as foreign policy pp 293294 crs3 trade policy continued to be used or proposed as means to achieve foreign policy objectives during the next several decades after independence boycotts partial or total of british goods were used or advocated to support postrevolutionary france in its struggle with england in 1789 and again in 1810 against britain and france to induce them to lift their blockades against neutral ships 18151934 promoting exports and restricting imports over the next hundred years us trade policy was driven almost exclusively by domestic economic and political interests these included using higher tariffs to protect infant us industries from european competitors and expanding us exports in pursuit of the latter objective main orientation of us foreign policy was to open up foreign markets for us exports us actions to open up japan in the 1850s and support for the open door policy in china in the later part of the 19th century can be viewed in large part as efforts to expand markets for us exports the trend towards higher average tariff levels during this period can be explained by two factors the first was fiscal consideration that tariff collections accounted for httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21657 significant proportion as high as 40 percent of total federal revenues the income tax was not enacted until 1918 the second was due to the responsiveness of lawmakers to demands from industrialists for protection from import competition absent theory about the damage protection could yield as well as absence of concern about the impact of us trade barriers on us foreign interests protection from foreign competition during this period was considered right to which all interests were entitled not an exception to established policy3 the nineteenth century pattern of treating tariffs as domestic policy issue however was shaken in 1930 as result of the passage of the smoothawley tariff act setting the average us tariff at an alltime high of over 55 percent the act contributed to the world depression and precipitated retaliation from us trade partners by 1932 us exports and imports had plunged by nearly 70 percent the results ultimately contributed to major shift away from preoccupation with domestic economic and political considerations in the making of us trade policy4 19341962 dominance of foreign economic objectives in response to the deleterious consequences of the smoothawley tariff and heavy lobbying by secretary of state cordell hull congress in 1934 passed the reciprocal trade agreements act rtaa under this three page law congress delegated to the executive branch authority to enact reductions of up to 50 percent in us tariffs provided that foreign countries reciprocated in turn the rtaa not only created new congressionalexecutive branch relationship for making trade policy it also established new philosophical framework this approach rested on the notion that 1 us 3 cohen stephen d joel paul and robert

crs4 prosperity depended on access to foreign markets not on tariff protection and 2 that increased trade and interdependence were building blocks for world peace because increased trade in the long run would enhance living standards and help reduce the economic dissatisfaction that can breed war5 the end of world war ii which reduced much of europe and asia to political disarray and economic devastation provided test for the new trade policy questions of war and peace and the need for us allies to become economically prosperous assumed great urgency particularly with the advent of the cold war toward this end domestic policy concerns associated with us trade policy decisions came to be increasingly subordinated to foreign policy concerns in addition to economic aid us trade policy was used to bolster the economies of europe and much of asia and integrate them into rulesbased and nondiscriminatory international economic system organized under the newly created general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt during the first decade of the gatt trading system 1948 1958 us policymakers actively encouraged imports and did little to promote us exports and export controls were employed to restrict commerce with communist bloc httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21657 countries especially to limit their access to technologies with military applications given that the united states emerged after world war ii with predominant economic position many observers argued that washington could afford to be altruistic on global scale however as the economies of europe and japan recovered in the 1950s and 1960s us firms and workers began to experience much more competition at home and abroad accordingly the us private sector began complaining about us trade orientation that sacrificed domestic interests for foreign policy advantage6 19622002 tilt back towards domestic priorities the end of the trade policy era dominated by foreign policy objectives was signaled by several events retrospectively one could see the seeds of change in the 1962 trade expansion act in this legislation which authorized us participation in what became known as the kennedy round of trade negotiations congress took an initial step in making us trade policy more attentive to domestic interests propelled by growing dissatisfaction in the private sector about the dominance of foreign policy considerations in trade policy congress relieved the department of state of its lead negotiating responsibility on trade issues and created the position of the special trade representative str the precursor of the office of the united states trade representative more definitive shift occurred in august 1971 in that month with an overvalued dollar contributing to rapid decline in us trade surpluses president nixon took the world by surprise by acting to reduce the value of the dollar he did this by suspending the us obligation to support the value of its currency by selling gold reserves on demand and by imposing temporary 10 percent surcharge on all imports the effect was to 5 raymond j ahearn political determinants of us trade policy orbis summer 1982 pp 413429 6 stephen d cohen et fundamentals of us foreign trade policy p35 crs5 end us postwar policy of altruism that in part accepted that us products would be sold at disadvantage because of unfair exchange rates in the 1970s and 1980s with the us economy becoming increasingly exposed to trade and foreign competition particularly from japan and the new asian tigers the us trade policymaking pendulum began swinging even more towards domestic priorities and interests in the 1974 trade act congress began to use trade policy to cushion the decline of weak industries by encouraging favorable findings in import relief cases in the early 1980s legislative emphasis switched to opening foreign markets for us exporters as an alternative to closing us markets to imports this movement for greater reciprocity in us trade relations was marked by the creation of various statutory processes that forced the executive branch to systematically address and redress the extent to which foreign unfair trading practices were burdening us commerce in addition congress began to keep the executive branch on shorter leash provision of tightly defined goals and consultations in order to insure that trade negotiations were not used as an instrument of foreign policy7 this is not to say that the united states did not use trade for foreign policy purposes httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21657 during this period the us denial of mostfavorednationtreatment to communist countries often combined with export controls or embargoes and preferential agreements such as the generalized system of preferences the caribbean basin initiative and the usisraeli free trade agreement are all examples of the use of trade policy to achieve foreign policy objectives but they were pursued against backdrop of growing emphasis particularly in congress on domestic considerations with the fall of the berlin wall major constraint on elevating domestic economic objectives was lifted while the cold war tended to provide the united states europe and japan an overriding rationale to compromise on economic issues in order to maintain grand antisoviet alliance the disappearance of common enemy opened opportunities for all countries to more aggressively promote domestic economic objectives8 post 911 tilt towards national security priorities the events of september 11 2001 may have set the stage for trade to be utilized more extensively as an instrument of us foreign and national security policy in speech delivered 10 days before the opening of the wto trade ministerial in doha qatar to launch new global trade negotiations us trade representative robert zoellick explained how successful meeting was necessary in the fight against terrorism9 the events of september 11 have set the stage for our work just as our cold war strategy recognized the interconnection of security and economics so must americas strategy against terrorism by promoting the wtos agenda these 142 nations can counter the revulsive destructionism of terrorism 7 stephen d cohen et pp 3639 8 destler im american trade politics institute for international economics 1995 p 62 9 robert b zoellick the wto and new global trade negotiations whats at stake speech delivered at the council on foreign relations washington dc october 30 2001 crs6 the administrations effort to link the need for successful doha round with the fight against terrorism was widely credited with facilitating the launch of global negotiations national security and associated concerns helped to provide an overriding need for agreement and consensus to be reached subsequently the bush administration has staked out larger role for foreign policy considerations in the choice of potential free trade agreement partners in may 8 2003 speech ustr zoellick stated that countries seeking free trade agreements with the united states must at minimum cooperate with the united states on its foreign policy and national security goals10 accordingly some of the countries that backed the usled invasion of iraq or supported the war on terrorism such as australia bahrain dominican republic several central american countries morocco and thailand have been rewarded with designation as free trade negotiating partner others that have not shown similar support for us foreign policy goals such as new zealand and many caribbean countries have been ignored11 this explicit foreign policy test has raised concerns in both congress and the business community that future free trade agreements could come at the expense of us httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21657 economic interests specifically some have questioned whether the administrations decision to negotiate agreements with morocco and bahrain countries that have small markets but are on the front line in the war against terrorism could come at the expense of countries such as taiwan and egypt that are more commercially significant markets12 there are also concerns about subordinating us economic interests to broad foreign policy concerns regarding relations with japan and china with security objectives of coaxing china to keep north korea from going nuclear and getting japan to commit troops and money to iraq some argue that the administration has elected not to pressure these countries to accept rise in the value of their currencies against the dollar change that could help reduce the us trade deficit with these countries13 while security considerations appear to be playing larger role in us trade policy decision making since 911 there are also numerous counterexamples such as the imposition of steel tariffs and passage of the farm bill in 2002 where domestic economic and political concerns appeared paramount whether the war against terrorism leads to new and consistent pattern of trade policy decisions remains uncertain congress with constitutional responsibility to regulate foreign commerce is bound to play major role in determining how the balance between domestic and foreign priorities is struck 10 inside us tradezoellick says fta candidates must support us foreign policy may 16 2003 11 financial times strains show in uscaribbean relations october 23 2003 p2 12
