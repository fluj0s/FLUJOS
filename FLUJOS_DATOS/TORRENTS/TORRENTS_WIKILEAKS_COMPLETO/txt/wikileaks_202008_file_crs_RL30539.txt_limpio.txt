preparation and procedure updated june 13 2006 thomas p carr analyst in american national government government and finance division congressional research service the library of congress hearings in the house of representatives guide for preparation and procedure summary congressional hearings are the principal formal method by which committees collect and analyze information in the early stages of policy making whether legislative oversight investigative or combination of these all hearings share common elements of preparation and conduct house rule xi sets down many of the regulations to which committee hearings must conform including the quorum requirement advance submission of witness statements the opportunity for minority party members to call witnesses of their choosing the fiveminute rule for questioning witnesses witness rights the process for issuing subpoena the procedure for closing hearing to the public and the broadcast of hearings and media behavior committees have broad latitude in how they hold hearings in part because they adopt their own rules of procedure these rules may amplify and supplement house rules but cannot contravene them customs of committees not embodied in rules also vary considerably among committees committees usually plan extensively for hearings early planning activities commonly include collecting background information from sources within and outside the house preparing preliminary hearing memorandum for the chair and members discussing the scope of the hearings and the expected outcome and scheduling and giving public notice of hearings carefully selecting witnesses determining the order and format of their testimony and preparing questions or talking points for committee members to use in questioning are all important considerations other arrangements include preparing briefing books determining if and how the hearings will be broadcast and attending to the many administrative matters such as scheduling an official reporter on the day of hearing committee needs quorum to conduct business while most hearings are open to the public committee may vote to close hearing for reason specifically stated in house rules representatives typically make opening statements at the beginning of hearing then witnesses are introduced and may be sworn by the chair witnesses present oral testimony in accordance with the arranged format this verbal testimony generally is summary of the written testimony submitted in advance the question and answer period that follows is an opportunity for committee to build public record on matter and gather needed information to support future actions house rules give each committee member five minutes to question each witness but individual committees determine the order in which their members will question witnesses and may allow extended questioning by committee members or staff following hearing committee staff may prepare summary of testimony draft additional questions for the days witnesses and begin to ready the hearing transcripts for printing and publishing to the web transcripts generally are printed along with supplemental materials

introduction coverage and organization of the report under house rules each committee has authority to hold hearings whether the house is in session has recessed or has adjourned house rule xi clause 2m1a committees may hold hearings in washington or hold field hearings elsewhere within the united states whether legislative oversight investigative or combination of these all hearings share common elements of preparation and conduct this report emphasizes these shared elements the report describes provisions of house rules that pertain to hearings citations to these rules are included for reference while house rules generally apply to committees and subcommittees it is house rule xi that contains many provisions specific to hearings house rules set the general framework in which committees hold hearings each committee is required to adopt and publish written rules of procedure which must be consistent with house rules but which may expand upon them house rule xi clause 2a1 committees rules generally apply to its subcommittees although some contain specific procedures for subcommittees house rule xi clause 1a1a the rules of many committees contain provisions pertaining to hearings this report gives examples from 109th congress committee rules2 these examples are illustrative intending to show the variation in particular areas in some cases multiple committees have the same or similar provisions but only one committee provides an example thus this report does not attempt to list comprehensively all provisions of committee rules that apply to hearings further the summaries of both house and committee rules are not intended to capture every nuance and detail of the rules themselves members and staff are advised to consult the text of the appropriate house or committee rule 1 this report was originally written by the late richard c sachs formerly specialist in american national government at crs the listed author updated the report and is available to answer questions concerning its contents 2 for compilation of house committee rules see us congress house committee on rules rules adopted by the committees of the house of representatives committee print 109th cong 1st sess washington gpo 2005 crs2 in addition to house and committee rules this report covers common committee practices in planning and holding hearings given that each committee has its own rules and practices hearing procedures may differ significantly among committees members and staff needing comprehensive information on the hearing practices of particular committee are advised to consult the committee this report is organized into four main sections the introduction addresses not only coverage and organization but also the role of hearings in the committee process and the various types of hearings committees plan extensively for hearings section 2 preparation for hearings discusses how committees carry out these activities among other issues this section covers deciding whether to hold hearing sources that assist committees with hearings procuring supplemental staff by contract or detail holding joint hearings scheduling and giving public notice of hearings selecting witnesses and determining the order and format of testimony securing advance written testimony from witnesses written statements of nongovernmental witnesses procedures for issuing subpoenas and taking depositions preparing briefing books for committee members procedures for broadcasting hearings and techniques for attracting and managing the media and administrative arrangements section 3 conducting hearings covers how hearing is held among other matters it discusses quorum requirements closing hearing to the public the rights of witnesses opening statements by members introducing and swearing in witnesses oral testimony by witnesses and the question and answer period following oral testimony finally section 4 posthearing activities describes activities committees often undertake following hearing for instance committee staff may prepare summary of testimony or draft additional questions for witnesses or print the hearings transcript along with supplemental materials hearings in the committee process hearings are the primary informationgathering technique committees use in policy making and oversight hearings may be held on issues in the absence of specific legislation but many examine on particular legislative proposals in either case hearings serve variety of purposes hearings inform members staff and the crs3 public about measures and issues and help assess the intensity of support for proposals hearings serve to monitor government programs and activities and expose problems that congress can later correct hearings give citizens an opportunity to participate in the policy process and help build the public record for measure or issue for number of reasons house committees act only on minority of the measures introduced and referred to them for instance committee often receives many proposals in each major policy area within its jurisdiction but ultimately may choose to act on only few measures in each such area if any committees usually send bill to an appropriate subcommittee for initial consideration although committees do not uniformly require such referral committee may decide to send bill to subcommittee for initial scrutiny because of the technical nature of the issue the history of prior handling of the matter or political factors among other reasons when committee or subcommittee considers measure it generally takes four actions when subcommittee initiates some of the four actions the extent to which the full committee repeats some of these steps varies among committees and from issue to issue the sequence of actions assumes the committee favors measure but at any time the committee may discontinue action first committee may seek agency comment by sending copy of the measure to the executive departments or agencies having relevant policy expertise and soliciting their written evaluation of the proposal the executive agency typically sends copy of the measure to the office of management and budget omb for determination as to consistency with the presidents program second committee may decide to hold one or more hearings further committee action without hearings is the exception although hearings have been bypassed to move measures expeditiously through committee or because of action on related bill in the previous congress the importance of this action has been noted by congressional scholar walter j oleszek the decision to hold hearing is often critical point in the life of bill measures brought to the floor without first undergoing the scrutiny of hearings will likely receive sharp criticism the importance of the committee stage is based on the assumption that the experts the committee members carefully scrutinize proposal and hearings provide demonstrable record of that scrutiny3 third committee will meet to mark up or recommend amendments to the legislation based in part on information received at hearings markup is the critical stage where the committee decides how the language of the bill should appear when it is presented to the house for consideration while bill can be subsequently amended on the house floor committees have the important prerogative of shaping legislation before consideration by the full chamber 3 walter j oleszek congressional procedures and the policy process 6th ed washington cq press 2004 p 93 crs4 fourth the full committee will report the legislation to the floor subcommittees must report to their parent committees when committee reports measure it is also required to issue written report that typically describes and explains the measures purposes and provisions and tells members why the measure should be passed the report also may summarize any relevant hearings that were held this reporting requirement may be waived4 types of hearings all hearings share common elements of preparation and conduct some of these are governed by house rules particularly house rule xi at the same time hearings differ for number of reasons first each committee must adopt its own rules of procedure for each congress house rule xi clause 2a12 these must be consistent with house rules but may also expand or elaborate on them committee rules often contain provisions regulating hearings second customs not necessarily reflected in committee rules vary among committees for example some committees do not routinely enforce the fiveminute rule when examining witnesses rule that generally allows member to question each witness for five minutes until every member of the committee has had this opportunity house rule xi clause 2j2 third hearings are held for different purposes depending on the purpose hearings can be grouped into three broad classes legislative oversight or investigative5 sometimes one hearing has dual purposes such as both legislative and oversight while in general there are separate house rules governing each type of hearing some rules are invoked more frequently at particular types of hearings for instance rule xi clauses 2k3 and 5 contain provisions particularly applicable to investigative hearings such as protections for the rights of witnesses also committees power to subpoena house rule xi clause 2m1b usually is used to obtain documents for investigative hearings or to require the testimony of witnesses at these sessions committees hold legislative hearings on measures or policy issues that may become legislation sometimes committee holds hearings on multiple measures before ultimately choosing one vehicle for further committee and chamber action most often the goal of legislative hearing is the consideration of measure for enactment into law these hearings provide forum where facts and opinions on legislation can be presented by witnesses with diverse backgrounds including members of congress and other government officials representatives of interest groups and academia and from additional citizens affected by the proposal 4 for more information on committee reports see crs report 98169 house committee reports required contents by judy schneider 5 senate committees also hold hearings on approving treaties and on confirming presidential nominees in fulfillment of the senates advice and consent responsibility under the constitution because the house does not have this constitutional duty its committees do not hold confirmation hearings crs5 oversight hearings review or study law an issue or an activity often focusing on the quality of federal programs and the performance of government officials hearings also help ensure that the execution of laws by the executive branch complies with legislative intent and that administrative policies reflect the public interest oversight hearings often seek to improve the efficiency economy and effectiveness of government operations on march 16 2005 for instance the house subcommittee on space and aeronautics of the committee on science held an oversight hearing on the future of aeronautics at nasa many committees also oversee existing programs in the context of hearings on related legislation or routinely perform oversight when it is time to reauthorize program or agency investigative hearings share some of the characteristics of legislative and oversight hearings the difference lies in congresss stated determination to investigate usually when there is suspicion of wrongdoing on the part of public officials in governmental operations or of private citizens in business or other activities congress has exercised its investigative function since the earliest days of the republic and its most famous inquiries are benchmarks in american history credit mobilier teapot dome armymccarthy watergate and irancontra in some cases select committees have been created to conduct investigations6 at other times the standing committees have investigated matters within their jurisdictions investigative hearings may lead to legislation to address any problems uncovered judicial proceedings may precede or follow congressional inquiries committee hearings are mostly held in washington but sometimes committee will decide there is need to hold hearing elsewhere field hearings may be held for variety of reasons field hearing brings congress to the people committee can hear from witnesses who might find it inconvenient or be unable to travel to washington to testify field hearing also can present information to citizens who are directly affected by government program or issue it can enhance committees oversight activities by providing the opportunity to evaluate programs on site it can orchestrate public support for and enhance the visibility of an issue field hearing can reinforce committee chairman or other committee members relationship with his or her constituents it can provide an opportunity for local regional and sometimes national media coverage field hearings are often held in geographic area where the subject matter of the hearing is particularly relevant for example on august 13 2005 the subcommittee on energy and mineral resources of the house committee on resources held field hearing in port fourchon louisiana on the benefits of offshore oil and gas development regulations in the house forbid official travel for political or campaign purposes field hearings cannot be employed for explicitly political or electoral purposes the formal authority for field hearings is implicit in house rule xi clause 2 which states in part that committee is authorized to sit at such times and places within the united states whether the house is in session has recessed or has 6 for more information on select committees see crs report rs21243 ad hoc select committees use in the house of representatives by judy schneider crs6 adjourned and to hold such hearings as it considers necessary house rules do not otherwise distinguish field hearings from those held in washington preparation for hearings preliminary issues committee considers variety of issues in deciding whether to hold hearing committee must define the information it needs evaluate the policy matters or the political message it wishes to communicate and then determine whether hearing is the best method of achieving its goals hearing agenda is influenced by several factors including timing of the hearing the salience of issues to the nation the importance of policies to interest groups and matters of significance to the president house leaders and other representatives programs under committees jurisdiction that need to be reauthorized generally receive committee scrutiny as do instances of reported waste fraud or abuse each committee receives dozens or even hundreds of proposals for possible examination and studies matters not embodied in specific legislation in the context of this overall workload committee must decide whether holding particular hearing is the best use of staff and funds committee also considers whether and how hearing would fit into its overall schedule it may be particularly difficult for committees with broad jurisdictions to justify the allocation of limited resources to hearing or even to find time in its crowded schedule in order to obtain approval for hearing committee staff often prepare preliminary hearing memorandum for the chair that includes information such as the scope and purpose of the hearing the expected outcome possible witnesses how many hearing days are planned and perhaps the views of the minority party informal discussion with committee members and staff may suffice sources of outside assistance numerous governmental and nongovernmental resources are available to committees to assist with hearings given that most hearings focus on government programs or potential programs executive agencies often are major providers of information committees may request information directly from specific offices or may place requests through an agencys congressional liaison an office established to respond to congressional requests for information each of the three congressional support agencies can assist with hearings the congressional research service crs can assist in framing the agenda for hearings preparing background and policy studies preparing bibliographies and conducting database searches providing information on positions of interest groups and other key players crs7 suggesting witnesses and drafting questions for members to ask them making its experts available on nonpartisan basis as witnesses analyzing testimony preparing studies or documentation for inclusion in the hearing record supplying information on program accomplishments and evaluating legislative proposals and discussing alternative approaches the government accountability office gao provides assistance to committees principally by reviewing executive branch programs through independent audits investigations and evaluations its reviews measure the effectiveness of government programs gaos reports contribute to the background study and examination necessary for hearings for instance reports on investigations of waste fraud and abuse in federal entities may be used at oversight and investigative hearings probing government programs or at hearings to craft legislation to correct problems exposed in addition to its routine periodic reviews gao may be asked for studies specific to committee hearing also gao experts frequently appear as witnesses the congressional budget office cbo furnishes congress with key information relating to the us economy the federal budget and federal programs it assists committees by preparing cost estimates of legislation its assistance to congress in carrying out the congressional budget act provides framework and useful background and analysis for committee hearings its responsibilities include estimating the fiveyear budgetary costs of legislation tracking congressional budget actions against targets established in budget resolutions scorekeeping estimating costs to state local and tribal governments of carrying out mandates to be imposed by legislation making periodic forecasts of economic trends and baseline projections of spending and revenue levels against which proposed changes in taxing and spending policies can be measured conducting studies of programmatic or policy issues that affect the federal budget and preparing an annual report on spending and revenue options for reducing the federal deficit nongovernmental organizations provide wealth of resources for committees knowledgeable individuals in universities policy research institutes law and consulting firms and trade and other nonprofit associations often are willing to assist committees with data analysis and testimony interest groups with public policy concerns become involved at the hearing stage in an attempt to frame the issues early in the legislative process studies indicate that lobbyists believe testifying at congressional hearings is an important and effective technique for influencing legislation in addition to consulting policy experts and special interest groups committees seek information and assistance from ordinary citizens who have crs8 direct experience with proposed policy or whose lives will bear the impact of congresss eventual decision supplemental staffing committees may find it useful on occasion to supplement their staff to assist with hearings committees may hire consultants or employ staff detailed from any government agency or department with the permission of the committee on house administration committees may also accept temporary services of fellows regulations governing consultants detailees and fellows are contained in the committees congressional handbook7 the services of individual consultants must be intermittent or temporary not to exceed 12 months or the end of congress whichever occurs first contract first must be approved by majority of the committee that seeks consultant services information including the proposed contract the need for the contract the amount to be paid and the consultants resume are then submitted for approval to the committee on house administration contracts for services which are the regular and normal duties of committee staff will not be approved by the committee on house administration the chair of committee seeking to have an employee detailed from department or agency should submit written request to the head of the appropriate agency or department any detail cannot exceed one year or the end of congress whichever comes first if the agency agrees to loan an employee the committee chair submits an authorization request with copy of the detailing agreement to the committee on house administration written approval of the committee on house administration is needed before an employee may be detailed in the 109th congress committee generally may use detailees from government agencies on reimbursable or nonreimbursable basis the total number of non reimbursable detailees at one time must remain at or below 10 of the committees staff ceiling as established by the speaker committees must reimburse agencies for detailees above this limit although committee must reimburse the government printing office for all detailees the house office of the legislative counsel assists in drafting legislation works closely with committees and sometimes assigns staff to work directly with committee staff also may be available from the many fellowship internship and volunteer programs that place individuals with committee or member offices these programs can provide staff ranging in expertise from high school and college students with little or experience to trained professionals and subject specialists 7 us congress committee on house administration committees congressional handbook available online at httpchahousegovservicescommitteehandbookhtm crs9 joint hearings each panel has the discretion to hold hearings jointly with another committee or subcommittee panels meeting jointly must agree on common rules of procedure and determine logistical questions such as meeting rooms sometimes two house panels meet jointly for example on july 19 2005 the committee on financial services and the committee on resources held joint hearing on improving land title grant procedures for native americans8 sometimes house and senate panels hold joint hearing for instance on july 24 2003 subcommittees of the house committee on science and the senate committee on commerce science and transportation held joint hearing on commercial human space flight some observers view joint committee sessions as an efficient use of time and resources joint hearings bring together the expertise and differing perspectives of panels they may reduce the difficulties and delays that arise from contradictory actions and proposals joint committee sessions however tend to be infrequent some members believe that separate perspectives and approaches provide significant benefits to congress separate hearings increase avenues of access for witnesses and opportunities for influence and exposure of committee members and leaders further coordinating meeting times between two panels may present greater scheduling difficulties scheduling house committees may hold hearings at any time except during joint session or meeting of the house and senate house rule xi clause 2i9 any member may try to persuade committee to hold hearings but the chair generally controls the schedule paramount in scheduling for many committees is choosing date and time convenient for committee leaders the computerized scheduling service of the house information resources office hir allows committee to coordinate its schedule with that of other committees to minimize scheduling conflicts for its members in order to maximize member participation the rules of the house republican conference provide that committee rules should seek to avoid overlapping scheduling of subcommittee sessions the rules of many committees thus contain provisions requiring coordination in scheduling hearings among committee and its subcommittees 8 joint hearings in the house are also commonly conducted by two different subcommittees of the same standing committee 9 joint session of congress occurs upon the adoption by both chambers of concurrent resolution the house and senate meet in joint session primarily to hear remarks by the president the presidents annual state of the union address is an example joint meeting is held when both chambers declare themselves in recess by resolution or unanimous consent congress holds joint meetings to receive addresses from foreign dignitaries and to commemorate events crs10 examples of several committee rules regarding scheduling follow subcommittee chairs of the house committee on the judiciary set dates for hearings after consultation with each other and with the full committee chair each subcommittee chair of the house committee on government reform may set hearing dates only with the approval of the chairman of the full committee in order to assure availability of meeting rooms and to avoid scheduling conflicts on the house committee on rules the chair of each subcommittee schedules hearings only after consultation with the full committee chair and subcommittee can meet at the same time as the full committee notice under house rules the chair of committee except rules must give at least one weeks public notice of the date place and subject of hearing house rule xi clause 2g3 hearings may be held with less than one weeks notice if either the chair with the concurrence of the ranking minority member or the committee by majority vote determines need when this happens the notice should be given as soon as possible notices of hearings appear in the daily digest section of the congressional record and in the houses computerized committee scheduling service of hir often committee sends announcements of hearing to all its members both well in advance of and immediately before the hearing some committees also require that particular information be sent to their members or made available to the public for instance the rules of the house committee on financial services direct the chairman to provide members of the committee concise summary of the subject of the hearing at least three days in advance the house committee on resources provides its members with tentative witness list and memorandum explaining the subject of the hearing as soon as practicable after the announcement of the hearing additionally the chair makes available to committee members any official reports from departments and agencies on the subject matter of the hearing the house committee on education and the workforce generally requires its chair to make public the final list of witnesses 48 hours before hearing convenes choosing and inviting witnesses choosing witnesses is often one of the most important issues in planning hearing committees pay careful attention to which viewpoints will be represented who should testify and the order and format for presenting witnesses in some cases committee will strive to make sure that all reasonable points of view are represented while in other cases witnesses expressing only particular points of view will be invited house rules allow the minority party members of committee to call witnesses of their choice on at least one day of hearing if majority of these members makes this request to the committee chair before completion of the hearing house rule xi clause 2j1 in lieu of this formal option the minority sometimes works informally with the majority to invite witnesses representing its views crs11 in order to testify witness must be invited by the committee before officially inviting witness committee staff identify and often interview prospective candidates when suitable witnesses are found the committee chair typically sends formal letter of invitation this letter generally gives the witness some basic information including the purpose subject date time and place of the hearing in addition to specifying the portion of measure or issue the witness should address the letter may contain limitation on the length of the witnesss oral testimony the committee may send the witness additional information this information may include list of committee members the committees rules the measure under consideration and material from the media relating to the issue often staff contact is indicated staff will sometimes meet with witnesses before hearing to answer questions and to review procedure committee may reimburse witness for expenses related to testimony and if reimbursement is expected the letter of invitation may address this point under guidelines of the committee on house administration reimbursement of travel expenses incurred by witness is described as an extraordinary measure the committee chair must specifically authorize the payment house rules set the rate of pay to be the same per diem amount as authorized by the committee for members and employees of the house and actual expenses for travel however per diem is paid to witnesses who are summoned at the place of the examination house rule xi clause 5 advance written testimony letter of invitation also may request that the witness send the committee biographical information and an advance copy of written testimony house rules require each witness insofar as is practicable to file with the committee an advance copy of written testimony and then to limit oral remarks to brief summary of his or her statement house rule xi clause 2g4 the individual rules of committees often state how far in advance of the hearing testimony should be filed usually between 24 and 72 hours the rules sometimes also require submission of multiple copies and specify to whom the testimony should be delivered for example the committee on financial services requires sufficient copies of written testimony two business days in advance including copy in electronic format the committee on rules asks for testimony 24 hours in advance the committees on house administration small business ways and means and education and the workforce ordinarily require testimony 48 hours before hearing the committee on small business calls for 100 copies of testimony with one copy to furnished directly to the ranking minority member of the committee the committee on education and the workforce also calls for brief summary of written testimony permanent select committee on intelligence witnesses generally must file statements 48 hours in advance in written and electronic form committee has authority to decide when it is impracticable to require advance written testimony for instance when witness is invited with too little notice the house committee on appropriations does not apply the requirement for advance written testimony and subsequent oral summary of the testimony for witnesses at crs12 hearings on the overall federal budget in most cases however committees assert their right to receive advance copies of testimony for several reasons before the hearing committees may want to summarize or outline the testimony draft questions tailored to each witnesss statement and photocopy the statement for distribution to the press and others committee rules sometimes stipulate that testimony be submitted in both written and electronic form electronic submission can facilitate printing the testimony as part of the hearing record and making testimony available to the public online the committee on armed services for instance asks that prepared statement be submitted in electronic form at the time the written statement is submitted similarly for matters of original jurisdiction the committee on rules requests each witness to file statement of proposed testimony in written and electronic form to the maximum extent practicable statements of nongovernmental witnesses the advance written statements of nongovernmental witnesses must contain particular information in addition to resume the statement must contain the amount and source of any federal grant or contract received by the witness or the organization being represented during the current or previous two fiscal years house rule xi clause 2g4 the truth in testimony rule as it is commonly called was adopted at the beginning of the 105th congress it is intended to provide committee members and the public with information on witnesss education experience and receipt of grants and contracts so as to assist members in evaluating the witnesss views and remarks the rules of the committee on science state explicitly that witnesses should provide information on grants or contracts which are relevant to the subject of the testimony committee rules rarely compel additional specific information to be included in witness testimony notable exception is the committee on ways and means which requires hearing witness who submits statement for the record or written response to published request for comments to include list of all clients persons or organizations on whose behalf the witness appears format and order of witness testimony committees determine the format and order of presenting witnesses according to one traditional format witness summarizes his or her written statement and then takes questions from committee members before second witness testifies committees have used different formats recently and it has become common to present witnesses with diverging viewpoints as panel the usual practice in this case is for all witnesses on the panel to make statements then for committee members to pose questions to the panel some observers believe that this format produces more stimulating debate and more effectively elicits pertinent information committees have experimented with several other formats for gathering information which may not always be considered formal hearings for instance committees have held seminars consisting of briefings by experts with informal crs13 opportunities for asking questions and roundtable discussions where committee members and staff have freeflowing dialogue with knowledgeable outsiders the order in which witnesses testify is arranged at the discretion of the committee protocol dictates that member of congress or highranking executive branch official will generally testify before other witnesses celebrity witnesses are carefully placed in the lineup because they often generate significant media and public attention they often are scheduled to appear at times of high attendance by committee members and viewing by the public such as at the beginning of the hearing academics representatives from interest groups and other private citizens are arranged in way that most favorably presents information and communicates the intent of the committee for example committee may arrange its witnesses to allow one individual to refute arguments made by another witness subpoenas and depositions most individuals respond favorably to an invitation to testify believing it to be valuable opportunity to communicate and publicize their views on question of public policy if however if person will not come by invitation committee may require witness to appear through subpoena house rule xi clause 2m1b committees also may subpoena any relevant books records correspondence memoranda papers and other documents subpoenas are used infrequently and most often at investigative hearings under house rules committee may authorize and issue subpoena with majority quorum present however committee may delegate this authority to its chair under any limitations it establishes many committees currently require majority approval to issue subpoena but have adopted additional procedures for instance the house committee on agriculture requires that notice of meeting to issue subpoena be sent to all members by 5 pm on the day preceding the meeting several committees including energy and commerce allow the chair to issue subpoena during any adjournment of the house for more than three days the house committee on energy and commerce chair must notify the committee of this action as soon as possible in case later than one week after service of the subpoena if request for subpoena has not been previously rejected by the committee on transportation and infrastructure or one of its subcommittees the full committee chair may issue the subpoena after consultation with the ranking minority member the chair must then notify all committee members of the action other committees have delegated general subpoena authority to the chair the rules of the committee on small business allow the chair to issue full committee subpoena although the ranking minority member must be promptly notified further the chairs of small business subcommittees are authorized to issue subpoenas for their panels but require the approval of majority of the subcommittee and the full committee chair committee issuing subpoena can obtain the appropriate form from the clerk of the house subpoenas usually are delivered by authorized committee staff or by the us marshals office compliance with subpoena can be enforced only at the direction of the house under one method of enforcement committee could report crs14 resolution citing for contempt of congress an individual who did not respond to subpoena if approved by the house the resolution would be sent to the office of the us attorney for prosecution committee staff commonly consult with experts to gather information in preparation for hearing more formal means of obtaining information for investigative hearings in particular is through the use of depositions under this method committee staff may take testimony in private in some cases from individuals who also appear as witnesses the testimony is sometimes taken under oath and transcript may be prepared individuals often are accompanied by counsel and respond to prepared questions given that house rules do not expressly authorize committees to take depositions on occasion the house has granted specific authority for such action by resolution in such cases the committee usually has adopted procedures expanding on its authority to take depositions as an example the house in 1997 approved resolution authorizing staff of the committee on government reform to take depositions in the study of alleged political fundraising improprieties and possible violations of law hres 167 105th congress agreed to june 20 1997 briefing books committees often ask staff to prepare summary and background material for use by their members before and during hearing this information is sometimes assembled into briefing books or folders to present issues in systematic uniform way briefing books might include variety of items including description of the subject scope and purpose of the hearing for legislative hearings copy and explanation of each measure under consideration and comparison of all measures to be discussed are useful background material might include relevant statutes and regulations court decisions press articles agency reports academic studies and chronology of major events in order to assist members with witnesses the books might contain list of witnesses in their order of appearance copy or summary of written testimony and biographical information briefing material might also include questions or talking points for committee members to use in opening statements and in examining witnesses before hearing committee staff sometimes brief members and other staff staff may conduct oral briefings in addition to or in lieu of preparing briefing books these sessions provide an opportunity to discuss matters of particular interest to individual committee members publicity and media considerations committees goal in holding hearing often is not narrowly limited to collecting information for policy development the goal may include publicizing an issue or problem to focus attention on it public exposure of problem at an oversight or investigative hearing can be particularly effective technique public officials often seem responsive to correcting program deficiencies when an issue has been broadly publicized hearings also are used to build support for proposal crs15 among the public generally or certain sectors thereof members and witnesses make arguments that form part of the public record in support of future committee action such as reporting measure house rules influence how committee plans for media coverage and other publicity matters for example house rules require that hearings be open to the public as well as to radio television and still photography coverage unless committee votes to close hearing house rule xi clause 2g2a hearings may be closed only for limited and specific reasons for example to deal with information that could compromise national security see closing hearing below detailed provisions of house rules dealing with broadcasting committee hearings point up the importance to congress of television coverage house rule xi clause 4 among the issues covered are the following radio and television coverage cannot be used as partisan political campaign material to promote or oppose persons political candidacy coverage must be in strict conformity with and observance of the acceptable standards of dignity propriety courtesy and decorum traditionally observed by the house hearings open to the public must be open to coverage by the media although in november 1997 the house removed language in rule xi clause 4 that previously allowed subpoenaed witnesses to request that television lenses be covered microphones used for media coverage be turned off and still cameras not be used once chair determines the number of cameras that will be permitted in hearing the executive committee of the radio and television correspondents galleries determines how those cameras will be allocated among the television media neither television cameras nor still photographers can be positioned between the witness table and members of the committee and photographers may not position themselves where they might unnecessarily obstruct coverage by other media television cameras must operate from fixed positions and cannot unnecessarily obstruct coverage of the hearing by other media television and radio equipment must be in place before the hearing begins and cannot be installed or removed from the hearing room while the committee is in session technicians may install additional lighting in hearing or meeting room in order to raise the ambient lighting level in hearing to the lowest level necessary to provide adequate television coverage crs16 otherwise additional lighting such as spotlights and strobelights is not permitted preference in allocating the number of still photographers permitted by committee chairs must be given to photographers from the associated press photos and united press international newspictures if requests are made by more media than permitted by the chair pool coverage is arranged by the standing committee of press photographers individuals providing media coverage must be accredited to the radio and television correspondents galleries or the press photographers gallery the house committee on ways and means is one of the few committees with rules expanding upon these provisions the committee forbids interviews in the hearing room while the committee is in session and individual interviews must take place before the gavel falls to convene meeting or after the gavel falls for its adjournment the media must notify the committee one day in advance of planned electronic coverage committee press aides usually are responsible for planning media coverage for hearing and they typically employ number of diverse techniques for attracting and managing the media in some cases press aides in members personal offices take similar actions on behalf of individual committee members often an early objective is to seek the assistance of the house press gallery the periodical press gallery and the radio and television correspondents gallery the mission of the gallery staffs is not only to facilitate coverage of house activities on behalf of the media but also to assist member and committee staff with their media responsibilities gallery staff can assist committees in variety of ways by distributing press releases and witness statements resolving differences involving camera crews and making pool arrangements for maximum television coverage including setting cables for broadcasting some committees routinely inform the media of upcoming events the information typically includes list of hearings and description of each emphasizing why the hearing is important for each hearing these calendars provide the date time and location as well as staff contact press releases are standard format for informing journalists of newsworthy committee activities in addition to the committees press list press releases also can be distributed to committee and member offices and the house press galleries language from press releases can be used to draft dear colleague letters and member statements for use in committee and on the floor committee staff often put together media packets prior to hearings the packets can include variety of material such as statements by the committee chair and other members list of witnesses and copies of written testimony and background material such as press clippings and support agency studies crs17 as the day of hearing approaches reporters often will seek out staff for information many committees prefer that journalists discussions with staff be on background and not for attribution speaking for attribution usually is limited to committee members press conferences are common technique for personally informing interested journalists of important issues in an upcoming hearing and for clarifying issues immediately following hearing some committee members prefer to meet informally with reporters in the hallway outside the hearing room others prefer more structured environment in the hearing room or the members office administrative matters dozens of administrative arrangements need to be made before hearing and these usually are the responsibility of the committees administrative staff two important administrative matters are 1 reserving hearing room and 2 arranging for an official reporter early in the planning stage if committees own hearing rooms are unavailable it may try to use room of another committee in the past it has also been possible to use rooms within the jurisdiction of the speaker and other leaders and officers by contacting the pertinent offices upon request the office of official reporters clerk of the house will provide reporter to transcribe hearing many administrative details concern the physical setup of the hearing room these may include arranging furniture and equipment setting up items on the dais such as nameplates writing materials water and ice supplying the chair with gavel block and timer providing the chair and other members with materials not included in the briefing books such as copies of committee and house rules reserving seats for the press staff witnesses or other individuals and arranging for turning on audio consoles microphones and lighting sufficient copies of relevant materials such as member and witness statements should be provided for distribution at the hearing security during hearings is provided by the us capitol police if hearing deals with sensitive or volatile issues or there is unusually great public interest multiple uniformed or plain clothes officers may be assigned the capitol police may take any law enforcement actions that become necessary during the course of hearing such as responding to disturbance or making an arrest of an unruly spectator the capitol police also provide security for protected witnesses such as the attorney general and other highranking government officials field hearings field hearing presents planning considerations different from those for washington hearings these include identifying the city district or state and the specific location for example federal building school or private venue where the hearing will be held it may be necessary for staff to travel to the field location day or more before the hearing to ensure that arrangements are to the committees satisfaction including the specific layout of tables and chairs for committee crs18 members witnesses and the public and the availability of sound system and the technicians to operate it security personnel also need to be arranged when field hearings involve oversight of federal agency it may be possible under committees oversight authority to request that the agency provide transportation for committee members and staff usually such requests require letter from the committee chairman to the agency head expenses incurred by representative or staff aide attending field hearing including transportation meals and incidentals such as parking charges are reimbursable by the committee holding the hearing automobile rentals are also reimbursable provided that the car is used only to transport members or staff authorized by the committee for travel regulations printed in the house administration committees committees congressional handbook cover several matters specific to field hearings committees are authorized to rent commercial space when public space is not available or suitable if committee has to lease private space for field hearing it may be asked to provide certificate of insurance the house does not carry private insurance policy and generally does not permit the use of committee funds to pay for private insurance policy house regulations also stipulate that the office of official reporters to committees will either send an official reporter or arrange for stenographic reporter from commercial firm at the location of the field hearing conducting hearings as previously noted hearings involve extensive preparation by the day of the hearing important requirements of house rules such as publicly announcing hearings have been met critical decisions such as choice and format of witnesses have been made necessary research has been conducted and relevant materials assembled in briefing book briefings may have been prepared for committee members staff witnesses and the press administrative issues such as arranging for an official reporter have been attended to as result of thorough and careful preparation many hearings proceed without surprises committees must however occasionally confront unanticipated events that require change in plans such as calling additional witnesses or closing session to the public quorum each committee can determine the number of members required for its hearings but house rules require minimum quorum of two members at any hearing house rule xi clause 2h2 while most committees have adopted this minimum there are variations for example the committee on ways and means requires quorum of two but its rule requires that every effort be made to secure the presence of at least one majority and one minority party member the rules committee operates with different hearings quorums for different purposes the quorum is five for full committee testimony on requests for rules three for measures or matters of original jurisdiction before the full committee and two for testimony before subcommittees crs19 committee staff often poll members before the start of hearing to determine who plans to attend sometimes staff also obtain information on where members can be reached in case they are needed to meet the quorum requirement committees sometimes proceed with hearings without quorum for instance committee may work through roll call vote on the floor by leaving only one member presiding over the hearing while others vote the first committee member to return from the floor may replace the member presiding who then leaves to cast his or her vote if however if any member makes point of order that quorum is not present the committee cannot continue to conduct business until the presence of quorum is established closing hearing the vast majority of committee hearings are open to the public as required under house rules but house rules permit committees to close hearing for specific reasons and outline the procedure for doing so house rule xi clauses 2g2 and 2k5 hearing may be closed to the public because disclosure of testimony evidence or other matters to be considered would endanger the national security would compromise sensitive law enforcement information or would violate any law or rule of the house of representatives in order to close all or part of hearing committee must vote by roll call in open session and with majority present when quorum is present for taking testimony however committee may vote to close hearing 1 because the anticipated testimony at an investigative hearing may tend to defame degrade or incriminate any person or 2 solely to discuss whether there is reason to continue the hearing in closed session house rules permit most committees to close hearing on specific day and on one subsequent day of hearings the committees on appropriations armed services and intelligence however may vote to close their hearings for five additional consecutive days of hearings members of the house generally may attend but not participate in hearings of committees except the committee on standards of official conduct on which they do not serve nevertheless the house may vote to authorize committee to use procedures for closing hearing to the public to close hearings to members not on the committee as well witness rights in 1955 the house first adopted rules to protect the rights of witnesses these rules responded to criticism about the treatment of witnesses particularly at investigative hearings such as those to explore communist party activities in the united states today several protections for witnesses especially at investigative hearings are contained in house rules house rule xi clause 2k for example witnesses are provided copy of the rules of the committee and house rules applicable to investigative hearings they may be accompanied by their own counsel to advise them of their constitutional rights further if evidence will tend to defame degrade or incriminate person the committee may vote with quorum present for taking testimony to meet in closed session the committee may proceed in open crs20 session only if with majority present it determines that the evidence will not have these effects on this person in either case the committee will give the person an opportunity to appear as witness and will take requests from the individual to subpoena additional witnesses in other instances the chair receives and the committee disposes of requests to subpoena witnesses witnesses also are protected by the constitution in particular the fourth fifth and first amendments while committees need to obtain answers to questions the fourth amendment prohibits unreasonable search and seizure to obtain information under fifth amendment protection against selfincrimination witnesses cannot be compelled to give evidence against themselves unless granted immunity the first amendment protects witnesses who may seek to refuse compliance with committee subpoena by claiming that the committee infringed on the witnesss right to free speech assembly or petition opening statements when present the committee chair ordinarily will preside over its hearings house rules allow each committee chair to designate majority party member to be the vice chair of the full committee or subcommittee and stipulate that the vice chair presides in the temporary absence of the chair house rule xi clause 2d if both the chair and vice chair are absent the most senior majority party member present presides in order to begin the hearing the chair usually makes an opening statement introducing the subject and purpose of the session the chair may describe important events leading to the hearing and key contemporary issues he or she also may outline the committees approach to the matter how interruptions such as for roll call votes will be handled and the schedule of future hearings when finished the chair generally recognizes the ranking minority party member to make an opening statement and may then recognize other members not all committees allow opening statements by all committee members the rules of the committee on resources for instance preclude opening statements unless the chair or designee makes statement in which case the ranking minority member or designee also may make statement in practice chairs of other committees sometimes discourage opening statements in the interest of time perhaps asking that interested members instead submit opening statements for the printed hearing record where opening statements are permitted they usually occur under the five minute rule which allows member to speak for five minutes when recognized by the chair this is not always the case however while the committee on energy and commerce chair and ranking minority member or designees may speak for five minutes other committee members are limited to three minutes each the committee on science attempts to restrict the total time of opening statements its rules generally provide that after consultation with the ranking minority member the chair limits the total time for opening statements by members to more than 10 minutes the time is equally divided among members present who wish to make an opening statement crs21 introducing witnesses and administering the oath following any opening statements the chair generally introduces each witness in accordance with the arranged order and format committee member other than the chair might introduce witness in some cases the committee on resources for instance permits committee member to introduce witness who is constituent house rules authorize the chair or any member designated by the chair to administer the oath to witness house rule xi clause 2m2 in practice most committees rarely require testimony under oath swearing in of witnesses appears to be more common at investigative hearings and hearings dealing with sensitive subject matter for instance under the rules of the permanent select committee on intelligence the chairman may require testimony of witnesses to be given under oath or affirmation further the rules of few committees prescribe particular oath if witnesses are sworn the rules of the committee on armed services contain the following do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony you will give before this committee or subcommittee in the matters now under consideration will be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god oral testimony of witnesses under house rules each committee requires witnesses to limit their oral testimony to brief summary of their argument insofar as is practicable house rule xi clause 2g4 in the interest of time and because written testimony generally is available to the committee in advance it is usually not necessary or desirable for witness to read his or her entire written statement on some committees the chair has the discretion to determine how long witness may speak on the committee on agriculture witnesses may be limited to brief summaries of their statements within the time allotted to them at the discretion of the chair other committees have adopted rules stipulating how long witness may speak typically for five minutes for instance each witness before the committee on resources and the committee on science is restricted to five minute summary of his or her written remarks resources committee witnesses may be granted additional time by the chair in consultation with the ranking minority member and science committee witnesses may receive additional time from the chair fiveminute rule for questioning witnesses the question and answer period which follows witnesss opening statement presents an opportunity for committee to build public record and to obtain information to support future committee actions committee staff sometimes prepare questions or talking points for committee leaders and other members in some cases the expected line of questioning is discussed in advance with witnesses house rules generally accord committee members five minutes to question each witness until every member has had this opportunity house rule xi clause 2j2 in practice many committees allow an extension of time by unanimous consent and crs22 few committees such as veterans affairs specify this in their rules after the first round of questioning under the fiveminute rule committees can determine how to dispose of any additional time some committees rules specify procedure for using additional time for example the rules of the house committee on international relations provide for second round of questioning under the fiveminute rule while rules of the committee on agriculture allow the chair to limit the time for further questioning extended questioning of witnesses house rules allow committee to extend the time for questioning witnesses by adopting rule or motion to allow an equal number of its majority and minority party members to question witness for period not to exceed one hour in the aggregate house rule xi clause 2j2b similarly committee may adopt rule or motion allowing its majority and minority staff to question witness for equal periods of time not to exceed one hour in the aggregate house rule xi clause 2j2c several committees have adopted procedures allowing extended questioning the rules of some committees for instance the committee on agriculture give only members this authority they state that the chair and ranking minority member may designate an equal number of members from each party to question witnesses and that unless majority of the committee or subcommittee determines otherwise staff may not interrogate witnesses the source of the authority for extended questioning differs among committees on the committee on government reform the chair with the concurrence of the ranking minority member or the committee by motion may permit members or staff to question witnesses for an extended period on the committee on veterans affairs the chair after consultation with the ranking minority member may designate members or authorize staff to conduct extended questioning further few committees specify when any extended questioning may occur for instance the chair of the committee on veterans affairs cannot recognize member for extended questioning until all members have had chance to question witnesses under the five minute rule the rules of the house committee on government reform allow extended questioning at the discretion of the chair only after all members have had an opportunity under the five minute rule few committee rules also detail how the time for extended questioning is to be allocated on the committee on government reform the chair determines how to allocate the time permitted for extended questioning by majority members or staff and the ranking minority member determines how to allocate the time for minority members or staff the chair or the ranking minority member as applicable may allocate the time for extended questioning by staff to members crs23 order of questioning witnesses each committee has discretion to determine the order in which its members may question witnesses common procedure allows alternating between the parties in order of seniority by contrast the socalled early bird rule permits members to question witnesses based on members order of arrival at the hearing some committees use combination of these two methods the rules of many committees contain provisions granting their chairs flexibility in recognition to take into consideration the ratio of majority to minority members present in practice committee chairs may entertain requests to proceed out of order to accommodate the schedules of individual members committee rules covering the order for questioning witnesses vary on the committee on house administration questioning begins with the chair and ranking minority party member then alternates between the majority and minority parties further the chair is to take into consideration the ratio of majority to minority members present in order not to disadvantage the majority the chair may accomplish this by recognizing two majority party members for each minority member recognized in the case of the committee on armed services all members present at the start of hearing will be recognized in order of seniority and thereafter members are recognized in order of appearance however the committee chair also must take into consideration the ratio of majority to minority members present and the chair and ranking minority member take precedence upon their arrival relevancy of debate and questions house rules require members speaking on the floor to confine themselves to the question under debate house rule xvii1b while this rule is generally applicable to debate in committee some committee rules apply it explicitly to hearings in questioning witnesses members of the committee on transportation and infrastructure are limited in their remarks to the subject matter under consideration the committee on armed services requires questions put to witnesses to be relevant to the measure or matter under consideration the house committee on government reform requires that questions put to witnesses at investigative hearings be relevant to the subject matter before the committee and that the chair rule on relevance of questions put to witnesses on the committee on agriculture members are limited in debate to the subject matter under consideration unless permission is granted by unanimous consent to extend remarks beyond the subject in addition questions put to witnesses must be germane to the matter under consideration questioning by other than committee or subcommittee members house rules allow committees to adopt rule or motion permitting majority and minority staff to question witnesses for equal periods of time see extended questioning of witnesses committee rules sometimes give additional authority for staff to question witnesses the permanent select committee on intelligence for crs24 example allows witnesses to be interrogated by such committee staff as are authorized by the chairman in consultation with the ranking member several committees permit their members to participate in the hearings of subcommittees of which they are not members although the specific provisions differ in some cases this prerogative appears to be restricted to the chair and ranking minority member of the full committee for instance many committees allow the chair and ranking minority member to serve exofficio on all subcommittees which presumably allows them to participate in subcommittee hearings the rules of the committee on appropriations make explicit that the chair and ranking minority member may sit as members of all subcommittees and may participate in subcommittee work their participation may include voting by contrast the committee on education and the workforce allows any committee member to attend subcommittee hearings and question witnesses other committees explicitly bar nonsubcommittee members from engaging in certain activities while presumably allowing them to question witnesses any member of the committee on veterans affairs for example may sit with any subcommittee during any hearing or meeting but may not vote be counted for quorum or raise point of order relatedly even if hearing is closed to the public all members of the house generally may attend but not participate in hearings of committees except the committee on standards of official conduct on which they do not serve house rule xi clause 2g2c committee may however use the procedures for closing hearing to the public to close hearings to members not on the committee if the house so authorizes by vote posthearing activities after examining the last witness the committee chair closes the hearing the chair may summarize what has been learned about the issue and comment on the future committee schedule or expected action after day of hearings staff may be asked to prepare summary of testimony the summary may be distributed to committee members and the press and become part of any published hearing followup questions can be prepared and submitted to witnesses for written replies to clear up points not resolved during the hearing if the hearing is investigative the committee can prepare and issue its report if the hearing is legislative the committee may proceed to mark up and report measure to the house finally committees attend to administrative details following hearing such as restoring the hearing room to its original condition and sending thankyou letters to witnesses committees generally are protected on the house floor from points of order against actions that occurred during their hearings under house rules in general point of order cannot be raised on the floor against measure reported by committee on the grounds that the committee had not complied with provisions in crs25 house rules concerning hearings house rule xi clause 2g5 member of the reporting committee may however make such point of order on the floor if the point of order was made in committee in timely manner but was improperly overruled or not properly considered printing hearings committees are required to keep transcripts of their hearings most committees regularly ask the office of official reporters clerk of the house to provide reporter to transcribe hearing transcripts must be substantially verbatim house rule xi clause 2e1a only technical grammatical and typographical corrections authorized by the person making the remarks are allowed further committees usually publish their transcripts although publication is not required house rules encourage committees to publish their hearings on reported measures in general if hearings have been held on any measure or matter reported by committee the rules require the committee to make every reasonable effort to have the hearings printed and available to members before floor consideration house rule xiii clause 4b general appropriations bills may not be considered in the house until printed hearings have been available for at least three calendar days excluding saturdays sundays and legal holidays except when the house is in session on such day house rule xiii clause 4c in addition testimony taken in executive session may not be released or used in public sessions without the consent of majority of the committee majority being present house rule xi clause 2k7 the rules of some committees address the authority to print hearings transcripts of budget committee hearings may be printed if the chair so decides or if majority of the members so requests the appropriations committee requires that transcript of all hearings on the federal budget as whole be printed and distributed to members each committee may establish procedures for correcting its transcripts and some committees have rules to expedite this process the committee on ways and means for example requires each witness to correct and return the transcript and members must correct their testimony and return the corrected transcripts as soon as possible further the committee chair can order transcript printed without the corrections of member or witness if the chair determines that reasonable time has elapsed and that further delay would impede the legislative process each committee also has discretion to print supplemental materials as part of the printed hearing for example in its printed hearing committee might include written statements of witnesses charts and research materials prepared by committee staff and letters and testimony from individuals who did not appear as witnesses printed hearing also might include witness responses to questions posed during the hearing that the witness could not answer on the spot or witness responses to follow up questions the rules of some committees address the printing of supplemental material or information for instance the committee on agricultures hearings must include the attendance of members during the hearings crs26 house rules require that to the maximum extent feasible committees are to make their publications available to the public in electronic form house rule xi clause 2e4 this rules change in the 105th congress was intended to encourage committees to make printed public materials available on the internet while number of committee rules restate this house rule those of the committee on small business expressly state that the proposed testimony of witnesses must be provided to the public in electronic form since the 106th congress most committees have made written testimony andor hearing transcripts available online see httpwwwhousegovhousecommitteewwwshtml house rules require that committees hearings records and other documents be kept separate from the personal office records of the chair and generally allow all members of the house access to committees records house rule xi clause 2e2 the legislative reorganization act of 1946 pl 601 79th congress 60 stat 812 requires that at the end of each session of congress each committees printed hearings must be bound by the library of congress in addition at the end of each congress the chair of each committee is to required transfer to the clerk of the house the noncurrent records of the committee house rule vii clause 1 noncurrent committee records are preserved and made available by the
