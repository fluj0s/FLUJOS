charles henning analyst in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress pows and mias status and accounting issues summary there has been longrunning controversy about the fate of certain us prisoners of war pows and servicemembers missing in action mias as result of various us military operations while few people familiar with the issue feel that any americans are still being held against their will in communist countries associated with the cold war more feel that some may have been so held in the past in the soviet union china north korea or north vietnam similarly few believe there has been conspiracy to cover up the existence of live pows but many would maintain that there was at least during the 1970s us government mismanagement of the issue normalization of relations with vietnam exacerbated this longstanding debate normalizations supporters contend that vietnamese cooperation on the powmia issue has greatly increased opponents argue that cooperation has in fact been much less than supporters say and that the vietnamese can only be induced to cooperate by firmness rather than conciliation those who believe americans are now held or were after the war ended feel that even if specific report of live americans has thus far met rigorous proofs the mass of information about live americans is compelling those who doubt live americans are still held or were after the war ended argue that despite vast efforts only one live american military prisoner remained in indochina after the war defector who returned in 1979 the us government indicates the possibility that americans are still being held in indochina cannot be ruled out some say americans may have been kept by the vietnamese after the war but killed later increased us access to vietnam has not yet led to large reduction in the number of americans still listed as unaccounted for although this may be due to some us policies as well as the level of vietnamese cooperation there is considerable evidence that prisoners from the end of world war ii the korean war and cold war shootdowns of us military aircraft may have been taken to the ussr and not returned the evidence about pows from vietnam being taken to the soviet union is more questionable there is evidence that navy pilot scott speicher shot down on the first night of the 1991 persian gulf war and until recently listed as killed in action rather than missing in action was almost certainly captured by the iraqis information about his fate has not yet been discovered by us and coalition forces in iraq all american pows captured by the iraqis during the initial stage of the current war were returned to us control the remains of all others listed as mia have been recovered one us army soldier captured by iraqi insurgents on april 9 2004 is currently listed as pow there has been word about his fate since his pow status was confirmed by dod on april 23

report on the status of 1991 gulf war navy pilot lt cdr michael scott speicher was completed it reiterated conclusions reached in earlier studies that he could well have been captured that there was specific evidence of his death and that some former members they were not identified if known of the saddam hussein government of iraq were knowledgeable about his fate accordingly it recommended that speichers status be maintained as missing rather than killed areas of congressional interest this report summarizes numbers of us prisoners of war pows and servicemembers missing in action mias lost during the vietnam war 19611973 and the korean war 19501953 compares these losses to other 20th century american wars and describes the powmia investigation and policy process it discusses reports asserting that some pows from these wars were not returned to us control when the wars ended and that some of these individuals may still be alive further it discusses americans possibly captured by communist countries during cold war incidents or after being liberated from german pow camps at the end of world war ii and whether any such americans could still be alive it also summarizes powmia matters and controversies related to postcold war us military operations particularly the 1991 persian gulf war the ongoing operation enduring freedom that began on october 7 2001 when the united states began combat operations against the taliban regime in afghanistan and operation iraqi freedom that began on march 19 2003 finally the report describes legislation and congressional oversight concerning the powmia issue for information on other aspects of usvietnam relations and on the current controversy over the attempt by some american former pows held by the japanese during world war ii to obtain compensation from japanese corporations see the for additional reading section at the end of this report definition of terms the following terms are frequently encountered in analyses of the powmia issue pow prisoner of war persons known to be or to have been held by the enemy as live prisoner or last seen under enemy control mia missing in action persons removed from control of us forces due to enemy action but not known to either be prisoner of war or dead crs2 kiabnr killed in actionbody not recovered persons known to have been killed in action but body or remains not recovered by us forces such as an aircraft exploding in midair or crashing or body lost at sea pfod presumptive finding of death an administrative finding by the appropriate military service secretary after statutory review procedures that there is current evidence to indicate that person previously listed as mia or pow could still be alive unaccounted for an allinclusive term not legal status used to indicate americans initially listed as pow mia kiabnr or pfod but about whom further information is yet known names are shifted usually from the most uncertain status mia to more certain categories

south vietnam fell in april 1975 all were released by late 1976 since 1976 some americans have been imprisoned in vietnam almost all for civilian offenses and eventually released most americans now in vietnamese prisons for criminal offenses some of which would be characterized as political crimes by the vietnamese authorities are naturalized americans of vietnamese birth or ancestry since 1973 only one us military member has returned alive from vietnam marine corps pfc robert garwood was listed as pow by us authorities but never by the vietnamese in 1965 and returned voluntarily to the us

americans to have exploded without any sign of the crew ejecting and similar situations vietnam powmias us government policy and organization since 1982 the official us position regarding live americans has been as follows although we have thus far been unable to prove that americans are still being held against their will the information available to us precludes ruling out that possibility actions to investigate livesighting reports receive and will continue to receive necessary priority and resources based on the assumption that at least some americans are still held

and open sources according to dod between april 1975 the fall of south vietnam and august 5 2005 22677 reports possibly pertaining to americans in southeast asia have been acquired by the us government including 1976 alleged firsthand sightings of the 1976 fully 1942 9828 have according to dpmo been resolved more specifically 6786 1341 correlate with persons since accounted for ie returned live or known dead another 2814 556 have been determined to be fabrications and 228 45 correlate to wartime premid1975 sightings of americans either military or civilian the remaining 34 or 172 involve sightings of americans in either captive 31 or noncaptive 3 environment and represent the focus of dpmo analytical and collection efforts of the 34 24 were reported to have occurred prior to 1976 4 between 1976 and 1995 and 6 during the period 1996present usvietnamese interaction on powmia issues recent developments and issues since 1991 the us has gained substantial access to aircraft crash sites vietnamese records and vietnamese civilians and has established substantial permanent presence of military and civilian personnel for several years the vietnamese have allowed us personnel some access to their government archives and permitted some interviews with senior vietnamese military leaders from the war this increased access however has not yet led to large numbers of americans being removed masse from the rolls of people who are unaccounted for between 1991 and 2005 the total number has generally dropped by 30 35 cases per year however much information or material or information obtained in vietnam does not assist in remains identification upon close study it turns out to be redundant already in us hands or pertaining to resolved cases in addition dpmo has stated that vietnamese government disinformation program has been associated with recent reporting on missing americans those reports all pertain to the alleged recovery of remains and identifying data ie dog tags by vietnamese citizens cited in recent editions of the vietnamera unaccounted for statistical report of the dpmo located at the dpmo website some involved with the powmia issue argue that vietnamese cooperation on the powmia issue has actually been spotty and uneven at best arguing that the us government has tended to equate activity with results and resource inputs with true outputs in terms of the fate of unaccountedfor americans they suggest that the true cost of all us military and diplomatic activities associated with postvietnam war powmiarelated activities is much higher than stated dpmo budget outlays of approximately 15 million yearly perhaps as much as 50100 million yearly they allege that vietnam and north korea charge extraordinarily high fees for providing support to dpmojpac operations such as logistical support aviation costs food and lodging and the like and that the services received are by means as lavish as the bills presented indicate us policy and the remains issue as noted above dpmo believes of the 1815 americans listed as unaccounted for as of august 5 2005 that 667 are definitely dead and that further investigation could result in more evidence or remains being found such cases include those that resulted from aircraft explosions drowning or simple disappearance some believe that the vietnamese have documentary evidence about the fate of at least some of them others argue that concerns over public reaction more than disagreements on the part of american analysts that the individuals concerned really are dead are holding up the decision to close these cases the question may be as follows if evidence other than remains is not conclusive what use is it if remains are available the number of cases listed for crs6 further pursuit by dpmo does fluctuate based on new evidence cases hitherto thought unresolvable are made active by more information those in which leads were being pursued can turn out to be apparently unresolvable congress and the powmia issue 19932005 fy1994fy2006 2005 fy2006 congressional action relevant matters concerning powmia issues were in the fy2006 national defense authorization act pl 109163 on june 20 2005 in house floor debate on the fy2006 department of defense dod appropriation act hr 2863 109th congress passed house june 20 2005 colloquy on powmia matters took place between representative nathan deal and representative cw bill young chairman of the house defense appropriations subcommittee see congressional record june 20 2005 h4767 at mr deals request mr young agreed that report should be prepared about allegations that the defense powmissing personnel office dpmo has recently been arbitrary uncooperative and hostile with powmia organizations and families and that this report should be published in the eventual conference report on the act mr deal was further concerned about compliance with all applicable provisions of law with particular reference to allegations about attempts to use military air transportation for mia families to coerce them into supporting dpmo initiatives and said that this report must reflect comprehensive study of dpmos guidance and policy initiatives the national league of families of american prisoners of war and missing in southeast asia has stated these allegations in detail in its newsletterreview of 2004 available online at httpwwwpowmiafamiliesorg3220520newsletterpdf 2004 fy2005 congressional action the fy2005 ndaa pl 108375 october 28 2004 118 stat 1811 included provision sec 582 which required dod to maintain the number of military and civilian personnel in the dpmo at 46 and 69 respectively and the fy2005 budget at 160 million the levels of fy2003 it also required gao to study the adequacy of dpmo funding and personnel levels in relation to the missions it has to perform this provision appears to have been engendered by congressional concern over dod efforts to decrease the resources allocated to the dpmo both personnel and funding this provision essentially incorporated the house version of the bill with some minor changes the senate version included similar provision 2003 fy2004 congressional action section 588 of the fy2004 national defense authorization act pl 108136 november 24 2003 117 stat 1392 expressed the sense of the congress that the united states should aggressively pursue the case of mias with particular reference to speicher and authorized 1 million reward to individuals who provide information leading to the resolution of the speicher case and others see below persian gulf war powmia case 2002 fy2003 congressional action the fy2003 national defense authorization act pl 107314 december 2 2002 116 stat 2458 included two provisions related to powmia matters section 551 prohibited dod from reducing personnel or budget levels of the dpmo this appears to have resulted from planned reductions of at least 15 in the size of the dpmo staff as part of general effort to reduce headquarters staffs section 583 required the secretary of defense to submit comprehensive report on the speicher case see below persian gulf war powmia case to congress within 60 days after the bill became law crs7 19932001 fy1994fy2002 congressional action from 1993 through 1997 fy1994fy1998 legislation the annual defense authorization bill included powmia related sections with considerable policy significance and frequently political controversy however during 19982001 fy1999fy2002 legislation congress was less active on powmia matters none of the national defense authorization or intelligence authorization acts of the latter period contained significant powmiarelated provisions or report language with broad policy implications vietnam powmias were americans left behind are any still alive those who believe americans are still held or were held after the war ended feel that even if specific report has thus far been proved the numbers unaccounted for and the cumulative mass of information about live americans is compelling frequently people holding this view suggest that throughout the 1970s in the bitter and sour aftermath of the vietnam war there was lack of will in the government which reflected that of the country as whole to continue investigating the powmia issue they posit that this contributed to mindset to debunk reports of live americans as well as desire on the part of successive administrations to wash their hands of the issue those who doubt americans are still held or were when the war ended argue that despite numerous reports exhaustive interrogations and formidable technical means used by us intelligence agencies report of an unaccountedfor live american with the exception of garwood has been validated as to who when and where the individual is or was they believe that much of the evidence cited relates to already accountedfor americans wishful thinking or fabrication most us government analysts have come to believe that it is extremely unlikely that the north vietnamese kept us prisoners after the end of the war or transferred any to the ussr they appear to acknowledge the repressive nature of totalitarian communist regimes that the vietnamese could have opted to keep some americans they just feel that their examination of the evidence indicates that they did not significantly the progressively increasing penetration of vietnam by large american official presence american business interests and tens of thousands of american and european tourists has failed to disclose any indications that american pows were kept behind in the early 1970s let alone are still being held the coverup issue some say the us government has engaged in coverup of evidence about live americans still being held in indochina they attach greater credence to some sources than does the government and suggest that the criteria set by the government for validating reports of live americans are unreasonably and perhaps deliberately high the government responds by stating that such assertions are based on data that is inaccurate or fraudulent it also asserts that numerous investigations have cleared dia of coverup charges and that the ability to maintain coverup strains credulity in an era of press leaks and openness since 1982 it has been us policy to provide intelligence to families of unaccountedfor americans that pertains or may pertain to their missing men have americans remained in indochina voluntarily some americans stayed in indochina voluntarily garwood being the best known another defected to the viet cong in 1967 and was killed by the khmer rouge cambodian communists in 1975 or 1976 ideology collaboration with the enemy and fear of punishment upon return to the us personal problems home local wife and children brainwashing by captors or crs8 combination of these factors all could have played role in other americans remaining in indochina voluntarily the vietnamese have always left room for such by denying americans are living in areas under their control in addition the us government policy cited above on live americans is careful to refer to americans still being held against their will are the vietnamese laotians or cambodians still holding the remains of dead americans there is widelyheld belief that for many years the vietnamese had collection of remains from which they released remains as they saw fit the dpmo believes that this collection may have been exhausted by august 1990 whether the vietnamese hold other remains is not known some suggest the vietnamese have not released remains that would indicate mistreatment of pows andor that some were alive when the war ended but died in vietnamese custody thereafter although such mistreatment is well known the large number of americans lost in or over laos the number of known discrepancy cases and the few americans returned who had been captured in laos suggest that the laotians know more about the fate of unaccountedfor americans than they have yet stated on the other hand most lao governments communist or not have exercised little control over large parts of their country due to vietnamese occupation and their own lack of resources this suggests the laotians may not have the ability to provide many answers about missing americans and such answers may be better found from the vietnamese laos is however one area where searches of aircraft crash sites have resulted in the recent identification of some unaccountedfor americans recently for example in march 2005 us powmiarelated delegation held talks with lao officials to discuss ways to improve us access to information and aircraft crash sites related to us vietnam war pows korean war powsmias since the korean war ended in 1953 there have been rumors americans captured by the north koreans or chinese were or still are held against their will in north korea china or russiathe former ussr it is generally accepted that the communist powers involved in the war withheld significant amounts of information on powmia from the united states probably with more withholding by north korea and china than russia dpmo states that although there is firsthand direct evidence of korean war pows being transferred to the soviet union the cumulative weight of circumstantial evidence is so compelling that they believe that at least small numbers of americans were in fact so transferred there are indications that some sightings of caucasians by foreign nationals in north korea may be of several american soldiers who defected to north korea in the postkorean war era in addition some us pows were not released by china until 1955 two years after the war ended two civilian cia aircrew members shot down over north korea during the war in 1952 were imprisoned for 20 years and not released until 1972 declassified us documents indicate that the us government maintained an intensive interest in live pows from the korean war throughout the 1950s the end of the korean war in 1953 was followed by intensely bitter relations between the us the north koreans and the chinese this suggests that the two communist enemies of the united states during the korean war as well as stalinist soviet union might be inclined to hold live americans perhaps more so than vietnam in the 1970s crs9 during the mid1950s the us demanded the north koreans and chinese account for missing americans after 1955 due to the lack of response except for the return of 1868 remains in 1954 the issue abated although the united states periodically raised the issue in 1957 house foreign affairs committee hearings on the korean mia issue aired frustrations similar to those raised since 1973 on indochina mias although the issue of korean mias began to get more attention in the early 1980s concrete results of contact with the north koreans were minimal until 1996 between mid1996 and mid1997 negotiations took place in which united states and north korea agreed on parameters for conducting field investigations and archival research for us mias between 1996 and 2004 us personnel completed 36 joint field activities jfas searches for american remains in north korea these teams recovered 224 remains of which 20 have been identified as those of americans agreement was reached in late 2004 for five more jfas to be conducted in 2005 the first took place between midapril and midmay 2005 however on may 25 2005 dod suspended the operations of us powmia personnel operating in north korea citing heightened concerns about their safety in the context of rising tensions between the united states and north korea the teams operate in north korea under terms that effectively cut off their ability to communicate with anyone outside the countrythe only message permitted is daily situation report sent from liaison officer in pyongyang the north korean capital although acceptable to us commanders in the past this restrictive condition would clearly hamper any effort by other us forces to protect the recovery teams should an emergency arise such consideration us military spokesman said played part in the decision to suspend the missions1 the most recent identification of remains returned from north korea took place on july 22 2005 when dod announced that the remains of us army soldier mia from the korean war had been identified the remains had first been returned to the united states from north korea in 1993 there has been some controversy about the payments the us has made to north korea for powmiarelated search activity since 1993 dpmo has paid north korea about 15 million for recovery operations as with joint recovery operations in vietnam laos and other countries the payments are calculated by negotiating the compensation provided for the workers materials facilities and equipment provided by the north koreans some have alleged that the sums are form of disguised subsidy and provide little benefit in terms of remains found although it may be that the extremely austere conditions in north korea make any sort of operations there difficult and expensive by american standards for further information see crs report rl31785 foreign assistance to north korea by mark manyin pows and mias from cold war incidents during the cold war 19461991 some us military aircraft were shot down by the ussr eastern european countries china and north korea some of these aircraft were performing intelligence missions near or actually inside soviet airspace others were 1 bradley graham us halts missions to recover remains in n korea washington post may 26 2005 p a19 crs10 definitely in international airspace andor were not involved in intelligence operations while virtually all such aircraft losses were acknowledged at the time often with considerable publicity their intelligence functions were not between 1946 and 1977 according to dod list released in 1992 there were at least 38 such aircraft shootdowns and one involving ship the seizure of the uss pueblo by the north koreans in early 1968 of the 364 crewmembers 187 were eventually returned to us custody the remains of 34 were recovered 11 were known to be dead from eyewitness reports but remains were not recovered and 132 were not recovered fate unknown throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s intelligence mostly apparently obtained from german and japanese pows from world war ii several hundred thousands of whom were not released by the soviets until 19541955 provided considerable evidence that some crewmembers of these aircraft had been seen and spoken to in soviet concentration camps after the cold war ended in 19891991 the united states began to receive substantial russian cooperation about soviet involvements in cold war shootdowns however there is little doubt that the russians have not released all available information due to varying levels of obstructionism and the oftendisorganized nature of government in postsoviet russia second type of cold war incident involves kidnapping of us personnel in or near sovietoccupied territory in europe after the end of world war ii by soviet intelligence agents most however were defectors or had wandered into sovietoccupied areas for nonpolitical reasons romantic entanglements drunkenness and the like the full story of such kidnappings may well not have been told and may never be there is question that numerous west germans were kidnapped by soviet and east german intelligence agencies in the late 1940s and early and mid1950s2 postcold war powmias the iraq war that began on march 19 2003 provides the most recent illustration that the powmia issue is not merely one of historical interest congressional concerns over americans unaccounted for during the cold war have been an integral component of the discussion about how to account for americans missing or captured since then the largest conflicts since the cold war began to end in 1989 were the two wars with or in iraq the persian gulf war of 1991 operations desert shield and desert storm total of 49 american military personnel were initially listed as missing in action during the persian gulf war of these 23 were captured by the iraqis and released after the war ended the remains of 13 were recovered and another 13 were eventually determined to be kiabnr however the status of one of the latter 13 was changed back to mia in january 2001 based on evidence that he may have survived and been captured as discussed below 2 see smith arthur l jr kidnap city cold war berlin westport cn greenwood press 2002 crs11 the speicher case on january 10 2001 the navy changed the status of lt cdr michael scott speicher from kia to mia speicher was the first us pilot shot down during the persian gulf war on the night of january 17 1991 his body was never recovered there is doubt his aircraft was shot down and crashed in iraq about 150 miles southwest of baghdad issues include the lack of remains resultant questions about whether he was in fact killed upon impact and some evidence from variety of sources that he was taken prisoner by the iraqis when in relatively good physical condition joint dodcia report prepared at the request of the senate select committee on intelligence and first publicized in 2001 stated that we assess that iraq can account for lcdr speicher but that baghdad is concealing information about his fate lcdr speicher probably survived the loss of his aircraft and if he survived he almost certainly was captured by the iraqis crs italics significantly the occupation of iraq by us and other coalition forces since march 2003 and extensive investigation of possible leads about speicher has not so far led to more substantive information about his fate although some leads could not be pursued due to the security threat posed by the iraqi insurgency3 in early september 2005 another navy report on speichers status was completed it reiterated conclusions reached in earlier studies that he could well have been captured that there was specific evidence of his death and that some former members they were not identified if known of the saddam hussein government of iraq were knowledgeable about his fate accordingly it recommended that speichers status be maintained as missing rather than killed and us military and civilian agencies in iraq and the new iraqi government increase the level of attention and effort inside iraq devoted to the case4 the ongoing iraq war 2003present powmia matters on april 13 2003 the seven remaining american pows known to have been captured by the iraqis since the war began on march 19 2003 were recovered by us troops an eighth had already been rescued by us special operations forces on april 1 this was the widely reported case of army pfc jessica lynch maximum of 21 us military personnel were listed as pow or mia during the initial stages of the war on april 28 2003 dod announced that the remains of the last remaining american listed as mia at that time had been positively identified on april 9 2004 one american soldier was captured by iraqi insurgents he was the first pow taken by the enemy in iraq since the eight captured in the early part of the war were liberated by us forces in april 2003 although there were rumors in late june 2004 that he had been killed these reports were not confirmed and have since died down us officials say they have reason to think he is not still pow and he is listed as such 3 see for example scarborough

imprisonment of us pows liberated from the germans there are allegations that the ussr failed to repatriate up to 25000 american pows liberated from the germans after world war ii ended in europe on may 8 1945 this appears to have foundation in fact and to result in large part from an apparent lack of rigor and care in analyzing the issue archival research in the united states and russia combined with interviews in russia appears to establish conclusively that virtually all such prisoners were returned in addition the large flow of information on soviet concentration camps of the stalin era beginning in the early 1960s both in writing and from emigre accounts has provided indication of mass imprisonment of americans some us citizens of german birth who served in the german armed forces or lived in germany were taken prisoner by the red army as it advanced into central europe in addition the soviet secret police singled out americans with german russian or jewish names for special attention both figures are consonant with other knowledge of the arbitrary and brutal nature of the stalinist ussr accounts of us dealings with the ussr during and immediately after world war ii on the pow issue are replete with accounts of soviet obfuscation truculence and reluctant cooperation the joint usrussian commission on powsmias investigating these issues has obtained good deal of information however as was noted above in the section on cold war shootdowns and similar incidents there has been considerable hesitancy and obstruction of the commissions work by russian officials
