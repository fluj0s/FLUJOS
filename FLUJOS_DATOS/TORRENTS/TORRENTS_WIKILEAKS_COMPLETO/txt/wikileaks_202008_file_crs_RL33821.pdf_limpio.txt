what changes in us strategic and defense relationships in the asiapacific region if any are needed to respond to major developments in the region particularly chinas emergence as major power the continuing potential for interstate conflict and the struggle against militant islamists the report addresses this central question by setting it within the larger dynamics of american strategy in both gl obal and regional contex t it discusses the shifting correlates of power in asia before considering the current strategic debate force structure and key american security relationships with regional states it also considers the united states strategic res ponse to recent developments and provides several policy options east asia is rapidly changing largely due to the rise of china which is fueled by chinas impressive econo mic growth chinas new economic clout is giving it new power and influence in the region ma ny asiapacific anal ysts and observers both in the region and in the united states feel that the united states is preoccupied in the middle east and as result is not sufficiently focused on the asiapacific at critical point in the evolution of what may pr ove to be new era in asia china is the only power that is presently thought capab of becoming peer competitor of the united states to many the overwhelming challenge is the need to try to shape the global and regional geostrategic and ec onomic environments to encourage and facilitate chinas peaceful and constructiv evolution as great power there is concern by some that policy towards china that assumes china will become threat to the united states and its interests in asia will become selffulfilling prophesy that said many feel that strategy that hedges against the possibility that chinas rise is less than peaceful and coopera tive is prudent course of action other key strategic challenges facing the united states at present in asia include the ongoing real prospect of interstate c onflict particularly on the korean peninsula and over taiwan and the ongoing struggle against militant islamists in southeast asia war over taiwan or on the korean peninsula has the potential to embroil the united states in large scale war that could be very costly in terms lives wealth power and prestige the united states main focus on the war against militant islamists is viewed by some in southeast asia as an insufficient lens in and of itself for broad based us engagement with the southeast asian region some alliances have proven to be more resilient and adaptable in adjusting to evolving challenges than others several factors appear to be linked to the durability of americas alliances in asia including common perceptions of threat shared strategic objectives diploma tic attention shared valu and common history better understanding of the disposition of americas forward deployed force structure alliance ties defense partners and working relationships in asia in the context of us strategi c priorities and shifting ge opolitical realities can inform assessments of the future direction of american stra tegic posture in the region httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33821contents

face its largest geopolitical challenges in the years ahead2 he also noted that maintaining robust overseas military presence has historically been key element of the united states national security policy in the asiapacific this forward presence promotes regional stability and has been maintained by successive us administrations all of which have emphasized the linkage between our network of alliances and friendships to regional environment in asia conducive to confidence in economic growth3 the united states established number of bilateral defense alliances with key asian states in the 1950s as it was positioni ng itself to contain communist expansion in asia in the period following world wa r ii and the korean war despite periods of drift these alliance relationships pr ovided support and assistance to the united states through the cold war and during the war in vietnam the circumstances under which these alliances were forged ve changed dramatically the fall of the soviet

shifts in the positioning of us asiapacific based for ces including the anticipated shifting of some 8000 marines from okinawa to guam the reduction and repositioning of us forces in south korea away from the demilitarized zone dividing the peninsula and an increase of additional na val and air forces on guam most regional states continue to welcome the positive role that the united states can play in promoting regional security but some are beginning to hedge against what they perceive as an increasingly distracted and insufficiently engaged american power regional states geographic proximity to china and rapidly expanding trade ties with china are when combined with perceptions of american inattention shifting regional states perceptions of the long term role of the united states in the region recent study on the united states and asia suggests that washington must actively reengage if it is to maintain its influence in the region4 the united states relative lack of attention to asia comes at time when the correlates of power are shifting not only with regard to china but elsewhere in asia as well friction in the sinojapanese rela tionship as well as in north koreajapan relations is prompting japan to develop its military capabilities and play more assertive role in international affairs india is developing rapidly and may as result play an increasingly

developments present both challeng and opportunities to the united states us strategic concerns and the evolving correlates of power in asia several key strategic issues in the asiapacific region are

capabilities by restructuring and redeploying its forces in the region6 ongoing tensions over taiwan stemming from beijings opposition to taiwanese independence chinas milita ry modernization its growing power projection capabilities its expanding diplom atic relationships its massive economic presence and its drive for energy and ot her resources are of increasing concern among many in strategic circles in the united states the pentagons quadrennial defense review of 2006 and its 2006 annua l report to congress on chinas military power noted that china has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the united states7 most view the expansion of chinas military power as primarily concerned with taiwan though some have not ed that china is in the early stages of developing power projection for contin gencies other than taiwan8 observers believe that china is seeking to attain maritime anti access force that could deter or delay the intervention of us forces in possible conflict over taiwan9 some have taken the view that chinas leaders likely hope to establish thei r country as the preponderant power in east asia10 such view is at odds with the us goal of preventing the asian continent from being dominated by any single power or coalition of states that could potentially undermine ameri can interests in the region potential interstate conflict in asia as much of the world enters phase in which conflict is predominately at the subnational level asia continues to have the very real prospect of interstate conflict this is most likely in three areas between china

tensions also exist between japan and china and between korea and japan potential conflict over taiwan remains the most plausible scenario in which the united states could become embroiled in gr eat power conflict president chen shui bian of the democratic pr ogressive party dpp has sserted more independent stance for taiwan than his nationalist pa rty kmt predecessors in 2001 president bush stated that the united states would do whatever it takes to help taiwan defend itself but later backed off from this assertion by warning taiwan that the us does not wish to see destabilizing declarations of taiwans independence that could provoke conflict with china11 tensions on the korean peninsula increas ed in july and october 2006 as result of north koreas missile and nuclear tests these events along with north koreas development of long range ssiles demonstrates that north korea continues to seek to acquire new and increasingly lethal military capabilities ongoing tensions on

toward east asia in april 2006 the fi rst point highlighted the importance of traditional allies nations that share the values of democracy and freedom while pointing to the need to resolve longstanding irritants in rela tions with japan and korea hadley also pointed to strengthened ties with key allies and friends the second insight focused on working with partners to develop cooperative and creative approaches to regional and global challenges such as the war on terrorism the third insight noted that while the us welcomes china as responsible stakeholder that cooperates to find so lutions to common problems it desires that china change policies that exacerbate nsions such as their nontransparent military expansion their quest to lock up energy supp lies and their support of resource rich countries with poor reco rds of democracy and human rights24 the us strategic response to the evolving correlates of power in asia the united states has undertaken number of

cautioned that the new smaller footprint facilities will remain dependent on larger bases located elsewher such as yokosuka in japan it has also been asserted that move to diversify support facilities

united states and taiwan were once allies under the mu tual defense treaty betw een the united states of america and the republic of china taiwans official name that was signed on december 2 1954 the treaty was terminated by the united states in 1979 as result of the us decision to switch official r ecognition to the peoples republic of china the taiwan relations act which now guides ustaiwan defense relations was enacted on april 10 1979 to ensure that despite the cutoff of formal diplomatic ties the united states would continue to help taiwan defend itself against an attack by the prc however there is guaranteed commitment of us forces the act declares us policy that the future of taiwan will be determined by peaceful means and that the united states will make available to taiwan

promot americas system of government such policy clearly defines the different foreign policy approaches of the united states and china this could positively affect regiona l public perceptions of the united states but could also alienate foreign governme nts that would prefer the united states not become involved in what they perceive as the intern affairs of their countries such policy could do more to reemphasize americas alliances with democratic regional states such as australia new zealand japan south korea and india it could also do more to reach out and support the expansion of democracy in regional muslim states such as indonesia more us funded developmen t resources could be channeled into the promotion of democracy in re gional developing countries debate in this area can be viewed as focusing on the proper bala nce between promoting democracy and balancing that against american geopo litical considerations in the region increase support for moderate islamic countries and groups many have come to the conclusion that the war against radical islamist extremists is war of ideas as such po licy response that not only attacks terrorists and denies them sanctuary but one which also seeks to shrink the political space in which they operate could pr ove effective this could be achieved through expanded support of moderate regional muslim states and aid programs targeted at muslim majority areas in nonmuslims states such as the southern philippines and southern thailand to help the aliena ted and disadvantaged in these countries become more integrated policies that promote the economic wellbeing of these states could also do much to positively affect the disposition of those who might be otherwise become alienated and disaffect ed it is sense of alienati on disaffection and grievance that appears to be key prerequisite for recruitment into terrorist organizations an initiative aimed at educating the next generation of muslim and other leaders from the region would send positive signal funding for exchanges with midlevel and seniorlevel representatives from academia the military the ngo community as well as cultural leaders could also enhance
