operations not law enforcement our job is to work within the judicial system and understand its needs and update units on emerging trends in the judicial system this useful checklist will help coaliti on forces cf personn obtain and properly document evidence and all other documentation that is needed to prosecute detainees before the central crimin court of iraq ccci evidentiary necessities there are three types of eviden ce that are necessary to ensure successful ccci prosecution photographs sworn statements and diagrams this is normally referred to as the acronym psd p photographs take as many photographs as you can of as much as you can the pictures are used to show the judges what happened and where it happened and will aid the witnesses when testifying remember picture is worth thousand words s sworn statementswitness testimony be as thorough and detailed as possible the statement needs to contain the five ws who what when where why and how d diagrams draw detailed diagram of the crime scen this could be house field or vehicle evidence handling prodedures we understand that you are combat units in the field conducting combat operations not trained law enforcement investigators ho wever the more evidence you collect on the objective the more chance the detainees will be detained for extended periods the amount of evidence you collect determines more than anything else if the detainee will be sent to central criminal court of iraq ccci wher if convicted they face up to 20 years imprisonment or to the combined review and release board crrb wher they are eligible for release in six months or less with that in mind you should take reasonable steps when collecting evidence in the field that will not compromise your safety photographing everything will shorten your time on the objectiv because it allows you to process things later minimize the handling of items or weapons that could be fingered printed or forensically analyzed or identifying which ite ms were found in certain detainees home or on the person of specific detainee photogr aph the detainee at the objective with the evidence if possible especially with the weapons explosives or contraband found place the 3evidence found in separate vehicles or containers that is seized on the objective so that it can be easily sorted out later the proper chain of custody documents and proper storage care of items seized can be done when you have return ed to the safety of your forward operating base fob use the photographs of the scene to refresh your memory when filling out the evidence tags and the witness statements back at the fob remember though the more pictures you take on the objectiv the better however if th fob is the only place that pictures can be safely taken then take the photographs back at the fob in appendix a2 we have provided you with the proper procedures for handling evidence use these procedures when you are back at the fob the bottom line if it relates to the reason why you are detaining the individual then seize it or photograph it if safely possible photographs photograph anything that may be consid ered evidence weapons ammunition money detonators etc make sure to take photograph of detainees with the evidence this is must photographs need to establis h the location of the crime scene by including landmarks andor reference points if ever in doubt photograph it more is better then less make sure to include date time an d location when photographs were taken if you have digital camera set it up so th pictures will have the date and time on them note make sure it is the correct date and time bec ause if you have the wrong date and time it hurts the case and you may have to explain why the capture date is different take photographs as safely as possible above all safety comes first statements witness statements important in order to be witness you must actually have been there statements should be specific and answer the who what when where why and how who 1 list the names of all the detainees capt ured and their respective capture tag numbers 2 list at least five soldiers who actually w itnessed the event or actively participated in the raid if possible 4what how and why 1 describe how the events leading to the detainees capture occurred 2 explain what happened for example the detainees shot at coalition forces or weapons cache was found in the detainees home 3 if known state why the events occurred did the detainees admit why they acted or what their motives were when and where 1 record the date and time 2 note the nearest town and province and the street name in the town be specific do not just use the grid coordinate s the judges dont understand the grid coordinates for example on 23 n ovember 2005 at approximately 0400 hours near the city of fullajah which is located in anbar province make sure to get statements from at least three cf witnesses if possible dont confuse this with the listing of five soldiers in the who above also get statement from the detainee if he or she is willing to provide statement written statements should be obtained from the witnesses as soon as possible while the facts and circumstances are still fresh in their memories statements should include question and answ er after the narrativ if all of the who what when where why and how have not been answered all statements need to be closed out nd signed by the witne ss andor detainee remember to print on the forms and to ta ke the time to write legibly lot of different people will be relying on that statement in the future remember to take your time and address the details of the event in your statement so that the people reading your statement will have bett er understanding of what happened remember to list all the detainees captured by name and capture tag for example if there are two target houses make sure you xplain which detainees were captured in which target house refer to the example in appendix b page b1 apprehension form correct contact information for the unit is must providing the following contact information for all witnesses capture tag numbers dates grids name of closet town or city name of province and any other pertinent information on the detainee disposition and location of ll detainees being transferred 5 when the unit will be redeploying and new contact information refer to example in appendix b page b2 and b3 evidenceproperty custody document da form 4137 all blocks must be filled out exceptions be specific when describing the evidence include model serial numbers and any other identifying marks maintain proper chain of custody ever yone who handles the evidence must be listed on the da form 4137 the person who collected the evidence should be the first name in the released by block on the form use only block style lettering ex cept in the signature block refer to the example in appendix b page b4 evidence inventory form the arabicenglish inventory document should indicate exactly what has been seized from each detainees vehiclehousepropert yperson and contain section for the detainees acknowledging signature or refusal to sign units should complete the inventory docum ent as soon as possible and have the detainee sign immediately preferably at the scene get phot ographs of detainee signing the document if possible refer to the example in appendix b page b5 diagrams diagramssketches reference where the detainees were f ound in relation to the crime scene reference landmarks cities villa ges and key points of interest show where the evidence was found estimate distances in meters diagram should support your photographs 6 the diagram or sketch can be hand drawn use simple words and phrases for example road instead of ms tampa this is your chance to show the inve stigative hearing judge what happened refer to the example in appendix b page b6 and b7 other important points what to seize and do on the objective seize all weapons computers cell phones money and documents remember to take all forms of identification for ex ample id cards passports etc secure the material in sealed contai ner eg plastic bag marked with the date time name rank and unit of the person who seized it handle all material in forensically correct manner eg minimal handling with gloves by the edges all explosives should be destroyed by eod remember to photograph the detainee with the evidence seized photographs of the detainee with the evidence on the objective is preferred but they can be taken at the fob remember to conduct explosive testing on the detainees the testing may be conducted on or off the objective photograph the testing if possible vapor trace is the preferred method of xplosive testing by the iraqi court system and by the combined review and release board dealing with money money keeps the insurgents in business take away the money and you take away most insurgent activity seize and bag all cash checks check books money ledgers pocket litter and all sensitive items the noncurrency items money ledgers or bank books may help the s2 shop find out how the insurgents obtain their weapons or explosives in other words what looks like trash to you may be solid gold to the intelligence folks make sure you accurately document and account for the currency you recover for example if you find lot of united states currency you should write down the serial numbers however there is need to do this for iraqi currency but remember to photograph it 7determining the detainees identity remember to seize all identification cards and passports these documents will be used to determine the individuals identity at trial and whether or not the indivi dual is juvenile you also need to take close up

if you are unsure of what needs to be done dont be afra id to ask following types of law enforcement agencies for help military police security for ces master of arms navy osi or cid agents or your legal office for help if th resources are located at your fob we all want to ensure that the detainees stay behind bars if they are security threat the chain of custody begins when an item of evidence is collected by any coalition forces member evidence will doubt be passed from person to person and even unit to unit during the course of an investigation and subsequent trial the written chronological record of transa ctions of this type is the chain of custody each person who takes physical control over evidence must be identified as part of the evidence chain correct identification of ev idence is accomplished when the coalition force member who initially takes custody of the evidence promptly marks and tags the items of evidence evidence should be inscribed with the initia ls of the collector and military date and time place the marking so as not to destroy any latent h idden characteristics reduce the function of the object devalue it common sense and an understa nding of how the evidence relates to the commission of the crime will dictate where and how to mark the evidence when an item of evidence cannot be marked without marring or destroying evidentiary characteristics it is placed in suitable contai ner sealed and marked for identification an evidence tag further serves to identify the evidence remember to put the detainees name capture tag number date of capture capturing unit and other relevant information on the evidence tag it is good if it cant be matched to the detainee at later date evidence should be packaged and wrappe d to minimize friction and to prevent shifting breaking leaking or contact with other evidence items such as ammunition bullets cartridge cases tablets and capsules which are particularly susceptible to breaking marring or other destructive changes should be packed in cotton or soft paper items that contain stains such as clothing with stains of blood or other body fluids should not be placed in airtight plastic containers sweating and moisture accumulation may occur within such containers contaminating the evidence such items must be dry before packaging this cau tion also applies to fingerprint evidence a2 appendix a2 when evidence is to be examined for finge rprints each item of evidence should be packed in manner that prevents damage to the fingerprints this is accomplished by fastening the object in the container so that it will not shift and so that other objects will not come in contact with the area s of the object suspected of containing fingerprints with the exception of explosives oils and gasoline liquid evidence should be packed in sterile allglass bottles or other containers nd sealed with wax or other suitable materials in general small solid items such as fibers hairs paint scrapings powder powder patterns and threads should be placed on separate pieces of plain paper fold each piece of paper and pack it in pill or pow der box paper container or druggist fold seal the container with adhesive tape wax or ot her suitable material documents exemplars standards strings tw ine and rope should be placed in an inner cellophane envelope and an outer man ila
