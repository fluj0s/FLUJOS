john f sargent specialist in science and technology policy resources science and industry division the national nanotechnology initiative overview reauthorization and appropriations issues summary nanotechnology term encompassing the science engineering and applications of submicron materials involves the harnessing of unique physical chemical and biological properties of nanoscale substances in fundamentally new and useful ways the economic and societal promise of nanotechnology has led to substantial and sustained investments by governments and companies around the world in 2000 the united states launched the worlds first national nanotechnology program since then the federal government has invested more than 8 billion in nanoscale science engineering and technology through the us national nanotechnology initiative nni us companies and state governments have invested billions more as result of this focus and these investments the united states has in the view of many experts emerged as global leader in nanotechnology however the competition for global leadership in nanotechnology is intensifying as countries and companies around the world increase their investments nanotechnologys complexity and intricacies early stage of development with commercial payoff possibly years away and broad scope of potential applications engender wide range of public policy issues maintaining us technological and commercial leadership in nanotechnology poses variety of technical and policy challenges including development of technologies that will enable commercial scale manufacturing of nanotechnology materials and products environmental health and safety ehs concerns and maintenance of public confidence in its safety congress established programs assigned responsibilities and initiated research and development rd related to these issues in the 21st century nanotechnology research and development act of 2003 pl 108153 while many provisions of this act have sunset provision fy2008 is the last year of agency authorizations included in the act consideration may be given to reauthorization of this act in 2008 proponents of the nni assert that nanotechnology is one of the most important emerging and enabling technologies and that us competitiveness technological leadership national security and societal interests require an aggressive approach to the development and commercialization of nanotechnology critics of the nni voice concerns that reflect disparate underlying beliefs some critics assert that the government is not doing enough to move technology from the laboratory into the marketplace others argue that the magnitude of the public investment may skew what should be marketbased decisions in research development and commercialization still other critics say that the inherent risks of nanotechnology are not being addressed in timely or effective manner from the nnis inception through fy2008 congress has

nanotechnology initiative overview reauthorization and appropriations issues introduction nanotechnology has been an issue of interest to congress for number of years coming into focus in 2000 with the launch of the us national nanotechnology initiative nni by president clinton in his fy2001 budget request to congress since then congress has appropriated more than 8 billion for nanotechnology research and development rd these efforts have been directed at advancing understanding and control of matter at the nanoscale1 where the physical chemical and biological properties of materials differ in fundamental and useful ways from the properties of individual atoms or bulk matter2 the development and application of nanotechnology more fully explained below across wide array of products and industries holds the potential for significant economic and societal benefits to capture these benefits the united states will have to effectively address variety of technical and policy challenges that stand as potential barriers to commercialization including environmental health and safety concerns and their implications for workplace environmental food and drug regulations development of standards reference materials and consistent nomenclature development of new measurement methods and tools effective technology transfer to the private sector protection of intellectual property availability affordability and patience of investment capital ethical legal and societal concerns public understanding support and acceptance and development of worldclass scientific and technical nanotechnology workforce in 2003 congress passed the 21st century nanotechnology research and development act pl 108153 providing legislative foundation for some of the activities of the nni authorizing agency funding levels through fy2008 and intended to address several of these challenges discussions are underway with respect to the possible reauthorization of this act in 2008 congress may use this opportunity to further address these issues and to establish authorization levels for agency nanotechnology rd alternatively congress may choose to address these issues in separate legislation several bills were introduced in the first session of the 110th congress to address specific nanotechnology issues 1 in the context of the nni and nanotechnology the nanoscale refers to dimension of 1 to 100 nanometers see box below 2 while extensive rd has been and continues to be conducted to understand and harness the properties of individual atoms this is not the domain of nanotechnology crs2 this report provides an overview of nanotechnology the national nanotechnology initiative possible reauthorization of the 21st century nanotechnology research and development act

rd it is estimated to account for only about quarter of global annual public investments4 global investments in nanotechnology already have begun to yield economic benefits as products incorporating nanotechnology enter the marketplace these products are estimated to have produced 50 billion in revenues in 20065 by tapping the unique properties that emerge at the nanoscale proponents maintain that nanotechnology holds the potential for products that could transform existing industries and create new ones clean and protect the environment extend and improve the quality of our lives and strengthen the national security most nanotechnology products currently on the market such as faster computer processors higher density memory devices lighterweight auto parts stainresistant clothing antibiotic bandages cosmetics and clear sunscreen are evolutionary in nature offering incremental improvements in characteristics such as performance aesthetics cost size and weight evolutionary nanotechnology products however represent only small fraction of what many see as the substantial longerterm economic and societal promise of nanotechnology one estimate projects nanotechnology product revenues will reach 26 trillion6 by 2014 or 15 of global manufacturing output while another estimates global revenues will reach 295 trillion by 2015 of which almost half will come from semiconductors7 8 many nanotechnology advocates including business executives scientists engineers medical professionals and venture capitalists assert that in the longer term nanotechnology

development activities though federal nanoscale science engineering and technology rd had been underway for over decade the nni was first initiated as presidential technology initiative in 200021 the original participating agencies were the national science foundation nsf the department of defense dod the department of energy doe the department of commerces doc national institute of standards and

activities president bush has requested 1527 billion for the nni in fy2009 in 2003 congress provided statutory foundation for some of the activities of the nni through the 21st century nanotechnology research and development act of 2003 pl 108153 the act established national nanotechnology program nnp and provided authorizations for subset of the nni agencies namely the nsf doe nasa nist and environmental protection agency epa the act however did not address the participation of several agencies that fund nanotechnology rd under the nni including dod nih and the department of homeland security dhs nevertheless coordination of nanotechnology rd activities across all nni funding agencies continues under the national science and technology councils nstcs nanoscale science engineering and technology nset subcommittee22 according to the nset subcommittees 2004 nni strategic plan for continuity and to capture this broader participation the coordinated federal activities as whole will continue to be referred to as the national nanotechnology initiative accordingly the functions and activities established under the act are incorporated into the executive branchs implementation of the nni while many provisions of this act have sunset provision fy2008 is the last year of agency authorizations included in the act discussions are underway regarding the potential reauthorization of this act in 2008 the thrust of the nni has primarily been the development of fundamental scientific knowledge through basic research investments at mission agencies such as dod have supported nanotechnology applications development for which they are primary customer other investments have supported infrastructural technologies for example nist has contributed to developing tools and standards that enable measurement and control of matter at the nanoscale thereby supporting the conduct of rd and the ability to manufacture nanoscale materials and products as understanding of nanotechnology has matured the nni has worked with variety of industry organizations to facilitate the movement of research results from the laboratory bench to the marketplace in fields as disparate as semiconductors chemicals energy concrete and forest products the nni agencies also have begun to address research needs and regulatory issues related to environmental health and safety issues as well as issues such as public understanding and workforce education and training the nni agencies actively engage in variety of international fora such as the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd and the international standards 22 prior to pl 108153 the bob stump defense authorization act for fiscal year 2003 pl 107314 required dod to provide for interagency cooperation and collaboration on nanoscale research and development the nset subcommittee is subcommittee of the nstc committee on technology crs7 organization iso to cooperatively address nanotechnology issues related to ehs metrology23 and standards nomenclature and nanoscale materials characterization maintaining us leadership poses variety of technical economic and policy challenges including safeguarding the environment and ensuring human health and safety creating the standards reference materials nomenclature methods and tools for metrology to enable the manufacturing of nanoscale materials and products developing worldclass scientific and technical nanotechnology workforce translating research results into products including effective technology transfer to the private sector understanding public perceptions and attitudes and fostering public understanding addressing ethical legal and societal implications protecting intellectual property securing investment capital for earlystage research development and commercialization and fostering and facilitating international cooperation and coordination proponents of the nni assert that nanotechnology is one of the most important emerging and enabling technologies24 and that us competitiveness technological leadership national security and societal interests require an aggressive approach to the development and commercialization of nanotechnology critics of the nni hold variety of competing views asserting that government is not doing enough is doing too much or is moving too quickly some in industry have criticized the nni for being overly focused on basic research and not being aggressive enough in moving nnifunded rd out of government and university laboratories and into industry others in industry have criticized the federal government for not providing mechanisms to help advance nanotechnology rd to the point where it becomes economically viable for venture capitalists corporations and other investors to create products and bring them to 23 metrology is the science of measurement including the equipment and processes used to produce measurement 24 the department of commerce characterizes emerging and enabling technologies as those that offer wide breadth of potential application and form an important technical basis for future commercial applications atp rule 15 cfr part 295 crs8 market some refer to this gap as the valley of death25 still others in industry have criticized the nni for not adequately supporting the development of metrology standards equipment and processes necessary to manufacture nanotechnology materials products and systems at commercial scale conversely supporters of industrydriven market investments contend that extensive government support for nanotechnology may supplant the judgment of the marketplace by picking winners and losers in technological development for example the size and directions of the nni investments may encourage industry to follow the governments lead rather than independently selecting rd directions itself or alternatively may result in the promotion of less effective technology path over more effective one these supporters also assert that federal government funding of scientific research is often wasteful driven by political considerations and not scientific merit26 some nongovernmental organizations ngo are critical of nanotechnology for its potential adverse impacts on human health and safety and on the environment they assert that the government is pushing ahead too quickly in developing nanotechnology and encouraging its commercialization and use without adequately investing in research focused on understanding and mitigating negative ehs implications27 they argue that the very characteristics that make nanotechnology promising also present significant potential risks to human health and safety and the environment some of these critics argue for application of the precautionary principle which holds that regulatory action may be required to control potentially hazardous substances even before causal link has been established by scientific 25 the term valley of death is used by business executives economists and venture capitalists to describe the development gap that often exists between laboratory discovery and the markets willingness to invest to advance the discovery to final commercial product this gap occurs due to variety of issues such as technical risk market uncertainty and likelihood of obtaining an adequate return on investment 26 crews clyde wayne jr washingtons

still account for the vast majority of nni funding 983 in fy2008 some of the nnis activities were codified and further defined in the 21st century nanotechnology research and development act of 2003 which was passed by congress in november 2003 on december 3 2003 the act was signed into law pl 108153 by president bush37 the legislation received strong bipartisan support in both the house of representatives which passed the bill on recorded vote of 40519 and in the senate which passed the bill by unanimous consent though this act is often referred to as the enabling legislation for the national nanotechnology initiative the act actually establishes national nanotechnology program nnp the act provides authorizations for five nni agencies the national science foundation department of energy nasa national institute of standards and technology and environmental protection agency but not for the department of defense national institutes of health department of homeland security38 or other nni research agencies that collectively accounted for 46 of nni funding in fy2003 the act created the nnp for the purposes of establishing the goals priorities and metrics for evaluation of federal nanotechnology research development and other activities investing in federal rd programs in nanotechnology and related sciences to achieve those goals and providing for interagency coordination of federal nanotechnology research development and other activities undertaken pursuant to the nnp 35 nni participants include agencies that either conduct or provide funding for nanotechnology rd as well as agencies with missions that may affect the development commercialization and use of nanotechnology for example in the latter case the food and drug administration may regulate or not regulate nanotechnology products the us patent and trademark offices uspto treatment of nanotechnologyrelated patents may affect the value of the underlying intellectual property and the execution of the missions of the departments of education and labor could affect the preparedness of the us workforce for emerging nanotechnology jobs some nanotechnology rd agencies may also have nonrd missions related to nanotechnology for example epa conducts and funds rd but also has regulatory mission that could affect nanotechnology research development production use andor disposal 36 us

interdisciplinary research and education centers networks and user facilities the centers and user facilities are located at universities and federal laboratories across the country centers and networks provide opportunities and support for multidisciplinary research among investigators from variety of disciplines and research sectors including academia industry and government laboratories such multidisciplinary research not only can lead to advances in knowledge but also may foster relationships that further the development of basic research results into devices and other applications many agencies support such centers examples of federal and federally supported centers include the national science foundation has established universitybased centers focused exclusively on nanotechnology including 15 nanoscale science and engineering centers nsec one engineering research center one science and technology center four materials research science and engineering centers two nanoscale science and engineering education centers and five nanoscale science and engineering networks59 the nih has established more than 20 centers including eight universitybased nanomedicine

nstc to develop an nni strategic plan every three years this plan is to guide the programs activities to meet the goals priorities and anticipated outcomes of the participating agencies in addition the act requires the triennial report to address how the program intends to move results out of the laboratory and into application for the benefit of society its plan for longterm funding for interdisciplinary rd and the allocation of funding for interagency projects the 2007 strategic plan is the first to follow external assessments by the national academies and pcast operating as the nnap and seeks to incorporate the findings of these reviews of particular note the 2007 national nanotechnology initiative strategic plan includes new chapter on highimpact application opportunities and critical research needs possibly indicating an effort on the part of the administration to move the nni toward more directed research with commercial and societal benefits much of the early nni work has been focused on basic research and mechanisms by which such research may produce economic and societal dividends seven years into the nni the program is under increasing scrutiny to deliver

smarter computers more energyefficient transportation and energy security the 2007 national nanotechnology initiative strategic plan split the societal dimensions pca into two separate pcas environmental health and safety and education and societal dimensions this change responds to increased congressional and public attention to ehs needs some critics of the nni had raised concerns that the inclusion of investments in education and other societal dimensions in the broader category obscured and artificially inflated the perception of investments in ehs rd the plan also identifies four

science and technology to serve as the nnap by issuing executive order 13349 amending executive order 13226 to designate the presidents council of advisors on science and technology to serve as the national nanotechnology advisory panel 70 matter of size triennial review of the national nanotechnology initiative national research council 2006 crs29 investments the nrc attributed much of this success to effective communication and coordination by the nset subcommittee and the nnco recommendations here are the recommendations made by the nrc followed by discussion of each nrc recommendation the federal government should sustain investments in manner that balances the pursuit of shorterterm goals with support for longerterm rd and that ensures robust supporting infrastructure broadly defined supporting longterm research effectively will require making new funds available that do not come at the expense of muchneeded ongoing investment in us physical sciences and engineering research president bush has expressed support for increasing federal rd funding for the physical sciences and engineering most notably in his american competitiveness initiative which includes nanotechnology investments yet as federal non discretionary spending growth increases pressure on federal discretionary spending finding new funds to support longterm nanotechnology research may need to come from other scientific disciplines nrc recommendation the federal government should establish an independent advisory panel with specific operational expertise in nanoscale science and engineering management of research centers facilities and partnerships and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate cuttingedge research on and effective and responsible development of nanotechnology in july 2004 president george w bush implemented the provision of the 21st century nanotechnology research and development act to establish or designate national nanotechnology advisory panel by issuing executive order 13349 which amends executive order 13226 designating the presidents council of advisors on science and technology to serve as the nnap the nrcs recommendation suggests that the presidents designation of pcast to serve as the legislatively mandated national nanotechnology advisory panel is not fully adequate critics of the use of pcast to serve as the nnap maintain that the scope and depth of expertise needed to provide effective guidance on the nni requires an independent panel of people with nanotechnology and interdisciplinaryspecific expertise and an undivided focus supporters of the use of pcast for this function assert that single advisory panel provides an integrated perspective reduces unnecessary cost and management burdens and that expertise can be added to the panel or accessed through nonmember technical advisory groups nrc recommendation federal agencies participating in the nni in consultation with the nnco and the office of management and budget should continue to develop and enhance crs30 means for consistent tracking and reporting of funds requested authorized and expended annually the current set of pcas provides an appropriate initial template for such tracking it is difficult to assess and track funding for specific purposes within the nni because the initiative is not centrally funded and operated the nni budget is an aggregation of the nanotechnologyrelated activities of the participating federal agencies congress funds the nnirelated rd on an agencybyagency basis with responsibilities crossing many authorizing committees and appropriations subcommittees thus while it is relatively straightforward to quantify an agencys nanotechnology budget tracking all nni investments related to particular activity ehsrelated research for example is much more difficult the pcas serve to provide such tracking mechanism in addition according to the 2007 national nanotechnology initiative strategic plan the division of the societal dimensions pca into two pcas environmental health and safety and educational and societal dimensions is intended to better understand and manage the nni investment such change indicates level of flexibility that may enable the executive branch and congress to more effectively manage and balance investments in discrete areas of the nni nrc recommendation the nset subcommittee should carry out or commission study on the feasibility of developing metrics to quantify the return to the us economy from the federal investment in nanotechnology rd the study should draw on the department of commerces expertise in economic analysis and its existing ability to poll us industry among the activities for which metrics should be developed and relevant data collected are technology transfer and commercial development of nanotechnology few efforts have been made within the federal government to understand the economic impacts of the nations investments in the nni identification and tracking of data that could serve as an indicator of success in commercializing nanotechnology research or the effects on us job creation or retention has not been formalized to the extent that federal assessments of the economic contribution of andor potential for nanotechnology products have occurred they have not been performed with analytical rigor although the commerce department retains its economic analysis expertise resident primarily in the economics and statistics administrations bureau of economic analysis the departments technology administration which led commerces nni activities and had governmentwide responsibilities for technology transfer activities was eliminated in august 200771 prior to its elimination the technology administration contracted for two studies that could contribute to addressing this nrc recommendation an analysis of barriers to nanotechnology commercialization performed by the university of illinois at springfield and an analysis of innovation metrics conducted by the alliance for science and technology 71 the technology administration was eliminated in the america competes act pl 11069 crs31 research in america astra these reports are publicly available at commerce department websites72 nrc recommendation research on the environmental health and safety effects of nanotechnology should be expanded assessing the effects of engineered nanomaterials on public health and the environment requires that the research conducted be welldefined and reproducible and that effective methods be developed and applied to 1 estimate the exposure of humans wildlife and other ecological receptors to source material 2 assess effects on human health and ecosystems of both occupational and environmental exposure and 3 characterize assess and manage the risks associated with exposure while the nrc asserts the need for additional ehs research it does not quantify how much more is needed clayton teague director of the nnco has testified that the current level of investment in ehs research is adequate73 many critics from academia industry and nonprofit organizations have argued strongly that the nni needs greater level of investment in ehs research74 these critics argue from variety of perspectives including the need to protect workers human health and the environment create public faith and confidence in the safety of nanotechnology products prevent problem with one specific nanotechnology product from resulting in loss of public support for all nanotechnology rd and create predictable and stable regulatory environment this last factor is deemed by some as critical to fostering future nanotechnology investments 72 barriers to nanotechnology commercialization college of business management

working group on education and the workforce that engages the department of education and department of labor as active participants the nset subcommittee has sought with limited success greater involvement of the departments of education and labor in the subcommittees activities an nset subcommittee working group on education and the workforce has not yet been established with advocates promising the creation of many new jobs some assert millions as result of global nanotechnology investments some have expressed concern that the country must prepare students for nanotechnology research engineering and production jobs75 assessing which industries are likely to create such jobs which skills will be needed and in what timeframe are key challenges if workers with nanotechnologyspecific skills are needed and workers are available domestically us citizens resident aliens or those in the united states on work visas potential employers may opt to establish or move operations outside the united states to tap workers with those skills abroad conversely if students are trained for jobs that do not emerge or do not emerge in the same timeframe as students are entering the job market this investment is lost in addition potential students may be discouraged from pursuing future nanotechnologyrelated studies close coordination among the departments of commerce education and labor might help to align federal education and training efforts better with the labor market for nanotechnology workers the 21st century nanotechnology rd act also directed the nrc to address two other issues in its first triennial report is molecular self assembly feasible for manufacturing of materials and devices at the nanoscale and what are the needs for standards guidelines or strategies for ensuring the responsible development of nanotechnology molecular selfassembly selfassembly is the process by which components atoms molecules or more complex structures form without external control or direction an organized structure for example water molecules dispersed in air in cold temperatures can selfassemble to form snowflakes our bodies act as selfassemblers producing variety of cells as needed eg to repair damage to the skin or produce new blood cells from added nutrients to what extent can molecular selfassembly be used as tool for nanomanufacturing on this issue the nrc concluded that molecular selfassembly is feasible for the manufacture of simple materials and devices however for the manufacture of more sophisticated materials and devices including complex objects produced in large quantities the nrc found it unlikely that simple selfassembly 75 phillip j bond under secretary for technology us department of commerce remarks

october 2004 crs33 processes will yield the desired results one major barrier cited is the probability of error during assembly as result of the systems complexity standards guidelines and strategies for ensuring responsible development of nanotechnology the nrc concluded that it is not possible yet to make rigorous assessment of the level of environmental and health risks posed by engineered nanomaterials and called for further development of risk assessment protocols the nrc report also stated that the need for more ehs data requires an expanded research effort to complement dialog on these issues in addition until reproducible and wellcharacterized ehs data are available to inform the development of rigorous riskbased guidelines and best practices the nrc found it prudent to recommend use of precautionary measures to protect the health and safety of workers the public and the environment the nrc report also stressed that addressing the ethical and societal impacts of nanotechnology will require an integrated approach among scientists engineers social scientists toxicologists policymakers and the public the national nanotechnology initiative at five years assessment and recommendations of the national nanotechnology advisory panel presidents council of advisors on science and technology76 this report presents the findings of the first biennial review of the nni by the presidents council of advisors on science and technologys acting as the national nanotechnology advisory panel as mandated by the 21st century nanotechnology rd act of 2003 pcast submitted its first report to the president on may 16 2005 titled the national nanotechnology initiative at five years assessment and recommendations of the national nanotechnology advisory panel the second report was due in 2007 but has yet to be completed the pcast report finds that the united states is the acknowledged leader in nanotechnology rd but the us leadership position is under increasing competitive pressure from growing public and private investments around the world the report states that the federal investment in the nni has been wellspent the united states is wellpositioned to maintain global leadership going forward and continued robust funding is important for longterm us economic wellbeing and national security this assessment of the us leadership position is founded not on sales growth or market share of commercial products common measures of global competitiveness for established products but rather on metrics that may serve as early indicators of potential innovation such as the us share of scientific publications and patents the use of such metrics may not be universally accepted as predictive of leadership position technological leadership or even leadership in innovation does not ensure that the economic benefits from such leadership will accrue to the united states companies may choose to manufacture products or conduct other valueadded activities outside the united states if the assessment of national competitiveness is expanded to include the valueadded activities and jobs 76 the national nanotechnology initiative at five years assessment and recommendations of the national nanotechnology advisory panel presidents council of advisors on science and technology may 2005 crs34 generated or retained within the united states then the metrics for assessing leadership might change the pcast report acknowledges that there are potential environmental and health risks associated with nanotechnology but finds that the nni is directing appropriate attention and adequate resources to the research that will ensure the protection of the public and the environment nanotechnology products should not be immune from regulation according to the report but such regulation must be rational and based on science not on perceived fears the pcast report states that strong communication exists among the nni agencies responsible for research and regulation the pcast report contains four recommendations for the nni pcast recommendation to further facilitate technology transfer from the lab to the marketplace the nni should expand its interaction with industry increase federalstate coordination and improve knowledge management of and access to nni assets such as user facilities and instrumentation the nset subcommittees national innovation and liaison with industry nili working group was established to facilitate nni interactions with industry and with state and local nanotechnology initiatives the nili working groups limited resources and agency participation have hindered its ability to conduct more extensive and sustained outreach77 due to the structure and resource allocation of the nni the initiatives engagements with industry and with state and local initiatives are largely limited to single agency or laboratory interactions and to public engagement activities such as speeches and information on the nni website78 pcast recommendation the nni should continue its efforts to understand the possible toxicological effects of nanotechnology and where harmful human or environmental effects are proven pertinent federal agencies should apply appropriate regulatory mechanisms there should be strong interagency and international collaboration on this issue to eliminate unnecessary duplication of research efforts and to ensure wide dissemination of information since exposure to nanomaterials is most likely to occur during the manufacturing process research on potential hazards associated with workplace exposure must be given the highest priority with respect to collaboration on ehs issues the nset subcommittees national environmental and health implications nehi working group is the primary ehs coordination mechanism for participating nni agencies the global issues in nanotechnology gin working group works with the nehi working group on international collaboration on ehs issues the niosh has published several documents addressing concerns about workplace exposure to nanoparticles approaches to safe nanotechnology an information exchange with niosh was 77 private telephone and email communication with sean murdock executive director of the nanobusiness alliance february 4 2008 78 ibid crs35 intended to provide the best currently available knowledge on nanoparticle toxicity and control and to solicit input from the stakeholder community79 progress toward safe nanotechnology in the workplace details the work of nioshs nanotechnology research center from 2004 through 200680 in december 2007 niosh released interim guidance concerning the medical screening of workers potentially exposed to engineered nanoparticles during the manufacture and industrial use of nanomaterials the niosh says that the document is intended to generate discussion fill the current knowledge gap and provide interim recommendations until further scientific information becomes available81 the niosh is currently seeking public comment on this guidance with respect to regulatory issues associated with nanotechnology see crs report rl34332 engineered nanoscale materials and derivative products regulatory challenges by lindajo schierow pcast recommendation the nni should establish relationships with the department of education and department of labor to develop education and training systems to support the nations technical proficiency in areas related to nanotechnology the pcast reports recommendation is similar to the recommendation made by the nrc and is discussed earlier in this paper pcast recommendation the nni must support research aimed at understanding the societal implications of nanotechnology including ethical economic and legal implications and must actively work to inform the public about nanotechnology the nni should continue to confront societal issues in an open straightforward and sciencebased manner some critics of the nni hold deep reservations about the ethical economic and legal implications of nanotechnology some of these concerns are common to many technologies such as the allocation of risk and benefit during manufacturing for example neighborhood located near production facility may bear risks associated with exposure to the byproducts or products of manufacturing while gaining few of the benefits concerns about possible adverse effects of nanoscale particles on human health and the environment resulting from their small particle size and unique characteristics may result in increased attention to such costs and benefits with 79 approaches to safe nanotechnology an information exchange with niosh national institute for occupational safety and health july 2006 80 progress toward safe nanotechnology in the workplace national institute for occupational safety and health june 2007 81 niosh update niosh draft offers interim guidance on medical screening of workers potentially exposed to engineered nanoparticles national institute for occupational safety and health december 13 2007 crs36 respect to nanoscale material production currently nanotechnology ehs risks are unknown and may be acute or pose more risk than other manufacturing processes privacy rights are another issue associated with the products of nanotechnology nanotechnology may enable the production of highly sensitive inexpensive sensors that could be deployed ubiquitously in commercial and public settings while these sensors may allow checkoutfree purchases from stores or monitor the environment for toxic substances critics argue that they could also impinge on the privacy rights of individuals if for example the sensors could detect chemicals related to the use of tobacco alcohol or illegal substances without the permission of the individual such information might be later applied in law enforcement life insurance health insurance or employment decisions82 others express concern that the economically disadvantaged and less educated both individuals and nations might be unable to take part in the benefits that nanotechnology products could offer83 on the legal front innovations in nanotechnology are already presenting unique challenges to the us patent and trademark uspto for example us case law generally prohibits patenting where the sole element of novelty is change in size the characteristic most obviously associated with nanotechnology84 in addition many nanotechnology innovations involve multiple disciplines since the uspto structure for examining patents is disciplinebased an examiner may not have all of the requisite expertise for the examination affecting both their ability to conduct the examination and the speed at which it can be done uspto also has acknowledged the need to accelerate the speed of nanotechnologyrelated patent applications according to john doll commissioner of patents the agency is hampered in its ability to recruit and retain patent examiners with the requisite skills to handle nanotechnology patents given the more generous offers patent examiners get from the private sector85 doll said that efforts have been made to improve hiring and retention at uspto and that new processes has been established allowing an accelerated examination of applications86 82 moore fiona m implications of nanotechnology
