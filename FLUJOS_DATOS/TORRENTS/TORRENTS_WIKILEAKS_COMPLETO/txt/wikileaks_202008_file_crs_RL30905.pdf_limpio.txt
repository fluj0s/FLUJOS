divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30905federal research and development budgeting and prioritysetting 19932000 summary during his two administrations president clinton linked research and development rd to economic growth and sought partnerships between govern ment and business in research and innovation in contrast to the two previous administrations which increased defense rd relative to civilian rd the clinton administration sought to reduce defense rd funding and to increase funding for civilian rd including at the national institutes of health nih the national science foundation nsf and for environmental research the republican majority priorities during the 104th to 106th congresses stressed in large part deficit reduction deregulation and tax incentives to foster marketdriven innovation and support for civilian basic research and defense rd as governmental functions both president clintons and congresss rd priorities reflected moves to balance the budget as result in terms of constant dollars that is inflationadjusted dollars of budg et authority federal rd was funded below the previous high funding level fy1992 for each year from fy1993 to fy1999 during this period pressures mounted to raise funding for rd programs as budget surpluses started to grow beginning in 1997 congress circumvented or raised caps imposed on the discretionary portion of the federal budget and as result major rd funding increases were made in the fy1998 to fy2001 budget cycles in constant dollars fy2001 funding for nondefense rd was 28 higher than for fy1993 while fy2001 defense rd was 6 less than for fy1993 civilian rd increases were led by nih whose rd budget grew 72 in constant dollars between these two years followed by increases for rd at nsf at 40 the commerce department 22 the environmental protection agency 20 the agriculture department 16 and the national aeronautics and space administration 2 between fy1993 and fy2001 the energy departments rd budget was cut 7 in constant dollars fy2001 appropriations action funded defense and nondefense rd at about the same dollar amount for the first time since 1977 debates about prioritysetting for rd included increasing rd in nonhealth related fields to the same extent as in the health sciences fields coordinating federal agency rd budgets to promote national needs as well as support of cuttingedge science and ensuring accountability for rd spending special studies and caucuses dealing with science policy were initiated in the hous and senate in 1998 the house passed resolution endorsing the science policy study conducted by congressman vernon ehlers the senate passed bill that would have increased future rd by specified minimum percentages required the president to develop coordinated rd budget and enhanced rd accountability potential issues during the 107th congress could include whether rd funding increases will be maintained in the face of potential tax cuts and economic slowdown funding

crs issue brief 94009 which chronicled rd budgeting and prioritysetting activities from 1994 to 2000 presidential prioritysetting since it started funding large amounts of rd after world war ii the federal government has always supported core fields of science but the focus in rd budg ets has changed in response to policy shifts congressional concerns and presidential prerogatives during the 1970s interest focused on space rd growth in energy and health research and reductions in defense rd rd in the department of defense dod and defense rd in the department of energy doe in fy1978 nonfederal sources largely industry started to eclipse the federal government as source of rd funding support for defense rd and for basic research became prominent during the 1980s with the administrations of presidents ronald reagan and president george bush1 energy research and space research funding declined in fy1989 near the end of the reagan administration about 65 of federal rd funding went to defense rd rd in dod and defense rd in doe and near the end of the bush administration in fy1993 defense rd received about 57 of federal rd funding for details see figures 1 and 2 and

1993 limits on discretionary spendingthe part of the budget from which most rd is funded later in 1997 the president and congress agreed on balanced budget bill that capped discretionary spending through fy2002 because of the spending caps imposed by congress rd programs increasingly competed with funding for other discretionary programs as discretionary spending was projected to decline from 37 of total outlays in fy1999 to about 30 in fy2002 thus rd funding vied even more than it had in the past with programs for public infrastructure housing discretionary social services programs and

congresses were subject to caps which continued to be applied even as the economy started to rebound and budgetary surpluses started to grow beginning in 1997 because of wide congressional support for rd starting in 1996 congress despite the pressure of caps began to give rd funding higher priority in 1996 congress appropriated 18 more for fy1997 rd than the president had requested this pattern of congressional increases continued in succeeding years in addition rd funding started to increase over each previous year in terms of constant dollars beginning with fy1997 for fy1999 and fy2000 congress used emergency spending authority to circumvent budget caps in many areas and as one result federal rd appropriations were increased for fy2001 congress utilizing cbo forecasts of additional surpluses raised the discretionary caps to about 100 billion above the existing cap and above what the president had requested paving the way for major increases in rd appropriations for fy2001

these tables report outlays for each fiscal year outlays according to the congressional quarterlys american congressional dictionary are amounts of government spending they consist of payments usually by check or in cash to liquidate obligations incurred in prior fiscal years as well as in the current year including the net lending of funds under budget authority in federal budget accounting net outlays are calculated by subtracting the amounts of refunds and various kinds of reimbursements to the government from actual spending continuedbillion constant dollars considerable pressure was applied by nonbiomedical scientists and their supporters during the fy1999 to fy2001 appropriation cycles to balance funding among fields of science and among rd agencies while increasing funding specifically they sought to increase funding for nonhealth civilian rd to keep pace with the steady and substantial increases that had been made in health rd the clinton administrations success at reducing defense rd and increasing civilian technologyoriented funding altered federal rd priorities for instance defense rd spending declined in constant dollars by 182 between fy1987 the peak year of funding for defense rd and fy2001 the percentage decline since the fy1993 budget the last bush budget and fy2001 the last clinton budget was 63 civilian rd spending increased about 28 in constant dollars between the fy1993 and fy2001 with the focus largely on biomedical research at nih the last democratic majority 103rd congress had reoriented some rd programs to focus more on projects which would generate econ omic benefits or contribute to strategic programs to solve problem or contribute to industrial capability this was reflected in large increases for technology transfer and development at nist and for clean car technology and highperformance computing programs the nsf and the nih emphasized strategic ie applicationsoriented research attempts were made by some leaders of the succeeding republicanled congresses beginning with the 104th congress to halt technology development and applicationsoriented research and to abolish some technologyoriented programs and agencies such as doe and the commerce department funding for basic research and especially for health research in nih typically has received considerable congressional priority federal rd is decreasing part of national rd spending in fy2000 federal rd funding was estimated to be higher in constant dollars of budget authority for the first time since the previous peak in fy1992 peak which was due largely to the reagan and previous bush administra tions defense rd buildups in terms of outlays the previous peak was in fy1990 which was estimated to have been surpassed for the first time since then in fy20 01 despite these increases rd funding decreased from about 12 of total federal outlays in 1965 during the buildup for the space program to about 44 today and from about 16 of budget authority in 1966 to about 129 in 20014 federal rd funding has alsohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30905crs7 4continued much of the data used in this report which come from the data series and analyses of the american association for the advancement of science aaas report rd funding in terms of budget authority which is the authority provided in law to enter into obligations that will result in immediate or future outlays of government funds government officials may obligate the government to make outlays only to the extent they have been granted budget authority the budget records budget authority as dollar amount in the year when it first becomes available office of management and budget the budget systems and concepts fiscal year 2001 p 9 aaas budget authority data which were used to develop tables 1 and 2 in this report show that the previous constant dollar high for rd spending occurred in 1992 not 1990 as omb reports using outlay data this was during the george bush administration omb data like aaas data show that in terms of constant dollars rd funding fell below this 1992 level for every succeeding year until fy2000 the omb data show that the fy1990 omb high year was not exceeded until fy2001 estimated while budget authority and outlays are not equal they provide internally consistent trend comparisons historical trends of outlays and budget authority provide similar conclusions note according to the congressional quarterlys american congressional dictiona ry obligations are defined as binding agreement by government agency to pay for goods products services studies and the like either immediately or in the future when an agency enters into such an agreement it incurs an obligation as the agency makes the required payments it liquidates the obligation appropriation laws usually make funds available for obligation for one or more fiscal years but do not require agencies to spend their funds during those specific years the actual outlays can occur years after the appropriation is obligated for example contract for payment for submarine when it is delivered in the future such obligated funds are often said to be in the pipeline under these circumstances an agencys outlays in particular year can come from appropriations obligated in previous years as well as from its currentyear appropriation consequently the money congress appropriates for fiscal year rarely coincides with the total amount of appropriated money the government will actually spend in that yeardecrea sed as percentage of discretionary outlays from about 17 of total discretionary

weapons and funding was increased in applied technology programs in nist in nsf for basic research facilities and instrumentation and in nih during 1995 congressional scrutiny of rd increased in response to budget pressures and efforts were made to deemphasize the governments role in civilian applications oriented rd and to focus more attention on basic research the republicanmajority 104th congress attempted to reduce programs of civilian technology development which many republicans traditionally oppose on the grounds that the private sector not the government should make marketrelated choices and share the risks and rewards pl 1046 and pl 10419 emergency supplemental appropriations acts rescinded an additional 243 billion in rd for fy1995 and fy1996 each year congress passes budget resolution which sets spending levels or caps for total spending and for each budget function that appropriations committees use in setting discretionary spending allocations called 302b allocations for each appropriations subcommittee the resolution also gives outyear projections based on current budget and economic assumptions and recommends priorities for spending the accompanying legislative report may include explanations of the amounts to be allocated by the committees that have jurisdiction over the programs in each budget function9 the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1996 hrept 104159 reflected serious budget pressures that would affect rd funding the american association for the advancement of science aaas calculated based on information in the budget

defines earmarks and limitation in appropriations bills as an annual appropriations act is generally made up of separate paragraphs each of which provides funding for specific agencies and programs generally each paragraph corresponds to unique account and provides appropriat ions for multiple projects and purposes as single lump sum earmarks and limitations are two devices regularly used in annual appropriations acts to restrict or more precisely direct the availability of funds for specific projects or purposes of an account sometimes an earmark or limitation may generate more interest or controversy than the total appropriation an earmark refers to funds set aside within an account for specified purpose sometimes earmark refers to any congressional setaside for specified program project activity institution or location at other times the term more narrowly refers to setasides for individual projects locations or institutions for example an appropriations bill including 100 million for construction account may set aside 10 million of the construction funds for particular project in addition to setting aside funds the earmark might also provide spending floors by stating that not less than 10 million must be used for the specified project some earmarks are included in the text of appropriations measures floor amendments and conference reports to such measures if enacted these earmarks are legally binding most earmarks however are included in the senate and house appropriations committees reports explaining measure as reported earmarks are also frequently

2000 government performance and results act of 1993 the government performance and results act pl 10362 is related to the issue of prioritysetting since the law requires agencies to define longterm goals set specific annual performance targets and report annually on performance the law is intended to ensure accountability for federal investments and to develop processes which ensure that an agencys programs and priorities meet its goals the law allows the use of qualitative measurement alternatives if quantitative methods can not be used this is especially salient to agencies that fund rd since they say it is difficult to define goals and priorities for many basic research program s and to measure the results quantitatively since research outcomes often can not be defined well in advance and accomplishments take long time to demonstrate and document the nstc committee on fundamental science in assessing fundamental science july 1996 and the federal research roundtable an

recommendation beginning in 1995 with the fy1996 budget request nstc started to identify major administration rd priorities and submitted budget requests that identified these as crosscutting budget initiatives whose rd activities were coordinated by nstc interagency committees the fy2001 initiatives which repre sented major administration priorities whose funding was highlighted in the
