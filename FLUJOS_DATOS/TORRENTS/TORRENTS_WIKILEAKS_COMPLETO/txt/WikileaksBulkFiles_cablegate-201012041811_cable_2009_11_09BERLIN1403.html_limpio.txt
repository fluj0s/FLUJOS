kpal kwbg gm subject scenesetter for secretary clintons visit to berlin november 810 classified by ambassador phillip murphy for reasons 14 bd 1 c summary embassy berlin warmly welcomes you to germany for the historic 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall berlin is hosting all fourpowers and eu leaders at berlins brandenburg gate to mark this occasion your visit includes meetings with chancellor merkel and foreign minister westerwelle chancellor merkel will likely raise concern about general motors november 3 decision to keep its german subsidiary opel and westerwelle may likely raise his interest in removal of nuclear weapons from germany you may wish to encourage from them assurances that the proposed afghanistan conference will not slip past january and that germany will go immediately to the bundestag if increases in contributions are warranted support for including banking and insurance relations with iran in calculations for possible new sanctions and backsliding on export controls assurances that germany and the eu will work with the us at copenhagen and not seek to isolate agreement to tone down the public rhetoric on opel german prodding of russia to engage constructively on security issues and human rights recognizing germanys prominent and international role on this occasion is important to merkel she is still trying to get sense of working with the new washington administration and seems uncertain at times of course westerwelle is learning the ropes and being watched by merkel to see if he can be an effective fm for her alternatively merkel may look to new defense minister zu guttenberg csu to play an alternative role on foreign policy end summary political climate 2 c the political divisions that marked the recent election campaign culminating in the october 28 swearingin of centerright coalition led by chancellor merkel will be swept aside for your celebratory visit merkel just returned from what she considers an exceptional visit to washington which frontpaged her address to congress in every publication merkel will be focused on setting her priorities for the next legislative term she gives major state of the unionlike address on november 10 on all issues and will seek us cooperation in promoting economic recovery and growth opel regulation progress in addressing climate change copenhagen and strengthening germanys international profile afghanistan westerwelle will have spent total of some two days work in the foreign ministry by the time your arrive his ministry is not sure what he wants yet economic climate 3 c germanys exportdriven economy is showing initial signs of recovery from its deepest recession since ww ii for the full year 2009 gdp will shrink around 5 but should show modest growth of 1 next year unemployment has remained relatively low thanks to governmentsubsidized programs but is expected to rise next year given the governments record budget deficit there is heated debate over the wisdom of the new coalitions proposed tax cuts intended to boost growth germany was pleased with the outcome of the g20 summit in pittsburgh but is keener on the g20s regulatory agenda than addressing global imbalances 4 c gms sudden decision on november 3 to cancel the sale of its european subsidiary opel in deal underwritten by the german government shocked and angered germans merkels chief economic advisor told the ambassador november 4 that merkel was so furious at gms aboutface that she refused to take call from gm ceo fritz henderson merkel subsequently called the president federal and state governments are demanding that gm immediately pay back 12 billion euros in bridge loans they had extended to the car maker what particularly irked the germans was that gm had failed to forewarn them of their latest flipflop after months of laborious negotiations and total of 45 billion euros in loansguarantees in exchange for promises to retain most opel jobs and plants in germany merkel found out about the gm decision just hours after delivering her address before congress the opel story has dominated the news november 45 opel workers are likely to strike in the next few days and politicians and others are citing the gm action as another example of american turbocapitalism berlin 00001403 002 of 003 iranexport controls 5 c you should express appreciation for merkels strong statement during her speech to congress that there should be zero tolerance for iranian acquisition of weapons of mass destruction you should stress the importance of german support for eu measures or measures taken by likeminded countries should unscr be unattainable due to possible iranian rejection of the engagement track with westerwelle it remains imperative that you raise the importance of p5 1 unity again in addition you should stress the particular importance of continued german leadership on export control particularly in light of recent interdictions of iranian arms shipments the new german coalition seeks to expand exports by normalizing german export control policy of arms and dualuse items with the eu germany contends that its intention is to raise the eu to the german standard but the danger is that german standards could be watered down to an eu lowest common denominator arms controldisarmament 6 c westerwelle is on bit of tangent by publicly calling for removal of nuclear weapons from germany although he insists that berlin will not act unilaterally this gets him attention and he then offers assurances that everything must be done in the nato context but it distracts from other issues this is one of the few foreign policy positions that distinguishes his fdp from chancellor merkels cdu and westerwelle may feel pressed to mention this the mfa emphasizes that westerwelles position does not necessarily mean that germany intends to cease participation in the nato nuclear share germany may be willing to maintain its fleet of dualcapable aircraft but have the applicable nuclear weapons stored in the us or elsewhere westerwelle also understands that some allies may want to maintain their current stock of nato nuclear weapons your meeting with westerwelle is good opportunity to emphasize any red lines or concerns we have before this effort gets too far down the road for its part the chancellery mfa and mod are uncomfortable with westerwelles push and sees reason to tackle this issue right now afghanistan small window for more troops 7 c fm westerwelle has strongly defended german engagement in afghanistan both military and civilian as vital to german national security interests however he supports the chancellors recent decision to put off any consideration of deploying additional german soldiers until after the proposed international conference on afghanistan early next year notwithstanding the significantly deteriorated security situation in the north the new government sees the conference as critical for setting new framework and benchmarks for the international engagement in afghanistan as well as for prescribing what is expected of the afghan government in return it is in our interest to capitalize on the germans sense of ownership of the north in getting commitment from westerwelle to seriously reconsider troop increase after the afghanistan conference early next year if in fact he and merkel rule out any increase before then within this context it would be important to acknowledge that germany is the fourth largest provider of civilian development assistance in afghanistan and is an enthusiastic supporter of the us focused district development fdd civilian police training program which it joined in january of this year middle east 8 c you should thank merkel for her strong statements before congress where she stressed the overarching importance of israels security and twostate solution in general merkel has been very supportive of us efforts in the middle east she is now planning the second round of germanisraeli government consultations likely before the end of the year she may raise this with you and seek your advice on messages to netanyahu we understand that westerwelle may also be planning to visit israel the mfa said that westerwelle may seek greater german role to promote peace for example to offer german support in coordinating middle east policy with the eu according to the mfa westerwelle may also raise the concept of creating some type of oscelike security structure berlin 00001403 003 of 003 for the middle east reluctance with overseas deployments 9 c germany continues to wrestle with the issue of overseas deployments westerwelle and the fdp in general tend to be more skeptical than merkels cdu on this topic and this is reflected in the government coalition agreement the coalition agreement calls for gradual reduction of german participation in unifil with the perspective of bringing it to an end similarly the agreement calls for critical review of the multitude of parliamentary mandates for the bundeswehr to participate in counterterrorism and piracy operations off the horn of africa again with view toward reducing them it would be helpful for you to emphasize how important we view germanys contributions to these international operations russiaenergy security 10 c we expect germany to be less forgiving of russian bullying of its eastern european neighbors through cutoffs of natural gas supplies especially given the departure of former foreign minister steinmeier known for his relatively prorussian views still we expect germany to continue to place heavy emphasis on maintaining good relations with russia believing that constructive engagement and assistance with modernization are the best way to deal with this difficult strategic partner germany is europes largest energy user and is highly dependent on russia for energy supplies but berlin does not view this as vulnerability believing that moscow is equally dependent on germany as consumer germany nevertheless recognizes that it must diversify its sources of supply routes and means of energy generation to gain greater energy security climate change 11 c as the chancellors remarks underline german officials want strong us leadership going into the copenhagen summit they are advocating for unified useu position towards the major emerging economies particularly china and india to urge them to commit to ambitious national actions at copenhagen they are looking for signals of our commitment to domestic and international actions that will allow us to collectively meet sciencebased targets german leaders recognize the challenge of passing climate change legislation in the us and have lowered their expectations for the possibility of reaching legally binding agreement next month at copenhagen they have begun to describe the summit as one step in larger process politically binding framework and may be preparing the german public for less ambitious outcome
