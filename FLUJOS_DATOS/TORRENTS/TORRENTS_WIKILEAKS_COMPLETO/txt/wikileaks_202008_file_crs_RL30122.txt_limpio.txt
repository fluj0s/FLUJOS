sponsorship and participation summary of recent trends background employment and an aging workforce the aging of the american population has made retirement income an issue of increasing concern to the congress and the public although americans are living longer than ever before most retire before age 65 moreover while the nations population continues to grow the decline in birth rates that followed the postworld war ii baby boom and the continued lengthening of life spans will result in fewer workers relative to the number of retirees these trends will affect the economic wellbeing of future retirees because pensions and social security benefits will be paid over longer periods of time savings will have to be stretched over longer retirements and social security benefits will have to be financed by working population that is shrinking relative to the number of retirees life expectancy continues to increase the average life expectancy of americans born in 1960 was 697 years it has been estimated that those who were born in 2005 will live for an average of 778 years1 man who reached age 65 in 1960 could expect to live another 130 years while woman who turned 65 in 1960 had remaining life expectancy of 158 years man who reached age 65 in 2005 could expect to live another 168 years while woman who turned 65 in 2005 had remaining life expectancy of 198 years as more people live into old age the ageprofile of the population will shift in 1960 167 million people in the united states 92 of the population were aged 65 or older in 2005 there were 367 million americans age 65 or older representing 124 of the population by 2025 according to projections made by the bureau of the census there will be 635 million people aged 65 or older comprising 182 of the us population labor force participation begins to drop after age 55 the proportion of the population that is either working or looking for work is called the labor force participation rate as indicated by the data in table 1 the labor force participation rate starts to drop significantly after age 55 when income is longer derived from earnings individuals depend more on pensions interest and dividends withdrawals from their savings and when they become eligible through age or disability social security the aging of the us population will place 1 us national center for health statistics vital

bureau of labor statistics employment and earnings january 2008 congress and retirement income policies the internal revenue code was first amended to provide favorable tax treatment for qualified pension and retirement plans in the 1920s these provisions have been expanded and modified many times since then among the tax exemptions that apply to traditional defined benefit pension plans are the deduction of pension contributions from employer income exclusion of employer contributions to pension plans from employee income and tax exemption of the earnings of pension trusts2 in defined contribution plans such as those authorized under section 401k of the tax code income taxes are deferred until retirement on employer and employee contributions to the plan and on the investment earnings of the plan by establishing the taxfavored status of pension programs and defining the terms under which tax exemptions and deductions are granted federal tax law has both encouraged the growth of retirement plan coverage among workers and shaped the development of pensions and retirement savings plans congress also has sought to protect the pension benefits earned by workers through direct regulation of pension plans most notably through the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa pl 93406 erisa too may have influenced the development of employersponsored retirement plans since its enactment defined contribution dc plans have proliferated while the number of defined benefit db plans has fallen 2 defined benefit pensions are taxed when the employee receives benefits during retirement crs3 two kinds of retirement plans defined benefit and defined contribution retirement programs are legally classified as either defined benefit plans or defined contribution plans in defined benefit or db plans the retirement benefit usually is based on an employees salary and number of years of service with each year of service worker accrues benefit equal to either fixed dollar amount per month or year of service or percentage of his or her final pay or average pay defined contribution or dc plan is much like savings account maintained by the employer on behalf of each participating employee the employer contributes specific dollar amount or percentage of pay into the account which is usually invested in stocks and bonds in some plans the size of the employers contribution depends on the amount the employee contributes to the plan when the worker retires the amount of the retirement benefit that he or she receives will depend on the balance in the account which is the sum of all the contributions that have been made plus interest dividends and capital gains or losses the worker usually has the choice of receiving these funds as lump sum series of fixed payments over period of years or in the form of life annuity in recent years many employers have converted their traditional pensions to hybrid plans that have characteristics of both db and dc plans the most popular of these hybrids has been the cash balance plan cash balance plan looks like dc plan in that the accrued benefit is defined in terms of an account balance the employer makes contributions to the plan and pays interest on the accumulated balance however in cash balance plan the account balances are merely bookkeeping devices they are not individual accounts that are owned by the participants at retirement the employee must receive benefit that is equal to the amount contributed to the plan plus the interest that has been credited to those contributions legally therefore cash balance plan is defined benefit plan who bears the investment risk in defined benefit plan it is the employer who bears the investment risk of the plan while in defined contribution plan it is the employee who bears the investment risk in defined benefit plan the employer promises to provide retirement benefits equal to certain dollar amount or specific percentage of the employees pay the employer contributes money to pension trust that is invested in stocks bonds real estate or other assets retirement benefits are paid from this trust fund the employer is at risk for the amount of the retirement benefits that have been promised to employees and their survivors if there are insufficient funds in the pension trust to pay the accrued benefits the firm that sponsors the pension plan is legally obligated to make up the difference by paying more money into the pension fund this can be done over period of years in defined contribution plan the employer bears risk beyond an obligation to make contributions to each employees retirement account in these plans it is the employee who bears the risk that his or her retirement account will increase in value by an amount sufficient to provide adequate income during retirement if the contributions made to the account by the employer and the employee are insufficient or if the securities in which the account is invested lose value or increase in value too crs4 slowly the employee risks having an income in retirement that is not sufficient to maintain his or her desired standard of living if this situation occurs the worker might choose to delay retirement many factors affect firms decision to sponsor retirement plan and workers decision to participate in the plan in any given year changes in the business climate inflation interest rates wage increases the cost of other benefits such as health insurance trends in business revenues and profits could weigh more heavily in firms decision to establish or continue retirement plan than the potential tax advantages it could gain by sponsoring plan likewise an employees decision to participate or not to participate in retirement plan may be affected by such variables as the rate of growth of wages the rising cost of employee health insurance premiums his or her confidence in the financial status of social security and whether another family member already participates in retirement plan encouraging sponsorship of retirement plans by small firms is an important issue to the congress in part because of the large number of people employed by small businesses in 2007 for example more than 36 million wage and salary workers were employed by firms with fewer than 25 employees3 the relatively low rates of employer sponsorship and employee participation in retirement plans at small businesses have prompted congress to look for ways to make it easier for small employers to establish and maintain retirement plans for their employees because small employers may be reluctant to take on the financial risk and administrative burden of establishing definedbenefit pension plan congress has sought to encourage greater retirement plan sponsorship among small businesses mainly by easing the financial and reporting requirements associated with certain types of defined contribution pension plans the revenue act of 1978 pl 95600 authorized defined contribution plan called the simplified employee pension sep4 the small business job protection act of 1996 pl 104188 authorized another type of defined contribution plan called the savings incentive match plan for employees simple nevertheless rates of retirement plan sponsorship and participation in small firms continue to lag behind the rates achieved in larger firms the number of defined benefit plans is declining according to the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc the number of pbgcinsured defined benefit plans fell from 114396 in 1985 to 30328 in 20065 the decline in the number of db plans resulted mainly from the termination of large number of small plans between 1985 and 2006 the number of single employer defined benefit pension plans with fewer than 100 participants fell from 3 fulltime and parttime wage and salary workers source current population survey 4 pl 95600 authorized tax exemption only for employer contributions to sep the tax reform act of 1986 pl 99514 allowed workers in firms with fewer than 25 employees to contribute to sep on taxdeferred basis through salary reduction sarsep pl 104 188 authorized simple plans to replace sarseps firms may continue to establish seps funded exclusively by employer contributions but new sarseps were prohibited after december 31 1996 previously existing sarseps may continue as before 5 pension benefit guaranty corporation pension insurance data book 2006 crs5 90061 to 18199 decline of 80 the number of large db plans fell from 22147 to 10585 decline of 522 in recent years however several large pension plans have been terminated and others have been frozen so that participants longer accrue pension benefits recent trends in retirement plan sponsorship and participation every month the bureau of the census conducts the current population survey cps among nationally representative sample of approximately 100000 households primarily for the purpose of estimating the rates of employment and unemployment during march of each year the survey includes supplemental questions about employment income health insurance retirement plan participation and receipt of government benefits during the previous calendar year this information allows analysts and researchers to calculate the number and percentage of workers who reported whether their employer offered retirement plan and whether they participated in the plan responses can then be categorized by demographic and economic characteristics such as the workers age race sex income and the size of firm at which they worked unfortunately however because the cps asks only two pensionrelated questions if the workers employer offered retirement plan and if the worker was included in the plan we cannot ascertain whether the plan is defined benefit plan or defined contribution plan plan participation by fulltime vs parttime employment table 2 compares retirement plan participation among yearround fulltime wage and salary workers in the private sector with participation among workers who were employed partyear or parttime workers with partyear or parttime employment are much less likely to be employed by firm that sponsors retirement plan parttime and partyear workers also are less likely to participate if their employer sponsors plan the proportion of yearround fulltime workers employed at firms that sponsored retirement plan increased from 572 in 2006 to 599 in 2007 the participation rate among these workers rose from 492 in 2006 to 520 in 2007 between 1990 and 2000 plan participation among fulltime workers increased from 546 to 574 it has since fallen by about five percentage points between 2006 and 2007 the proportion of parttime or partyear workers employed by firms that sponsored retirement plan rose from 378 to 383 the participation rate among partyear and parttime workers whose employer sponsored retirement plan was essentially unchanged from 2006 to 2007 at approximately 23 in both years the lower rate of retirement plan participation among partyear and parttime workers is one of the reasons that women are less likely than men to participate in companysponsored retirement plan there is little difference in retirement plan participation between men and women who work yearround fulltime see table 4 women however are more likely than men to work partyear or parttime in 2007 827 of working men between the ages of 25 and 64 were employed year crs6 round fulltime compared to 687 of working women in this agegroup consequently although women who worked fulltime in 2007 were as likely as their male counterparts to have participated in retirement plan 526 of women vs 516 of men the retirement plan participation rate among all women 25 to 64 years old in the private sector in 2007 was lower than the participation rate among all working men in that age group6 43 of women participated vs 47 of men table 2 participation in retirement plans

population survey various years 6 crs estimates based on the march 2008 cps not shown in accompanying tables crs7 retirement plans and employer size data from the cps show that retirement plan participation in small firms rose between 1990 and 2000 but has recently declined the cps data also indicate that access to companysponsored retirement plan remains substantially lower in small firms than in firms with 100 or more employees the data displayed in table 3 show that from 1990 to 2007 the number of workers between the ages of 25 and 64 who were employed in the private sector and worked yearround fulltime at firms of all sizes increased from 530 million to 746 million at the same time the number of such workers whose employer offered retirement plan increased from 333 million to 446 million the proportion of yearround fulltime workers who were employed at firms that offered retirement plan rose from 628 in 1990 to 663 in 2000 it has since fallen to 599 the data displayed in table 3 show that since 2000 the proportion of workers in firms with 100 or more workers whose employer sponsors retirement plan has fallen from 805 to 752 nevertheless workers at large firms remain substantially more likely than employees of small businesses to work for an employer that sponsors retirement plan in 2007 293 of fulltime workers in businesses with fewer than 25 employees were employed at firms that sponsored retirement plan down from 342 in 2000 this was still higher than the 254 of workers at small firms whose employer sponsored retirement plan in 1995 among workers in firms with 25 to 99 employees 531 were employed at firms that sponsored retirement plan in 2007 compared to 585 in 2000 and 541 in 1995 table 3 also shows the percentage of yearround fulltime employees in the private sector who participated in an employersponsored retirement plan7 this statistic takes into account the impact of employers that do not sponsor plan on overall retirement plan participation rates among firms of all sizes the proportion of yearround fulltime employees between the ages of 25 and 64 who participated in retirement plan rose from 492 in 2006 to 520 in 2007 this was lower than the participation rates of 574 in 2000 and 549 in 1995 in firms with fewer than 25 employees just 255 of fulltime employees between the ages of 25 and 64 participated in retirement plan in 2007 down from 293 in 2000 but higher than the 213 who participated in plan in 1995 in firms with 25 to 99 employees retirement plan participation rose from 426 in 2006 to 455 in 2007 this was lower than the participation rates of 494 in 2000 and 460 in 1995 participation in retirement plans among workers in firms with 100 or more employees also rose between 2006 and 2007 increasing from 627 to 654 this was about five percentage points lower than the participation rates of 702 in 2000 and 704 in 1995 7 not all employees whose employer sponsors retirement plan are eligible to

sector and worked yearround full time according to their age young workers ages 25 to 34 were less likely than middleaged and older workers to be employed at firm that sponsored retirement plan in 2007 they also were less likely to participate in retirement plans than are older workers in 2007 543 of workers 25 to 34 years old worked for an employer that sponsored retirement plan and 430 of workers in this age group participated in companysponsored plan thus 792 of those aged 25 to 34 who worked for firm that sponsored plan participated in the plan 04300543 0792 in contrast among workers

907 participated in the plan 05760635 09078 8 some of the difference in participation rates is because workers under 35 are somewhat more likely to be in their first year with an employer and can be excluded from participating in the plan employees who work fewer than 1000 hours in year and those under age 21 also can be excluded from participating but neither group is represented in table 5

the bureau of labor statistics collects data from employers about paid leave health insurance retirement plan participation flexible spending accounts and other employee benefits as part of the national compensation survey ncs this survey is conducted among nationally representative sample of privatesector business establishments9 the term establishment usually refers to single place of business at particular location or all branches of business in particular metropolitan area or county an establishment might be branch or small operating unit of larger firm in contrast firm comprises all of the establishments that together form corporation partnership or other business entity10 according to the data collected from employers through the national compensation survey 51 of workers in the private sector participated in employer sponsored retirement plans in march 2007 see table 8 twenty percent of private sector workers participated in defined benefit plans and 43 participated in defined contribution plans approximately 12 of privatesector workers participated in both types of plan the ncs indicates that 66 of employees in establishments with 100 or more workers participated in an employersponsored retirement plan in march 2007 while only 37 of employees at establishments with fewer than 100 employees participated in an employersponsored retirement plan the data from the ncs also indicate that among fulltime workers 60 participated in an employersponsored retirement plan in march 2007 compared to just 23 of parttime workers while it is not necessarily surprising that the results of the ncs differ from those of the cps nor that the ncs shows higher rates of participation it is important to note that in recent years the difference in the results shown by the two surveys has increased because the ncs has indicated generally steady rate of retirement plan participation whereas the cps data indicate that retirement plan participation has been falling as recently as 2003 the ncs indicated that 49 of privatesector workers participated in retirement plan whereas the cps data showed participation rate of 47 this two percentage point difference was small enough to be inconsequential for most analytical purposes the slightly higher rate of participation indicated by the ncs might partly be due to the fact that the business owners and benefits specialists who are interviewed for the ncs could be expected to have greater knowledge of employerprovided benefits than the household members interviewed for the cps by march 2007 however the ncs indicated that the proportion of privatesector workers participating in employersponsored retirement plans was 51 whereas the march 2008 cps which asks about pension participation in 2007 showed that participation in retirement plans among private sector workers had fallen to 45 the difference in the results shown by the two surveys can longer be considered inconsequential leaving 9 for more information on the
