be updated again for the 2004 presidential electionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30527presidential elections in the united states primer summary every four years americans elect president and vice president thereby choosing both national leaders and course of public policy the system that governs the election of the president combines constitutional and statutory requirements rules of the national and state political parties political traditions and contemporary developments and practices as initially prescribed by the constitution the election of the president was left to electors chosen by the states final authority for selecting the president still rests with the electoral college which comprises electors from each state equal in number to the states total representation in the house and senate all but two states award electoral votes on winnertakeall basis to the candidate with plurality of the states popular vote the process of electing the president is essentially divided into four stages 1 the prenomination phase in which candidates compete in state primary elections and caucuses for delegates to the national party conventions 2 the national conventionsheld in the summer of the election yearin which the two major parties nominate candidates for president and vice president and ratify platform of the parties policy positions and goals 3 the general election campaign in which the major party nominees as well as any minor party or independent contenders compete for votes from the entire electorate culminating in the popular vote on election day in novembe r and 4 the electoral college phase in which the president and vice president are officially elected presidential elections in recent years differ in several important respects from those held earlier in american history the first is the far wider participation of voters today in determining who the party nominees will be the political parties have in recent years given much greater role to party voters in the states in lieu of party leaders in determining the nominees the second difference involves the role of the electronic media and most recently the internet both in conveying information to the voters and shaping the course of the campaign third the financing of presidential campaigns is substantially governed by system of public funding in the pre nomination convention and general election phases enacted in the 1970s in response to increasing campaign costs in an electronic age and the concomitant fundraising pressures on candidates thus contemporary presidential elections blend both traditional aspects of law and practice and contemporary aspects of larger more complex and more technologically advanced societyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30527 contents i presidential

the natural born requirement2 under the 22nd amendment one may serve more than two full terms although vice president who succeeds to the presidency and serves less than two full years of the prior incumbents term may seek election to two additional terms prior occupations of presidents american voters have chosen men of varied backgrounds on the 53 occasions they have gone to the polls to elect president all 41 presidents served the country previously either in government or the military of the 24 presidents who served prior to 1900 seven had been vice presidents three of whom were elected to the presidency while four succeeded deceased incumbent four were members of congress four were governors and nine previously held an appointive federal position the trend in 20th century presidential elections has favored former vice presidents governors and senators of 17 20th century presidents several served in more than one of these positions at the time of their inauguration one eisenhower had served as career army officer two taft and hoover had most recently served as cabinet officers five wilson fd roosevelt carter reagan and clinton as governors two harding and kennedy were senators and seven were vice presidents five of the seven vice presidents t roosevelt coolidge truman johnson and ford succeeded on the death or resignation of the incumbent two vice presidents were electedone nixon as former and one bush as an incumbent the candidate field before the primaries and conventions the candidates determine the presidential field the decline of party leader dominance over the nominating process has resulted in system whereby selfselected candidates compete in the states for the delegates needed for nomination the democratization of the nominating process has meanthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30527crs3 that many candidates enter the race begin raising money and organize for the primaries and caucuses well before the election year in order to be competitive according to the federal election commission 203 individuals had filed statement s of candidacy or had committees file statements of organization for the 2000 presidential election as of january 31 2000 just 33 of these individuals had met the federal election campaign acts feca criteria for candidacies subject to federal election laws ie raising contributions or making expenditures in excess of 5000 2 usc 4312 in reality only small number of these are considered by the media as serious candidates seeking the nomination of the two major parties exploratory candidaciestesting the waters the formal announcement of candidacy is often preceded by period in which candidates test the waters as unannounced candidat for nomination this may begin several years before the convention likely candidates may form exploratory committees to gauge popular support and to begin developing base of supporters and contributors while avoiding some of the legal requirements such as contribution limits and disclosure of receipts and disbursements of the feca as unofficial candidates who are not technically campaigning for office persons may raise and spend unlimited amounts of money without registering as candidates with the federal election commission fec upon declaration of candidacy however the individual must register with the fec and report all financial activity while testing the waters these amounts become retroactively subject to all feca regulations announcement of candidacy an individual must file statement of candidacy with the fec within 15 days of reaching the laws financial threshold ie 5000 in receipts or expenditures and must name principal campaign committe to receive contributions and make expenditures this committee must file statement of organization with the fec within ten days after being designated the statement must identify the committees title which includes the candidates name the treasurer bank depositories and any other committees the candidate has authorized to raise or spend on his or her behalf such other committees which the candidate authorizes may raise and spend funds but they must report such activity through the principal committee the timing of the formal announcement is crucial because of its political impact and also because of the legal and tactical implications once public declaration of candidacy is made candidates are subject to state and national spending limits if they qualify for and choose to accept public matching funds and they are subject to the broadcasting provisions of the equaltime rule 47 usc 315a nominations today are usually won during the primary campaign rather than at the convent ion and primaries have proliferated and been scheduled earlier in the election year because of these developments competitors are pressed to announce their candidacies much earlier than in years past whereas in 1932 franklin roosevelt formally announced for the presidency 156 days before the convention michael dukakis formally announced his candidacy 446 days prior to the 1988httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30527crs4 democratic national convention the trend toward earlier longer campaigns is hallmark of modern presidential elections qualifying for the primaries and caucuses the guidelines that candidates follow to qualify for primaries and caucuses differ from state to state in primary states the secretary of state or other chief elections officer is the authority for listing candidate names on the ballot in caucus states the parties oversee the procedures for candidates to gain ballot access they do not always have to file to be eligible for delegates in caucus states however candidates generally file statement of candidacy with the secretary of state or the party chair at the state level in some primary states the secretary of state may automatically certify for the ballot the names of all major party candidates those submitted by the party candidates who have qualified in other states or candidates who have applied with the fec or are eligible for federal matching funds presidential candida tes may also be required to pay filing fee submit petitions or both signatures may be required from requisite number of voters in each congressional district or from requisite number of voters statewide party nominations the primary season gradually reduces the field of major party candidates the accelerated pace of the present system winnows out those who fall short of expectations and hence find it difficult to raise the money needed to sustain their candidacies furthermore the reforms of the past 30 years have changed the dynamics of the nominating process by closely tying the allocation of delegates to electoral performance the days when candidate could compete in select number of primaries to demonstrate popular appeal have passed the nomination goes to the candida who has amassed majority of delegates in the primaries and caucuses party conventions have largely become ratifying bodies that confer the nomination on the candidate who won it in state contests the 1976 republican national convention was the most recent one at which the determination of major partys nominee was in any real doubt before the nominating ballots were cast the general election ballot the names of the major party nominees for president and vice president are automatically placed on the general election ballot some states also list the names of presidential electors adjacent to the presidential and vice presidential candidates whom they support voters mark their ballots once for partys presidential and vice presidential ticket electors also cast single vote in the electoral college for the party ticket minor party and independent candidates are also listed on the ballot if they qualify according to provisions of the state codes and several such candidates are usually on the ballot in different stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30527crs5 3 frederick kaiser specialist in american national government in the crs government finance division assisted in preparation of this section 4 pl 90331 18 usc 3056 5 advisory committee guidelines for assignment of secret service protection to presidential candidates us department of the treasury washington 2000secret service protection3 in the aftermath of the 1968 assassination of senator robert kennedy while he was seeking the democratic presidential nomination congress passed legislation which for the first time authorized secret service protection of presidential and vice presidential candidates4 the law made the secretary of the treasury responsible for determining which major candidates are eligible for protection after consultation with bipartisan advisory committee comprised of the majority and minority leaders of the senate the speaker and minority leader of the house of representatives and one additional member to be chosen by the committee spouses of such candidates are also entitled to protection within 120 days of the general election on occasion candidates have declined protection offered to them while the law provides protection for major party presidential and vice presidential nominees in the general election it does not specify the criteria for determining major candidates in the primary season however criteria and standards in the advisory committees guidelines specify that an eligible individual 1 is publicly declared candidate 2 is actively campaigning nationally and is contesting at least 10 state primaries 3 is pursuing the nomination of qualified party ie whose presidential candidate received at least 10 of the popular vote in the prior election 4 has qualified for public matching funds of at least 100000 and has raised at least 2 million in additional contributions and 5 as of april 1 of the election year has received at least an average of five percent in individual candidate preferences in the most recent national opinion polls by abc cbs nbc and cnn or has received at least 10 of the votes cast for all candidates in two sameday or consecutive primaries or caucuses5 notwithstanding this the secretary of the treasury after consultation with the advisory committee may provide protection for candidate even if all of the conditions of the guidelines have not been met secret service protection for primary candidates generally begins shortly after january 1 of the election year on occasion the secretary of the treasury has accorded protection to certain candidates earlier than the election yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30527crs6 ii the nomination process primaries and caucuses are the initial testing ground for the next president the primary season plays an essential role in presidential elections by narrowing the field of major party candidates the nomination is conferred on the candidate who holds majority of delegates at the party convention but under the present system for choosing delegates one candidate is likely to emerge with majority by the end of the primary season if not sooner and well before the convention meets the development of the nominating system the emergence of the national nominating convention in 1831 in place of the congressional caucus method of choosing nominees gave the political parties more democratic means of bestowing nominations based more closely on popular sentiment see chapter iii for detailed information on national nominating conventions early delegate selection methods delegates to the early conventions were either appointed by party leader or were chosen under partyrun caucus system while both methods involved more participants than the congressional caucus in reality they merely shifted control of nominations to the state party leadership which usually controlled the states entire delegation delegates were chosen in this manner until the beginning of the 20th century when members of the progressive party whose aim was to reform the structure and processes of government introduced an innovative device called the primary emergence of the primary in 1904 florida became the first state to adopt the primary as means of choosing delegates to the nominating conventions and many states followed within the decade by 1916 20 democratic and republican parties selected delegates in primaries the primary took democratization of the nominating process step further by enabling party members to choose the delegates it was the first largescale innovation in the process since the introduction of the party convention about 80 years earlier hailed as triumph of democracy upon its debut the primary failed to attract many voters and in the first half of this century it never became the principal route to the nomination in 1912 theodore roosevelt won nine of 13 republican primaries but his name was not even placed in nomination at the republican convention which instead renominated incumbent william howard taft who had won only one primary but whose forces controlled the partys national committee the primary movement made little progress in the years following the first world war and some states abandone d it as the method for choosing delegates the number of state party primaries in which delegates were chosen stood at around 14 for the next four decadeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30527crs7 many candidates avoided primaries altogether or ran in select few simply to demonstrate their popular appeal in 1952 democratic contender estes kefauver entered and won 12 of 15 primaries held only to see the convention turn to adlai stevenson who had not entered any primaries in 1960 john f kennedy demonstrated electability by winning few selected primaries but his delegate totals were amassed more by his cultivation of key party leaders and state delegations reform and revival of the primary the violence that marred the 1968 democratic convention in chicago underscored growing discontent in that party with the dominant role played by party leaders in the nomination of candidates in response the democra tic national committee formed the mcgovernfraser commission to evaluate the delegate selection process and to recommend changes designed to make the system more responsive to rankandfile party members the commission in 1969 proposed series of reforms that addressed most aspects of delegate selection the principal aim of which was to increase popular participation and link it more directly to the selection of delegates the national committee accepted nearly all of the commissions proposals which were subsequently adopted by the state parties furthermore some state legislatures many of them under democratic control enacted statutes applicable to both parties which incorporated the commissions recommendations the commission recommended series of sweeping changes that addressed nearly every major aspect of delegate selection it established guidelines for translating public support for candidates into delegate votes and eliminated automatic exofficio delegate slots by calling for the election of all of the delegates to the convention guidelines for equal representation of women and minorities were adopted and devices that vested considerable power in the party leadership eg proxy voting the unit rule etc were eliminated the mcgovernfraser recommendations as subsequently modified changed the process for the democrats and had an impact as well on the system used by the republicans who made changes to respond to perceived public pressure for greater democratization perhaps the principal effect of the reform movement was the revitalization of the primary in determining the choice of party nominees it was viewed as the most suitable method for encouraging broad participation in 1968 375 of democratic delegates were chosen in 17 primary states the 16 republican primary states that year sent 343 of the delegates to that partys convention by 1976 the democrats held primaries in 30 states which selected 726 of the delegates while the republicans chose 679 of their delegates in 28 primary states the percentage of delegates chosen in states holding primaries has been higher in recent cycles under the present schedule for 2000 852 of democratic delegates in 38 states and the district of columbia and 901 of republican delegates in 41 states and the district of columbia will be selected in states holding primaries the resurgence of the primary was accompanied by changes in other aspects of the political landscape which reinforced the importance of primary elections the media became fullfledged participant in the nominating process through their extensive coverage of primaries and their role in publicizing primary resultshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30527crs8 candidates are now likely to pick and choose which primaries to contest because delegates are at stake in virtually all of them early primaries are especially vigorously contested particularly by lesser known candidates who seek to gain crucial media coverage and establish campaign momentum the pace of the entire season has quickened the nominating process in the post1968 era thus focused attention once again on the primaries where nominations today are won or lost assignment and categorization of delegates by the national parties allocation of delegates to the states and other jurisdictions each party has its own method for assigning delegates and alternates to the different states and jurisdictions democrats the democratic party allocates delegates and alternates according to formula based on population as measured by electoral college strength and past levels of voting for democratic presidential candidates in the general election the democratic national committee also awards delegates and alternates to five jurisdictions for which the allocation factor cannot be computed because they do not participate in the presidential electionamerican samoa democrats abroad guam puerto rico and the virgin islands furthermore the party assigns additional delegate slots for party leaders former distinguished elected officials and the entire democratic membership of the us senate and house of representatives republicans the republican allocation system assigns three delegates per congressional district and six delegates atlarge for every state it also assigns bonus delegates based on the states republican vote in the previous election for president us senate us house of represent atives and governor delegates to the convention for other jurisdictions are assigned by the republican national committee categories of delegates democrats the democratic party has two basic types of delegates grouped by whether or not they are pledged to support particular candidate furthermore there are three categories of pledged delegates which comprise the majority of delegates to the convention and four categories of unpledged delegates pledged delegates the allocation formula determines only the number of delegates in the pledged categories districtlevel base delegates atlarge base delegates and pledged party and elected official delegates of the number of delegates assigned to state according to the allocation formula 75 are assigned at the district level and 25 are designated atlarge although districtlevel and atlarge delegates are allocated in the same manner they are chosen separately at different stages of the processhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30527crs9 pledged party and elected official delegates represent 15 addition to the base number of allocated delegates they are usually chosen in the same manner as the at large delegates unpledged delegates the number of unpledged delegates for state depends on the number of individuals available in each specified category delegate slots are allocated for former democratic presidents and vice presidents former democratic majority leaders of the us senate former democratic speakers of the us house of representatives and all former chairs of the democratic national committee democratic governors members of the democratic national committee dnc including the state chairs and vice chairs and officers of the dnc and all democratic members of the us senate and house of representatives republicans aside from three congressional district delegates and six atlarge delegates assigned to each state under republican allocation rules number of bonus delegates may be awarded for the atlarge category as well four and onehalf atlarge bonus delegates are assigned to each state which cast its electoral votes for the republican nominee in the previou s election one bonus delegate is allocated to each state in which republican was elected to the senate or the governorship between the last and the upcoming presidenti election one bonus delegate is also allocated to states in which half the delegation to the house of representatives is republican in 1996 15 atlarge delegates have been allocated to the district of columbia puerto rico has been allocated 14 atlarge delegates and four delegates have been allocated each to guam and the virgin islands the national party also awards bonus delegates to states where the primary or caucus is held after midmarch of the election year in states where the primary or caucus is scheduled between march 15 and april 14 5 increase to the national convention delegation is awarded 7½ increase is awarded to state parties with contests scheduled between april 15 and may 14 and 10 increase is awarded to states where the primary or caucus is held between may 15 and the third tuesday in june state parties have considerable flexibility to determine the means of electing or choosing the district and atlarge delegates according to national party rules delegate selection structure under the present system for choosing presidential nominees state parties use two main electoral devices the primary and the caucusconvention system state parties combine the two in variety of ways to choose delegates to the nationalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30527crs10 conventions and the resulting mix of methods accounts for the complexity that characterizes the presidential nominating process furthermore the timing of delegate selection events is determined by either the state legislatures or the state parties depending on which electoral method is used primary dates are usually determined by the legislatures while caucus events are scheduled by the states political parties in large part this divided authority concerning the choice of method and the timing of delegate selection events explains and perpetuates the inherent complexity of the nominating system the present mixed system of presidential nomination events primaries primary is staterun election for the purpose of nominating party candidates to run in the general election presidential primaries perform this function in an indirect manner because voters elect delegates to national convention rather than directly selecting presidential candidates most states restrict voting in primary to party members these are closed primary states open primary states allow the voter to choose either partys ballot in the voting booth on primary day none of the open primary states require voter registration by party in 1992 more state parties selected delegates in primary than ever before34 democratic and 37 republican out of the 50 states and the district of columbia in 2000 39 democratic and 42 republican primaries are scheduled in the states and the district of columbia caucuses and conventions caucus is meeting of party members or leaders to select nominees for public office and to conduct other party business in the presidential nominating process it is often used in combination with state convention to elect delegates to the national nominating convention the caucusconvention process is typically comprised of several tiers beginning with broadbased meetings of rankandfile party members usually at the precinct level because of their cumbersome nature precinct caucuses invariably attract fewer voters than do primaries participants must invest substantial time to attend caucus in contrast to voting in primary and participants usually register their support for presidential candidate by public declaration by show of hands or by gathering in groups according to presidential preference in some places caucus participants may vote by ballot for presidential candidates but in any event the process requires face toface contact with other participants that is not required when casting ballot at polling place once the presidential preference vote is tallied caucus participants elect representatives for their preference who attend the meeting convened as the next stage in the process precinct caucuses are usually followed by county or congressional district meetings with smaller number of representatives selected at each stagebased on support for them or the candidate they favorto go on to the next level delegates to the national convention are finally chosen by the representatives to the congressional district caucus or the state convention or bothhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30527crs11 in 2000 both state parties in nine states will select delegates using the caucus process democrats scheduled caucuses in three additional states choice of device for electing delegates because primaries are administered by the states the guidelines and timing are determined by state law however political party may opt out of the primary and select delegates in caucus process instead not all states provide for presidential primary in which case both parties use the caucus method and accordingly set their own rules and dates for caucus events in many primary states caucuses are component of the process for choosing delegates as well but the results of the primary are the crucial factor in determining the division of delegates methods of selecting delegates the principal difference between the parties in choosing delegates is the democratic partys requirement that delegate candidates selected in primaries and caucuses state their presidential or uncommitted preference as condition for election the republican party does not require declaration of preference and consequently republican delegate selection is less uniform and more dependent upon the different approaches of the state parties democrats under the present system state democratic parties use one of the following four methods to elect district delegates caucusconvention system this consists of one to four tiers as general rule grassroots participation is at the first tier at which representatives to the next tier are elected and so on delegates and alternates are chosen at district meeting usually the second or third tier preprimary caucus this nominates district delegates who are subsequently elected on the basis of the vote for president in the primary postpri mary caucus this is held after the primary to elect the number of delegates presidential candidate has won on the basis of the primary vote twopart primary this requires that the voter mark the ballot for presidential preference and again for individual delegates within preference district delegates declare presidential preference or run as uncommitted in the primaries and caucuses atlarge and pledged party and elected official delegates also declare presidential or uncommitted preference but they are chosen by the state committee committee of elected district delegates or by the state convention to reflect primary or caucus results republicans district delegates may be elected in primary or may be selected by presidential candidates on the basis of the primary vote they can be chosen in congressional district caucuses or they may be combined with the atlarge delegates and selected as unit at the state conventionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30527crs12 atlarge delegates may be elected by primary voters chosen by presidential candidates according to the primary vote selected by the state committee or as in most states chosen at the state convention timing of delegate selection events with three exceptions the democratic party restricts firststage delegate selection events to the period between the first tuesday in march and the second tuesday in june party rules permit three states to hold delegate selection events prior to the first tuesday in march the iowa democratic party may conduct its precinct caucuses 15 days earlier the new hampshire primary may be held seven days earlier and the maine firsttier caucuses may be held two days earlier these exceptions honor traditional dates for holding primaries and caucuses in new hampshire iowa and maine that predated the national partys rule that restricts delegate selection contests to specific period for 2000 iowa was given approval by the dnc to hold its caucuses even earlier on january 24 and new hampshire received approval to hold its primary on february 1 maine democrats longer use caucus process but elect delegates in primary on march 7 2000 national rules for the republican party state only that participants in caucuses or conventions for the purpose of choosing national convention delegates shall not be elected prior to the official call for the convention the party issues the call prior to january 1 of the election year the timing of

voters mark their ballot either for presidential candidate with delegates chosen or allocated afterwards according to the results or for both presidential candidate and individual delegate candidates republican primary voters may have third option whereby the voter marks the ballot for individual delegate candidates without an accompanying presidential candidate preference vote the caucus process is comprised of several stages usually three or four where rankandfile voters participate at the first stage to choose participants for the next stage and so on national convention delegates are chosen at later stage after the initial mass participation event under the convention system group of participants assembles to choose the national delegates convention participants may have been

the contemporary nominating system length of the campaign potential candidates begin organizing their campaigns and raising money year or more in advance of the primary season in order to be competitive while the length of the nominating season has remained virtually unchanged the preelection maneuvering by candidates may begin shortly after the previous presidential election and exploratory committees are often in operation one or two years before the election in 1972 12 of 15 major party contenders announced their candidacies earlier than two months preceding january 1 of the election year in 1988 all 14 major party candidates announced before the election year began one of whom announced in 1986 for the 2000 election six candidates had announced by the end of april 1999 and all twelve major party candidates had announced their candidacies or the formation of their exploratory committees by september the accelerated pace in 1976 the iowa republican party advanced its caucus date to january 19 the same day as democratic party caucuses thereby supplanting the new hampshire primary in its traditional role as the first twoparty delegate selection event of the nominating season since then iowa and new hampshire have played an incipient role in narrowing the field of candidates and setting the stage for ensuing primaries and caucuses other states have reacted to the influence and attention accorded iowa and new hampshire by advancing their dates as wella phenomenon known as frontloading the 2000 calendar was the most frontloaded ever the nominating season began in iowa and new hampshire according to tradition although events in these states took place nearly month earlier than in past years the iowa caucuses were moved to january 24 from february 21 in 1996 and the new hampshire primary was scheduled on february 1 it was held on february 29 in 1996 following new hampshire republicans scheduled events in eight states during february but the most significant change to the calendar was the scheduling of primaries in california new york and ohio on march 7 the first date on which democrats may hold delegate selection events according to national rules from which iowa and new hampshire are exempt seven primaries were scheduled on the first tuesday in march in 1996 mostly in new england states but the addition of california new york and ohio in 2000 swelled the number of delegates at stake and created national event with contests taking place in each region of the country twelve primaries and caucuses were

important aspect of the nominating process in recent years an unprecedented number occurred during the 1988 primary season approximately 60 debates virtually all televised locally or nationally were held among candidates of one or both parties6 for the 2000 election cycle 19 debates between the democratic or republican candidates were held between october 27 1999 and february 21 2000 according to the alliance for better campaigns7 in general the increase in debates coincided with decrease in the number of straw poll elections before and during the nominating season these polls measure candidate popularity among party activists at state conventions but have bearing on the selection of delegates to some extent candidate debates offset one of the most frequently cited criticisms of the processthat the combined influence of the media and the proliferation of primaries with their mass audience seem to foster an emphasis on candidate image over substantive issues debates will

our two major partiesthe democratswas held in baltimore maryland between may 21 and 23 1832 nomination by party convention replaced earlier arrangements which included nomination by both congressional party caucuses and by state legislatures which prevailed through 1828 historical developments the caucus system in 1800 thomas jefferson was nominated by caucus comprised of democraticrepublican members of congress the federalists chose the same method to renominate president john adams following jeffersons successful election to the presidency that year the democraticrepublicans continued to use the caucus method until the election of 1820 when incumbent president james monroe was the unchallenged consensus candidate the declining federalists who relied on meetings of party leaders to nominate their choices after 1800 fielded their last presidential ticket in 1816 emergence of the national party convention the election of 1824 brought an end to both the democraticrepublicandominated era of good feeling and the use of congressional caucus as nominating device although the democratic republican caucus nominated william crawford of georgia as its candidate three other candidates john quincy adams henry clay and andrew jackson were also nominated by rival factions within the party after bitter contest and an electoral college deadlock adams was elected president by the house of representatives brief transitional period followed in which state legislative caucuses and conventi ons and various other methods were used to nominate presidential candidates in 1832 the three parties contesting the electionantimasonic democratic and national republicanused national conventions as vehicles for nominating their presiden tial tickets for the first time the use of nominating conventions reflected the growing trend toward greater democratic participation which characterized the jackson era king caucus had been criticized as being both basically undemocratic and insufficiently reflective of the popular choice of candidates the national convention by comparison was comprised of delegates chosen by party voters activists and officeholders in each state it was natural extension on the national level of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30527crs18 8 the republican record is held by the 1880 convention which took 36 ballots to nominate james garfieldparty conventions used to nominate elected officials on the county and state levels the antimasonic party was the first to use the national convention which met in baltimore in september 1831 to choose william wirt as its candidate the democrats and national republicans followed suit the next year by 1840 the democrats and whigs had adopted the national convention as the standard nominating device which the major parties have used without exception ever since classic elements of the national convention for over century national conventions were often unruly strongly contested gatherings it was common for number of names to be placed in nomination with single candidate possessing the requisite number of votes to win on the first ballot in 1860 the democrats were unable to decide on candidate after ten days and were forced to reconvene six weeks later in another city to finalize their selection on other occasions many ballots and extensive political maneuvering were required before presidential candidate could be nominated various party rules and political practices contributed to these characteristics the twothirds rule and darkhorse candidates major factor was the democratic party requirement adopted at the 1832 convention and not abandoned until 1936 that the partys nominee receive twothirds majority of delegate votes the record for the number of ballots cast is held by the democrats who required 103 ballots to nominate john w davis in the 1924 national convention8 fear of deadlock among the most widelyknown candidates led to the occasional emergence of dark horse candidatea minor candidate or party figure who had not originally been thought of as candidateas compromise choice james k polk of tennessee nominated by the democrats in 1844 is often cited as the first dark horse candidate to win nomination in 1936 the democrats adopted rules changes requiring only simple majority for nomination largely ending the lengthy balloting which had occasionally resulted in the selection of dark horse candidates the smokefilled room convention deadlock was not unknown among the republicans despite the fact that they required only simple majority to nominate at their 1920 convention ohio senator warren harding emerged as compromise candidate on the 10th ballot according to legend hardings nomination was engineered at secret latenight meeting of party leaders held in hotel suite giving rise to an enduring element of national convention loreselection of the presidential nominee in the smokefilled room the term came to imply choice of nominee by small group of party leaders meeting out of the view of public scrutiny favorite sons the favorite candidacy is another oncecommon device which is seen much less frequently in contemporary national conventions favoritehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30527crs19 sons were political figures often governors senators or representatives who ran for the presidency usually campaigning only in their home states for the purpose of retaining control of state delegations once at convention the favorite typically used his delegates as bargaining chips to influence the party platform to help secure the nomination for preferred candidate to seek future political favors or to enhance his own prospects as vice presidential nominee 1972 democratic party rules change required that candidates secure pledges of support from at least 50 delegates not more than 20 of whom can be from single state this rule which essentially required candidates to secure at least modest level of support from more geographically diverse representation of delegates further served to reduce the number of names placed in nomination at subsequent conventions similarly current republican party rules require that candidates must be able to demonstrate the support of majority of the delegates from five or more states in order to have their names placed in nomination the decline of favorite candidac ies in both parties is also attributed to the changing nature of the preconvention nomination process fewer uncommitted delegates are elected in the primaries and caucuses moreover as state and local party leaders gradually lost control of the selection process they were unable to keep delegates from supporting major candidates for the nomination the modern convention ratifying the party choice throughout most of the first half of the 20th century national conventions were frequently the scene of contentious struggles for the presidential nomination it was not uncommon for convention to open without clear favorite and with candidate holding the votes needed to win the nomination on the first ballot since that time the choice of nominees has been much less likely to be made at the convention although there can beand frequently arespirited controversies over rival candidacies the nominee today is usually known well in advance of the convention based on an accumulation of comfortable majority of delegate votes as result the convention now characteristic ally serves largely to ratify choice already arrived at by party primaries caucuses and state conventions to large extent this change has resulted from corresponding change in how convention delegates are chosen traditionally most delegates were selected by party leaders and officials since world war ii and especially since the 1970s increased reliance on caucuses and primaries has opened the delegate selection process to larger numbers of party activists and the voting public effectively wresting control from state and national party professionals primary voters usually declare their presidential candida choice at the same time as they indicate their choice of convention delegateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30527crs20 moreover despite the large numbers of candidates who have entered the race in recent elections at least when incumbent was running in particular party the increasing length of the primary and caucus season has tended to eliminate weaker candidates winnowing the field to one or two major contenders in almost every convention since 1956 one candidate has gone to each partys convention with clear strong lead in delegate totals the influence of television since 1952 when fullscale television coverage began the national convention has been transformed from gathering of the party faithful to media event which attracts widespread national interest television coverage led to complete reorganization of scheduling and events convention sessions once primarily conducted during the day are now largely scheduled for peak viewing hours in order to attract the widest television audience the onceleisurely pace of events has been tightened timecon suming demonstrations are more strictly limited and lengthy speeches have largely been curtailed or eliminated emphasis has been placed on producing stageset platforms geared more to television viewers than convention participants both parties also make increasing use of professionally produced films on the candidates and the party included as an integral part of the convention proceedings

permanent chair althoug h conventions of both parties are opened by temporary presiding officer election of permanent chair is usually one of the first points in the order of business the permanent chair who presides for the balance of the convention is usually senior party figure most often the party leader in the house of representatives since 1972 the democrats have required that the permanent chairmanship alternate between the sexes every four years in 1996 house speaker newt gingrich ga chaired the republican national convention while senate minority leader tom daschle sd and house minority leader richard gephardt mo cochaired the democratic national convention convention committees committees of the national conventions prepare reports for the conventions on delegate credentials rules of procedure and party platforms the full convention ratifies or amends the respective recommendations from each of these committees permanent organizati on the permanent organization committee which functions continuously between conventions has as its primary role the selection of convention officers as part of its 1972 reforms the democrats abolished the permanent organization committee transferring its duties to the rules committee credentials the credentials committees of both parties examine and rule on the accreditation of state delegations to the conventions in closely contested or unusually acrimonious nomination campaigns the credentials committees occasionally consider conflicting claims for recognition by competing slates of delegates the rules and bylaws committee of the democratic national committee monitors the delegate selection process to ensure party rules are observed rules the rules committees of the two parties recommend procedures under which the national conventions are conducted platform the first party platform was adopted by the democrats at their 1840 national convention the task of drafting the platforms of the two major parties is the responsibility of the platform committees which draft the document for the conventions approval typically these committees hold hearings around the country prior to the convention at which public views on policy questions are solicited the convention daybyday contemporary national conventions are generally held over fourday period with both parties observing similar schedules the proceedings are regularlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30527crs25 interspersed with films honoring party figures continuing procession of party notables usually selected to reflect the partys diversity offer short speeches throughout the proceedings while clergymen from various denominations offer invocations and benedictions to open and close each session the following daybyday account provides general overview of the course of events at typical national convention variations in scheduling both planned and those necessitated by timeconsuming floor procedures are not uncommon day one the first day of national convention is generally devoted to routine business the convention is called to order by the national party chair the roll of delegations is called and the temporary chair is elected welcoming speeches are delivered by the mayor of the host city and often the governor of the state in which the convention is held committee appointments which have been previously announced are ratified the democrats generally install permanent convention officers at the first session while the republicans in recent years have completed adoption of credentials rules and the party platform before turning over convention proceedings to the permanent chair usually on the second or third day the democratic convention keynote address is also delivered on the first day of convention proceedings the republicans tend to schedule keynote speeches for later in the convention usually at the second session the keynote address the keynote address sets the themes and tone of the convention and often of the general election campaign to follow keynote speakers are usually prominent office holders or party officials chosen because of their national appeal and speaking ability or because they may be viewed as rising stars in the party the keynote address is highly partisan in tone and content it extols the party record and the incumbent president when the party holds the white house it attacks the opposition candidates policies and record perhaps the most famous such address was delivered at the 1896 democratic national convention by william jennings bryan of nebraska his passionate attack on the gold standard coupled with plea for free silver you shall not crucify mankind on cross of gold stampeded the convention and led to his own nomination list of 20th century

convention business often spills over into the second day of proceedings as reports of the credentials rules and platform committee s are debated and approved by the delegates while the acceptance of delegate credentials is usually perfunctory procedure in some years credentials have been hotly contested as rival slates of delegate s from the same state representing contending factions were presented in 1968 the democratic national convention voted to unseat the racially segregated mississippi regular democratic delegation and replace it with the rival integrated freedom democratic delegation four years later in 1972 challenges to both the california and illinois democratic delegations resulted in lengthy struggles on the floor these struggles grew out of infighting between supporters and opponents of candidate george mcgovern and focused on whether the delegations had been elected in accordance with newly adopted reform rules in both cases the promcgovern delegations were seated helping insure nomination of the south dakota senator and constituting major defeat for more traditional party leaders rules adoption of the rules committee report setting convention procedures is another important function usually completed on the second day of the convention consideration of the committee report has occasionally been accompanied by spirited debate particularly in close convention when delegates have sought to boost their candidates chances by securing rules changes at the 1976 republican convention supporters of ronald reagan unsuccessfully sought rules change which would have required candidates for the nomination to name their vice presidential running mate before the first ballot failure to comply with the propose d rule change would have freed all delegates from their customary pledge to vote for the candidate to whom they were committed on the first round reagan supporters hoped that adoption of the rule might force opposing candidate gerald ford to name running mate unacceptable to some of his committed delegates and thus enhance reagans chances of nominationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30527crs28 platform adoption of the party platform is another task usually completed on the second day of convention although consideration of proposed amendments to the platform committee draft will occasionally continue into the third day the party platform statement of principles and policy proposals is prepared in advance by the platform committee but is sometimes amended on the floor through minority reports these reports are filed by those who were unsuccessful in incorporating their views into the draft version consideration of minority reports by the convention is contingent upon obtaining threshold level of delegate support the process of platform approval has also occasionally led to spirited struggles between contending convention factions often allied with opposing candidates in 1984 for instance candidate jesse jackson sought platform planks statements of distinct party policies renouncing first use of nuclear weapons denouncing runoff primary elections deemed discriminatory to black candidates and embracing the use of quotas to combat racial discrimination all controversial positions considered by opponents as pushing the party too far to the left convention forces loyal to eventual nominee walter mondale rejected all three proposals although compromise language allegedly acceptable to jackson was eventually adopted platforms are intended to maintain the loyalty of committed party activists while attracting the support and votes of political independents as such they generally avoid proposals which might be interpreted as extreme on the occasions when party platforms have incorporated allegedly radical proposals of the left or right they have tended to damage the election chances of the presidential ticket although serving as statement of principles and intentions party platforms are not binding presidents once in office may choose to ignore the pledges made by the party in convention for example in 1932 franklin d roosevelt was elected on platform calling for increased austerity and balanced budget once in office however his administration undertook program of spending measuresthe new dealintended to stimulat the economy and end the depression furthermore republican platforms in 1980 1984 and 1988 called for balanced federal budget but budget deficits throughout this period continued to increase day three the third day of national conventions is usually reserved for the nomination of the presidential candidate in recent years the nomination is accomplished in one evening with only one ballot the last national convention requiring more than one ballot to nominate presidential candidate was the 1952 democratic national convention in which adlai stevenson was chosen on the third round of voting the nomi nating speech prominent or promising party figures are usually given the task of placing the names of candidates in nomination followed by series of seconding speeches the classic form of nominating speech which generally included long list of the candidates strengths and achievements avoided naming the candidate until the final paragraph this device known as the man who washttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30527crs29 intended to postpone the inevitable and timeconsuming demonstrations of delegate support which inevitably followed mention of the candidates name this classic formulation has largely disappeared from contemporary nomination speeches balloting following completion of the nominating and seconding speeches the role of states is called by the clerk of the convention position usually filled by the permanent secretary of the partys national committee the tally of delegate votes in each state is announced by the chair of the delegation often the partys highest ranking elected official in the state running count of vote totals is maintained usually culminating in spontaneous demonstration for the nominee when he or she receives enough votes to go over the top to secure the nomination following the completion of balloting the chair usually entertains motion to demonstrate party unity by making the nomination unanimous by acclamation in 1984 the republicans departed from tradition by nominating incumbent president ronald reagan and vice president george bush in joint ballot day four the fourth day of the convention is usually dominated by the nomination of the vice presidential candidate and the presidential and vice presidential nominees acceptance speeches nominating the vice president in current practice embraced by both parties the choice of vice presidential nominee remains the prerogative of the presidential candidate franklin roosevelt particularly in 1940 and 1944 is generally regarded as the first president who was able to impose his personal vice presidential choice in 1948 republican nominee thomas dewey followed suit when he chose earl warren as his running mate prior to these precedents party leaders usually chose the vice presidential nominee often an unsuccessful presidential candidate who had wide support or who was perceived as adding geographical balance to the ticket the concept of ticket balance remains an active element in contemporary nominations with such factors as geography age of vice presidential nominee and political ideology ie presidential nominee perceived as liberal will often choose more conservative running mate and vice versa figuring in the nominees choice that choice is rarely challenged although notable deviation from this tradition occurred in 1956 when democratic nominee adlai stevenson encouraged open nominations for vice president from the convention floor spirited contest ensued in which tennessee senator estes kefauver bested number of challengers on the third ballot including senators albert gore sr tn john f kennedy ma hubert humphrey mn and new york mayor robert f wagner incumbent presidents seeking reelection usually select their current vice presidents as running mates in the interest of continuity and party unity although there have been occasional efforts to deny an incumbent vice president place on the ticket for instance in 1956 some republican leaders unsuccessfully urged president eisenhower to replace vice president nixon more recently in 1976 vice president nelson rockefeller announced that he would not seek the nomination an actionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30527crs30 widely interpreted at the time as an effort to preserve party unity by opening the slot for more conservative candidate and to bolster president fords candidacy the procedure for nominating the vice presidential candidates mirrors that for the presidential candidates with the name placed in nomination by prominent party leader seconded by others and followed by roll call of the states often motion to nominate by acclamation occurs in place of the roll call acceptance speeches following his or her nomination the vice presidential candidate delivers an acceptance speech which is followed by the last major activity of the conventionthe presidential nominees acceptance speech democratic nominee franklin roosevelt in 1932 was the first candidate both to appear at national convention and to deliver his acceptance in person prior to that time committee of party dignitaries customarily visited the candidate to inform him of his nomination republican nominee thomas dewey inaugurated this practice in the gop in 1944 the candidates acceptance speech ranks with the keynote address as one of the highlights of the convention and it serves as its finale it provides an opportunity for the nominee to establish the tone content and general themes of the election campaign to come while providing incumbent presidents running for reelection with the opportunity to defend their record and seek renewed mandate from the

campaign organizations seek to build winning popular and electoral vote coalition labor day has traditionally marked the start of the general election campaign although party nominees make campaign appearances throughout the summer scheduling and media advertising begin in earnest in september dramatic kickoff events seek to draw the greatest possible attention to the national ticket democratic nominees traditionally began their campaigns with large labor day rally in detroits cadillac square however in recent years both parties have varied the site campaign structure immediately following the conventions the nominees are faced with several tasks these include uniting the party behind the candidates establishing general election campaign organization and preparing campaign plan campaign organizations in recent years presidential campaigns have been managed by separate candidate centered organizations adhoc groups assembled for the specific purpose of winning the election after the conventions these committees are usually expanded from the nominees primary organization to include key party professionals and staff from the campaigns of rival contenders for the nomination the campaign organization prepares the campaign plan schedules appearances by the nominees and surrogate campaigners conducts opposition and survey research manages the national media campaign and conducts both voter registration and get outthevote gotv drives the organization is organized on the national state and local levels overlapping especially on the local level existing party structures the campaign organization seeks to broaden the candidates appeal beyond committed partisans bringing his or her message to the largest number of independent voters possible and to dissatisfied members of the other party campaign plans campaign plans detail the strategy and tactics which the campaign organizations and candidates hope will bring winning combination of electoral and popular votes in the general election they specify the issues to be emphasized by the nominees and aspects of the candidates personal image they hope to project to the voters they include plans of attack on the platform issues and candidates of the opposition targeting of socioeconomic ethnic and religious groups deemed to be most amenable to the campaign message assessments of the tickets strengths and weaknesses in various states and decisions on which geographic areas the candidates should concentrate in order to assemble an electoral college majorityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30527crs32 campaign plans while often quite detailed tend to be flexible they seek to anticipate possible events emerging issues and fluctuations in voter attitudes allowing candidate and organization activities to be adjusted or fine tuned in order to strengthen the ticket as needed and to most effectively allocate resources candidate activity the contemporary model of presidential candidates crisscrossing the country on campaign tours participating in wide variety of political gatherings is actually fairly recent innovation in presidential campaign activity traditional methodsthe front porch campaign

groups of supporters and issuing occasional statements to the press the modern campaign style active campaigning by presidential candidates became more common in the 20th century in 1932 franklin d roosevelt conducted the first modern whistle stop campaign traveling 13000 miles by train and visiting 36 states in succeeding elections the whistle stop campaign in which candidates toured the country by train delivering speeches from the rear platforms became regular fixture of presidential politics president harry truman apparently holds the record covering 32000 miles and averaging 10 speeches day in his successful 1948 election bid during the same period candidates made increasing use of air travel another area in which roosevelt pioneered in 1932 he flew from new york to chicago to accept the democratic nomination the first candidate to do so in person modern presidential campaigns are almost exclusively conducted by air with the candidates able to cover both coasts in single day air travel enables candidates to touch base in media markets in different parts of the country on the same day maximizing their television exposure to voters sometimes the candidates appearances are confined to airport rallies after which the campaign plane flies to another metropolitan area the rose garden campaign variation of the front porch campaign survives in contemporary presidential

money spent by the clinton and dole general election campaigns by the candidates and national parties was devoted to electronic media advertising most all of it for television10 since the advent of broadcast political advertising first on radio and later tv candidate messages have grown progressively shorter the standard 30minute broadcast speech by nominee was succeeded by the fiveminute spot

into either of two categories positive or negative both approaches are likely to be used aired in different markets at different times as dictated by the campaign plan and changing circumstances positive messages positive political advertising seeks to portray the candidate and issues in favorable light the candidate his family career achievements and issue identifications are emphasized if

debates of 1858 as model for issues to be discussed before the voters in 1948 the first public debate among presidential candidates was held between thomas dewey and harold stassen radio broadcast in connection with the oregon republican presidential primary in 1952 joint televised appearance before the league of women voters national convention included several presidential candidates or their representatives although the event did not constitute debate the first televised debate occurred in 1956 between contestants for the democratic presidential nomination adlai stevenson and estes kefauver12 the first nationally televised presidential debate among general election contenders was held in 1960 and since 1976 these events have become regular fixture of presidential elections the 1960 debates in 1960 proposals were advanced for series of televised debates between the major party nominees in the general election however an obstacle to such debates lay in the federal communications commissi ons fcc interpretation of the federal communications acts equal time provision as it applied to political broadcast debates under this interpretation tv networks would be required to give equal time to presidential candidates of the numerous minor partieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30527crs35 if they broadcast the kennedynixon debates in public law 86677 congress temporarily suspended the equal time rule for presidential candidates for the duration of the 1960 campaign paving the way for four debates between john f kennedy and richard m nixon sponsored by the three commercial networks following the 1960 campaign the fcc returned to strict enforcement of the equal time rule furthermore at least one of the major party candidates in the next three elections lyndon johnson in 1964 and richard nixon in 1968 and 1972 expressed reluctance or unwillingness to participate in televised debates presidential debates since 1976 since 1976 televised debates have become regular expected feature of presidential campaigns both in the primary and general elections in 1975 the fcc reversed its longstanding interpretation of the equal time rule aspen institute 55

gerald ford and one vicepresidential debate between their respective running mates walter mondale and robert dole in 1980 president jimmy carter declined to participate in any debate that included independent john anderson whom the league invited based on his public opinion poll standing the fund ultimately sponsored two debates one in which only anderson and republican ronald reagan participated and the second with only carter and reagan anderson longer met the funds criteria by that point in 1983 the fcc modified its earlier ruling when it allowed broadcasters principally the commercial networks to sponsor debates through 1992 debates generally followed familiar format candidates appeared before panel of journalists made an opening statement took questions from the panel heard rebuttal by the opponent and generally ended with closing statements in 1984 president ronald reagan met democrat walter mondale in two debates sponsored by the fund while their running matesgeorge bush and geraldine ferrarodebated in single meeting in 1985 in an effort to assert party control over the debates the chairs of the democratic and republican national committees collaborated to establish nonpartisan commission on presidential debates after protracted negotiations 1988 agreement called for commission sponsorship of the first of two presidential debates with the fund sponsoring the second eventually the fund withdrew altogether and the commission sponsored both presidential events and the single vice presidential debate held in 1988 debates in 1992 were

of televised presidential debates televised debates now constitute one of the most important elements in presidential electoral politics they draw what is easily the largest audience of any public activity associated with the election the final presidential debate of the hotly contested threeway election of 1992 was watched by an estimated 97 million tv viewers for example14 candidates devote substantial time and effort in preparing for debates as it is widely believed that their performance may significantly affect their chances of electoral success extensive briefings and rehearsals are conducted to anticipate questions and issues which may be raised careful attention is paid to the nominees physical appearance in order to project an appealing if not presidential image survey research in the presidential election campaign the use of survey research is an integral aspect of contemporary electioneering the public watches the fluctuations in candidate matchups by polling organizations during the campaign but more important to the campaigns than the horse race data are the tracking polls conducted on continuing basis these surveys done by organizations on contract for the campaigns are designed to identify issues of concern to potential voters as well as to measure support for the nominee and his running mate among key demographic groups and in different geographical areas the tracking polls along with even more indepth devices like focus groups wherein carefully selected groups of representative voters are interviewed for their reactions to the candidates and their messages provide source of vital information for campaigns if support is low among particular social economic or ethnic groups or in certain states such resources as candidate appearances and political advertising are redirected and targeted to strengthen the campaign where needed in this way the candidates seek to change or minimize negative personal images or to emphasize their strengths and achievements based on trends monitored often on daily basis election day on election day voters in the 50 states and the district of columbia cast their ballots for electors pledged to their favored presidential and vice presidential nominees the law establishes the first tuesday after the first monday in november for the choice of all federal elective officers in the interest of convenience and economy most states and many localities also hold elections on federal election day elections for president and vice president are held every fourth year in years that are divisible by the number four ie 1988 1992 and 1996 congressional elections are held on this day every evennumbered year with those in between presidential contests termed midterm or offyear electionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30527crs38 history of selection the constitution originally made provision for election dates for presidential electors or representatives delegating the power to establish such times to congress in 1845 congress set uniform time for holding election s for presidential and vice presidential electors specifying that such individuals would be chosen on the first tuesday after the first monday in november every fourth year 5 stat 721 the states however were specifically empowered to set different times by legislation maine provided the best known exception to the november practice holding its presidential election on the first tuesday after the first monday in september until 1956 this practice sometimes regarded as bellwether for the rest of the us gave rise to the not always accurate phrase as maine goes so goes the nation as of 1960 maine has held its presidential election in conformity with the other states in 1872 congress extended the november election day to cover members of the house of representatives 17 stat 28 in 1915 following ratification of the 17th amendment to the constitution establishing direct popular election of senators the same date in november was also designated for senate elections 38 stat 384 reasons for selection several reasons are traditionally cited for the selection of november as the time for federal elections in largely rural and agrarian america harvesting of crops was completed by then and farmers were able to take the time necessary to vote travel was also easier before the onset of winter throughout the northern part of the country tuesday was chosen partly because it gave full days travel time between sunday often strictly observed as day of rest and voting day this was considered necessar when travel was either on foot or by horse and the only polling place in most rural areas was at the county seat the choice of tuesday after the first monday prevented elections from falling on the first

1787 at one point the delegates voted for selection by congress other proposals considered were for election by the people at large governors of the several states electors chosen by state legislatures and special group of members of congress chosen by lot eventually the matter was referred to committee on postponed matters which arrived at compromise the electoral college system size of the electoral college and allocation of electoral votes the electoral college as established by the constitution and modified by the 12th and 23rd amendments currently includes 538 members one for each senator and representative and three for the district of columbia under the 23rd amendment of 1961 it has continuing existence or function apart from that entrusted to it each state has number of

president and vice president this insures that they will be of the same party avoiding source of potential partisan divisiveness in the executive branch general ticket system in 48 states and the district of columbia all electoral votes are awarded to the slate that receives plurality of popular votes in the state this practice is variously known as the general ticket or winnertakeall system the general ticket system usually tends to exaggerate the winning candidates margin of victory as compared with the share of popular votes received for instance in 1996 bill clinton and gore won 492 of the popular vote as compared with 407 by bob dole and jack kemp the democrats electoral vote margin of 379 to 159 was much higher 704 of the total due to the fact that the democratic ticket received plurality vote in 32 states and the district of columbia district system currently maine and nebraska provide the only exception to the general ticket method awarding one electoral vote to the ticket gaining the most votes in each of their congressional districts and awarding the remaining two representing their senatorial allotment to the winners of the most votes statewide this variation more widely used in the 19th century is known as the district system the faithless elector the founding fathers intended that individual electors be free agents voting for the candidates they thought most fit to hold office in practice however electors are not expected to exercise their own judgment but rather to ratify the peoples choice by voting for the candidates winning the most popular votes in their state despite this understanding there is constitutional provision requiring electors to vote as they have pledged over the years number of electors have voted against the voters instructions known as the phenomenon of the unfaithful or faithless elector although number of states have laws which seek to bind the electors to the popular vote winners the preponderance of opinion among constitutional scholars holds that electors remain free agents moreover all of the seven votes of the faithless electors between 1948 and 1988 were recorded as cast 16 the most recent occurrence was in 1988 when west virginia democratic elector voted for lloyd bentsen for president and michael dukakis for vice president winning the presidency the 12th amendment of the constitution

by the newly elected congress which convenes on january 3 the winning candidates are then declared to have been elected minority presidents major criticism of the electoral college is that it could deny victory to the candidate with the most popular votes which can occur when one ticket wins the requisite majority of electors but gets fewer popular votes than its opponents popular vote winners have failed to win the presidency on three occasions since adoption of the 12th amendment in 1824 1876 and 1888 in 1824 the electoral vote was split among four candidates necessitating election by the

274in the event contingent election is necessary the house has two weeks between counting the electoral votes january 6 and inauguration day january 20 in which to elect president if it is unable to do so during this time the vice presidentelect assuming one has been chosen by the electors or the senate serves as acting president until the house resolves its deadlock in the event the senate has been similarly unable to elect vice president the speaker of the house of representatives serves as acting president until president or vice president is elected but he must resign the offices of both speaker and representative in order to so serve in the event there is speaker or the speaker fails to qualify then the president protempore of the senate the longest serving senator of the majority party becomes acting president under identical resignation requirements death of candidate before dece mber meeting of electors in the event presidential or vice presidential candidate of either party dies or resigns between the convention and the meeting of electors in december the rules of the major parties provide that their national committees shall meet and fill the vacancy in the democratic party the replacement nominee is approved by per capita vote of the members of the national committee for the republicans each state delegation to the national committee casts number of votes equal to its delegation to the national convention18 in 1972 the democratic national committee selected r sergeant shriver as vice presidential nominee to replace senator thomas eagleton who resigned as nominee after the national convention the republicans most recently replaced candidate on the national ticket in 1912 when vice president james s sherman died on october 30 meeting after the election the republican national committee elected nicholas m butler to receive republican electoral votes for vice president between december and january 6 if there is vacancy due to the death of the presidentelect after the electoral votes have been cast in the states most authorities maintain that the provisions of the 20th amendment apply section 3 specifies that the vice presidentelect becomes presidentelect in these circumstances some observers however maintain that there is presidentelect until the electoral votes are counted by congress on january 6 of the following year and that since living candidate received majority of electoral votes then the house would elect the president and the senate the vice president19 other sources dispute this inference however maintaining that congress has choice but to count all the ballots provided the person voted for was alive at the time they were cast20 moreover this interpretation is corroborated by the house report accompanying the

united states 72nd cong 1st sess hrept 72345 washington gpo 1932 p 5amendment which states that the votes under the above circumstances must be counted by congress consequently congress would declare that the deceased candidate had received majority of the votes21 the balance of opinion and precedent thus suggests that electoral votes cast for deceased candidate would be valid provided they were cast when the candidate was living final question is whether these provisions would apply if winning presidential candidate withdrew from consideration after the electoral votes were cast but before they were counted as the 20th amendment cites only the case of candidates death would congress count the votes proclaim the results and then have the option to declare the position of presidentelect vacant if so it is then arguable whether the vice presidentelect would become presidentelect on the other hand it can also be argued that section 3 of the 20th amendment provides only for cases in which presidentelect has died and would not cover other circums tances in this case it could be argued that sentence 2 of section 3 would apply if president shall not have been chosen before the time fixed for the beginning of his term or if the president elect shall have failed to qualify emphasis added then the vice president elect shall act as president until president shall have qualified under these circumstances the vice presidentele ct would serve only as acting president while the differences in these two situations may seem to be difference without distinction it can be argued that it is preferable for the nation to have duly inaugurated president serving full term to an acting president whose term of office and constitutional status are largely undefined this question would appear to merit further legal and constitutional study between january 6 and january 20 if winning presidential candidate dies after congress has counted the electoral vote the vice presidentelect becomes presidentelect under the provisions of the 20th amendmen t the new president would then be empowered under the 25th amendment to nominate person to fill the consequent vacancy in the vice presidency if both the president and vice presidentelect die before the inauguration but after the electoral votes are counted congress is then empowered by the 20th amendment to provide by law who shall act as president or the manner in which president is to be selected inauguration although the president and vice president were inaugurated on march 4 of the year after their election from 1789 to1933 the 20th amendment ratified in 1933 and effective in 1937 changed the commencement date of the presidential term of office to january 20 the purpose of this change which also moved the start of the congressiona l term from march 4 to january 3 was to shorten the time betweenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30527crs48 election and inauguration to eliminate lame duck sessions of congress
