home loan guaranty program the program authorized the guaranty of 20year loans at 4 interest rate under which the v guaranteed to pay the lender the lesser of 50 of the loan amount or 2000 if the borrower defaulted the loan term interest rate and the percentage and dollar guaranty limitations have been increased over the years the v loan guaranty program was an alternative to cash bonuses for the millions of men and women who served in the armed forces during world war ii there was the feeling that veterans during their service to the country had missed the opportunity to accumulate savings or to establish credit rating which could be the basis of borrowing to acquire home or establish business the loan guaranty program was an attempt to put them on par with their nonveteran counterparts the program also provided an inve stment outlet for the countrys postwar wealth under this program an eligible veteran may purchase home through private lender and the v guarantees to pay the lender portion of the losses if the veteran defaults on the loan although initially established to benefit veterans who had served during war times the program has been amended to extend eligibility to all parties who are on active duty or honorably discharged from the services the main objective of the current v home loan guaranty program is to help veterans finance the purchase of homes on favorable loan terms g8g142g138g157g158g155g142g156g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g561 g7g149g146g144g146g139g146g149g146g157g162g561 eligibility for v aguaranteed

eligible veteran may finance home through private lender and the v guarantees to pay the lender portion of losses that may be suffered as result of default by the borrower the guaranty amount depends on the date on which the loan was closed for loans closed on or after december 18 1989 the maximum v guaranty is as follows 1 50 of the loan amount for loans of 45000 or less 2 22500 for loans between 45001 and 56250 3 the lesser of 36000 or 40 of the loan for loans between 56251 and 144000 for loans in excess of 144000 the maximum guaranty amount is equal to the lesser of 25 of the loan or 25 of the freddie mac conforming loan limit the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 pl 110 289 provides that through december 31 2008 the v guaranty will be based on the temporary freddie mac conforming loan limit of 729750 and this implies maximum v guaranty of 182437 g6g152g160g151g153g138g162g150g142g151g157g561 the downpayment is matter of negotiation between the borrower and the lender standard lender practice is to permit eligible veterans to borrow up to four times the maximum v guaranty with down payment given the presen t v guaranty of 182437 an eligible veteran may purchase home valued at up to 729750 with downpayment for higherpriced homes the amount of cash down payment plus the amount of the v guaranty must equal at least 25 of the value of the home for example on 800000 home downpayment of 200000 would ordinarily be required but for veteran the v guaranty of 182437 would be subtracted and the required downpayment would be 17563 the veteran would therefore obtain v guaranteed loan of 782437 g15g138g161g146g150g158g150g561g15g152g155g157g144g138g144g142g561 v places limits on the maximum mortgage that the veteran may obtain except that the

entitlement and the selling veterans entitlement could be used to obtain another v aguaranteed loan under limited conditions veteran may obtain second v loan while the existing loan is outstanding the maximum v loan guaranty is set by law and has been periodically changed by the congress that guaranty amount is considered an entitlement to eligible veterans if veteran purchased home when the guaranty was lower than it is under existing law then the veteran is eligible to purchase another home with the unused guaranty the maximum loan in such case would be 75 of the appraised value of the home plus the unused guaranty of course the new home would have to become the principal residence of the veteran
