congress federal program performance review some recent developments summary on january 4 2005 hr 185 the program assessment and results act was introduced to require the office of management and budget omb to review government programs at least once every five years for purposes of evaluating their performance the bill would amend the government performance and results act of 1993 pl 10362 known as gpra to create statutory process resembling the program assessment rating tool part first used by omb during preparation of the fy2004 budget hr 185 would not however mandate the use of part specifically on march 10 2005 the house government reform committee held business meeting to mark up hr 185 the committee voted to report the bill favorably 19 yeas14 nays and the written report followed on march 17 house report 10926 hr 185 is very similar to hr 3826 as reported in the 108th congress house report 108768 and to s 2898 companion bill in the 108th congress hr 185 would amend gpra to require the omb director to review to the maximum extent practicable each federal program as defined by omb at least once every five years in conducting each assessment omb would coordinate with the relevant agency head to determine the programs to be reviewed and to evaluate the purpose design strategic plan management and results of the program in developing criteria for identifying programs to be assessed each year the director would consider the advantages of reviewing programs with similar purposes or functions the same year at least 90 days prior to completing the annual assessments listing of programs under review and the criteria being used would be available on the omb website and omb would also provide mechanism for public comment on the programs and criteria the assessments would be performed only by federal employees and the results would be transmitted to congress along with the next budget submission of the president would further amend gpra to require submission of strategic plans covering four years to be submitted by september 30 following year when there is presidential election various subjects are of potential interest in considering hr 185 one issue is its relationship with gpra and part some suggest that builds and improves upon the gpra framework and is needed to ensure that coordinated program reviews continue others point out that the part process which resembles is not well integrated with gpra and that unlike gpra does not require consultation with congress and other stakeholders additional concerns include avoiding partisanship in the review process and protecting the role of congress finally frameworks for systematic review of federal programs developed previously in sunset bills may be of interest in deliberations for example in 1978 s 2 95th congress as passed by the senate devised 10year schedule for review and reauthorization of most federal programs based on categories of function and

require that the office of management and budget omb review federal programs on fiveyear cycle provisions in the bill resemble the program assessment rating tool part currently used by omb as component in the budget formulation process although part is not explicitly referenced hr 185 is very similar to hr 3826 as reported in the 108th congress in order to place recent activities in congress and in the executive branch relating to review of federal programs in perspective this report considers briefly some background on gpra and part the report then reviews the development of hr 3826 in the 108th congress and of hr 185 in the 109th congress and finally discusses some concerns that have been raised regarding the legislation gpra gpra sought to promote greater efficiency effectiveness and accountability in federal spending by establishing new framework for performance management and budgeting in federal agencies gpra represents the latest in series of initiatives by the federal government dating back some 50 years which attempt to align spending decisions with expected results an approach commonly referred to as performance budgeting in complying with gpra agencies must set goals devise performance measures and then assess the results achieved2 gpra established three types of ongoing planning evaluation and reporting requirements for executive branch agencies strategic plans covering six years but to be revised at least every three years annual performance plans and annual reports on program performance gpra requires that agencies consult with congress when developing strategic plan and also consider views of other interested stakeholders such as state and local governments interest groups and private citizens as specified in the law and subsequent guidance from omb and the general accounting office gao now known as the government accountability office an agencys strategic plan must contain six key components 1 pl 10362 107 stat 285

implementation gao concluded that the statutory requirements under gpra have established solid foundation of resultsoriented performance planning measurement and reporting in the federal government4 in addition gao said gpra had also begun to facilitate the linking of resources to results although significant implementation challenges remained gao reviewed thencurrent strategic plans and annual plans and reports for six selected agencies and noted general improvements over their initial efforts however gao indicated that the evaluation component continued to be major weakness in agency strategic plans while the subject was generally addressed gao said that the strategic plans lacked critical information required by gpra such as discussion of how evaluations were used to establish strategic goals or schedule of future evaluations5 part in 2002 the bush administration developed part to provide more evaluation data on the results of federal programs part became component in the

respectively on program purpose and design strategic planning program management and program results and accountability in addition to common questions raised in all reviews part also divides programs into seven categories and asks additional questions unique to each type of program8 omb characterizes part as diagnostic tool with primary objective of the reviews being to improve program performance concurrently the part assessments help to link performance to budget decisions and provide basis for making recommendations to improve results9 for various reasons omb translates part numerical scores into qualitative ratings as listed below in table 1 table 1 programs by part rating categories 20022005 2002 2003 2004 2005 rating group n234 n407 n607 n794 effective 6 11 15 15 moderately effective

budget transmitted by the president on february 7 2005 an additional 187 programs received part reviews in 2005 and were reflected in the fy2007 budget submitted by the president on february 6 2006 with this fourth round nearly 800 programs constituting roughly 80 of the federal budget have been through part reviews with the final 20 to be examined in 2006 by the time the fy2008 budget is due to congress in february 2007 virtually all federal programs will have undergone at least one part review13 the distribution of programs by part rating categories has shown consistent percentage decline

welcome complement to the statutory management framework laid by gpra14 shortly thereafter on february 25 2004 representative platts with representative davis chairman of the full government reform committee as cosponsor introduced hr 3826 the program assessment and results act referred to as or sometimes just par to require omb to review all government programs at least once every five years for purposes of evaluating their performance the bill would amend gpra to codify the requirement for program reviews but does not mandate the use of part specifically in his accompanying remarks representative platts noted that gpra has laid solid foundation for agencies working with congress to set strategic goals and begin to utilize performance based information with the development of part the bush administration moved beyond the gpra requirements and introduced system of program review for evaluating the performance and results of federal activities according to representative platts the next logical step is to codify the requirement for coordinated evidencebased review of programs15 hr 3826 was referred to the committee on government reform and to the subcommittee on government efficiency and financial management subcommittee markup occurred on may 19 2004 chairman platts offered an amendment in the nature of substitute containing new provisions to enhance coordination between omb and the agency in the program review process to outline more specific criteria to be used in evaluating programs and in the report to congress to add termination date of september 30 2013 and to effect further technical changes this managers amendment was approved by voice vote the subcommittee also approved by voice vote an amendment offered by ranking member edolphus towns requiring the omb director to publish notice of programs slated for review draft performance goals and review criteria and to provide 60day period for public comment then the director would publish in the federal register for each program under review in given year the final performance goals assessment criteria and summary of public comments16 full committee action in the house markup of hr 3826 by the government reform committee followed on june 3 2004 during which representative platts offered another managers amendment in the nature of substitute making additional changes in the bill as approved by the subcommittee the previous month language in the substitute softened the requirement to review each program at least once very five years by inserting to the maximum

days prior to completion of the assessments list of programs under review that year and the criteria used to assess the programs and also to provide some mechanism for public comment in contrast the towns amendment established more formal 60day period for public comment and required that omb include summary of comments received with the publication of the final listing of programs performance goals and review criteria the substitute amendment was approved by voice vote representative towns offered an amendment to the substitute to restore the original language of his amendment as approved by the subcommittee but the amendment failed by recorded partyline vote of 9 democrats to16 republicans an amendment by representative henry waxman to require that the program reviews mandated by the bill be performed by the agencies rather than by omb was rejected by voice vote two amendments offered by representative chris van hollen were subsequently withdrawn following majority agreement that the language would be included in the bill as reported one of the amendments required that reviews be considered as inherently governmental functions only to be performed by federal employees and the other provided for classified appendix to part reviews as needed to make available to congress the classified information without public disclosure the government reform committee voted to report hr 3826 as further amended favorably by voice vote17 senate companion bill and house report senate companion bill s 2898 identical to hr 3826 as approved by the government reform committee in june 2004

would coordinate with the relevant agency head to determine the programs to be reviewed and to evaluate the purpose design strategic plan management and results of the program along with any other matters the omb director might consider appropriate in developing criteria for identifying programs to be assessed each year the director would take into account the advantages of reviewing programs

congress along with the next budget submission of the president provisions would be made for congressional access to classified information on program reviews consistent with existing law governing such disclosure the review requirement would expire september 30 2013 within six months after enactment of the director of omb would prescribe necessary guidance for implementation including definition of program would further amend gpra to require submission of strategic plans covering four years to be submitted by september 30 following year in which there is presidential election this new timetable for strategic plans if enacted would supersede current law whereby strategic plans cover six years but must be revised at least every three years developments in the 109th congress on january 4 2005 congressman platts and congressman tom davis reintroduced the program and assessment and results act as hr 185 in the 109th congress the bill is identical to hr 3826 as reported in the 108th congress except for one provision hr 3826 as reported included termination date of september 30 2013 hr 185 contains such sunset provision for the program assessment process20 in the 109th congress hr 185 had subcommittee referral the full government reform committee held business meeting to mark up the bill on march 10 2005 during markup representative towns again offered his amendment to require the omb director to provide notice and an opportunity for public comment in the federal register on each program to be assessed along with draft performance goals and draft evaluation criteria the final list of programs and final performance goals and evaluation criteria would likewise be published along with summary of all public comments21 second amendment from representative towns sought to restore sunset provision with the program assessments to terminate in 2013 the committee voted 1615 to defeat the towns amendments bloc during the markup representative waxman also offered his amendment to require that the program reviews be performed by the agency head rather than omb the waxman amendment failed by vote of 1715 the government reform 20 the sunset provision first appeared in the substitute amendment version offered by chairman platts at subcommittee markup of hr 3826 on may 19 2004 hr 3826 as reported to the house on oct8 2004 retained the termination date of sept 30 2013 21 the towns amendment to hr 185 was similar to that which he offered during subcommittee consideration of hr 3826 in the 108th congress when it was accepted the provisions were modified in the substitute version accepted at the full committee level in 2004 however and representative towns again offered his amendment at the full committee level where it was defeated crs8 committee then ordered hr 185 favorably reported to the full house of representatives by vote of 1914 with the written report filed on march 17 200522 possible concerns various subjects are of potential interest and relevance in conjunction with continuing consideration of the bills some issues that may garner attention in this regard are identified in the discussion that follows relationship of with gpra and part the house reports accompanying hr 185 and hr 3826 in the 108th declare that the bill builds on the gpra framework and is necessary to ensure the continuation of systematic program assessments in the future according to the committee majority in developing and using part omb has improved upon the gpra framework with the addition of tool for evaluating the results of discrete federal programs the next logical step is to codify the requirement for coordinated evidence based review of programs as such the par act is necessary to ensure that program assessments be required for this and future administrations requiring omb to be responsible for overseeing program assessment data will be great step forward in realizing the reforms envisioned by gpra and will make the federal government more efficient and results oriented23 on its website omb has characterized the connection between part and gpra as follows the part reinforces the ambitious outcomeoriented performance measurement framework developed under gpra also the part builds on gpra by encouraging agencies to integrate operational decisions with strategic and performance planning performance measures in gpra plans and reports and those developed or revised through the part process must be consistent24 as noted previously omb has also testified in support of statutory requirement for program assessment similar to part as compatible and desirable addition to gpra25 while part is not specifically mandated in the provisions in the bill are modeled on part on the other hand criticism has been voiced that part as currently formulated is not well integrated with gpra according to gao report agency officials we spoke with expressed confusion about the relationship between gpra requirements and the part process many view parts programbyprogram focus and the substitution of program measures as detrimental to their gpra planning and 22 us congress house committee

house subcommittee action crs9 reporting processes26 in another report gao observed it is not yet clear the extent to which part performance goals and measures will compete with agencies long term strategic gpra goals and objectives that were established in consultation with congress and other stakeholders27 minority views included in the house report in the 108th congress to accompany hr 3826 also pointed to differences between the gpra requirement for input from stakeholders the provision for public comment in the towns amendment that was accepted in subcommittee and the much weaker language in the managers amendment at the full committee which leaves to omb the determination what is an appropriate mechanism for public input according to the minority views the towns amendment would have created forum for public comment akin to the process frequently employed in federal rulemaking activities and an appropriate parallel to the government performance and results acts requirement for input from stakeholders when developing strategic plans28 discussion in the minority views of the report accompanying hr 185 in the 109th congress reiterated this position29 statutory program review by omb and the role of congress gpra requires agencies to set performance goals and evaluate programs results whereas under the white house through omb would determine assessment criteria and then take the lead in conducting the program reviews albeit in coordination with the relevant agency head the minority views in the report accompanying hr 3826 raised concern about possible partisanship in the arrangement for assessment noting we already have seen the problems that occur when omb reviews programs the part process has led to questionable ratings for number of programs in addition the statutory mandate in arguably might affect the constitutional separation of powers shifting power from congress to the executive by directing omb to evaluate programs without requiring any involvement by congress according to the minority views such program review process might not give adequate weight to congressional intent as reflected in authorization and appropriations laws along with guidance provided in report language30 minority views in the report accompanying hr 185 further noted congress should not authorize omb to effectively overrule congress and set the goals for federal agency activities31 26 us general accounting office performance budgeting observations on the use of ombs program assessment rating tool for the fiscal year 2004 budget

respect both to politicization and congressional prerogatives the article contended just as there has been concern that president bushs part evaluation is way of using program evaluation as justification for cutting funding from government par evaluation also suffers from seriously lopsided balance of powers the executive branch basically gets to decide what government should or should not be doing and how each program should best accomplish its goals33 in contrast to these views the reports accompanying hr 185 and hr 3826 reflecting the perspective of the majority do not envision such potential consequences in defending the need for the legislation the report accompanying hr 185 maintains information gleaned from these program reviews will be useful across the board to all stakeholders including members of congress taxpayers and agency officials the 2005 report contends in particular that program reviews under will provide congressional policy makers with the information needed to conduct more effective oversight to make betterinformed authorization decisions and to make more evidencebased spending decisions that achieve positive results for the american people34 meanwhile omb has recognized congress as an important partner in the part process the administration is inviting members of congress and other stakeholders to review the part details and provide feedback to omb on the conclusions omb and agencies have made in answers to part questions omb moreover avers the objectivity and transparency of the part review process and holds in general that because part is an evidencebased objective analysis the administration believes it is useful tool in budget and policy formulation for all branches of government35 since the review process in is modeled on part one might arguably associate ombs defense of part with the process as well previous review frameworks in sunset legislation the sunset label has been characterized as the popular name for statute which provides for the periodic termination of government agencies unless they are able to justify their existence36 sunset measures typically contain two basic components an action 32 omb

carrying the ultimate threat of termination and framework or guidelines for the systematic review and evaluation of past performance37 noteworthy similarity between and sunset legislation is thus the codification of requirement for systematic review and evaluation of federal programs in considering congress may want to examine how previous bills requiring reviews of federal programs have been structured for example provisions in the sunset act of 1978 as passed by the senate s 2 95th congress differed from those in hr 185 and hr 3826 in several respects as detailed below38 designation of review agent in the sunset act the entity charged with conducting the reviews was congress in hr 185 the reviewer is omb in coordination with agency heads despite this fundamental difference other features of the sunset review process may prove relevant in considering timetable for review the sunset act of 1978 would have required that virtually all federal programs be reviewed at least once every 10 years with 20 of the programs reviewed in each biennium hr 185 provides that virtually all programs be reviewed at least once every five years with 20 of the programs reviewed each year both measures similarly would divide the universe of federal programs into five groups but the sunset act provided two years for review of each group whereas hr 185 would see group reviewed every year exemptions from review the sunset act specifically exempted from review certain types of programs interest on the federal debt social security and federal retirement and disability programs medicare civil rights programs and enforcement judicial administration veterans benefits and income tax refunds the intent arguably was to protect essential programs from termination not to exempt them necessarily from program evaluation perhaps the concept if not the legislative content of provisions for exemptions from review in the 1978 legislation may be of continuing interest in devising statutory requirement for program review hr 185 contains such categorical exemptions but the provision indicating that all federal programs should be reviewed to the maximum extent practicable gives omb measure of discretion to exclude certain programs from the analysis according to the house report accompanying hr 185 this clause was intended to give minimum flexibility to the director should special circumstance arise where an assessment of certain programs is deemed unneeded the report goes on to say that the clause to the maximum extent practicable was not intended to give the director wholesale flexibility or the ability to exempt any programs from review without legitimate reason should the director seek to exempt any program from 37 in the 95th congress the senate passed sunset bill s 2 by vote of 871 and sunset measures have been introduced in each ensuing congress for further discussion of sunset proposals see crs report rl31455 federal sunset proposals developments in the

the federal government recent developments by virginia mcmurtry crs12 this review he shall notify the congress in writing explaining the specific reasons why the review is deemed unneeded39 with the house committee report expressing such concern regarding the discretion given omb to waive program reviews unilaterally previous language in proposed sunset bills may be relevant to further consideration of earlier sunset bills contained provisions creating statutory parameters for possible exemptions from program review rationale for devising groups the sunset act specifically delineated the programs to be reviewed each biennium by budget function and subfunction as set forth in the fy1979 budget grouping similar programs in the same review period while balancing the workloads of congressional authorizing committees who would be conducting the reviews in contrast hr 185 gives omb discretion to decide which 20 of federal programs are to be reviewed in given year the approach of referencing budget functions and subfunctions in statutory language might offer an alternative framework for review of federal programs that would allow less latitude for omb in deciding which programs to review in given year and concurrently help ensure the review of related programs with similar functions in the same cycle impact of reviews the sunset act contained an automatic termination feature with programs expiring unless they were specifically renewed by law hr 185 contains similar program termination provision40 instead as is the case currently with part the information derived from the reviews conducted pursuant to the requirements in hr 185 is expected to be used by omb in preparing the presidents budget omb has substantial discretion in how the part scores are used and has emphasized that the program evaluation data will never be the only consideration in budget deliberations for example the documentation accompanying the fy2007 budget provided the following explanation of how part scores affect budget decisions part ratings do not result in automatic decisions about funding clearly over time funding should be targeted to programs that can prove they achieve measurable results but part rating of ineffective or results not demonstrated may suggest that greater funding is necessary to overcome identified shortcomings while funding decrease may be proposed for program rated effectiveif it is not priority or has completed its mission however most of the time an effective rating is an indication that the program is using its funding well and that major changes are not needed41 with or without input from part or omb retains substantial discretion regarding the use of program performance information in preparing the presidents budget it will arguably require attentive congressional oversight to assess how 39 hrept 10928 p 6 this passage reiterates the explanation provided in hrept 108 768 p 9 40 in hr 3826 however the entire review process would have ended in 2013 basically after two review cycles unless congress acted to extend it 41 fiscal year 2007 budget of the united states government analytical perspectives washington gpo 2006 p 10 crs13 performance information has been translated into dollars in the presidents budget recommendations as noted in the materials accompanying the fy2007 budget
