barbara miles government and finance division updated july 11 2003 abstract on july 12 2002 fannie mae and freddie mac jointly announced that they would voluntarily register their common stock and begin filing financial reports with the sec both companies would retain the exemption regarding their mortgagebacked securities however ending the exemption would have the effect of requiring as matter of law greater disclosure for securities issued by the governmentsponsored enterprises gses and would remove one advantage that the gses have over their mortgage market competitors staff report published in january 2003 by three federal regulators found that additional disclosures by the gses would be useful to and not disruptive of the mortgagebacked securities market the gses subsequently announced that they would provide more information voluntarily order code rs21263 updated july 11 2003 fannie mae freddie mac and sec registration and disclosures mark jickling specialist in public finance government and finance division summary businesses selling securities to the public generally must register with the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21263 securities and exchange commission sec the governmentsponsored enterprises gses fannie mae and freddie mac1 are large public issuers but are exempt from sec registration and reporting requirements this privilege saves them millions of dollars each year and adds to the market perception that their securities have an implied guarantee from the federal government guarantee that is not officially extended the gses have announced that they would voluntarily register with the sec but it remains an issue whether voluntary disclosures will meet sec standards for other publicly traded firms ending the exemption would have the effect of requiring as matter of law greater public disclosure for individual securities issued by the gses and would remove an informational advantage that the gses have over their mortgage market competitors staff report published in january 2003 by three federal regulators found that additional disclosures by the gses would be useful to and not disruptive of the mortgagebacked securities market hr 2022 would end the gses exemption this report2 will be updated as events warrant background sec registration businesses that sell securities stocks or bonds to the public are required to register with the securities and exchange commission sec registration consists mainly of disclosure of information before public sale of securities can take place registration statement must be filed with the sec and prospectus must be made available to potential investors these documents must contain detailed information about the businesss operations management and financial condition and must describe the risks involved in the purchase of the offered security the initial 1 fannie mae is formally referred to in its chartering legislation as the federal national mortgage association and freddie mac as the federal home loan mortgage corporation 2 barbara miles former specialist in financial institutions contributed to this report crs2 disclosures are kept current through annual and quarterly reports which are also filed with the sec and made available to the public most large us corporations are registered with the sec several kinds of securities however are exempt from registration and disclosure requirements including us government bonds securities sold privately to limited number of sophisticated investors issued by certain small businesses or sold within single state in addition securities offered by two shareholderowned governmentsponsored enterprises fannie mae and freddie mac are exempt in the 108th congress hr 2022 proposes to repeal the exemption for these two gses3 the gses fannie mae and freddie mac are the dominant institutions in the secondary mortgage market they buy residential mortgages from the original lenders and finance the purchases either by issuing debt securities in denominations as small as 1000 or by repackaging the mortgages and selling them in the form of mortgage backed securities mbs investors in these types of bonds include mutual funds major financial institutions pension funds insurance companies and some individual investors in the us markets and central banks and other institutions in foreign countries in 2001 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21263 fannie mae issued 249 billion in longterm debt 18 trillion in shortterm debt and 528 billion in mbs freddie mac issued 208 billion in longterm debt 2 trillion in shortterm debt and 390 billion in mbs4 congress originally chartered fannie mae and freddie mac in 1968 and 1970 respectively to create secondary resale market and thereby improve the functioning of home mortgage markets generally to accomplish this the gses were granted special privileges not available to other privatesector firms in addition to the exemption from sec regulation both companies are exempt from state regulation and income taxation besides these direct benefits fannie mae and freddie mac have wide variety of privileges5 that add up to what is termed an implicit government guarantee that is participants in securities markets infer from the privileges that the treasury would intervene rather than allow either company to fail as result the gses are able to issue their securities at lower interest rates than other private borrowers providing them significant advantage over their fully private sector competitors 3 there are three other gses the farm credit system and the federal home loan bank system are cooperatively held by their institutional membercustomers and do not register farmer mac which is publicly held is required to register with the sec sallie mae has nearly completed the transition out of gse status and now registers with the sec as do other publicly held companies 4 both corporations also issued large amounts of derivatives for riskmanagement purposes such securities however are not generally subject to sec registration because they are not available to the public 5 these include line of credit with the us treasury of 225 billion each eligibility of securities for federal reserve open market purchases eligibility for unlimited investment by depository institutions eligibility of securities to collateralize public deposits and use of the federal reserve as fiscal agent crs3 removing the exemption arguments pro and hr 2022 proposes to make fannie mae and freddie mac subject to the same disclosure and registration requirements that apply to other firms that sell securities to public investors the immediate effects of repealing the exemption would be two 1 the gses would as matter of law rather than on voluntary basis have to disclose periodically information about themselves their operations and their securities and 2 the gses would have to pay registration fees to the sec these effects raise questions as to what new information would be disclosed and whether such disclosure would better protect investors only at the cost of harming the liquidity of the mortgage market or endangering the practice of locking in interest rates for home buyers and owners further would the payment of fees necessarily result in rise in mortgage interest rates new information supporters of removing the gses exemption argue that sec disclosure would improve the quality of information available to public investors about the gses and the securities they sell bringing it up to par with other private sector corporations the question is raised why fannie mae and freddie mac should be the only members of the fortune 500 not to report to the sec the exemption contributes to the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21263 perception that in crisis the government would treat the gses more like government agency such as ginnie mae6 than like private corporation and not allow them to fail the gses have grown rapidly in recent years and have returned substantial earnings to their shareholders and some observers believe that they are willing to take on more risk than other market participants because of the implicit government guarantee the bush administrations fy2003 budget noted that failure of gse could have strong repercussions in financial markets7 defenders of the exemption argue that the gses voluntarily make disclosures that are comparable to or better than what sec regulations would require fannie mae and freddie mac publish annual and quarterly reports and provide information to congressional committees and regulatory agency the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo further on july 12 2002 fannie mae and freddie mac jointly announced that they would register their own common stock with the sec and begin filing their financial statements in accordance with sec requirements beginning perhaps as early as 2003 in march 2002 fannie mae announced that it would post data about insider transactions in its securities on its web site continuing trend of voluntary disclosures in 2003 the gses agreed to publish more detailed information about the mortgages that back up their mbss thus opponents argue that repeal of the exemption would merely make what the gses are already doing or proposing to do legal requirement and would not provide significant new information to investors opponents of the exemption however claim that sec registration would substantially improve disclosures about individual debt securities issues and especially 6 the government national mortgage association ginnie mae is part of the department of housing and urban development it guarantees securities that are backed by mortgages that are already governmentbacked such as vaguaranteed and fhainsured loans 7 the fy2003 budget pointed out that from the end of fy1997 though fy2001 the gses combined mortgage portfolios grew 150 and mortgagebacked securities guarantees grew 40 their combined debt rose during the same period at an annualized rate of 25 crs4 about mbs issues they point to several areas where disclosure about risk has been less detailed than it would be under the regular sec regime for example the gses disclose information about the underlying mortgages that support mortgagebacked bonds on an aggregate basis for number of similar issues of securities rather than for each individual issue the aggregating of data about such loan characteristics as initial and average time to maturity interest rates paid by homeowners on individual loans the initial size of loans and the geographic locations of mortgaged properties may conceal small but perhaps significant variations in the pools of mortgages that back individual mbs issues in january 2003 the treasury ofheo and the sec published staff study that found that disaggregated poollevel disclosures would be useful to investors and would not be disruptive to the mbs market the study recommends that enhanced information be provided if possible through market forces and voluntary disclosure rather than government action such as repeal of the exemption8 following publication of the study the gses announced that they would voluntarily begin to provide poollevel information for their mbs issues9 sec registration is always based on disclosure of risks and characteristics related to httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21263 the particular issue of securities that is being registered if investors received more specific information about the mortgage pools behind individual mbs issues they would presumably be able to price those issues more efficiently such information is routinely available at the individual loan level for nongse mbs issues10 an argument in favor of removing the exemption is that only their protected monopoly status allows the gses to withhold this data from the market some market participants believe moreover that the gses are able to profit from their information advantage by cherrypicking or retaining the mbs pools with the most attractive characteristics while selling those with less attractive characteristics however the treasuryofheosec report found evidence of impropriety in portfolio selection11 liquidity and rate lockin concerns the other side of the informational efficiency argument is that too much information could harm the liquidity of mbs issues and raise mortgage interest rates standardization of the risks of mbs issues has two main effects it lowers the costs of information to investors and it encourages investors to treat all mbs issues with the same basic characteristics especially interest rates on the underlying mortgages alike ginnie mae securities issues deliberately suppress some information in order to get their mbss treated in generic fashion with trading based on 8 department of the treasury ofheo and sec staff report enhancing disclosure in the mortgagebacked securities markets january 2003 50 p hereinafter cited as staff report 9 fannie mae fannie mae provides additional information on new mbs disclosures announces user enhancements to mbs section of corporate web site news release february 4 2003 see httpwwwfanniemaecomnewsreleases20032376jhtml for freddie macs announcement see httpwwwfreddiemaccomnewsarchivesmbs2003pcdisclsre_0203html 10 the data are important to understanding kind of interestrate risk known as prepayment risk when interest rates fall mortgages tend to be refinanced this helps homeowners who get better rate but hurts investors who lose the investment they thought they had the information problem occurs when mortgage characteristics other than interest rates that are relevant to prepayment are not disclosed 11 staff report p 42 crs5 the coupon rate of issues rather than characteristics of mortgages in the pool all of which are themselves governmentguaranteed fannie mae and freddie mac are attempting to do the same thing by not revealing some of the relevant information on mortgages underlying individual mbs issues this strategy while increasing liquidity because more issues appear interchangeable has limits when mortgages prepay faster than expected because of undisclosed data investors may reprice all mbs in more generic way than is warranted it is one thing if standardized mortgage pools are actually standard it is something else if they are not the greater the prepayment discrepancies within the mortgage pools backing securities the more valuable the information is and the greater the possibility that investors who cannot distinguish between issues will penalize the broader market raising mortgage interest rates across the board12 fannie mae and freddie mac also argue that sec registration will interfere with current arrangements that allow home buyers to lock in mortgage rate at the beginning of negotiations with lenders even though market interest rates may rise before final settlement this is possible because mortgages are in effect pooled and securitized before httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21263 they are actually signed investors agree to accept certain interest rate and this rate can be guaranteed to home buyers if prospectus were required for each bond issue the gses argue it would not be possible to lock in fixed rate until settlement and prospective home buyers would be exposed to interest rate risk supporters of sec registration for the gses however point to private issuers of bonds backed by jumbo mortgages which the gse charters prevent them from buying and pooling and say that home buyers in these markets are able to lock in presettlement mortgage rates in any case the gses should be able to hedge the interest rate risk by using interest rate derivatives or other risk management tools with minimal impact on home buyers impact of sec fees the gses argue that sec registration and reporting will impose costs that will ultimately be borne by home buyers the gses current charters effectively give them subsidy which allows them to raise capital at lower cost which translates into lower mortgage rates there are costs associated with sec registration that the gses do not now bear an added paperwork burden and registration fee collected by the sec13 however the gses already bear the major costs associated with issuing securities the compensation of wall street underwriters who find investors willing to buy and the voluntarily or marketmandated disclosure of information as noted above there is obvious reason to assume that sec registration will have any significant impact on transaction volume or prices in the robust secondary mortgage market opponents of the exemption point out that many other issuers of securities find the us markets attractive places to sell debt and equity regardless of registration costs the possible impact on mortgage borrowers should also be insignificantly and unmeasurably 12 there is some evidence that this has happened in 2001 the investment bank bear stearns released an analysis advising their customers that the prepayment problems of undisclosed gse mbs were making the betterdisclosed nongse securities more attractive see bear stearns co nonagency mortgage research dated may 29 2001 13 under section 6b of the securities act of 1933 issuers pay fee of 92 for every million dollars in new securities sold or just under 1100th of 1 the fee rate is adjusted periodically so that all sec fees collected approximate the cost of running the agency crs6 small at less than one cent per 100 of securities issuance the fee is easily absorbed by the gses whose funding advantage is about 40 times larger14 recent developments in january 2003 freddie mac announced that it had concluded that certain accounting policies it had adopted were incorrect and that earnings for the past few years would have to be restated in june freddie dismissed its top three executives and released more information about the accounting problem including an estimate that reported earnings for 2000 through 2001 would be raised by 1545 billion it appears that freddies former management the top three executives were dismissed sought to smooth out reported earnings by deferring earnings that should have been recognized under gaap to future years the episode raises questions about the value of voluntary sec reporting freddies press release of june 25 2003 stated that past disclosure practices did not meet standards that would have been required of freddie mac had it been an sec registrant for more information about the accounting restatement see crs report rs21567 accounting and management problems at freddie mac by mark jickling httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21263 conclusion fannie mae and freddie mac were created with blanket exemption from sec disclosure requirements over time market forces the demand of bond buyers for relevant information and pressure from congress and the regulators have led the gses long way down the path of voluntary disclosure each new disclosure undertaken voluntarily makes the exemption less significant reducing the urgency of the case for requiring the gses to register like any other publicly traded firm recent accounting and management problems at freddie mac however may indicate need for more rigorous gse oversight at the same time when voluntary disclosure programs appear to have harmful effects on secondary market liquidity on gse profitability or on the costs of home ownership justifications for retaining the exemption also lose persuasiveness 14 fannie mae and freddie mac receive an estimated subsidy from their implied guarantee of about 41100ths of 1 and retain about 16 of that for their shareholders while passing through about 25 quarter of percentage point in the form of lower mortgage rates see congressional budget office federal subsidies and the housing gses may 2001
