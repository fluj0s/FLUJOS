from druidldgocolumbiaedu gordon jacoby to kbriffaueaacuk subject russia date sun 26 jan 1997 141632 0500 hi keith as you are aware the situation in russia is very uncertain with their unfortunate economic condition especially science support there is interest hope and dots on maps showing intent but actual activity is difficult to judge in the particular area i am interested in the taymyr there is current active treering research going on although it has been previously sampled and some reports are in preparation ed probably told you that i have submitted proposal to do work there my understanding is that unless there is some external funding support such as my project treering sampling there is in abeyance several people including yourself recognize the great potential in the region from my perspective it seems that the polar urals are being studied yokutia to the far east is being studied some work has been done by szeicz and macdonald at the lena but there is need for more intensive effort in taymyr i would like to hear your perspective on the situation in related topic i am thinking of using the option in eds new arstan to use the regional standardization method in russia and other locales the establishment of trees is episodic in particular in alaska glenn juday has data showing cohort groups being established in favorable times in taymyr also the establishment of trees is not evenly distributed through time there are times of growth and times of demise this concerns as it could affect the development of regional curve do you see problems arising from this i am also curious to hear any comments you care to make about my recent letter to fritz schweingruber he obviously will pursue any style of sampling and analyses he chooses to my only contention is that he should not represent his data as the definitive treering information particularly ringwidth data his opinions are influential but there is an accumulating body of ringwidth data that clearly shows him to be missing much important information with his style of sampling scientists and others should be aware of this fact cheers gordon
