on december 2 2001 the enron corporation filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in federal court in new york enron sponsors retirement plan 401k for its employees to which they can contribute portion of their pay on taxdeferred basis as of december 31 2000 62 of the assets held in the corporations 401k retirement plan consisted of shares of enron stock some enron employees held even larger percentages of enron stock in their 401k accounts the companys bankruptcy substantially reduced the value of many of its employees retirement accounts shares of enron which in january 2001 traded for more than 80 per share were in january 2002 worth less than 70 cents each the financial losses suffered by participants in enrons 401k plan have prompted questions about the laws and regulations that govern these plans this crs report describes the current laws governing the holding of employer stock in employee retirement plans and summarizes some key policy questions that pension analysts have raised about holding such stock in defined contribution retirement plans this report will be updated as further legislative developments occur the two kinds of retirement plans sponsorship of retirement plans by employers is voluntary but any firm that sponsors plan for its employees must abide by the standards established under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 pl 93406 popularly known as erisa in order for plan to be taxqualified that is for contributions to the plan and investment earnings on those contributions to be eligible for deferral of federal income taxes the plan must also comply with the relevant sections of the internal revenue code of 1986 retirement plans are legally classified as either defined benefit plans or defined contribution plans in defined benefit plan an employer pays retired workers pension benefit based on predetermined formula usually related to the employees length of service and average salary in the years immediately preceding retirement each year the employer must contribute money to pension trust to fund the retirement benefits that the firms employees earned that year trustee or other fiduciary appointed by the employer determines how to invest those funds fiduciary is an individual company or association responsible for managinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21115crs2 anothers assets broad guidelines prescribed by federal law require the funds to be invested solely in the best interests of the workers and retirees covered by the plan defined contribution plan is much like savings account maintained by the employer on behalf of each participating employe the most common defined contribution plan is the 401k plan named for section of the internal revenue code that was added by the revenue act of 1978 pl 95600 in 401k plan the employee can make pretax contributions to retirement account these contributions are often matched by the employer in whole or in part up to some percentage of the employees base salary typically participants can allocate the investment of their account balances among menu of investment options selected by the employer andor fiduciaries appointed by the employer employer stock is frequently one of those options the value of the retirement benefit that the worker receives will depend on the balance in the account which is the sum of all the contributions that have been made plus interest dividends and capital gains or losses the worker usually has the choice of receiving these funds in the form of lifelong annuity as series of fixed payments over period of years or as lump sum in recent years some employers have converted their traditional pensions to hybrid plans that have characteristics of both defined benefit and defined contribution plans the most popular of these hybrids has been the cash balance plan cash balance plan looks like defined contribution plan in that the accrued benefit is defined in terms of an account balance the employer makes contributions to the plan and pays interest on the accumulated balance however in cash balance plan the account balances are merely record of the participants accrued benefit they are not individual accounts owned by the participants legally therefore cash balance plan is defined benefit plan the locus of risk in db and dc plans in defined benefit plan the employer bears the investment risk of the plan while in defined contribution plan the employee bears the investment risk in defined benefit plan the employer promises to provide retirement benefit equal to certain dollar amount or percentage of the employees pay the employer contributes money to pension trust that is invested in stocks bonds real estate or other assets retirement benefits are paid from this trust fund the employer is at risk for the amount of retirement benefits that have been promised to employees and their survivors if there are insufficient funds in the pension trust to pay the accrued benefits the firm that sponsors the pension plan is legally obligated to make up the difference by paying more money into the pension fund in defined contribution plan the employer bears risk beyond its obligation to make the contributions it has promised to each employees retirement account in these plans it is the employee who bears the risk that his or her retirement account will increase in value by an amount sufficient to provide adequate income during retirement if the contributions made to the account by the employer and the employee are insufficient or if the securities in which the account is invested lose value or increase in value too slowly the employee risks having an income in retirement that is not sufficient to maintain his or her desired standard of living if this occurs the worker might choose to delay retirement the pension benefit guaranty corporation the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc is federal government corporation established by erisa to insure pension benefits in privatesector defined benefit plans by law the pbgc insures only defined benefit plans it does not insure defined contribution retirement plans such ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21115crs3 1

times nov 22 2001profit sharing plans or 401k plans the pbgc currently insures pension benefits for more than 43 million workers in almost 38000 privatesector defined benefit pension plans the insurance provided by the pbgc is financed through premiums levied on all privatesector defined benefit pensions this premium set by congress is 19 per year per participant an additional premium of 9 per 1000 of unfunded vested benefits is levied against underfunded plans because these plans present the greatest risk of default when fully funded plan terminates perhaps because an employer chooses to end the pension plan the plan provides benefits either by purchasing an annuity from an insurance company or by paying out the benefits owed to each participant in lumpsum when an underfunded plan terminates either because the employer is unable to properly fund the plan or because the pbgc ends it to protect the interests of participants or the pbgc the pbgc takes over the plan as trustee and uses its own assets and any remaining assets in the plan to make sure that participants will receive pension benefits within legal limits the pbgcs maximum benefit guarantee is set each year under provisions of erisa for pension plans that end in 2002 the maximum guaranteed benefit is 3579 per month for worker retiring at age 65 the guarantee is lower for payments beginning before age 65 or if the pension includes benefits for survivor employer stock in retirement plans erisa limits the amount of employer stock that can be held in defined benefit plan to 10 of plan assets to ensure that the assets of pension trust funds are diversified beyond the assets of the company itself1 such diversification reduces the risk that pension fund would become insolvent as result of the company that sponsors the plan going bankrupt congress has generally exempted defined contribution plans from limits on investing in employer stock2 except for certain plans that require salary deferrals equal to more than 1 of employee pay to be used for purchasing employer stock3 hr 3463 deutsch would limit employer stock to 10 of the total assets in 401k plan that are attributable to employee contributions employer contributions would not be subject to the limit s 1838 boxer and hr 3640 pascrell would limit employer stock to 20 of the assets held by any individual in 401k plan should employee ownership of employer stock in 401k be limited to some fixed percentage of the total as of december 31 2000 62 of the assets in the enron corporations 401k plan consisted of shares of enron stock4 the company has estimated that 89 of this stock was purchased by employees and that the remainder represents the corporations matching contributions to the plan most of which were made in the form of shares of enron stock5 it is not unusual for defined contribution plans to hold employer stock that comprises more than 10 of the plans assets according to survey of 428 employers conducted by the benefits consulting firm hewitt associates 296 of the assets of these firms 401k plans was invested in the employers stock as of october 31 2001 fiftyfive percent of plans offered the employers stock as an

employees can invest in employer stock the most common limit is 25 another recent survey found that the concentration of employer stock in some 401k plans is greater than 50 of total 401k assets see

company stock some also offer company stock as an investment option that employees can purchase for their 401k accounts contributing company stock is popular with employers because when it consists of newlyissued shares or shares from the company s treasury it does not reduce the companys cash flow moreover as with cash contributions stockhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21115crs5 6 shlomo benartzi excessive extrapolation and the allocation of 401k accounts to company stock the journal of finance vol 56 5 october 2001contributions are fully deductible as business expense for income tax purposes making contributions of stock also puts shares into the hands of group of people the firms employees who are less likely to sell their shares either when there is hostile tender offer for the company or when the firms reported profits are less than expected some observers contend that if companies were forced to contribute cash rather than stock many companies might stop making matching contributions to their 401k plans others point to research suggesting that workers whose employers make matching contributions with company stock are more likely to put their own contributions into company stock thus risking substantial losses from decline in the price of their employers stock6 under s 1992 kennedy defined contribution plan could either 1 permit employees elective deferrals to be invested in employer securities or 2 make the employers contribution in employer securities but not both should there be limits on when and how long employers can suspend 401k transactions companies sometimes suspend transactions in their 401k accounts most commonly when they are changing plan administrators installing new software or performing other routine administrative tasks that require temporary suspension of account activity according to the office of regulations and interpretations of the us pension and welfare benefits administration there is statutory or regulatory limit on the length of time during which participants can be blocked from re allocating assets or conducting other transactions in 401k plan plan sponsors and administrators have certain rights and responsibilities as fiduciaries of the plan such as crediting each individual participants account with contributions and recording investment earnings or losses fiduciaries therefore have the right to take reasonable actions to ensure that these and other administrative tasks are carried out in an orderly and efficient manner nevertheless when plan sponsor suspends transactions it still must act in the interest of the plan participants erisa 404c1 states that when plan permits participant or beneficiary to exercise control over the assets in his account neither the plan sponsor nor the plan administrator are liable for investment losses that the participant may incur whether the plan sponsor or administrator is relieved of such responsibility depends in part on the ability of the participant to exercise control over the assets in his account in lawsuit filed against the enron corporation plan participants have alleged that the company deprived plan participants of control over their accounts by locking down the plan ie prohibiting reallocation of assets during period of time when revelations about the companys finances were causing the share price of enron stock to fall they argue that during the lockdown the plan assets were under the control of the plan sponsor rather than the plan participants therefore they contend the plan sponsor should be held legally responsible for carrying out the fiduciary duty for diversification of plan assets defined at erisa 407a2 hr 3509 bentsen would require 401k plan sponsors to secure permission from the department of labor before suspending transactions in the plan and to provide 90 days notice of any suspension hr 3657 miller ca hr 3762 boehner s 1919 wellstone s 1921 hutchison s 1969 hutchinson s 1971 grassley and s 1992 kennedy would require plans to give participants written notice 30 days before lockdown begins hr 3657 and s 1919 would limit lockdowns to more than 10 consecutive business days

employer sponsored plans november 13 1997 httpwwwdolgovdolpwbapublicadcounacemerhtmshould employers be able to compel employees to hold on to employer contributions of company stock until age 50 or later plan sponsors can require participants to hold on to employer stock contributed by the employer according to the hewitt associates survey 34 of 401k plans that match employee contributions with employer stock require participants to reach certain age typically 50 or 55 before they can sell it of the firms that match with employer stock only 15 allow their employees to sell the stock immediately nineteen percent do not permit diversification at any time according to study of 401k plans by fidelity investments only 4 of plans that match with company stock let participants immediately sell those shares employees participating in employee stock ownership plans esops are permitted to begin diversifying their holdings of employer stock when they have completed at least 10 years of participation under the plan and have attained age 55 26 usc 401a28 in 1997 majority of the pension and welfare benefits administration advisory council working group on employer assets in erisa plans recommended that participants in 401k plans should be able to sell employer stock when they become vested in the plan7 s 1838 and hr 3640 would permit vested participants to sell employer stock 90 days after it is credited to their 401k accounts hr 3463 would allow participants in 401k plans to sell employer stock 3 years after the stock is contributed to their accounts hr 3657 would permit vested participants to sell employer stock 30 days after it is credited to their 401k accounts it also would reduce the maximum vesting period for defined contribution plans from three years to one year should 401k accounts be insured by the federal government defined benefit pensions are insured by the pension benefit guaranty corporation which was established by erisa in 1974 insuring defined contribution plans would raise several difficult questions about the specific kinds of risk to be insured against 1would investors be insured only against losses directly attributable to the collapse of their employers shares in that case regulating risk by requiring diversification would be simpler and cheaper than insuring defined contribution plans 2 would investors be insured against wider investment risk such as business failures in particular industrie s or sectors of the economy in which they had invested 3 would investors be insured against market risk such as general decline in stock prices in any case it would be challenging to price the insurance appropriately all 401k investors would ultimately pay for the insurance through higher administrative fees reduced employer contributions or both in addition to defining the specific risks to be insured against there is the potential problem that offering insurance for 401ks might actually encourage workers to engage in risky investment behavior something that insurers call moral hazard investors might choose to invest in companies that are especially risky because they would have nothing to lose the effects of offering insurance for 401k plan losses could lead to events similar to the savingsandloan crisis of the 1980s depositors were willing to place their money with risky savings and loans those that paid the highest interest rates because they knew that if the sl failed they would get their money back from the federal government through federal deposit insurance hr 3657 and s 1992 would direct the pbgc to study the feasibility of system of insurance for defined contribution retirement plans
