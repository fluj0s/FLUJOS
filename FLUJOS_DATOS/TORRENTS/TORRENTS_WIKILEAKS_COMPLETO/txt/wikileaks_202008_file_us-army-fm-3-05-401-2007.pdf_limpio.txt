characteristics of the deliberate assessment elements may be taskorganized fo r each deliberate assessment mission 214 the deliberate assessment consists of two cat egoriesthe initial assessment conducted upon entry into the designated ao and the rapid assessment when conducting initial and rapid assessments ca soldiers obtain information by c onducting direct observation using checklists and interviewing civilians in various settings gathering inform ation should not be haphazard proce ss as with all military missions this task requires wellformed pr actical plan the basic steps of this plan include the following z determine what information to gather z determine the most likely source such as pers on place event or reference from which to obtain the information z prepare list of questions for the source that supports the information requirements z engage the source for example research references observe activit ies and interview individuals z compile the results obtained in the step above z report the results according to unit sop 215 every assessment must contain welldefined geogr aphical boundaries and time frames within which the assessment is valid as mere snapshots in time assessments and surveys must be updated as often as necessary to remain current at minimum ca ssessments and reports cover the five wswho what when where and why to make this data and information easy to ter into database reports are quantifiedsuch as the number of hospital beds in hos pital the kilowatt output of power plant and so on it is also crucial to georeference what is

assessments 216 cao and cmo planners identify those information requirements necessary to satisfy information gaps and assumptions made during the conduct of the preliminary assessment these information requirements result in tasks to subordinate ca t eams and units to conduct the initial ca assessment upon entry into the designated ao the obj ectives or focus of the initial asse ssment should be broad but not so broad that specific objectives cannot be assigned for example assess ge neral conditions of the ao in the areas of public health public safe ty public works and u tilities and civil information cats conducting initial assessments must be aware of the security situation at ll times 217 during the initial assessment the ca t takes cursory look at the cond itions of the area as directed by the mission statement using the ca area assessment format found in appendix and t he principles of metttc for analyzing situation the cat visits locations that will most likely provide the information it has been directed to find sources of pertinent information include hn officials munic ipal government and public safety offices hospitals medical clinic s food distribution centers and igo and ngo relief sites 218 products of the initial assessment include situation reports sitreps spot reports and requests for assistance the findings of an initia l assessment may lead to refined mission statements updates to the ca area study cmo annex to the base order and reallocation of forces and resources rapid assessments 219 the rapid assessment is determination of current conditi ons capabilities or attitudes of specific village facility or population group the objectives or focus of the rapid assessment should be well defined for example assess the generating capacity of the xyz power plant or assess the needs of town x to sustain the populace for the next 72 hours the cats conducting rapid assessments must continuously be aware they have authority to comm it resources during the assessment process and they must be maintain situational awareness of the security environm ent at all times 220 rapid assessments are normally tasked during the decide step to appropriate elements that will be in position to satisfy information shortfalls rapid assessments can also be directed for mergencies single issues or special situations such as damage assessm ent incident to claim or to determine the current conditions of specific location an example of rapid assessment format may be found in appendix formats may vary among ca units supported elements and interagency elements 221 products of the rapid assessment include updated sitreps that portray actual conditions project nominations and interim or final reports validating the status of projects the

factors of metttc while executing these actions ca soldiers generate rou tine cao and cmo briefings and reports according to unit sop these briefings and reports feed directly into the evalua step in which soldiers monitoring cao determine when the deliver step is over and transition step may begin evaluate 234 the evaluate step is vital part of the ca methodology the evaluate step should not be confused with the assess step of the methodology this step actually begins during the develop and det ect step and continues through the deliver step 235 once execution of the cao and cmo plan begins every task performed or mission executed requires critical evaluation to determine the results of the action the evaluation validates the cao and cmo concept of operations and determines whether th established moes and mops have been met it also helps commanders decide when and how to adjust the plan when to develop new plans to address unforeseen consequences of operations and when to terminate or transition an operation 236 during the evaluate step evaluators at the strategic and operational levels focus on the moes established for the operation during the decide step at the tactical level the focus i s on mops evaluations determine the sustainability of any projects or programs initiated during th deliver step evaluators look at aspects of the 14 ca functional specialties to determine

infrastructure and other systems is for cmo planners to apply the 14 polm il factors that pertain to each subsystem the info rmation derived ultimately describes the effectiveness vulnerabilities susceptibilities and the accessibility of each system moreover the proce ss highlights the critical or key decision makers those that may influence the decision makers and those tha t carry out the

incl udes the following z history in broad terms history serves three purposesto understand the past highlight the present and cast light on the future the cmo staff planner studies the history of an for four reasons discern pattern of behavior to discern if possible pattern of behavior in culture means to help predict how populace will react to various acti ons of the force consider for example the introduction of external military forces into foreign territory studying civil affairs analysis and planning process 5 july 2007 fm 305401mcrp 3331a 39 joa systems polmil factors political military economic soci infrastructure information history natural environment cultural environment political systems political economy role of the military ideology religion foreign influence leadership regional perspectives national interests ethnicity media figure 34 joint operation area systems and po liticalmilitary factors data matrix example history may reveal that the populace embraces exte rnal military forces as stabilizing entity conversely history may instruct that the populace will likely reject the in tervention force as violation of sovereignty and unwanted meddling in what they perceive to their internal affair s matter how chaotic those affairs may appear to external states determining preference in this case is crucial to advising the commander and developing an effective cmo plan understand how populace perceives its history it is more important to the cmo planner to understand how populace perceives its history than to be an expert in the factual historical recordperception is reality also there may be significa nt contradiction between the populations internal or insider view of the historical events and the xternal foreign or factual one determine the relative importance of polmil factors history provides basis for determining how relevant polmil factors were manifested in the past from longterm behavioral patterns the cmo planner can identify which factors to emphasize in developing effective programs and products identify historical issues that remain si gnificant today and resonat with the population examples of such issues are historicallybased border disputes perceived historical wrongs sources of historical pride or contention and major historical figures the basis for the identification of such historical issues is their continuing potency as symbols and motivators even though they may have occurred in the distant past z natural environment the economic political social cultu ral and military behavior and development of any society is affected by the natural environment the effects of the environment can be discerned in the way society is organized and ruled by its trade patterns by its population growth distribution and migration by its eating habits and style of clothing by its military formations z cultural environment culture is critical polmil analyti cal concept in studying culture the cmo planner learns how popul ace perceives realitythe physi cal and social universeas indicated through the institutions ideas and behavi or within population culture is the learned and shared attitudes values and ways populace behaves chapter 3 310 fm 305401mcrp 3331a 5 july 2007 z political system political system is set of structures and processes by which people make authoritative collective decisions all nations and cu ltures have at least one such system in most cases political system is complex web of formal and informa l structures and processes that extend past the official state organizations the two leading issues for cmo planners to cons ider are as follows legitimacy the degree of support that government has is instrumental in determining the cmo plan identification of key stakeholders and decision makers can be derived from knowing how legitimate government is and wh at the sources of that legitimacy are key issues every system has set of issues that ar at the center of its attention generally the ruling regime formed around solution to past set of issues over time some issue may gain or lose importance especially as the result of crisis understanding the issues over which the existing regime formed and changes to perceived importance of those issues is important to understanding the stability and potential for change in the ruling regime z political economy politics and economics are intertwined as major determinant of state or group power economics the process of the authoritative allocation of cultures resources pervades politics because almost every political decision has ec onomic ramifications economic strength affects foreign policy in four ar easgovernmental regime legitimacy military capabilities determination of national interests nd international influence economic issues are important to cmo planners in determining ke stakeholders and the relative strength of competing groups in society z role of the military the military plays an important role in virtually every nation determ ining the nature of that role and its relationship to other analytical fa ctors will enable the cmo planner to better determine causality in critical area of soc iety the word military when used in the context of polmil analysis describes those armed forces identified by governm ent as its military if country considers its police fo rces to be part of the military then the cmo planner should treat them as so key issues for the cmo planner in studying the role of the military include identifying the mode of the force regular paramilitary police or other identifying the nonpolitical and political ro of societys military force recognizing the tendency of military force to intervene in politics and by implication the extent to which the military controlsor is controlled bycivilian authorities z ideology an essential element in any societal values system is its ideology an ideology can serve to integrate communities to advance the position of particular group and to strengthen group resolve to act to change the status quo for polmil analysis cmo planners must distinguish ideology from philosophy philosophies tend to encourage introspection and be profound and personal ideo logy is the tool from which philosophical belief becomes reality ideology is political consists of view of the present and the future is actionoriented is directed at the masses is usually explained in simple terms z religion there are historic examples of cultures that are entirely free of religion and all governments and states that have tried to elimin ate religion have failed religion has influenced the types of political systems under which we ar governed the economic systems in which we trade and the social systems in which we live for polmil an alysis cmo planners need to define the role of populaces religion in an ffort to determine the effect it has on political social economic and cultural events z foreign influence recognizing and understanding the role foreign influence plays in the polmil environment of country is crucia l in planning how cmo will influence another nation foreign influence relates directly to seve ral other influence conduits such as history civil affairs analysis and planning process 5 july 2007 fm 305401mcrp 3331a 311 religion culture geography and economics foreign influence can be either direct or indirect direct influences are actions for example military force or economic sancti ons taken by foreign government or actor with the express purpose of influencing policy or actions of specific state indirect actions for example immigration and technological advances are not under the direction of specific outside agency but can be equally as important as direct actions z leadership this factor addresses the behavior of leaders leaders can use motives purposes and resources to mobilize other people to reali ze goals independently or mutually held by leaders and followers for cmo planners influenc ing the influencer leader can be key step in affecting the behavior of population id entifying key decision makers and formal and informal leaders is critical task for cmo planners an understanding of the leaderships decisionmaking process is also essential to influence that process z regional perspectives regional perspectives are an important factor with which the cmo planner must deal they affect the manner in which the regional populace perceives events leading to reactions that may be unanticipated cmo planners mus t be able to identify and understand the general regional pers pectives on broad range of issues to judge their effect on future actions within the region regional perspectives focus on those issues that mo re immediately threaten local security and stability key issues for cmo p lanners to consider include to which regional organization the count ry in question belongs regional treaties and alliances foreign policy trends and the pattern of crisis response z national interests in the international arena selfinterested behavior is the prin cipal assumption upon which the actions of nations nd populations are interpreted all actors will choose and pursue policies according to their own pe rception of their national interests it is critical for cmo planners to see another actors national interests from that actors perspective for polmil analysis cmo planners can identify national interest in terms of survival sovereignty and economic wellbeing z ethnicity the modern nationstate is based on citizenship that implies degree of loyalty nd individuality from other people however within the nationst ate there are those ethnic groups who may not belong to the politically dominant gr oups and hold to distinct cultural or social differences these ethnic differences may tran scend all other polmil factors group may benefit economically from living within the borders of another nation however this in way diminishes their desire to form their own state or join one with which they have com mon ethnic heritage the cmo planner must see within the nationstate to understand i f ethnicity is critical element in the behavior of the populace z role of the media the media news and literary plays vital role in society the incre asing availability of news media and other information networks to influence societys leadership population and infrastructure can have significant impact on nationa l will political direction and national security objectives and policy cmo planne rs must understand the role of the media as it affects each potential populace and actors external to the ao cmo planners must also exam ine the literary media because literature itself conveys im portant insights of that culture and society 338 cmo planners obtain data for the analysis of enemy forces in the from the intelligence estimate and the preliminary cmo assessment cmo planners describe enemy c apabilities by considering sabotage

paragraph of the cm estimate with list of assumptions developed during mission analysis an assumption is appropriate if it mee ts the tests of validity and necessity validity means the assumption is likely to be true assuming away potential problems ch as weather or likely enemy coas produces an invalid assumption necessity is whether the assumption is essential for planning if planning can

the coas under consideration the following are examples of ke civil areas requiring analysis z locations of government centers these areas are often richer more populated better educated and contain greater nd more advanced infrastructure than outlying areas they are also often the center of influence over th populace in outlying ar eas depending on mission priorities commanders may consider aggressively engaging these areas rather than bypassing them z areas defined by political boundaries districts within city or municipalities within region political boundaries are often well defined nd respected not just by political leaders but also by the population of the areas commanders might consider overlaying unit boundaries on political boundaries for l ongterm operations for pr actical control purposes z social political religious or criminal enclaves these can be sources of potential problems that pose threat to us forces or sources of sympathetic allies that can be exploited for prc purposes z agricultural and mining regions and trade routes routine economic activities may hinder the movement or staging of military resources likewise interfe ring with operations related to the economy of an area may bring an unnecessa ry burden on military its or logistical resources in the area z possible sites for the temporary settlemen t of dcs or other civil functions often the same considerations that make site ideal for positioning military unit will also make it ideal for dc camp or other such settlement commanders must consider the longterm practical and environmental consequences of occupying certain civil areas structures 395 existing civil structures take on many significant roles some such as bridges communications towers power plants and dams are traditional highpa yoff targets others such as churches mosques national libraries and hospitals are cultural sites that interna tional law or other agreements generally protect still others are facilities with practical applications such as ja ils warehouses schools tv stations radio stations and print plants which may be useful for military purp oses 396 structures analysis involves determining the cation functions capabilities and application in support of military operations it so involves weighing the consequences of removing them from civilian use in terms of political economic religious social and informational implications the reaction of the populace and replacement costs capabilities 397 cao and cmo planners can view civil capabilities from several persp ectives the term capabilities may refer to z existing capabilities of the populace to sustain itsel f such as through public administration public safety emergency services and food and agriculture systems z capabilities with which the populace needs assistan ce such as public wo rks and utilities public health economics and commerce z resources and services that can be contract ed to support the military mission such as interpreters appendix c laundry services c onstruction materials and equipment local vendors the hn or other nations may provide th resources and services in hostile territory civil capabilities include resources that military forces could use consistent with international law 398 the cao and cmo planners normally conduct the an alysis of the existing capabilities of the ao on the basis of

outside the ao whose actions opinions or political influence can affect the military mission in l military operations us forces must be prepared to encounter and work closely with civilians of all types 3102 regardless the type of operation military forces will usually encounter various civilians living and operating in and around the supported units ao to facilita determining who they might be it is useful to separate civilians into distinct categories in foreign operat ions these categories might include z local nationals town and city dwellers fa rmers and other rural dwellers and nomads z local civil authorities elected and traditiona l leaders at all levels of government z expatriates z foreign employees of igos or ngos z usg and thirdnation government agency representatives z

categories of civilians identified in the ao events 3104 many categories of civilian events exist that may affect th military mission some examples are planting and harvest seasons elections riots and ev acuations both voluntary and involuntary likewise there are military events that impact on the lives of civilians in an ao some examples are combat operations including indirect fires and deployme

that because the most important thing we can do is to understand that there is so much differences in these operations that they dont lend themselves to recipes or checklists the danger when we start

perform the vital functions of research planning recording coordinating monitori ng and influencing cmo in secure and sometimes lessthansecure austere environment 452 the cmoc must be prepared to conduct echel on and splitbased operations doing so means operating within the security perimeter of the suppor ted military hq as well as outside the security perimeter of the supported military hq and on the ro ad mobileoften simultaneously the parent ca unit must have redundancy in its manning organiza tion and equipment to conduct echelon and split based operations in support of all units w

some other organization or agency already operates facility to coo rdinate cmo in the ao for example city or county emergency operations center during civil support operations cso it may be best to establish liaison or augmentation cell within that facility such coa leg itimizes the efforts of the lead organization and facilitates the disengagement of us forces during transitio n and redeployment from the operation civilmilitary operations terminology in operation strong support posthurri cane mitch relief operations in central america in 1999 regional or nationallev cmoc was avoided this was in deference to stated hn concerns about so vereignty and aversion to the cmoc concept as putting foreign military in char ge of what should be national coordinating function the

established at the local level to deconflict relief operations w here jtfs were operating notes of us ca officer on operations during operation strong support 1999 455 another important item to consider early while tablishing cmoc is the creation of continuity books the continuity books are digital they are maintained on local systems and the civil information management and knowledge manageme nt system at fort bragg c ontinuity book facilitates continuity of operations during periods of potential disruption fo r example routine or emergency personnel turnover extending and contracting the cmoc and transition ope rations although there is particular format for continuity book there are some techniques to make the book useful these techniques are as follow s z arrange book chronologically with daily weekly nd monthly calendars showing essential tasks z provide enough detail who what where why when and how to each task to eliminate guesswork by the replacement z include journal to record actions taken and pocs for ongoing projects z take photographs of projects pocs meeting f acilities and other items for example funding pertinent to conducting cmo and

afeguard them in the aftermath of disaster the disaster may be natural as in flood or an earthqua ke or manmade as in combat operations social or political strife or technol ogical hazard emergency such as hazar dous material hazmat for example chemical biological or radiological spills dc operati ons may occur in conjunction with stability operations 513 dc operations include the planning and

including civilians from other countries civilians within this category may or may not need help if they can care for themselves they should remain in place 516 dcs are civilians who have left their

or to the country in whic h they reside dc is generic term subdivided into eight categorie s legal and political considerati ons define these categories dc categories include z displaced person civilian who is involuntar ily outside the national boundaries of his or her country jp 102 z refugee person outside of his or her country of nationality who is unable or unwilling to return because of persecution or wellfounded f ear of persecution on account of race religion nationality membership in particular social group or political opi nion 1951 united nations convention relating to the

the following exampl illustrate in some situations the link between refugee problems and internal displacement is direct and clear in other situations the relationship between refugees and idps is more complex example of clear dc status when refugees and displaced persons ar generated by the same causes and straddle the border not only are the humani tarian needs similar solution to the refugee problem cannot usually be found wit hout at the same time resolving the issue of internal displacement unhcrs involvement in north ern iraq during the kurdish crisis was one such example in many situations effective reintegrat ion of returnees requires assistance to be extended also to the internally displaced in the same locality or community in mozambique sierra leone afghanistan and guatemala it has been operationally and conceptually difficult for unhcr to differ entiate between returnees and internally displaced in sri lanka refugees returned home only to become internally displaced prompting unhcr to refocus its programme sic on internal displa cement in ethiopia unhcr participated in crossm andate operation with other agencies to promote reintegration of returnees and also stabilise sic other kinds of population movements sometimes refugees have sought asylum ac ross the border in areas where there are also internally displaced for instance refugees from sierra l eone and the internally displaced in liberia were found not only living together but also affected in the same manner by instability in t he country of asylum not only is it operationally difficult and morally unacc eptable to distinguish between people in such situation assistance targeting onl refugees may aggravate their insecurity internally displaced persons the role of the united nations high commissioner for refug ees unhcr 6 march 2000 example of complex dc status refugees may be minor component of massive internal displacement colombia and chechnya are two such operations in which unhcr is involve d tajikistan was another instance of such involvement w hen geography and history di ctated the flight core tasks 5 july 2007 fm 305401mcrp 3331a 55 of some 600000 persons to other parts of the country and only tenth of that number to neighbouring sic afghanistan in such cases it makes little sense to base international assistance on location alone internal conflicts of secessionist nature have uprooted people within national boundaries which have then become international borders for instance in the former yugoslavia and timor unhcr decided to provide protection and assistance to the uprooted on the basis of humanita rian needs rather than refugee status borders which shift even as people move cannot be the sole factor determining the legitimacy of international concern sometimes it has been difficult to predict whether territorial disputes or ethnic violence will lead to breakup of st ate and exodus of refugees but it has been felt that early action to protect and assist internal displacement might check the proliferation and prolongation of human ffering and promote regional stability this was the basis of unhcrs response for instance in the caucasus internally displaced persons the role of the united nations high commissioner for refug ees unhcr 6 march 2000 518 the ca supporting tasks in dc operations are of support to the commanders

recovering or reconstituting hn jp 357 chapter iii and fm 30540 appendix contain sample checklists for transition planning continuity of operations 614 the continuity of operations plan is the mechanism to ensure that underway projects coordination reconstruction planning and impl ementation receive support during nd after transition the goal of transition to followon organizations or ipi is sustainable durable structure or system throughout all operations cao and cmo planners f unctional specialists and team members maintain continuity books that will orient new personnel to th eir routine tasks ideally an overl ap period exists when mission handoff occurs between individuals and units 615 continuity book facilitates turnover of operati ons between outgoing and incoming personnel that is transparent to the supported organization ag ency or populace the book s hould be chronologically arranged with daily weekly and monthly calendars that show essential tasks with enough detail to preclude guessing by newly assigned soldier including details such as who what whe re when why transition operations 5 july 2007 fm 305401mcrp 3331a 65 and how the daily staff journal is tool that ca soldiers can use to build useful continuity book additional items for the ca soldier to consider ensuring continuit of operations are z operational resource require ments funding equipment personnel and facilities z sources of supplies and services required to maintain operations z identification of interdependency and interoperability between rganizations z contingency plans that address th reats to continuity of operati ons countermeasures to mitigate those threats and preparedness for response to and recovery from those threats that succeed in disrupting operations z postredeployment overs ight and support mechanisms for the operation reachback pocs periodic visits and combatant command theater engagement programs civil affairs desired end state indicators and measurement 616 indicators are measures for which data exists that helps quantify the achievement of desired result indicators help answer the question how would we know result if we achieved it examples of indicators include z rates of preventable disease z death rates among distressed population z rates of pregnancy and drug use z crime rates 617 one of the products of the mdmp was cmo moes cao and cmo planners developed cmo moes to determine how well or poorly an operation is proceeding in achieving the cmo goals of the operation according to the commanders mission statement and intent ca and cmo planne rs developed cmo moes to identify effective strategies and tactics and to determ ine points at which to shift resources transition to different phases or alter or terminate the mission 618 in addition to deciding moes ca and cmo planners veloped plans to observe and validate each moe these plans answered the following questions z who will observe the moe z when will the moe be observed z how will the moe be observed z where will the observations be made z who will approve and validate the achievement of the moe z what actions will be taken when the moe is satisfactorily achie ved 619 some moes may be observed in the course of routine cmoc or interagency operations the cmoc analyzes reports from cats and various civilian agencies records t he statistics resulting from the analysis and then provides input to the cop in this way moes such as the sustainability of ngo or hn operations are readily identifiable 620 observation of moes may be eventdriven or timedriven ca soldiers are able to observe and measure some moes immediately after an event such as the percentage of population inoculated or the level of output of utility after repairs however ca soldiers can only bserve other moes after cycle of time has passed such as harvest season if measur ing agricultural output or school year if measuring academic achievement ca soldiers may need to observe moes on rou tine or periodic basis to establish baselines or trends as in crime rates or mortality rate 621 transition working groups usually require close ties with cmoc to obtain updates on the current situation and the status of moes the cao and cmo staffs validate the moes an approval authority which may be commander hn authorities organized represe ntative of the international community or some other entity approves the validated moes validation and pproval occur before final disposition of an event or program chapter 6 66 fm 305401mcrp 3331a 5 july 2007 622 achievement of moes must be tied to disposition action this action may be the rmination of an activity or task the transfer of an activity or task to followon ca units other military forces or the international community or the transition of an activity or task to the ogas ipi or igos satisfaction of moes indicates an operation is nearing completion ca soldiers finalize tra nsition plans and begin executing termination or transition timelines 623 if the moes have not been achieved ca soldiers must determine why the evaluated result s of an event or program may be unsuccessful because levels were set too high the wrong activity was measured or some other reason ca soldiers may determine that the moes h ave been partially achieved in this instance ca soldiers should modify not recreate the moes to do the intended job after the cao and cmo planners recommend the modification of the operation from the original plan the supporte d commander decides what to do next some options include z continuing the operation as currently pla nned and reevaluating at future date z accepting the results and proceeding with transition of the operation as planned z redefining the mission and developing new plan with new moes 5

during the planning and the preparation for military operations cao nd cmo planners use research techniques and tools to support writing of area studies and area assessments developing cmo estimates preparing for cr missions and conducting cim in the course of research planners use variety of approaches to acquire information and collaborate with knowledgeable people in some cases opensource research requires ca personnel to develop partnerships with academic and co mmercial research centers to facilitate the collection and analysis of primary source data on areas or topics not found in current literature or knowledge fmi 2229 opensource intelligence contains additional information regarding opensource intelligence although not the only tool the internet is an essential opensource research tool to acquire timely information about diverse operational environments the internet provides access to web pages and databases that hold wide range of cultural political military and technological information as depicted in figure b1 page b2 and described in this appendix pe rsonnel can use several basic techniques and procedures to accomplish internet research of open sources plan research b1 cao and cmo planners use their understanding of the supported units mission the specific information requirements and the internet to plan prepare and execute th eir research the specific information requirement helps the researcher determine what information to research and where to look for information sources good specific information require ment like any wellthoughtout research question provides the objective and indicators that will provide the terminology the research uses to locate information sources and research information b2 for example if unit is planning an fha operation in the sudan the information requirement may be locate refugee concentrations in the sudan the specific information requirements answer the questions z where are the humanitarian relief organizations operating food distribution centers in the sudan z where are the militia forces in the sudan b3 the location of food and hostile paramilitary forces are two possible indicators of where refugees may or may not concentrate based on the mission and specific information requirement s the research objective is to locate refugee concen trations based on the position of food and militia forces in the sudan the indicators that provide the search terms are z sudan z refugee z humanitarian relief z food distribution z water wells b4 once identified the researcher r ecords these search terms and uses them to identify information sources and locate information within the internet appendix b b2 fm 305401mcrp 3331a 5 july 2007 step technique and procedure plan research use mission and

after determining the objective and indicators the res earcher uses an internet browser to connect to previously identified information source on communications database or information site if there are previously identified sources th researcher can connect to co mmunications or service site to collaborate with other analysts or use search engine to identify information sources respectively

containing copyrighted or similarly protected information information security b7 the internet is not benign environment the inform ation and sites that researcher seeks and visits can provide adversaries with indicators of military plans nd operations the interaction with internet sites and information also provides adversaries and other malicious us ers with the means to track activities and attack the researchers workstation the internet researcher must be aware of these threats to take appropriate security measures to deny adversaries information about operations and protect the network from attack common threats to the re searcher and the network include z espionage agent hostile agent or malicious user uses email chat rooms web logs blogs and other communications means to subvert the internet user consciously or unconsciously z password hacking accessing workstation or network using stolen password encrypted file and encryption program z viruses computer virus injected in to the workstation or networks either through accidental or contrived means that destroys information and disables the workstation z forged internet protocol address forged internet protocol address of trusted host used to gain connection with workstation or network z sniffers program that captures user names passwords and keywords b8 the following are basic guidelines to prevent or limit

z uses standalone internet workstation to prevent corruption of the organizations primary lan understanding search engines b9 estimates are that the internet contains as many as 3 to 4 billion pages of information with 7 million new pages added each day with so many pages of seemingly random data how does anyone find anything without some way to organize all this info rmation researchers could wander aimlessly for eons without finding what they are looking for fortunately for researchers software engineers have developed tools to solve this problem th tools are search engines appendix b b4 fm 305401mcrp 3331a 5 july 2007 b10 simply stated search engine is tool that allows researchers to s earch text from billions of web pages once the search engine discove rs text matching the researchers query it displays brief description of the hit match to text query and hyperlink that will take the researcher to that particular web page in addition to text query some search engines have topic directories prepared by people who spend their days surfing the net and categorizing informa tion they find based on the topics covered some commercial governmental and ngos employ their own people to perform this function whereas others rely on contracting with one of several co mmercial companies who do this kind of work b11 the researcher uses search engine and planned search terms to locate information sources on the internet and find information within the internet site searc h engines allow the user to search for text and images in millions of web pages the different comme rcial and government search engines vary in what they search how they search and how they display results most search engines use programs called web crawlers to build indexed databases web crawler searches internet sites and files and saves the results in database the search engine therefore is actually searching an indexed database not the content of the site or an online database the sear ch results also vary between search engines because each engine uses different web crawlers and searches different sites most engines display search results in order of relevancy with brief description and hyperlink to th referenced internet file or site understanding how search engines work the researcher z conducts an initial search using unique keywords or keyword combinations and if possible multiple search engines z evaluates the relevance and accuracy of the search results to res earch objective indicators and search parameters do not rely on the relevancy formula of the search engine particularly commercial search engines to list the most relevant information s ource at the top of the list z conducts followon searches using refined terms and methods refining terms includes inverting the word order changing the case correcting spelli ng and adjusting search terms refining search methods includes searching within results that are similar to the desired informa tion index databases b12 search engines have database built by web crawler the web craw ler or spider is different application than the search engine the crawler is like so voracious monster with an insatiable appetite it roams the internet 24 hours day 7 days week searching for information once it finds web site it then indexes and saves it in database relevant to th search engine some search engines have their own spiders but others use commercial contracted spider pr ograms to develop their databases in addition each spider may use different approach to acquiring data one spider may be programmed to research only t he titles of web pages and the first few lines of text other s piders research virtually the entire web site with the exception of graphics or video files because s earch engines may use differe nt web crawler software with different ways to index and sa ve data each separate search engine may yield different results also the search engine provider can supplement or alter the spider softwares index to ensure the web site of specific customer appears in the index ex amples of these are when webmaster z submits information directly to the search engine company z pays paid inclusion services fee to ve their sites in the inclusion process z pays payforplacement fee to guarantee priority in search engine placement relevancy formulas b13 the relevancy formula is how well the researchers query results match the researchers request for web pages that are commercially oriented designing the page to achieve the highest ranking s become an art form for some search engines the process is simplethe higher the bid the higher th sites ranking search engines are continually changing their relevancy formulas to try to stay ahead of web developers some web designers however load their s ites with words such as free money or sex in an attempt to influence the relevancy formula of the search engine other web designers engage in practices called spamdexing or spoofing in an attempt to trick the search engine opensource research techniques 5 july 2007 fm 305401mcrp 3331a b5 b14 the significance of the relevancy formulas to the researcher is the importance of understa nding that the keyword the researcher uses in the search does not necessarily yield the same results w ith every search engine this becomes obvious when researchers consid er that the relevancy formulas vary from search engine to search engine and that they are in consta nt state of evolution in some formulas the placement of the keywords yields different re sults if rearranged because the search engines relevancy formula places more emphasis on the first words in the search string relevancy formulas may also ass ume importance depending on the type of search the researcher conducts for instance field search which i s limited to the web page itself for example title url and date may be more critical than fulltext search metasearch engines b15 as search engines have evolved some engines have become known for their ability to find specific types of information such as statistical financial and news more effectively then other engines to overcome this specialization software engineers developed the metasearch engine the metasearch engine allows the user to query more than one search engine at time on the surface this would seem to be the final answer to the search stion just query all search engines at one time unfortunately it is not quite that easy since the metasearch engine must be designed to work with all the search engines that it queries it must strip out each search parameter to th lowest common denominator of each search engine used for example if particular search engine ca nnot accommodate phrases in quot ation marks or type of boolean function then the metasearch engine will eliminat that function from the search the resulting search in many instances th becomes too broad and less useful than wellformatted search using search engine that the user is familiar with and that is known to be good at locating the type of information required conduct search b16 researchers should avoid the temptation to use one fa vorite search engine to the exclusion of others each search engine has its strengths and weaknesses organizational standards research experience and peer recommendations guide the selection of which search engine to use in any particular sit uation b17 generally thorough search often requires the use of more than one search engine and even then the information may not be complete as rule of thumb if trained researcher cannot fi nd the information using multiple search engines and common searc h techniques within 30 minutes it is possible that the information is not on the internet not indexed or not in retrievable format t that point the researcher must consider alterna tive noninternet information sources such as other humans brickand mortar libraries and direct observation search by keyword b18 in keywordbased searches the researcher shoul d consider what keywords are unique to the information being sought the researcher needs to dete rmine enough keywords to yield relevant results but not so many as to overwhelm the researcher with mixture of relevant and irrelevant information the researcher should also avoid such common words as the articles an and and the unle ss those words are part of title of book or article most s earch engines ignore common words for example if looking for information about russian and chinese tank sa to iraq the researcher should not use tank as the only keyword in the search in stead the researcher should use dditional defining words such as russian chinese tank sales iraq b19 in some search engines boolean and math logic ope rators help the researcher establish relationships between keywords that improve the search using the operators listed in table b1 page b6 the search engine searches for russian and tank together when th researcher places the word s within parentheses for example russian tank if the re searcher wants to exclude chines tank sales from the search result then he uses russian tank not chinese tank in the search the researcher can also use near search when the relationship and th distance between the terms are well established for example if the researcher is searching news articles for incident s of improvised explosive device ied attacks near ramadi he can define his search to locate incidents of the word ied within five words of the word ramadi he would for example enter i ed near5 ramadi in the search field appendix b b6 fm 305401mcrp 3331a 5 july 2007 table b1 boolean and math logic operators function boolean math example must be present and chemical and weapon chemical weapon must not be present not africa not sudan africa sudan may be present or not applicable chemical or biological complete phrase chinese tank sales to iraq nested not applicable shining path near near not applicable white house near airspace incursion wild cards word or word not applicable gun gunpowder gunsight and so on stop words not applicable or do not ignore or notes in some search engines the default is and in this case you will have to use the or operator or the equivalent option on pull down menu some engines use ten words as the distance between near words forward slash and number indicate the distance between the terms stop words are words that search engines ignore because they are too common or are reserved for special operation there is uniform list but they include words such as an any to with from and so on they also include t he standard boolean operators and not near and or search in natural language b20 an alternative to using keyword search is the natural language question format most of the major search engines allow this capability the researcher obtains the b est results when the question contains good keywords one of the major downsides to this technique is the large number of results if th researcher does not find the needed in formation in the first few pages he should initiate new search using different parameters refine search b21 normally the first few pages of search results are the most relevant based on these pages the researcher evaluates the initial and followon search results to termine if the results satisfies the objective or requires additional searches du ring evaluation the researcher z compares the relevancy of the resu lts to the objective and indicators z compares the accuracy of the results to search parameters key words phrase date or date range language format and so on z compares the results from different search engines to identify missing r incomplete information for example the results from one search engine in clude news articles but another engine does not modify the keyword b22 if initial search attempts are unsatisfactory the researcher can refine the search by changing z order search engines may place higher value or mo re weight on the first word or words in multiple word or phrase search string changing the word order from insurgents iraq to iraq insurgents may yield different search results z spelling search engines attempt to match the exact spelling of the words in the search string there are search engines that do recognize altern ate spellings or prompt the user to correct common misspellings changing the spelling of word from the americanenglish center to opensource research techniques 5 july 2007 fm 305401mcrp 3331a b7 the britishenglish centre may yield different re sults changing the spelling of transliterated name from alqaeda to alqaida alqaida elqaida or qaeda generates different results that may be useful depending upon the objective of the search z case search engines may or may not support cas esensitive searches like spelling some engines attempt to match the word exactly as ente red in the search the researcher should use all lowercase letters for most searches when looking for persons name geographical loca tion title or other normally capitalized words the researcher should use casesensitive search engine changing the case of word from java to java changes the s earch result from sites about coffee to sites about software program z variants researchers use terms that are common to their language culture or geographic area using variants of the keyword such as cha nging policeman to cop bobby gendarme carabiniere policía polizei or other form may improve search results search within results b23 if the initial or followon search pr oduces good but still insufficient resu lts the researcher can search within these results to drill down to the web page that ve high probability of matching the search string and containing the desired information most of the popular search engines make this easy by displaying phrase such as search within these results or similar pages that the researcher can select selecting the notice takes the researcher to web pages with potentially relevan t information search by field b24 in field search the researcher looks for the keywords within the url as opposed to searching the entire internet the best time to use field search is when the search engine returned large number of web pages although capabilities vary by search engine some of the co mmon field search operators are z anchor searches for web pages with specified hyperlink z domain searches for specific domains see figure b 2 page b8 or visit httpwwwianaorg z like searches for web pages similar or rela ted in some way to specified url z link searches for specific hyperlink embedded in web page z text searches for specific text in the body of web page z url searches for specific text in complete web addresses search in cache and archive b25 sometimes search or an attempt to search with results returns url that matches exactly the search objective but when the researcher tries to link to the site the link or the si is longer active if the search engine captures data and the url the researcher can select th cached link to access the original data another technique is to search an internet archive site such as httpwwwarchiveorg for the content the researcher needs to be aware that this information is historica l and not subject to update by the original creators truncate the uniform resource locator b26 in addition to using the search engine to search within results the res earcher can also manually search within the results by truncating the url to web page the researcher works backward from the original search result to the web page or home page containing the desired information or database by deleting the end segments of the url at the forwar d slash this technique requires basic understanding of how web page

of command or host government will assign one in other cas ca soldiers choose interpreters from pool provided by the host government finally in many opera tional situations ca soldiers use interpreters hired from the general hn population whatever the cas the following guidelines are critical to mission accomplishment c3 interpreters should be selected according to the following criteria z native speaker interpreters should be native speakers of the socially or geographically determined dialect their speech background nd mannerisms should be completely acceptable to the target audience so that their audience pays attentio n to the way the interpreter talks only to what the interpreter says z social status in some situations and cultures interpreters may be limited in th eir effectiveness with target audience if their social standing is considerably lower than that of the audience this may include significant differences in military rank or mbership in an ethnic or religious group regardless of the ca soldiers personal feelings on social status he should remember the job is to accomplish the mission not to act as an agent for social reform in faraway land the ca soldier should accept local prejudices as fact of life z english fluency an oftenoverlooked consideration is how well the interpreter speaks english as rule if the interpreter understands the ca soldier and the ca soldier understands the interpreter then the interpreters command of english should be satisfactory the ca sold ier can check that understanding by asking the interpreter to paraphrase in english something the ca soldier said the ca soldier then restates the interpreters c omments to ensure that both persons are synchronized also interpreting goes both ways the interpreter must be able to convey the information expressed by the interviewee or target audience z intellectual intelligence the interpreter should be quick alert and responsive to changing conditions and situations he must be able to grasp complex concepts and discuss them without confusion in reasonably logical sequence although education doe s not equate to intelligence appendix c c2 fm 305401mcrp 3331a 5 july 2007 generally speaking the better educated the interpreter the bette r he will perform due to increased exposure to diverse concepts z technical ability in certain situations the ca soldier may need an interpreter with chnical training or experience in special subject areas to translate the meaning and the words for instance if the subject is very technical or specialized with terms such as nuclear physics background knowledge will be useful z reliability the ca soldier should beware the potential interpreter who arrives late for the interview throughout the world the concept of time varies widely in many lessdevelope d countries time is relatively unimportant the ca soldier should make sure that t he interpreter understands the militarys preoccupation with punctuality z loyalty if the interpreter used is local national it is safe to assume th at his first loyalty is to the hn or subgroup and not to the us military the security implicati ons are clear the ca soldier must be very cautious in how he explains concepts to give interpreters greater depth of understanding additionally some interpreters for political or personal reasons may have ulterior motives or hidden agenda when they apply for the interpreting job if the ca soldie r detects or suspects such motives he should tell his commander s2 or security manager the ca soldier should be aware of and monitor these motives with all interpreters z gender age and race gender age and race have the poten tial to seriously affect the mission one example is the status of females in muslim society in predominantly m uslim countries cultural prohibitions may render female interpreter ineffective under certain circumst ances another example would be the balkans where the ethnic divisions may limit the effectiveness of an interpreter from outside the target audi ences group since traditions values and biases vary from country to country it is important to check with the incountry assets or are studies for specific taboos or favorable characteristics z compatibility the ca soldier and the interpreter will work as team for the int erpreter to be most effective he should become psychic extension of the ca soldier the target audience will be quick to recognize personality conflicts between the ca soldier and the interpreter these conflicts can undermine the effectiveness of the communication effort if possible whe n selecting an interpreter the ca soldier should look for compatible traits and strive for harmonious working relationship c4 if several qualified interpreters are available the ca soldier should select at lea st two this practice is of particular importance if the interpreter works during long conferences or courses of instruction t he exhausting nature of these type jobs makes about f our hours of active interpreting about the maximum for peak efficiency whatever the mission with two or more interpreters ne can provide quality control and assistance to the active interpreter additionally this technique can be useful w hen conducting coordination or negotiation meetings as one interpreter works in an active role and the other pays attention to the body language and side convers ations of the others present ma ny times the ca soldier will gain important side information that assists in negotiations from listening to what ot hers are saying among themselves outside of the main discussion population analysis c5 implied throughout the preceding points is the need fo r careful analysis of the target population this type of analysis goes beyond the scope of this lesson mature judgment thoughtful consideration of the audience as individual human bei ngs and genuine concern for thei r receiving accurate information will go long way toward accomplishing the mission the ca soldier must remember that the individual from farm or small village is going to have markedly different expectatio ns than the jetsetting polo player evaluation criteria c6 as mentioned it is safe to assume that if the interpreter is not us military or at least us citizen his first loyalty will be to his c ountry or subgroup and not to the unite d states the ca soldier must be cautious about what information he gives his interpreter the ca soldier must always keep in mind possible security issues certain tactical situations may require the use of uncleared indigenous personnel use of interpreters 5 july 2007 fm 305401mcrp 3331a c3 as field expedient interpreters commanders should be aware of the increased security risk involved in using such personnel and carefully weigh the risk vers us the potential gain if uncleared interpreters are used the ca soldier should keep an sensitive information to minimum the interpreters must be honest and free from unfavorable notoriety among the local inhabitants their reputation or standing in the community should be such that persons of hi gher rank and standing will not intimidate them rapport establishment c7 the interpreter is vital link to the target audience without cooperative supporti ve interpreter the mission could be in serious jeopardy mutual respect and understanding is essential to effective teamwork the ca soldier must establish rapport early in the relationship and maintain rapport th roughout the joint effort the difficulty of establishing rapport stems most of the time from lack of personal contact c8 the ca soldier begins the process of establishing rapport before he meets the interpreter for the first time most foreigners are reasonably knowledgeable about the united states the ca sold ier should obtain some basic facts about the hn useful information may include population geography ethnic groups political system prominent political figures monetary system business agriculture and exports recent almanac or encyclopedia is source for good general outline more detailed info rmation is available in the area handbook for the country and current newspapers and magazines such as the new york times the washington post newsweek and us news and world report c9 the ca soldier should find out about the interpreters background the soldier should show genuine concern for the interpreters family aspira tions career education and so on many cultures outside the united states place gr eater emphasis on family over career so the soldier should start with understanding the interpreters home life the ca soldie r should also research cultural traditions to find out more about the interpreter and the nation in which the soldier w ill be working although the soldier should gain as much information on culture as possibl before entering an hn his interpreter can be valuable source to fill gaps showing inte rest is also good way to build rapport c10 the ca soldier should gain the interpreters tr ust and confidence before embarking on sensitive issues such as religion likes dislikes and prejudi ces the soldier should approach these areas carefully and tactfully although deeply personal beliefs may be very revealing and useful in the professional relationship the ca soldier must gently and tactfully draw these ut of his interpreter orientation c11 early in the relationship with interpreters the ca soldiers should ensure that interpreters are briefed on their duties and responsibilities the soldiers should or ient the interpreters as to the nature of their duties standards of conduct expected techniques of interview to be used and any other requirements necessary the orientation may include the following z current tactical situation z background information obtained on the source interviewee or target audience z specific objectives for interview meeting or interrogation z method of interpretation to be used simultaneouswhen the interpreter listens and translates at the same time alternatewhen the interpreter listens to an entire phrase sentence or paragraph then translates during natural pauses z conduct of the interview lesson or interrogation z need for interpreters to avoid injecting their own personality ideas or questions into the interview z need for interpreter to inform interviewer ca soldier of inconsistencies in language us ed by interviewee an example would be someone who claims to be college professor yet speaks like an uneducated person during interrogations or interviews t his information will be used as part of the assessment of the information obtained from the individual z physical arrangements of the site if applicable z possible need for interpreter to assist in after action reviews or assessments appendix c c4 fm 305401mcrp 3331a 5 july 2007 interpreter training c12 as part of the initial training with the interpreter the ca soldier should tactfully convey that the instructor interviewer or interrogator ca soldier must always direct t he interview or lesson the soldier should put the interpreters role in proper perspectiv and stress the interpreters importance as vital communication link between the soldier and the target audience the ca soldier should appea l to the interpreters professional pride by clearly describing how the q uality and quantity of the information sent and received is directly dependent upon the interpreters skills also the ca soldier should mention how the interpreter functions solely as conduit between the soldier and the subject c13 the ca soldier must be aware that some interpreters because of cu ltural differences may attempt to save face by purposely concealing thei r lack of understanding they may attempt to translate what they think the ca soldier said or meant without asking for clarif ication or vice versa because this can result in misinformation and confusion nd impact on credibility the ca sold ier should let the interpreter know that when in doubt he should always ask for clarification the soldier should foster this unde rstanding as early in the relationship as possible c14 other points for the ca soldier to cover while orienting and training the interpreter are as follows z importance of the training interview or interrogation z specific objectives of the training interview or interrogation if any z outline of lesson or interview questions if applicable z background information on the interviewee or target audience z briefing training or interview schedules it may take double or triple the amount of time nee ded when using an interpreter to convey the same information for that reason the interpret er may be helpful in scheduling enough time z copy of the briefing questions or lesson plan if applicable special attention should be given to develop language proficiency in the technical fields in which the interpreters are expected to be employed in general this will give the interpreter time to look up unfamiliar words or ask questions to clarify anything confusing z copies of handout material if applicable z general background information on subject z glossary of terms if applicable interview preparation c15 the ca soldier selects an appropriate site for the interview h positions and arranges the physical setup of the area when conducting interviews with very important persons vips or individuals from different cultures this arrangement can be significant c16 the ca soldier instructs the interpreters to mirro r the soldiers tone and personality of speech the soldier instructs the interpreters not to interject their own quest ions or personality he also instructs the interpreters to inform him if they notice any inconsistencies or pecu liarities from sources interview conduct c17 whether conducting an interview or presenting lesson the ca soldier should avoid simul taneous translations that is both the soldier and the interpreter talking at the sam time the soldier should speak for minute or less in neutral relaxed manner directly to the individual or audience t he interpreter should watch the soldier carefully and during the translation mimic the soldiers body l anguage as well as interpret his verbal meaning the ca soldier should observe the interpreter closely to detect any inconsistencies between the interpreters and ca soldiers manners the soldier must be aware not to force the interpreter into literal translation by being too brief the soldier shoul d present one major thought in its entirety and allow the interpreter to reconstruct it in his language and culture c18 although the interpreter will be doing some editing as function of the interpreting process it is imperative that he transmit the exact meaning without additions or deleti ons as previously mentioned the use of interpreters 5 july 2007 fm 305401mcrp 3331a c5 ca soldier should insist that the interpreter always ask for clarification pri or to interpreting whenever not absolutely certain of the soldiers meaning however the soldier should be aware that good interpreter especially if he is local can be invaluable in translating subtl eties and hidden meanings c19 during an interview or lesson if the audience asks questions the interpreter should imm ediately relay them to the ca soldier for an answer the interpreter should never try to answer question even though he may know the correct answer additionally neither the sold ier nor interpreter should co rrect the other in front of an interviewee or class they should settle ll differences away from the subject or audience c20 just as establishing rapport with the interpreter is vitally important blishing rapport with interview subjects or the target audience is equally important the ca soldier and the interpreter should concentrate on rapport to establish critical rapport th ca soldier should treat the subjects or audiences as mature important human beings that are capable and worthy communication techniques c21 an important first step for the ca soldier in communicating in foreign language is to polish hi s english language skills this is true even if the ca soldier does not try to learn the indigenous language the clearer the soldier speaks in english including diction the easier it is for the interpreter to translate other factors to consider include use of profanity slang jargon and colloquialisms in many cases translators cannot translate such expressions even thos the translator can translate do not always retain the desired meaning in addition if the interpreter mu st translate technical rm or expression the ca soldier must be sure the interpreter conveys the proper meaning in the target nguage the soldier should speak in low context and simple sent ences for instance he may want to add words usually left off such as air plane this ensures the meaning will be obvious and he is not talking about the great plains or wood plane c22 when the soldier is speaking extemporaneously he must think about what he wants to sa he should break it down into logical bits he should give it out small pi ece at time using short simple words and sentences and low context the interpreter can then quickly and easily translate as rule of thumb the ca soldier should never say more in one sentence than he can easily re peat word for word immediately after saying it each sentence should contain complete thought without verbia ge transitional phrases and qualifiers c23 these tend to confuse and waste valuable time examples are for example in most cases maybe and perhaps the soldier should be cauti ous of using american humor cultural and language differences can lead to misinterpretations by foreigners the soldier should determine early on w hat the interpreter finds easiest to understand and translate meaningfully in summary the ca sold ier should z keep the entire presentation as simple as possible z use short sentences and simple words low context z avoid idiomatic english z avoid flowery language z avoid slang jargon and colloquial expressions c24 whenever possible the soldier should identify any cultural restrictions before intervie wing instructing or conferring with particular foreign nationa ls for instance when is it proper to stand sit or cross ones legs gestures being learned behavior va ry from culture to culture the interpreter should be able to relate number of these cultural restrictions which whe never possible the interpreter observes while working with the particular group or individual dos and donts c25 the following are some dos and donts for the ca soldier to consider while working with n interpreter the ca soldier should z position the interpreter by his side or even st ep back this method w ill keep the subject or audience from shifting their attention or fixating on the interpreter and not on the soldier appendix c c6 fm 305401mcrp 3331a 5 july 2007 z always look at and talk directly to the subject or audience guard against the t endency to talk to the interpreter z speak slowly and clearly rep eat as often as necessary z speak to the individual or group as if they understand english the soldier should be enthusiastic and employ the gestures movements and voice intonations and inflections that he would normally use before an englishspeaking group the soldier can convey considerable nonverbal meaning through voice and body movements the soldier should encourage the interpreter to mimic the same delivery z periodically check the interpreters accuracy consistency and clarity another american fluent enough in the language should sit in on sson or interview this should ensure that the interpreter has not distorted intentionally or unintentionally the translation nother way to be sure is for the soldier to learn the target language so he can check the inte rpreters loyalty and honesty z check with the audience whenever he suspects misunderstandings and clarify them immediately using the interpreter the soldier should ask questions to elicit answers tha t will tell whether the point is clear if it is not clear he should rephrase the instructi on differently and illustrate the point again the soldier should us repetition and examples whenever necessary to facilitate learning if the class asks few questions it may mean t he instruction is over the heads of the audience or the messa ge is not clear to the audience z make the interpreter feel like valuable member of the team give t he interpreter recognition commensurate with the importance of his contribution c26 the ca soldier should not z address the subject or audience in the third person through the interpreter the soldier shoul d avoid saying tell them im glad to be their instru ctor but rather should say im glad to be your instructor he should address the subject or audience directly z make side comments to the interpreter since the interpreter i s not expected to translate them this tends to create the wrong atmosphere for communication z be distraction while the interpreter is translating and the subje ct or audience is listening the soldier should not pace the floor write on the blac kboard teeter on the lect ern drink beverages or carry on any other distracting activity while the interpreter is actu ally translating 5 july 2007 fm 305401mcrp 3331a d1 appendix d negotiation and mediation this appendix discusses negotiation and mediation from the perspective of mediating between former belligerents in postconf lict environment the following guidelines are not allinclusive or exclusive since mediation is the preferred method for conducting bilateral or multilateral talks these guidelines were written mainly to facilitate mediation however the princi ples contained below should also apply in those cases where the ca soldier is serving as negotiator or arbitrator overview d1 the mediation process like the interview process c onsists of three distinct phases the preparatory phase the meeting phase and the postmeeting phase like the interview process which is normally onetime event the three phases are re peated before each mediation event preparatory phase d2 this phase includes determining where the mediati on should take place as well as doing research to understand what factors are involved so that successful outcome of the mediation process will result the following paragraphs discuss these actions environment d3 when setting the environment the mediator cons iders the physical meeti ng place and the individual or group requirements of the parties present at the mediation the mediator should consider preference s among the representatives for specific time or location however safe quick route equidista nt for as many of the involved parties as possible should be the priority all parties must feel cure and comfortable while at the mediation site shelter wa ter food light telephone and communications assets restrooms paper and pens chairs and tables and any other requisite supplies should be readily available situation research d4 preparation as in any military operation is the key to successful mediation the mediator must know the factual situation and the nuances that the local representatives will apply to the facts the condition of local factories level of educati on age of the populace amount of farming versus manufacturing and lines of communications roads telephones water and so on are but part of the overall situation also critical are political inclination before and afte r the conflict economic ties outside the country and the ideologies of internal and extern pressure groups seeking cooperation or disharmony d5 the mediator must be fully aware of the resources he can exploit to reach an agreement he must know about all possible resources not only from the orga nization that he represents but also from other international nongovernmental or private groups operating in the theater d6 the mediator should also know which requirements of the local populace he could leverage to increase pressure on the local repres entatives to comply w ith efforts to enhance stability and peace for example there may exist in the ao factories that are missing an easily procured part or farmland that could productively grow an alternate crop although this knowledge does not directly lead to an agreement an effort by the mediator to obtain the missing part or an alternate crop source coul d nudge party toward cooperation appendix d d2 fm 305401mcrp 3331a 5 july 2007 d7 the local slant on the facts will vary by person village county and nati on mediators must know what each party can and will concede nd ensure that balance is achieved d8 the mediator must know as much as possible about the parties that are directly and indire ctly involved in the mediation there will be personalities nd pressures from behind the scenes that can affect the willingness of the local representa tive to support an agreement medi ators must know the ability of the people present at the table to effectiv ely comply with any agr eement that they sign frustration and distrust are hard to overcome when an unseen person derails an agreement made in good faith d9 the mediator must also know if the local repr esentative can sign an agreement and expect the support of the populace if popular support is not forthcom ing any momentum toward stability will be lost finally the mediator must know which international partie s have an influence on as well as an interest in the topics of the mediation the mediator should ensure that the goals of the mediati on are not at odds with those of member of the international community d10 when using an interpreter the mediator must also be mindful of the interpreters personal bias filter to ensure the integrity nd accuracy of interpreters the mediator should arrange for routine check of the interpreters if the interpreter works directly for the mediator the mediat or arranges the check if the interpreter is from pool of interpreters the mediator arranges check with the interpreters supervisor before key meetings the mediator should brief the inte rpreters to ensure the interpreters understand new or difficult ideas and explain uncommon words and their definitions d11 when hiring interpreters mediators must consider many factors local interpreters tend t be the most fluent and have better comma nd of dialects but will be more likel to have more pronounced biases based upon their personal experiences and loyalties to particular ethnic or re ligious groups american interpreters have lower tendency to have personal biases either for or against party but their command of local dialects may not equal that of native speaker if possible mediators should use in terpreters in tandem to ensure accuracy and reliability nd to reduce the effects of personal bias d12 one of the most difficult challenges facing mediator is ensuring that all parties are represented in some cases portions of the populace will be either underrepr esented or not represented at all the mediator must know the demographics of the region to integrate all potential interested pa rties into the process failure to do so will lessen overall support for stab ility and may actually lay the foundation for future controversy where the united states is cited as biased entity meeting phase d13 effective communication is essential to maintain successful negotia tions this will often take place within meetings meetings may be informal and spont aneous or may be routine however ca soldiers must carefully think out and plan the briefing before the meeting d14 before any meeting the ca soldier conducti ng the meeting should accomplish the following z identify the reason for memb ers meeting facetoface z ensure members have been invited well in advance z establish the objectives for the meeting z ensure all participants understand the objectives z circulate reports and other documentation pertin ent to the discussion before the meeting so information can be read and digested z prepare the physical environment beforehand check for warmth fresh air light seating arrangements security communications support accessibility of the meeting location and solitude the ca soldier should also ensure appropriate visual aids whiteboards markers sheets of paper recording equipment and overhead projectors are in place arrange members so they can face each other if possible for larger groups he should try ushaped rows leader has better c ontrol when he is centrally located negotiation and mediation 5 july 2007 fm 305401mcrp 3331a d3 choose location suitable to group size small rooms with too many people get stuffy and create tension larger room is more comfortable and encourages individual expression vary meeting places if possible to accommodate different members z collect any other resources needed for the meeting z assemble static displays if used z establish and publish an agenda z identify and prepare facilitator z identify and prepare recorder at the meeting d15 the facilitator will z make sure the meeting starts on time z be knowledgeable on appropriate social customs and requirements z be aware that people of different cultures may fo llow different time scales if there are latecomers welcome them give them moment to settle and then tell them what the group is doing z welcome members and organizations and conduct introductions z articulate ground rules that have been developed by the members respect for other people there will be interrupting long monologues personal abuse and sufficient time for everybody to express their views confidentiality agreement needs to be reached on whether meeting content shall be discussed outside the meeting responsibility everybody agrees to take responsib ility for timekeeping keeping to the agenda and voicing their opinions in the meeting rather than afterward physical comfort agreement needs to be reached on whether smoking is permissible or whether breaks can be negotiated decision making agreement needs to be reached on how decisions are to be madeby consensus or voting if consensus cannot be achie ved at what point will alternative decision making methods be used and who will decide z read and call for apologies z establish the time frame for the meeting z keep the group focused on the agenda z thank everyone for attending th meeting and if appropriate set the time and place for the next meeting z conduct documents security check of the room or area after the meeting after the meeting d16 during the meeting with officers members discuss problems so improvements can be made t he facilitator will z follow up on delegation decisions ensuring all members understand and carry out their responsibilities z give recognition and appreciation to excellent and timely progress z put unfinished business on the agenda for the next meeting z conduct periodic evaluation of the meetings the facilitato r can analyze productivity and make necessary adjustments z ensure action plans and followups are confirmed z ensure minutes are checked by facilitator and recorder z ensure the time frame for publication and distributi on of minutes reports and the next agenda is arranged as required appendix d d4 fm 305401mcrp 3331a 5 july 2007 goal explanation d17 the methods and operational aspects of an operation ma be classified but there is nothing classified about the goals of us policy upon meeting the parties to the mediation the media tor must be forthright and direct with what is expected between parties as it pertains to the establishment of stability and lasting peace the mediator should present the us goals to ll parties to the mediation in written form and in the local language after the local representatives have read the goals the m ediator should ask questions of them to ensure that they understand the goals and that there is mistaken concept ion that the mediator is trying to further the particular interests of either the united states or local entity d18 neither the goal of stability nor of peace should ve negative connotations when applicable the mediator should place the mediation ffort in the context of larger framework of international or regional agreements or treaty signed by higherlevel local government official establishment of professional interpersonal relationship with the parties d19 it is challenge to balance the interpersonal relationship be tween the mediator and the local parties mediators must be accessible and ope n without appearing to favor one side over another any social meeting should be brief and based upon the professi onal relationship any appearance of being overly cordial with party to the negotiation will erode trust mediators shoul d treat all meetings as if they were in business environment to preclude the taint of impropriet fairness and impartiality d20 in conjunction with interpersonal relationships mediators mus t show fairness and impartiality when mediator suggests program or offers to assist in providing funding or support for cooperative project that adheres to us policy goals he must equitably divi the resources to ensure that neither side profits at the expense of the other d21 similarly the mediator must know when to allocate rewards and punishments if one party consistently cooperates while another party constantly resists or refuses to cooperate the mediator must simultaneously reward and punish the respective partic ipants in this situation an effective way to influence behavior is to seek an increase in funding or support for programs that benefit those w ho cooperate and decrease funding or support for programs that aid the uncooperative d22 mediators should exercise discretion concerning the treatment of how previously noncooperative parties once they begin to cooperate the mediator may recommend either restoring lost funding or support or simply recommend that funding or support be permanently lost perception equals reality d23 an essential tenet in all mediation efforts in postconflict vironment is that perception is the same as reality the basis for reality is how person perceives recent events and not how actual facts prove the perception right or wrong therefore if party to mediation perceives he was wronged then he was wronged alternatively if the united states were percei ved as taking side the united states has facto taken side d24 it is not the impartial mediators place to correct fa lse perception in any even t he will be unable to do so in the limited amount of time he has to affect the situation the mediator must be aware of local misperceptions and find way to circumvent them in postconflict environment an effective wa to correct misperceptions is by longterm revisions made with small steps something tangible to offer d25 while remaining impartial the mediator must have someth ing tangible to offer the parties for cooperation and therefore someth ing tangible to take away for fa iling to cooperate otherwise the mediator is only an observer and cannot lead the mediation effort towa rd cooperation stability and peace there are instances however where mediator has nothing traditionally tangible to offer f unding may be negotiation and mediation 5 july 2007 fm 305401mcrp 3331a d5 slow in coming or nonexistent in those cases the mediator will have to improvise and seek either nontraditional support or methods that allow military res ources to assist the mediator can always leverage the prestige of cooperating with the united states it is unusual for local politicians to not want to appear as being able to hold their own in usled arena money equals influence d26 money usually equals immediate influence however the use of cash can cause problems if not closely monitored mediators must not appear to be using funding for projects to force local offic ials into cooperating in agreements that run counter to th interests of the local populace appendix g provides more information on financial management d27 the united states funds foreign aid projects expressly to influence the decisions of loca l officials however the perception that an offi cial is puppet of the united states will lessen his effectiveness in the community and quell popular support for us policy refocus of the mediation effort d28 there are situations when the mediator may have to totally refocus the mediation effort if the participants are actively opposing us policy and the mediators concerted efforts fail to alter that behavior the mediator should redirect his effort this is very delicate and complex task if the uncooperative representatives are able to quickly or easily replace by dom estic or international means the same support or funding withdrawn by the us representative then the prestige and influe nce of the united states is adversely affected the mediator s hould display his determina tion to seek stability and leverage his ability to curtail support for the uncooperative officials coordi nation with the various members of the igos operating in the area is critical d29 if the mediator must redirect the mediation he should consider different communication methods the mediator can alter the meeting location change which tities participate reassess what subjects will be addressed find different igo to host allow for surrogates or lower the level of representatives from the local communities to succeed the mediator must be flexible d30 the mediator must consistently demonstrate that us determination to achieve stability and peace is greater than the local dedication to continued conflict he must constantly reiterate the goal of cooperation over the protests of the locals to confirm that us staying power wi ll overcome any attempt to stall progress toward peace mediator control d31 mediators must always be in control of themselves and the members of their team nd not become personally involved this is very difficult when the mediator has knowledge of particular particip ants inhumane acts or when party to the mediation exhibits an aggressive attitude matter the circumstances the mediator and his subordinates must maintain their composure d32 mediators must also control the outbursts of the participants the mediator cannot to lerate belligerent acts or threats when unacceptable behavior occurs th mediator must stop the talks immediately to prevent escalation the mediator should then schedule separate and private meetings with each participant to reiterate what is expected of each party d33 the mediator however should not be emotionless there are times when the mediator should show his disapproval both verbally and through body language although the mediator should not yell or aggressively approach any participant he shoul d schedule private meeting to clarify the reason for his disapproval option to retreat d34 parties to mediation should always have an option to retreat the goal of mediation is not to defeat party but to instill cooperation toward stability and p eace there may be times wh participant cannot support position and the mediator s hould tactfully allow the party f acesaving route of escape if an appendix d d6 fm 305401mcrp 3331a 5 july 2007 agreement is made with party that felt trapped that party is very unlikely to honor th agreement it is more effective to reschedule and meet when actual progr ess can be made than to reach an agreement that will be discarded all parties should be able to retreat honorably or with some form of victory private meetings d35 private meetings have an important role in medi ation efforts they allo w the mediator and each participant to know one another on personal level and both the mediator and the individual party can explain their particular goals in addition issues pa rty would not discuss in front of an adversary can be discussed while details and differe nces of opinion can be ironed out d36 the mediator should be aware that too many private meetings with one party or another may give the appearance of favoritism main issues of the mediation should be the focus in private meetings d37 an effective use of the private meeting format is mediation conducted in seclusion and wi thout outside witnesses because the parties do not have th opportunity or feel the pressure to bluster or outmaneuver their adversary for the benefit of the pub lic these meetings can be very constructive once cooperation and trust are established private meetings can quickly lead to progress public meetings d38 public meetings are the most effective vehicle for widely demonstrating progress and support for increased trust cooperation stability and peace between former warring par ties public meetings also help establish the air of permanence and thereby add to the legitimac of the effort d39 although public meetings are preferable to private meetings the costs and inherent ineffic iencies may outweigh the benefits coordinating public meetings can be extremely difficult as local and international spectators attend the mediation the phy sical requirements increase drastically security and safety issues also become more acute the mediator must weigh concerns for security against the public display for stability and peace mediator s must also ensure that the desi re to cooperate and pursue stability and peace is genuine and that parties will not intenti onally use public meeting to disrupt cooperation or us policy postmeeting phase d40 the postmeeting phase is the implementation and followthrough required for successful mediation the following paragraphs discuss the necessary actions that mediators must take representative accountability d41 once local representative commits to and signs an agreement he must be hel d accountable to the terms of the agreement support and funding for proj ects that benefit the signatories communities should always be directly linked to continued adherence to all agreements d42 the mediator must establish system that ensures every party wil l adhere to all agreements if signatory begins to veer away from the intent or the tter of an agreement the diator must be prepared to apportion punishment and clearly and directly explain the reason for the punishment d43 the mediator should use all forms of local national and international press as well as igos that monitor the area as watchdogs as often as possible the mediator should publicize agreem ents to make them matter of public record which will compel the parties to com ply accurate information delivery to all interested parties d44 the press can be tremendous asset and tremendous burden for mediators there are particular guidelines for interacting with the media and the public affairs officer pao within each command is tasked with announcing official information releases the pao is also the primary source for i nformation on contacting members of the press negotiation and mediation 5 july 2007 fm 305401mcrp 3331a d7 d45 the pao ca and io personnel must observe certain parameters when they integrate dia they have to conduct an analysis of the target audience and the method of information delivery they must balance the significance of the event with the amount of press coverage the size and the literacy rate of the audience are also factors in addition the geographic area local regional national or int ernational audiences has significant impact on which media will be effect ive d46 the ca civil information officer and local psyop assets should also be integrated into the delivery of information close coordination for timing and dissemination is critical for success accurately informing the public about successful agreements will broaden popular support for stability and peace while reducing the negative impact of local perceptions about the behavior of their former adversaries d47 wording and translation of information releases are critical as one who is fully knowl edgeable of the subject matter the mediator should be closely i nvolved in drafting all documents describing key points about the agreement when writing information releases the mediator should use short direct sentences that read well if quoted speeches should be availa ble in written form ratified agreements should be presented in as many applicable languages as possibl the mediator should ensure the accuracy of all translations for the tv and radio media the mediator ensures information appears in s hort but understandable pieces that are usable as sound bites as with everything that is to be disseminated after having been translated the mediator should ensure th at appropriate personnel have vetted the translations d48 timing is critical to effectively announcing successful mediation the mediator coordinates with io and pao to ensure events disrupt or detract from the mediators announcement the mediator releases information once he has ensured the content is not diluted or edited to the point where it is ineffective if possible the mediator should avoid dates that involve major holidays elections religious hol days historical events or dates when critical announcement is schedul ed the mediator should also coordinate with the other members of the international community to eliminate the possibility of conflicting announcements written records and agreements d49 written records of all meetings must be kept to ensure that l participants to the mediation understand important terms conditions and definitions within an agreemen t without written records it is impossible to establish the accuracy of an agreement the par ties to the mediation should see that notes and records are being kept which serves two purposes first it reinforces the understanding that the participants will be held to the terms of the agreement and theref ore should not make statements without intending to honor them second written record can be forwarded to the particip ants for their records this documentation boosts the professional image of th mediation thereby enhancing the legitimacy of the mediation effort d50 all agreements must be written and translated handshake to symbolize the final acceptance of an agreement is excellent for closing but does not substitute for written and signed agreement if necessary the mediator can gather signatures on working version of the agreement to stablish documentation of an agreement from this working vers ion the mediator can form alize the agreement with an official signing ceremony the mediator should use all of these protocols to reinforce among the cal population as well as their representatives the seriousness of the agreement and that all agreements will be monitored for compliance d51 english is commonly accepted as the internationa l language of agreements during mediation therefore the english version of an agreement is the official version if the intent or terms of an agreement are challenged the english version must be the benchmark for all clarifications mediation and transition to the international community d52 the mediator should establish routine by scheduling mediation meetings at set interva ls as the mediation progresses he should invite key member s from the international community to observe and participate after the members of the international community be come more active the mediator may defer to them on decisions or integrate their expertise th mediator integrates members of the international community into the process as mediators and hosts to maximize exposure and establish c ooperation if appendix d d8 fm 305401mcrp 3331a 5 july 2007 possible the mediator should enc ourage the group of participating tities to decide on group name to encourage sense of ownership and membership in an exclusive organization d53 the mediator should transition the mediation effort once firmly blished to the international community the mediator can use the role of mediation leader as well as the trust and prestige established over the term of the mediation effort to prepare the participants for tra nsition to the international community doing so will allow th international and nongovernmental institutions and organizations chartered to assist in these ar enas to accomplish their mandates d54 effectively transitioning the international community into th lead role in the mediation effort will help them accomplish their respective missions and may lead to future international community support of us militaryled mediation efforts as us military representatives stablish reputation as effective mediators the international community should in turn become more accepting of the us militarys mediation efforts and therefore become more enthusiastically supportive quicker support from the international community for us military mediation fforts will then reduce the longterm requirement for us force structure needed to conduct postconflict operations d55 the mediator should set timetable in coordina tion with the internati onal community that will gradually transition the lead role from the ca mediator to mediator from the international community the ca mediator should install member of the international community as c omediator or establish pattern for alternating the role of lead mediator fro m one meeting to another the ca representative and the international community represen tative should be present at all mee tings until final transition occurs after coordinating with his chain of command the mediator passes all records to the int ernational community organization that is providing the person who is taking the position of lead mediator mediation process and the mediator s actions d56 mediation in postconflict operation follows general pattern although each operation is on different timeline and can involve additional or fewer steps the process remains constant in some instances steps in the pro cess may take place at the same time or they may take place in different order the mediator must remain flexible and open to change based on the idiosyncrasies of the local situation since ca mediators are often replaced at the sixmont h mark the mediator must initiate the process as soon as possible after arrival in ddition the mediator must have accura records to ensure continuity when he transitions out d57 starting at establishing trust and ending at the first multilate ral agreement the average period for completing mediation cycle is four to six months since the ca mediator is usually in the area for about six months he must act quickly and decisively to velop plan for mediation the following paragraphs describe the general mediation process and the steps the mediator takes during the process establishment of trust closed doorno outside observers participants or press d58 the mediator conducts onetoone meetings to blish professional relationship between himself and each individual participant th mediator also explains us policy goals expectations and the rewards of cooperation as well as the consequences of noncooperation the mediator compiles list of the concerns and grievances of each party he compares the lists and decides which issues show promise of cooperation he looks for areas where infrastructure or lines of communication intersect these areas generate many opportunities where the needs of the pa rties overlap group meetings of increasing size and frequency are held to establish professional relati onship between the participants following onetoone and group meetings the mediator tries to establish the routine of social hour for sma ll talk and to relax the participants in the comp any of former adversaries bilateral mediation open or closed doormay or may not allow outside observers participants or press at the mediators discretion d59 the mediator orchestrates simple agreement over small issue that only involves two of the local entities or villages he concentrates on those areas where conce rns or needs overlap and works with pairs of representatives from the local communities one representative fro m each of the opposing sides the negotiation and mediation 5 july 2007 fm 305401mcrp 3331a d9 mediator rewards the two participants with funding support or by coordinating assistance for thei r respective communities d60 throughout the entire course of the mediation the mediator actively encourages l parties to meet outside the framework of the mediation details about wording or minor aspects about the t erms and conditions of cooperation should ta ke place directly between the oppos ing sides the mediator should make every attempt to determine what the parties have agreed t but the more important goal is to establish normalized communications between all local entities without th intervention of the international community or the us military the mediator meets with the representatives of adjacent entities or villages and discusses the successful coope rative efforts that are occurring in the region and the rewards that ensued d61 the mediator keeps comparative ba lance in the characteristics of the participants he attempts to pair each entity with an entity from the opposition that has simila r size infrastructure farming or business base and economic condition d62 the mediator repeats the above step s with issues of increasing impor tance to establis h credibility in everexpanding realms he makes cooperation the norm so that it becomes expected and not surprise d63 the mediator initiates bilateral talks with as many pairs of th local entities as can be effectively managed when possible he works di fferent issues with each pair to tablish cooperation in various areas d64 as bilateral talks advance toward multilateral setting the m ediator exploits established cooperation between any or all of th pairs of entities he encourages parties to successful bilateral mediation to mentor other pairs who are facing similar problems as the process moves forward int more formalized multilateral mediation the mediator builds ams from the pairs to establish personal bond between the participants d65 all of the above steps lay the groundwork for m eetings between multiple entities before moving forward in the process the mediator should ensure that there are enough successf ul precedents to indicate that multilateral mediation will be fruitful multilateral mediation open or closed d oormay or may not allow outside observers participants or press at the mediators discretion d66 the mediator meets with the pairs of representatives developed during the bilatera l phase to determine their combined concerns and issues also he determines whether they are willing to talk with other pairs of representatives to discuss larger gr oup cooperation and concessions the mediator explains us policy goals the rewards of cooperati on and the consequences of noncooperation d67 the mediator demonstrates the rewards and dvantages of cooperati on by citing previous cooperative ventures and the proceeds that the coope rative parties received for their communities he explains the goals of the mediation and what each cooperative party can exp ect to gain at the conclusion of an acceptable agreement the mediator should ensure that the international community and the military chain of command can and will sustain any support or funding that is proffered d68 the mediator asks the participants to propose name for the group that is representative of th entire region he refers to commonplace name s for rivers mountain ranges or an major terrain feature that the local populace can readily recognize the mediator should ensure the name does not have potential negative connotations such as major battle or the site of an atrocity d69 the mediator begins the multilateral mediation with statement of intent to cooperate he works out the details ahead of time and has the participants sign the document eith er as group or during onetoone meetings group setting is preferred d70 the mediator has the international community and the military commander write congratulatory letters to the entire group of partic ipants and ensures that the word ing is accurate and noninflammatory the mediator submits draft of the letter to the us military com mander and the representatives from the international community so that they have common referenc point from which to write their respective congratulatory letters from this point onward any communication from the us military or the appendix d d10 fm 305401mcrp 3331a 5 july 2007 international community is addressed to the group to reinforce the perception among the partic ipants of membership in larger organization d71 the mediator develops the statement of intent to cooperate into declaration to w ork as cohesive group for rebuilding infrastructure that affects the entire region once again he procures congratulatory letters from the major international community and military hq each s ubsequent statement declaration or agreement should receive letter from the appropria international community and military leadership the mediator matches the level of the local document with the level of the letter that the international and military communities deliver for example an agreement from group whose physical boundaries are within the ao of battalion should receive letters fro m the battalion commander and the leadership of the major international community organizations that conduct business in the immedi ate area as the participants to the mediation outgrow aos of the batt alion or brigade the nexthigher level within the command structure as well as the international community should write congratulatory tter mediation by establishing protocol and schedule d72 the mediator follows the rules of order for typical board of directors meeting and begins distributing minutes from the previous meetings he sets an agenda and keeps to it the media tor encourages direct discussions between the participants of the mediation d73 the mediator initiates plan where the participants to the med iation rotate as the president or host for the meeting any equitable system of rotating th is role is acceptable be it weekly biweekly or monthly as long as it allows all parties an opportunity to lead the discussion the medi ator does not relinquish control of the mediation at this time integration of the international community into the mediation open or closed doormay or may not allow outside observers participants or press at the mediators discretion d74 this period in the cycle of the mediation is criti cal for establishing longterm stability and peace the mediator identifies an organization within the international community that is directly involved with the issues of the participants and will be in the theater for an ex tended time the international community organization should provi person to act as comediator or lternate with the military mediator as the head mediator the us military mediator begins to phase out of th lead role agreement resolution open or closed doorat the mediators discretion d75 this period can be the least predictable in the mediation effort if the mediators prepara tion has been effective external events have disrupted the willingness of the participants to cooperate and funding from either the united states or the international community remains i ntact then participants can rather quickly reach written agreemen t if anything occurs to disturb th process the mediator may have to reinitiate the entire procedure d76 after the basics of the agreemen t are verbally resolved the mediator puts them on paper the mediator can use butcherblock paper on an easel or similar form of displaying the points of the agreement to the entire gr oup to start the process of putting the ideas of the agreement on paper the mediator formalizes the process by creating typewritten int erim versions of all documents and giving everyone copy participants use these documents as working drafts the mediator ma kes changes and adds details as required once the first part of an agreement is concluded momentum toward cooperation is created then the mediator assumes th additional burden of keeping up the pressure to reach finalized document agreement announcement to the public ope n dooroutside observers participants or press are invited d77 the mediator develops program to announce the agreement to both the domestic and the international community he integrates ca civil information and psyop assets to publicize the agreement in concert with the pao the mediator releases information to the l ocal national and international press the mediator ensures that the cooperating participan ts are the focus of all announcements he downplays negotiation and mediation 5 july 2007 fm 305401mcrp 3331a d11 the role of the us military mediation effort and enhances the ro of the international community and the participants to set the stage for eventual transition to the inte rnational community d78 the mediator allows access to signing events for print radio and tv to publicly document the agreement if possible local national and international press agencies should be present and given copies of the agreement in the local language and in english d79 the mediator has the local participants sign the agreement followed by the official witnesses from the international community and th military public display of civility such as group handshake is also encouraged the witnesses should be from the or ganizations tasked with monitoring the agreement mediation expansion d80 mediators should integrate efforts in one ao into the efforts of ad jacent aos if there is current effort underway in an adjacent ao the mediator coor dinates for expansion of th mediation effort across internal boundaries the mediator ducates key leaders in adjacent military and in ternational community organizations on the methods that led to success agreement monitoring d81 the organizations that mediated the agreement must supervise the agreement for compliance by all parties to ensure everyone is meeting the obligati ons outlined in the agreement monitors normally listed in the agreement monitor the local participants as well as us and igos that pl edged support or funding agreement documents d82 the documents that lead up to multilateral agreement can range from the simple to the complex the most successful documents allow for flexibility and are direct and simple complex documents especially when translated lend themselves to multiple interp retations d83 all agreements must be written and readily availa ble to establish compliance by the parties the mediator coordinates the forwarding of documents to all inte rnational community and military organizations in the affected area as well as ad jacent areas to coordinate all fforts to establish cooperation d84 the mediator should leverage every document produ ced during mediation to increase the legitimacy and institutionalization of the cooperative group each document should be the foundation for subsequent documents until the goal of permanently blished stability and peace is accomplished d85 there is standard format for any of these doc uments and the mediator must tailor each document to the individual situation however consistency in format is critical to establishing understanding and legitimacy as the process expands some of the common document s that the mediator will either draft or contribute to are z letters of intent the most simple of the documents involving mediation letters of intent are short statements signed by an individual or by two or more local parties declaring tha t the signatories will come together w ith the intention of discussing cooperation the mediator should be the official witness for these documents letters of intent inc ur other commitment than to enter into talks there is commitment from the united states or i nternational community letters of intent are the base document the mediator uses to bri ng parties to the original talks z statements supporting cooperation statements supporting cooperation are the next type of document that the mediator should pursue these documents include more detail and should incorporate an explicit commitment from the united states or th international community to support or fund projects based upon demonstrated cooperation these documents should quickly generate an official congratul atory letter from the us military as well as the applicable international community organizations appendix d d12 fm 305401mcrp 3331a 5 july 2007 z agreement to cooperate in support of stability and peace written agreement signed by all participants is the pinnacle of th mediation effort these documents delineate the categories in which the signatories intend to cooperate for example refugee return infrastructure reconstruction housi ng education agriculture and so on state what the signatories expect from the international community and the us military in return for cooperation these documents can be politically explosive at the local level and therefore mediators should seek methods to limit negative political impact upon the signatories to the agreement d86 the mediator should ensure that the document has enough detail to hold the participants responsib to the terms of the agreement the document should be concise and not overbearing the mediator shoul d eliminate references to any local political group to preclude the percep tion of favoritism or the generation of negative publicity through associati on flexibility in how signatory in terprets an agreement should be very limited and the body of the agreement mu st address each signatory s specific concerns d87 the mediator will find that issues will emerge after the agreement is signed that will hamper cooperation as soon as possible after signatory identifies an issue the mediator should draft an addendum to the original agreement that eliminates the problem additional administrative documents d88 there will be circumstances when mediator will have t draft document to clarify specific issue relevant to an agreement the mediator should minimize these occasions to preclude confusion and distraction from the intent of the original document the mediat ors task in this situation is to create simple addendum that is concise and directly addre sses grievance or clarifies questionable detail adoption of name d89 these documents are very simple and take the form of an official resolution as long as the media tor supported by cmo planners research negative connotations associated with name there is little contention in adopting name adoption of schedule d90 when the mediator establishes schedule the mediator must ensure that the schedule is clear and equitable to all parties any agreements pertaining to exceptions to predetermined schedule should be included to prevent confusion examples of common exceptions to predetermined schedule include religious holy days elections state holidays and contentious historical dates the m ediator can also incorporate prearranged meeting places and alternate meeting dates or cations into the schedule which adds to the legitimacy of the mediation effort establishment of revolving leadership program d91 the mediator should write agreements about rotating the internal leadership role wi thin the group of participants to ensure equality nd that individual party benefits exceedingly from leadership position the participant who is in the leadership role should not establish the groups agenda or have the powe r to veto or disproportionately affect issues brought to the mediation during the mediation proc ess participants may identify the need for other administ rative positions such as secretary deputy leader and so on recognition of transition of mediators d92 when the time occurs for transition to the international commun ity from the us military the participants should be encouraged to adopt resolution recognizing specific international com munity organization as the new mediator the cmo transition plan establishes the official date of transition and the method for contacting the new mediator this doc ument should not be required when the mediator negotiation and mediation 5 july 2007 fm 305401mcrp 3331a d13 transitions from one us military representative to another since th organization that is leading the mediation has not changed layout of typical agreement d93 the mediator should establish standardized format for each type of document based upon the peculiarities of each operation all subsequent documents in the ao should to the extent possible follow the format of documents written to accomplish similar goals this leads to formalized and predictable structure to succeeding mediation effo rts the mediator coordinates th production of enough copies of the agreement in the local language so that each signatory can receive an original document with original signatures in addition all participants and witne sses should sign an official english version of the agreement for example if there are six participants and two official witness the mediator should coordinate the production nd signing of nine documents to allow each participant and witness to receive an original document each partic ipant and witness receives an origin copy with the english version maintained as the official reference document d94 the general format for an ag reement includes the following z introduction the introduction should state the name of the group signing the agreement the goals of the agreement location and date of the signing and administrative information spe cific to the signing z body the body of the agreement should include the specific areas in which the par ties to the agreement will cooperate political entities that will adhere to the agreement specifics as required clarifyi ng the terms of the agreement what the signatories to the agreement exp ect from the members of the international community and the usg z conclusion the conclusion should state that the agreement is made in an effort to support stability and peace between the comm unities that are parties to th agreement and reiterate the signatories willingness to cooperate fo r the benefit of their communities z signatories the signatories should sign immediately below the body of the agreement the signature blocks shoul d include typed line long enough to accommodate signature the typed name of the signatory under the line for the signa ture with the signato rys title along with the name of his community under his name if the signatories habitually affix seal to official documents the document should include blank space for an official seal to prevent distortion of the signatures note the order of the signatures should not show favoritism an effective technique is to arrange the signatures in the order in which the participants join ed the mediation effort since the mediator took pains to maintain balance the signatories should be in bala nced and unbiased pattern z witnesses the witnesses should sign at the bottom of the document and their signature blocks should follow the pattern used for the participants again the document should include blank space for official stamps or seals maintaining the agreement d95 until the cessation of us participation in an operation the u s military representative who initiates the original mediation effort is responsible for monitoring that the signatories comp ly with any agreements stemming from mediation in addition the us milita ry mediator or representative is responsible for ensuring that the members of the international community as well as the usg comply with the obligations they made appendix d d14 fm 305401mcrp 3331a 5 july 2007 checking for compliance d96 either the mediator or represen tative of the us military should bitually attend the meetings that the parties to the mediation have scheduled this attendance exhibits the continued int erest of the us military and allows for an insight into how the fforts to support cooperation are progressing continuing contact with the representatives that have to comply with an mediated agreement facilitates communications and an open environment the mediator or his representative should always seek ways to reinforce cooperation d97 the mediator or his representative should perform scheduled and unscheduled inspections into areas where the local parties have agreed to cooperate meetings with local leaders who are not signatories to mediated agreement should include questions about support by the populace for cooperation as well as adherence by the local community to previous agreements d98 mediators should use all available information resources military and civilian to monitor adherence to the terms of the agreement the mediator should also watch for parties that ci rcumvent the intent of the agreement warnings as to possible punishment for noncompliance should be timely nd direct the mediator should have leeway for recommending curtailment of support for intentional breaches of an agreement d99 conversely mediators should reward cooperation be tween former adversaries in areas not covered by the terms of mediated agreement if possible mediators should seek add itional funding or support for initiatives outside the parameters of previous agreement d100 the mediator should apprise members of the international community of the current situati on advising members of an increase or decrease in cooperation doing so allows the in ternational community to reward or punish the local tities as their behavior dictates moderating the size d101 when the mediator sets out to bring former warring parties together he is always concerned wi th the issue of how many communities to incorporate into the mediation each operation will be different since two nations have political subdivisions of the same size d102 the mediator must be careful not to include too many parties in mediation effort too large of population can overburden the funding nd logistical capability of the milita ry assets and the international community than are committed to supporting cooperati on gradual expansion of the population involved in mediation can generally be planned for and accommodated but too many people too fast will overwhelm the theaters logistical systems d103 each party will have issues specific to their co mmunity and with large group the likelihood of competition for resources escalates additionally the requiremen t to monitor agreements by small force over expansive terrain is inefficient the typical optimum size of mediation effort is six to eight participants depending upon the popul ation and geography within each community mediation efforts larger than this tend to overcom the ability of the limited number of us military personnel and should remain in the realm of the international community or the us state department 5 july 2007 fm 305401mcrp 3331a e1 appendix force protection

areas pose safety risk to soldiers passing through those areas z the capability to organize and mobilize great numbers of civil ians armed with firearms pitchforks clubs or stones can overwhelm force opera ting among or near the mobilized population z nuclear power plants or facilities that employ toxic chemicals in production processes are vulnerable to accidents or direct terrorist attack that

minimize civilian interference with military operations and to protect civilians from combat operations dc operations are part of the cmo plan but because of expertise ca operators need to be prepared to be the lead elemen ts in dc operations this appendix addresses techniques for meeting those goals overview f1 people may become dislocated from their homes or villages for va riety of reasons in

gravity civil decisive points and civil lines of operation in their analysis f6 dc planners use this analysis to create series of civil situational templates sittemps the first of the civil sittemps describes civil dispositi ons under normal conditions and circumstances the remaining civil sittemps describe the possible c oas populace or portions of populace may take given certain criteria or stimuli ideally the sittemps will indicate the anticipated speed direction and flow pattern of dc movement described later in this appendix f7 dc templating is more of an art than science planners will often need to call on knowledgeable representatives of various ca specialties to fully understand the civil environment examples of additional information requirements that may resu lt from brainstorming are as follows z what is the status and resiliency of the civilian support infrastructure in the area z what is the level of preparedness for this type of situation for example how

this coa involves executing populace control measures such as stayput policy curfew and controlled evacuations each measure requires detaile d assessment and planning as well as coordination with and support of hn civil authorities and at times the international community public information and psyop assets will increas the chance of success stayput policy f15 stayput policy is essentially an order to citizens to stay within the confines of their homes communities or other defined bounda ries successful execution of st ayput policy requires that the citizens be provided with sufficient necessities of life food water she lter security and health care according to accepted international sta ndards such as the sphere project during and after the period the policy is in effect mitigation measures conducte d during predisaster emergency services programs building individual and community survival she lters stockpiling food and medicines and conducting preparedness exercises will enhance the willingness of citizens to abide by stayput policies emergency response operations such as the airlift of disaster relief into the populated area may so be required f16 the stayput policy minimizes civilian interference with mil itary operations and just as importantly minimizes civil collateral damage hn authorities should enforce stayput policy whenever possible when enfor ced by military forces the policy requires an agreement among participating nations and the appropriate military command t his section provides guidance on what such agreements should or could contain general f17 this agreement should state that in matters concerning population moveme nt military commanders will always deal through and with the appropriate na tional commanders or authority stay put means that civil authorities will do everything in their power to stop dcs also known as idps in their own country especially preventing them from passing from one c ountry to another neighboring countries should cooperate closely to help in the implementation of this policy within comm on frontiers if for whatever reason some movement does take place the receiving country should do all in its power to hold dcs in appropriate areas and return them to the country from which they were displaced as soon as circumstances permit any such movement might gravely prejudice national mult inational

way of minimizing the chaos that xists when civilians will not or should not stay where they are for ced dislocations may be appropriate to protect civilians from combat operations and impending

dictate that dcs can or must be ignored or bypassed to ensure military success an example is rapid offensive operations in which maintaining momentum is required commanders should consider the use of psyop leaflets or loudspeakers to instruct or bolste r the morale of bypassed dcs f26 the decision to bypass or ignore dcs depends on the factors of metttc and may require the approval of the chain of command bypassed or ignored dcs must eventually be controlled by some military or civilian organization in the ao since bypassed groups of dcs may include enemy infiltra tors attempting to pass through friendly lines the military or civilian organization must be prepared to take security and fp measures when assuming this control movement control f27 dc movement must often be c ontrolled to minimize interference with planned or ongoing military operations planners may use several techniques to control the movement of dcs these techniques require detailed assessment and planning as well as coordi nation with and support of hn civil authorities and at times the international community these techniques include blocking clearing and collecting table f1 table f1 measures to control dislocated civilians control measure effectiveness of measure special requirements personnel resource intensity blocking mediumhigh conductive terrain lowmedium clearing lowmedium dedicat ed vehicles lowmedium collecting lowhigh special training highvery high blocking f28 blocking uses roadblocks possibly supported by checkpoints to prevent dcs from flowing onto roads or into areas essential for the conduct of military operations blocking involves preventing dcs from entering those areas and redirecting them to some other area such as back to their homes or along designated dc route depending on the security situation and othe r factors civilians and their means of transport may or may not be searched at the blocking position f29 the following questions must be consider ed when planning dc blocking operations z what are the likely timing direction route rate and flow of dcs this is required to mass forces when and where th ey are most needed z where is terrain that canalizes dcs z does the ability exist to reinfo rce roadblock under pressure z does the flexibility exist to disengage on order clearing f30 clearing directs dcs from main s upply routes alternate supply rout and other areas of military significance to keep them from interfering with operations ordinary soldiers or small specialized teams at the small unit level clear dcs their sole purpose is to confro nt dcs remove them from their current location and orient them toward the location to which th commander wants them to go in some cases this may simply be the shoulder of the road techniques in dislocated civilian operations 5 july 2007 fm 305401mcrp 3331a f9 f31 clearing is intended for fastpaced unitlevel opera tions clearing is not an effective method for largescale dc operations clearing must be deliber ately planned and integrated with other control techniques clearing is intended to push or direct dcs in specifi ed directions away from military operations installations or encampments until they can be pic ked up by more organized dc operations such as collecting f32 some of the challenges of clearing operations include the following z clearing is temporary in nature units must continually sweep or chase new or returning dcs z external support is often required to transmit th intended message in way that the dcs will understand z dcs present continuing security concern for frie ndly forces for example potential for terrorist acts such as car or suicide bombings z unit resources can be quickly overwhelmed if the numbers of dcs are great or the dcs nee d emergency assistance collecting f33 collecting provides positive control of concentrations of dcs t various holding areas to prevent them from interfering with operations and to foster care and processing the collection plan is resource intensive and must be coordinated and synchronized with operations logistics and security plans whenever possible existing f acilities such as barns and wa rehouses should be considered f34 collecting must also be planne d and executed in collaboration with hn authorities and ngos that specialize in public health public safety public communi cations transportation public works and utilities and mass care and feeding the main features of co llecting are collection points dc routes assembly areas and dc camps collection points f35 these are temporary holding areas for gathering small numbers of dcs before moving onward along dc routes to assembly areas or dc camps units establishing dc collection points commonly known as civ on operational graphics

routes that offer protection to dcs dc routes move dcs away from the main effort of military combat and logistics operations assembly areas f37 assembly areas are larger and more elaborate than collection points they provide dcs with emergency relief such as food intermediate medi cal care and temporary shelter designated personnel military or civilians of the united states hn or international community begin screening and registering dcs to identify family groups determine points of or igin and intended destina tions and other pertinent information they also begin to

rest areas ca soldiers set up emergency rest areas at congested points to provide for the immediate needs of the dcs these needs include water food fuel maintenance and medical services z local and national agencies use of local and national agencies is essential for three reasons first it conserves military resources second civilian authorities normally have legal s tatus and are best equipped to handle their own people third the use of local personnel reduces the ne ed for interpreters or translators f41 when routing dc movements cmo planners should consider three fundamentals and four principles that govern routing the three fundamentals that govern routing are z balance the process of matching dc column charact eristics with route ch aracteristics balance ensures that dc traffic never r outinely exceeds the most limiting f eatures of route balancing also identifies requirements for upgrading routes or ordering cautions for certain areas along the route route characteristics are identified during the planning process z separation the process of allocating road space for movements to ensure that movements do not conflict the goal of separation is to reduce the potential for congestion z distribution the process of allocating as many routes as possible to reduce the potential for congestion distribution also promotes passive s ecurity by distributing and separating traffic f42 the four principles that govern routing are as follows z assign highest priority traffic to routes that provide the minimum timedistance z consider sustainability of route network when assigning moveme nts z separate motor movements from pedestrian movements z separate civilian traffic vehicular or pedestrian from military movem ents f43 effective routing of dcs requires detailed unde rstanding of the military highway regulation and traffic circulation plan route classification and traffic control mea sures currently in use by military movement control agencies are pplicable during the planning and execution of dc operations these measures include z open routes z supervised routes z dispatch routes z reserved routes z prohibited routes f44 opsec considerations are important planned dc routes may be an indicator for the loc ation of the main effort in the attack or defense by attempting to minimize interference by dcs with military operations planners may inadvertently disclose the location of the ma in effort because opposing forces seek to discover seams and boundaries to exploit them dc planners should not consistently move dcs along seams or unit boundaries the example in figure f 4 pages f12 and f13 discusses dc road space usage calculations combined dislocated civilian control methods f45 an analysis of metttc may indicate that seve ral of the dc control methods may be required simultaneously or sequentially in port city for example the people in predominantl neutral area may be ordered to stay in th eir neighborhoods and conform to such restrictions as curfews meanwhile civilians in hostile section of the city may be quarantined one may enter or l eave without permission and escort and those in the areas closest to critical t facilities and adjoining the main inland supply routes may be selectively evacuated appendix f f12 fm 305401mcrp 3331a 5 july 2007 1 task visualize describe and direct dc operations 2 fact the city of

in tense negotiations that have potential for creation or expansion of unrest or may result in highly adverse public perceptions bey ond the battlefield negotiations include meetings with civil leaders but not hostage incidentshostage rescue and similar means of resolving hostage situation are beyond the scope of generic tf dc control instead one goal of negotiation is to contain the incident or issue by containing the incident or issue the incident doe s not adversely or unduly influence the populace the second goal of negotiation is to resolve the incident or issue peacefully if possible so that civilian lives are not undul jeopardized and the incident does not become focus of the local or international news media z special reaction team sniper the primary purpose of the special reaction team sniper is to neutralize special threats effectively and safely as they arise in blocking clearing and collecting operations another purpose is to support the apprehension of troublemakers and ringleaders by team assigned to snatch them from crowd however apprehending suspect in other circumstances is beyond the scope of generic tf dc control z special reaction team armored vehicles the primary purposes of the special reaction team armored vehicles are to conduct showofforce ope rations especially at road blocks protect tf elements and any civilians in their charge and assist the tf as needed to include the execution of snatch apprehensions in crowds z medical care team the primary purposes of the medical care team are to respond quickly to civilian mass casualties mascal to begin tria ge and coordinate fu rther mascal response with the surgeon from the parent unit and medical operations center or the equivalent and to provide medical care above the level of emergency first aid as needed by the tf z ci team the primary purpose of the ci team is to exploit the potential for military and civil military information from civilians encountered by the

searches any property taken under the searchers control is ta gged and copy given to the owner field property control card should be used and an xplanation card should be issued as necessary z always use trained personnel to perform searches if possible females search females infants and little boys if female searcher is not at the collection point but can arrive there in reasonable time these searches are deferred until she arrives the searched people are set aside until then so that they do not pose clear and prese nt potential danger to others if female searcher cannot be obtained

everyone else this pr ocessing may be done without translator searchers should beware of irregular s and infiltrators trying to pass as civ ilians upon discovery all epws civilian internees and detainees are placed in the shortterm detainee holding area normally anyone who is causing problem at the collection point is detained although civilian internees and detainees should be further segregated from epws rarely is th time or resources available to do this f67 consistent with orders searchers take control of all items tha t may cause harm to the team friendly forces passing the collection point or the dcs in ddition searchers confiscate and tag all items that noncombatants are not permitted to have according to us or hn policy f68 if available field property control card is affixed to the vehicle or animal the field propert control card contains at minimum the following information the dc collect ion point number the date the seized item quantity the seized item

missionspecific obligations and requirements f71 the following historical example which discusses sanitation originates from not of ca soldier who served in operation desert storm lesson learned during operation desert storm when disposing of waste the burning pr ocedure used in vietnam would not work because the moslem population has the habit of cleaning th emselves with water therefore instead of waste there was high level of water or waste liquid this material would not burn consequently the recommended procedure was to have deep hole where the waste could be disposed of and allow ed to dry out once dry the waste was usually burned or buried resolution or disposition of each dislocated civilian f72 once dc collection point is operational there are four possible outcomes for the collecti on point operators z retain control of the collection point recognizing that moral obligations to dcs at th collection point increase with time z close down the collection point by releasing the dcs from it if warranted by the tactica l situation and other factors z arrange for movement of the dcs to another holding area such as civil ian assembly area z hand off collection point operations to other opera tors such as support unit or the hn which is the most likely outcome for infantry units on the move dislocated civilian collection point handoff f73 as unit moves out of an

such as local law enforcement or followon forces taking control of the dc collection point unit commanders act according to their moral and legal obligations weighing the advantages and di sadvantages of each option transferring control f76 to transfer control of this property units must f ill out property control register listing all the items controlled and have an official of the followon forces sign for the items and copy of the regist er itself by using da form 3161 request for issue or turnin retaining control f77 if units take the property with them it must be taken if one will s ign for

schools halls theaters vacant warehouses unused factories or workers camps ca soldiers must avoid those sites near vital communication centers large military installations or ot her potential military targets the location of the camp also depends on the availability of food water power and waste disposal additional considerations include the susceptibility of the area to natural or manmade disa sters for example flooding pollution and fire and the use of camp personnel as source of local labor support f83 the physical layout of the camp is important the main principle is to subdivide th camp into sections or separate compounds to ease administrati on and camp tension each section can serve as an administrative subunit for transacting camp business the major sections normally in clude camp

possible ca soldiers organiz and train the cadre before the camp opens whenever possibl civilians should come from public and private welfare organizations and be under m ilitary supervision other concerns are problems that might stem from the state of mind of the dcs the difficulties they have experienced may affect their acceptance of authority they may have little initiative or may be uncooperative because of an uncertain future they may be angry because of their losses or they may resort to looting and general lawlessness because of their destitution the camp administrator can
