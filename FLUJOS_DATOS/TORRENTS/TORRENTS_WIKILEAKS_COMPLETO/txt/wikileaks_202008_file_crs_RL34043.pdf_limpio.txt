imports some states have attempted to regulate this commerce by imposing barriers or requirements speciﬁc to waste importation federal courts however have declared such state restrictions unconstitutional if states are to have such authority these decisions say congressional action is required since the late 1980s congress has considered but not enacted numerous bills that would grant

same subject crs report rl32570 interstate shipment of municipal solid waste 2004 update provides updated information on interstate shipment of municipal solid waste msw since the late 1980s congress has considered but not enacted numerous bills that would allow states to impose restrictions on interstate waste shipments step the constitution prohibits in the absence of congressional authorization over this period there has been continuing interest in knowing how much waste is being shipped across state lines for disposal and what states might be affected by proposed legislation this report provides data useful in addressing these questions it generally presents data as of 2005 total interstate waste shipments continue to rise due to the closure of older local landfills and the consolidation of the waste management industry more than 42 million tons of municipal solid waste crossed state lines for disposal in 2005 an increase of 8 over 2003 waste imports have grown significantly since crs began tracking them in the early 1990s and now represent 253 of the municipal solid waste disposed at landfills and waste combustion facilities in the last 10 years reported imports have increased 147 pennsylvania remains the largest waste importer the state received more than 79 million tons of msw and 17 million tons of other nonhazardous wast from out of state in 2005 most of this waste came from new jersey and new york pennsylvanias waste imports represented 19 of the national total virginia and michigan the second and third largest importers received 57 million tons and 54 million tons from out of st ate respectively in 2005 each of them about 30 less than the amount received by pennsylvania with the exception of pennsylvania each of the 15 largest importers showed an increase in waste imports compared to our last survey which provided data as of 2003 indiana michigan and wisconsin showed particularly large increases with ohio new york oregon and georgia also increasing substantially in each of these states waste imports increased by 300000 tons or more in some cases substantially more in all 30 states had increased imports in the current report and 11 states reported imports that exceeded 1 million tons while waste imports increased overall pennsylvania the leading importer reported sharp decline in imports pennsylvanias imports fell for the fourth year in row about 27 million fewer tons of outofstate msw were received at pennsylvania landfills in 2005 than in 2001 factors causing this decline included the imposition of an additional 400 per ton state fee on waste disposal and the absence of rail service at pennsylvania landfills new york remains the largest exporter of waste with new jersey in second place nine other states illinois missouri maryland massachusetts washington minnesota north carolina indiana and florida the district of columbia and the canadian province of ontario also exported more than 1 million tons each

requirements specific to waste importation federal courts however have declared such state restrictions unconstitutional if states are to have such authority these decisions say congressional action is required since the late 1980s congress has considered but not enacted numerous bills that would grant such authority1 over this period there has been continuing interest in knowing how much waste is being shipped across state lines for disposal and what states might be affected by proposed legislation this report provides data useful in addressing these questions it updates information provided in earlier crs reports2 the report presents information gathered through telephone contacts with solid waste officials in the 50 states the district of columbia and the canadian province of ontario which ships large quantities of waste to the united states principa lly to michigan the data obtained from these contacts are summarized in tables 1 2 and 3 and figures 1 and 2 table 4 presents additional information including the names and telephone numbers of state contacts and in some cases links to detailed reports on solid waste management in the specific state that are available on the web not all states require reporting of waste imports and very few track exports so the available data are incomplete and in some cases represent estimates rather than actual measurements in number of cases faced with conflicting reports from exporters and importers or quantitative data at all the report provides crss best estimate based on discussions with state officials or other sources seven of the states provided data for period other than calendar year 2005either fiscal year that included part of 2005 or different calendar year this adds another layer of imprecision crs generally combined data for whatever was the reporting period closest to 2005 even though in these seven cases this meant combining data from somewhat different time periods the exceptions are noted in the appropriate tables as result many of the totals reported here represent best estimate rather than precise figures 1 legislation on interstate shipment of waste has been introduced in every congress since the 100th in the 104th congress the senate passed s 534 which would have granted states authority to restrict new shipments of municipal solid waste from out of state if requested by an affected local government in the 103 rd congress both the house and senate passed interstate waste legislation hr 4779 and s 2345 but lack of agreement on common language prevented enactment for discussion of the issues addressed in these bills see crs report rs20106 interstate waste transport legislative issues by james mccarthy 2 this report replaces crs report rl

show that total interstate waste shipments continue to rise3 imports in the current survey totaled 422 million tons 17 of the 2457 million tons of municipal solid waste generated in the united states4 of municipal waste disposed as oppo sed to recycled or composted the percentage is higher epa estimates that 790 million tons of municipal solid waste were recycled or composted in 2005 leaving 1667 million tons to be disposed in landfills or incinerators of this amount 253 crossed state lines for disposal 5 between crss year 2004 report reporting largely 2003 data and the current survey reporting generally 2005 data imports increased 32 million tons or 8 since 1995 reported imports have risen 147 from 171 million tons in 1995 to 422 million tons in the current survey 3 we rely on imports rather than exports as our measure of total shipments because we believe that waste management facilities and states have greater in terest in accurately measuring imports than they do exports often the am ounts received and their source are subject to formal legal reportin g requirements andor fees with penalties for failure to report exports are not generally subject to such requirements 4 because many of the larger importing states now differentiate msw from other nonhazardous waste imports we compared total msw imports to epas national estimate of msw generation 2457 million tons in 2005 for epa data on waste generation see municipal solid waste in the united states 2005 facts and figures at httpwwwepagovmswpubsmswchar05pdf statereported waste generation summarized in biocycle magazines biannual survey is substantially higher 509 million tons in 2004 but may include other nonhazardous waste provided it was disposed at msw facilities for statereported data see phil simmons nora goldstein scott m kaufman nickolas j themelis and james thompson jr the state of garbage in america biocycle april 2006 p 26 removing canadian waste from the total imports would also reduce the percentage of waste crossing state lines for disposal from 17 to 16 5 much of the waste destined for recycling may also have crossed state lines but waste destined for recycling is not as controversial as that sent for disposal in addition recyc ling facilities do not generally require permits by state agencies thus amounts shipped across state lines for recycling cannot generally be tracked by the solid waste agencies httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34043g11g151g157g142g155g156g157g138g157g142g561g21g145g146g153g150g142g151g157g561g152g143g561g15g158g151g146g140g146

occurring in indiana michigan and wisconsin these three states along with pennsylvania and virginia accounted for 56 of total municipal waste imports in 2005 as shown in table 1 pennsylvania continues to be the largest waste importer disposal facilities in the state received 79 million tons of msw and 17 million tons of other nonhazardous waste from out of state in 2005 the amounts represented 39 of all solid waste disposed in the state and 19 of the national total for interstate msw shipments pennsylvania has abundant landfill capacity relatively low tipping fees and is near two major states that have shortage of disposal capacity new york and new jersey despite the states continued predominance on the list of waste importers pennsylvanias msw imports actually declined for the fourth year in row in 2005a cumulative decrease of more than 27 million tons this happened simultaneously with continued growth of interstate waste shipments along the eastern seabord several factors appear to have been at work first beginning in 2002 pennsylvania imposed new state fee of 400 per ton on waste disposal added to preexisting fees the state and local governments in pennsylvania now collect 725 on each ton of waste disposed in the state this may have provided sufficient economic incentive for some haulers to dispose elsewhere second the state appears to be receiving less waste from new york city whose mayor has adopted goal of shipping all of new york citys waste by rail rather than truck pennsylvania has landfills served by rail so some of this waste has been diverted to large landfills in virginia that do have rail service after pennsylvania virginia is the largest waste importer with imports totaling 57 million tons of msw and 13 million tons of other nonhazardous waste waste imports to virginia have increased 45 since 2001 when they totaled 41 million tons of msw and 07 million tons of other waste the state has attempted to restrict imports but has not been as successful as pennsylvania in part because it has chosen variety of measures that have run afoul of the constitutions interstate commerce clause these included ban on barge shipping of wastes on virginia rivers truck regulations that applied only to commercial solid waste transporters and daily limits on the amount of waste that virginia landfills could accept 6 michigan the thirdlargest waste importer for the past several years has also seen substantial growth in imports significant amounts of waste come to michigan from indiana illinois and other neighboring states but the biggest source accounting for 69 of michigans outofstate waste is ontario canada ontario is also michigans neighbor but the fact that it lies in foreign country and that it has large expanses of open land where landfills might be sited seems to have added additional notoriety to its waste shipments ontarios shipments to michigan have grown as toronto canadas largest city awarded new contracts for waste disposal and closed its last two landfills at the beginning of 1999 the toronto area was generating about 28 million tons of waste annually of which about 700000 tons were shipped to michigan by early 2003 however 6 see

area and almost all of the waste was being shipped to michigan where large disposal sites offered very low cost disposal in august 2006 the ontario minister of the environment reached an agreement with michigans two senators under which ontario will eliminat shipments of municipally managed waste to michigan by the end of 2010 in return the senators agreed not to pursue passage of legislation that would have imposed large inspection fees and other requirements on ontarios waste shipments to the united states 7 on september 19 2006 torontos city council approved letter of intent to purchase landfill near london ontario where it is expected to ship its waste as it phases out shipments to michigan the agreement reached by the two michigan senators in their exchange of letters with ontarios minister of the environment would not eliminate the majority of the waste shipped from ontario to michigan however the agreement refers to municipally managed waste and specifically uses 2005 baseline amount of 134 million metric tons of municipal waste shipped 8 about two thirds of the waste shipped from ontario is not municipally managedit is waste collected by private haulers and shipped to michigan landfills under private contracts these wastes are exported to michigan either because it provides lower cost disposal options or because the landfills in michigan are controlled by the same company that collects the waste in canada the provincial government and the local governments within the province have authority to prevent these private waste shipments from leaving ontario for additional information on canadian waste import issues see crs report rl33720 imports of canadian waste in other highlights from the crs survey eleven states reported imports exceeding 1 million tons per year an increase from 10 in crss last survey indiana the additional state jumped from 11 th to 4th on the list with an increase of 15 million tons in addition to the 11 states that imported more than million tons another 20 states had imports exceeding 100000 tons besides the three big increases discussed above indiana virginia and michigan states that reported major increases in imports compared to crss previous survey were wisconsin new york ohio oregon georgia illinois maine tennessee and kansas each of which reported an increase of at least 100000 tons growth of waste imports in the great lakes states was particularly strong together indiana wisconsin michigan ohio and illinois saw an increase of 365 million tons in msw imports new jersey remains on the list of major importers with 17 million tons of msw imports in 2005 the state is also major exporter of waste receiving states estimated new jerseys exports at 58 million tons the absence of flow control local government requirements that waste within their jurisdiction be disposed at local facilities which were overturned by the courts in the mid1990s has led to increased waste exports from new jersey over the last decade wastetoenergy facilities in new jersey in turn began importing msw in order to replace local 7 letter of senators stabenow and levin to hon lauerl c broten ontario minister of the

entered new jersey from new york in recent years on april 30 2007 the supreme court held in the united haulers case that flowcontrol ordinances requiring delivery of local waste to publiclyowned processing facility do not violate the constitutions commerce clause making it cl ear that some forms of flow control can survive judicial scrutiny9 new jersey officials do not expect the decision to have much impact on waste exports or imports however10 besides pennsylvania only alabama experienced major decrease in imports in 2005 imports to alabama have been particularly volatile they declined by almost 270000 tons 65 in 2005 compared to 2003 but rebounded 150000 tons in 2006 even after that increase they were less than half the peak amount recorded in 2002 ten other states reported declines in waste imports the declines were generally smallin half the cases less than 20000 tons although there are comprehensive data imports to transfer stations11 have been political issue in some locations transfer stations are generally located in urban areas and are subject to less stringent regulation than disposal facilities heavy truck traffic and odors have aroused concerns in some neighboring communities connecticut rhode island the district of columbia and south carolina have reported significant amounts of outofstate waste imported to transfer stations then exported to other states for disposal new york city plan to export most of its waste to transfer stations in new jersey raised substantial controversy before being rescinded

and florida and the district of columbia each exported more than 1 million tons of waste to facilities in other states in the latest reporting period and 21 other states exported more than 100000 tons as noted above the canadian province of ontario also exported substantial amount of municipal waste nearly 4 million tons most of it to michigan12 although the reported amount of total waste exports grew by more than 4 million tons shipments from the two largest exporting states new york and new jersey did not increase compared to crss last survey new yorks exports fell more than million tons to

exports more than doubled to 44 million tons13 most of the exports originate in cook county chicago and its suburbs which has relative shortage of disposal capacity illinois as whole has reported more than doubling of landfill capacity since 1995 but chicago is located near the border of both indiana and wisconsin so increases in capacity elsewhere in illinois may not affect disposal decisions in the chicago metropolitan area in all 10 states and ontario increased waste exports by more than 100000 tons each in the period in addition to illinois and ontario minnesota and florida showed the largest increases five states and dc had decreases of more than 100000 tons besides new york the others were georgia ohio pennsylvania and michigan

shows that 21 states were net importers 24 plus the district of columbia were net exporters thirtyeight of the 50 states had net imports or exports exceeding 100000 tons in the reporting period 22 exceeded 500000 tons perhaps most interesting given the tendency to identify states as either exporters or importers 25 states both exported and imported in excess of 100000 tons of municipal solid waste an increase from 23 in crss last report several factors are at work here in the larger states there are sometimes differences in available disposal capacity in different regions within the state areas without capacity may be closer to landfills or may at least find cheaper disposal options in other states good example is illinois the chicago area which is close to two other states exports significant amounts of waste out of state downstate however illinois has substantial available landfill capacity and imported 2 million tons from st louis other locations in missouri and iowa as noted earlier the movement of waste also represents the regionalization and consolidation of the waste industry in 2005 the three largest firms waste management allied waste and republic services accounted for 66 of total revenues of the industrys 100 largest firms14 these large firms offer integrated waste services from collection to transfer station to disposal site in many locations often they ship waste to their own disposal facility across border rather than dispose of it at an instate facility owned by rival as small landfills continue to closethe number of us landfills declined 63 between 1993 and 2004 from 4482 to 1654 15this trend toward regionalization consolidation and waste shipment across state lines is likely to continue
