version of this legislation s 578 in the 108th congress raised concern in some quarters that it would overturn nevada v hicks 533 us 353 2001 or otherwise expand indian tribal sovereignty s 477 diﬀers from the earlier version both by including authority for direct funding rather than indirect funding through individual states of indian tribal homeland security projects and by eliminating the provisions in the earlier bill that appeared to endorse view of tribal criminal and civil jurisdiction inconsistent with supreme court rulings on the subject of tribal jurisdiction the operative provisions of the legislation remove tribal governments from the deﬁnition of local governments and distinguish them from both state governments and local governments the legislation also appears to contain direct statement speciﬁcally granting or delegating particular law enforcement authority to tribes or overruling any named supreme court case related legislation includes 131 of s 536 and s

1 200 senator dorgan noted that although they are not subdivisions of states tribal governments are included in the homeland security act hsa definition of local gove rnment and thus derive their funding for responding to threats of terrorism through state programs he stated that s 477 is designed to correct this situation to treat indian tribes as the separate political entities that they are consistent with the federal policy of tribal selfgovernance and self determination and to explicitly vest the secretary of the department of homeland security with the discretionary authority to provide direct funding to indian tribal governments rather than indirect f unding through the individual states 151 cong rec s18681869 an earlier bill s 578 of the 108th congress with similar purpose

federa l constitution the fede ral constitution confers on congress the powerto re gulate commerce with fore ign nations and among the several states and with the indian tribes1 and on the president and the senate the power to make treaties including treaties with the indian tribes2 in cherokee nation v georgia 3 the marshall court ruled that the cherokee indian nation was not foreign state and referred to indian tribes as domestic dependent nations4 entitled to the land that they occupied until the national government which held title against their will sought possession he declared that in th eir relationship to the national government tribes were in state of pupilage resembling ward to his guardian5 the following year in worcester v georgia 6 the court ruled that state laws could not be applied to activity in indian country where federal law by virtue of the supremacy clause ruled federal power was param ount and plenary in indian country from these cases are derived certain principles that have guided court decisions in the field of federal indian law 1 by virtue of aboriginal political and territorial status indian tribes possessed certain incidents of preexisting sovereignty 2 such sovereignty was subject to diminution or elimination by the united states but not by the individual states and 3 the tribes limited inherent sovereignty and their corresponding dependency on the united states for protection imposed on the latter trust responsibility7 from the earliest days of the nation federa l power has been interpreted broadly and used to enact statutes to re gulate trade and commerce defi ne and punish crimes prohibit liquor traffic and dispose of indian lands and property8 the supreme court has upheld this broad exercise of power in indian affairs and referred to it as plenary9 and has only recently recognized constitutional limits on it when it acknowledged that the fifth amendment for example places limits on that power10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21533crs3 10 continued though congress could dispose of indian property or change it from one form to another when it took land from tribe for public purpose th fifth

of tribal sovereignty the court drew distinction between tribal sovereign powers that have been retained and those that have been divested divestment may occur either explicitly by federal statute or implicitly as inconsistent with tribes status as subject to the sovereign authority of the united states according to the court authority over internal tribal affairs and relations among tribal members falls into the category of powers that have been retained while those directed outside the tribe are of the type that may have been divested11 tribal sovereignty has been diminished by treaties statutes and by the existence of the sovereignty of the united states in the field of administration of justice there has been considerable dilution of tribal authority prior to the treaties tribes could exert civil and criminal jurisdiction to prescribe rules of conduct and maintain law and order they could define and punish malfeasance and cr ime within their territory power that sometimes extended to nonmembers12 today although trib have criminal law jurisdiction over nonindians in accordan ce with the supreme courts ruling in oliphant v suquamish indian tribe 435 us 191 1978 they do retain criminal law power over their members13 and exercise delegated power over nonmember indians under 1990 legislation which has been uphe ld by the supreme court in united states v lara 14 this criminal law power has been limited in at least three ways 1 by federal statutes extending federal criminal law jurisdiction over indian country 2 by the indian civil rights act15 limiting tribal power to impose sentences or fines and 3 by delegation of criminal law jurisdiction over indians and reservations to states much law enforcement authority over indians on indian reservations resides

enacted the statute delegated criminal law jurisdiction to california minnesota except for the red lake reservation nebraska oregon except warm spring s reservation and wisconsin except menominee reservation and offered other states the option of accepting jurisdiction or any portion thereof subseque nt amendments added alaska as mandatory state permitted retrocession of jurisdiction and required trib consent for assumption of jurisdiction s 477 and indian tribal sovereignty generally most of the provisions in the bill do not effectuate substantive changes in the law because they merely add the word tribal after state in the phrase state and local governments in contexts in which hsa has already included tribal governments by incorporating them within the definition of local government22 the bill also renames hsas office of state and local government coordination to office of state tribal and local government coordination while these changes do not alter substantive law they may have the effect of increasing or centralizing the attenti on that hsa provides to tribal government concerns similarly there are other provisions that specifically mention the indian health

warrants authorized by the foreign intelligence surveillance court to consult with tribal as well as other law enforcement officials24 omission of earlier bills provisi ons criticized for expanding tribal sovereignty two provisions that were included in s 578 of the 108th congress that were criticized25 as expanding tribal sovereignty ar not included in s 477 the first is provision of section 10b of the earlier legislation that would include tribal law under choice of law provision relating to federal causes of action for claims arising out of acts of terrorism when certain technologies have been deployed defensively giving rise to claims against the seller under section 863a 1 of the homeland security act of 2002 that section appears to requi re application of tribal law to the area under the jurisdiction of an indian tribe despite variety of court decisions suggesting that the rules for application of tribal law are more complex than mere geography one of these decisions is nevada v hicks 533 us 353 2001 in that case the court ruled that tribes jurisdiction did not extend to state law enforcement official executing state search warrant on tribal land the second is section 13 of the earlie r bill congressional affirmation and declaration of tribal government authorities it makes broad statement of tribal inherent sovereign authority qualified by the phrase for the purpose of the act so broad is the statement that it would confer on tribes the authority exercised by the united states in indian country under 18 usc 1151 without the qualifying prepositional phrase limiting the statement to the purpose of the act this section would appear to confer reinstate or delegate to tribes authority over nonm embers and nonindian fee land that the courts have found to have been divested26 on the other hand because that qualifying phase appears th courts might have found th section to be limited because the only provision in the bill that appears to enhance tribal jurisdiction is that which related to choice of law in tort actions arising in connection with technology employed in defense against terrorist acts th introductory statements moreover are distinguishable on the issue of jurisdiction an aspect of tribal sovereignty when senator inouye introduced s 578 he stated that the bill would make it clear that for purposes of homeland security the united states recognizes the inherent authority of tribal governments to exercise jurisdiction concurr ently with the federal government to assurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21533crs6 27 this statement appears to be referring to the fact that while states have limited criminal law jurisdiction over indians in indian country trib and the federal government share jurisdiction over indian offenses within indian country federal and tribal courts have concurrent jurisdiction over 1 certain crimes committed by an indian against an indian 2 certain crimes committed by an indian against nonindian and 3 victimless crimes committed by an indian conference of western attorneys general american indian law deskbook 99 1998that applicable criminal civil and regulatory laws are enforced on tribal

response for mo re than fifty million acres of land that comprise indian country and of the bill as treating indian tribes as the separate political entities that they are consistent with the federal policy of tribal selfgovernment and self determination 151 cong rec s1868 funding under current law hsa funding for tribal governments is indirect it is transmitted through the individual states s 578 of the 108th congress did not address that issue s 477 does it authorizes but does not mandate the secretary of homeland security to provide any f unds available under the hsa directly to federally recognized indian tribes related legislation border preparedness pilot project s 536 and s 1374 contain provisions authorizing border preparedness pilot pr ogram on indian lands and authorizing appropriati ons of 35 million annually for fiscal years 2006 through 2008 section 131 of s 536 would require the homeland security department to establish pilot program to include at least six tribal governments with land near the mexican or canadian border the purpos of these pilot projects would include facilitating response to threats to border secu rity enhancing tribal authority as first responder to illegal immigrant borde r crossings and providing assistance to tribes with respect to surveillance technologies comm unication systems and personnel training under this bill funding would be subject to the provisions of the indian self determination and educati onal assistance act isdeaa 25 usc 450 et seq s 1374 introduced on july 12 by senator mccai n provides similar authority for border preparedness pilot program on i ndian lands without the nexus to isdeaa in addition s 1374 would authorize the pilot program to pr ovide technical assistan ce to tribes to plan and
