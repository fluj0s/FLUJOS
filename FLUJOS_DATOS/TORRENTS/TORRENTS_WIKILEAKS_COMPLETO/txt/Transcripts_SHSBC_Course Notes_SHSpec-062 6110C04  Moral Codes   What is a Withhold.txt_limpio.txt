6110c04 shspec62 moral codes what is withhold one is nonsecurity checkable its just necessary to find the areas where he has what he considers to be overts if he doesnt read on standard sec check it just means those things arent transgressions against his moral code criminals moral code is about the reverse of lawabiding persons all pcs have moral codes against which they have transgressed youll only get withholds off case when you locate the code against which the pc has transgressed withhold is an unannounced transgression against moral code by which the person was bound moral code is that series of agreements to which person has subscribed in order to guarantee the survival of group man has learned down the track that where he has agreed on proper conduct he has survived and where he hasnt he hasnt survived so people agree on what is moral ie survivalconducive actions the us was founded on an agreement the constitution wherever it has been breached the country has gotten in trouble the reason for the trouble is that there arent any other agreements than the basic agreement there arent modified agreements you start with moral code which eventually gets interpreted and altered and people longer knew what was moral it thus got to be confusion people tried to enforce it but the confusion increased finally people dispersed and left the group and formed or entered other groups there they got new moral codes which eventually got diluted time marched on and more confusion entered etc etc the cycle of action of civilizations is 1 an agreement on optimum conduct 2 disbanding of the group 3 formation of new group with new agreement on optimum conduct 4 disintegration of this agreement 5 etc etc the disintegration occurs because of the individuation that results from overts moral codes can also disintegrate when attacked by another code that gets imposed on them eg by colonialists on native peoples one reason auditors find scientologists harder to audit than nonscientologists is that when you flub youve transgressed against the survival codes of the group this is why the last two pages of hcoww form 3 straighten out oldtime scientologists who natter about scientology the most important code to the person is the one by which he is currently living if you transgress against the code of your group you tend to feel like an outsider if the group is scientology the transgression prevents one from making progress in auditing transgression of moral code separates the transgressor from free communication with the group the seriousness of the transgression is monitored by the degree of cut comm and impossibility of communicating which is accomplished by pretending to be member of the group when hes transgressed he individuates and thus the group disintegrates another element of this is coaction mutual action toward common goal the crew of ship is good until it has been through some common danger business group could get cohered if management let everyone in on the attacks against them otherwise not group becomes group when it encounters danger to its survival the common denominator of the moral codes and of transgression is one must not injure the survival of fellow group member therefore manager or leader of group tends to be isolated from the group because of the occasional necessity for injuring the survival of group member who has transgressed against the others if the leader has led slightly detached life so he hasnt been affected by the offenders transgressions he commits an unmotivated overt when he kicks him out he gets these undisclosed overts against exgroup members he seldom tells the group why the ousted group member has to be ousted because he thinks it will be too enturbulative this is so widely true that man has accepted the idea of the loneliness of command as natural when it isnt you can change groups leader but if the new leader changes the mores of the group there will be trouble the leader of the group can destroy it this leads to the popularity of such things as socialism and communism why is the old soldier always degraded its not because the military in itself is bad its because hes group member who is longer part of the group his old mores longer apply he is degraded not even because of his overts he is degraded because when person is longer part of group he feels automatically that he must have overts against it and was driven out of it even if he didnt have any overts because the result exists people feel that the crime must have existed people will feel responsible for effects they havent really caused this is the same mechanism so youll find yourself processing someone at times who feels he has tremendous overts against group which you as an auditor cant find on the meter its simply because he is longer member of the group whose purpose may have ended hell be very happy to get off his transgressions because it will make his longer being member ok it justifies the state hes in what actions are necessary to cohere group coaction in the direction of survival with two or more people inevitably results in social more if one of the group dies the other in group of two will feel he must have transgressed and will be glad to find what his overts were so that it makes sense to be longer member the coaction doesnt even have to be toward mutual survival it can be opposed eg two fighter pilots who are enemies they will have certain fellowfeeling and if they withhold their failure to kill the other from their own groups theyve got bit individuated from the groups etc so this gets complex on the basis of agreement what is agreement it is two or more people making the same postulate stick if they go into mutual action toward survival they have coaction and they confuse one with another they dont quite distinguish whose is whose and they misown action in their vicinity engine drivers start sounding like engines after awhile they can be unidentified by having them get the idea of mutual action with the motor that is the source of overt acts you have mutual action with something else you do something cruel to that with which you have mutual action and you experience the somatic thats the exact mechanics of the overtmotivator sequence after youve had lot of group coaction you embark upon cruel action to that with which you have coacted and you will get the somatic the group dramatizes it with you must be punished for your act but thats not part of the mechanism religionists who push the golden rule are forcing into existence something that already exists overtmotivator sequences become very pronounced when cruel actions against ones group members ars engaged in while withholding one is really member of the group but engages in cruel action against another member and tries to back out why does one try to withhold it is because he doesnt want the effect of the coaction he tries to individuate disowns the coaction in an effort to avoid the motivator he doesnt want the somatics of coaction that experience has taught him will inevitably occur were down to fundamentals of nondifferentiation and identification he identifies his action with every group members action so he withholds self in an effort to escape if you ask him to recognize his coaction with the group member he has injured the coaction prior to the overt the overt will blow the more commotion action withholds and nonsense preceded his overt act the more it will hang up and the more he will try to withhold it he can only suffer from his overt because of former coaction because he is involved with mutual action toward survival every time he has tried to back out of mutual action he has sought to deny the mutuality of the action he thinks he can avoid the overtmotivator sequence by denying it so he individuates you have to knock out the individuation before he can walk out the action he takes to escape punishment is the action which settles in the punishment withholds and overts will become visible as you uncover the confusion and coaction which preceded the overt when he blows the withhold he can move again on the time track every time he withholds he parks himself on the time track so it eventually becomes one big now which is the reactive mind he has never really succeeded in individuating from any group he has belonged to therefore all groups newly formed are formed by transgressors so if scientologists could get off that mechanism they could form the first true group since the beginning of the universe one reason withhold sticks on the track is that its noaction nomotion point when the pc has picture where nothing is happening get the earlier commotion or confusion and the overt will show up one can withhold oneself as well as data thoughts or deeds or objects withhold of self is the commonest when you clear somebody you clear the identities which the person has teamed up with and their withholds and nowimsupposedtos theres process that hits at this find something the person has identified with something tell him to think of mutual action with first the one thing then the other and the identifications will spring apart fifteen or twenty other subjects will emerge as you go dont q and with them stay with the original two broader simpler process would be tell group you are longer part of
