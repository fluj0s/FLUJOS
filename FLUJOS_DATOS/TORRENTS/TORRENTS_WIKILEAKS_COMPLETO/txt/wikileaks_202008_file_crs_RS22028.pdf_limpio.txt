government and finance division summary authorization for the commodity futures trading commission cftc sunset agency established in 1974 expired on sept ember 30 2005 in the past congress has used the reauthorization process to consider amendments to the commodity exchange act cea which provides the basis for federal regulation of commodity futures trading the last reauthorization resulted in the enactment of the commodity futures modernization act of 2000 cfma the most significant amendments to the cea since the cftc was created in 1974 both chambers considered reauthorization bills in the 109th congress but none was enacted in the 110th congress cftc reauthorization provisions were added to the farm bill hr 2419 and enacted over the pres idents veto on may 22 2008 as pl 110 234 this report provides brief mmaries of the issues addre ssed in that law including 1 regulation of energy derivatives markets where some blame excessive price volatility on lack of effective regulation 2 the legality of future slike contracts based on foreign currency prices offered to retail investors and 3 the market in security futures or futures contract s based on single stocks whic h were authorized by the cfma but trade in much lower volum than their proponents expected this report will be updated as developments warrant futures contracts like other financial derivatives such as options or swaps gain or lose value as the price of some underlying commodity rises or falls they allow traders to invest in corn gold or tbills wit hout actually owning the underlying commodities themselves futures can be used to avoid or hedge price risk that is farmers utilities airlines banks and many other businesses can use derivatives to protect themselves against unfavorable changes in commodity prices interest rates or other variables most futures trading however is done by speculators who profit if their forecasts of price trends are correct the futures exchanges are associations of professional speculators there are two be nefits to speculation liquidity and price discovery speculators provide liquidity becau they are willing to assume the risks that hedgers wish to avoid speculation provide s an efficient price discovery mechanism because futures prices adjust immediately to new information and serve as the basis for many physical or spot market transactions in energy ag ricultural and other marketshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22028crs2 1 remarks by chairman alan greenspan at the 2003 federal reserve bank of chicago conference on bank structure and competition chicago illinois via satellite may 8 2003the public interest in regulating derivatives markets flows from these two functions price discovery and risk transfer because fu tures prices are used as reference points for many physical transactions manipulation in the futures markets can affect the prices actually paid by consumers or received by farmers and other produc ers similarly the ability to hedge risks allows the economy to function more efficiently former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan frequen tly described the ge neral benefits of derivatives markets for example derivatives have permitted financial risks to be unbundled in ways that have facilitated both their measurement and their management concentrations of risk are more readily identified and when such concentrations exceed the risk appetites of intermediaries derivatives can be employed to transfer the underlying risks to other entities as result not only have individual financial ins titutions become less vulnerable to shocks from underlying risk fa ctors but also the financial system as whole has become more resilient1 but although derivatives markets may gene rally support stability and resilience they also enable very highrisk speculative strategies which at times may pose threat to financial stability how much government regulation is needed to see that derivatives markets remain sound to keep markets comp etitive and free from fraud and manipulation and to insulate the financia l system from shocks arising from sudden large speculative losses what kinds of customers are in need of government protection these are the basic questions for congressi onal oversight of the commodity exchange act cea the commodity futures modern ization act of 2000 cfma in several respects the cfma was funda mental rethinking of the governments role in derivatives markets before 2000 th cea was intended to regulate all forms of derivative trading any contract in the character of futures contract was to be traded only under cftc regulation however this onesizefitsall regu latory scheme did not correspond to the reality of the marketplace where very large overthecounter otc that is offexchange derivatives market wa s flourishing without cf tc oversight under the cfma most trading in otc derivatives was placed beyond the reach of the cea and thus the cftc where trading was offlimits to small investors market discipline was deemed to be sufficient regulatory force the exception was for contracts based on agricultural commodities which were thought to be susceptible to price manipula tion as result the cfma did not provide statutory exemption for otc agricultural rivatives the derivatives market in farm commodities is dominated by exchangetraded futures contracts the cfma provided for the creation of unregulated futures exchanges where all trading involved sophisticated or professional investors again there is an exception for farm derivatives potentially therefore the futures exchanges can reconfigure themselves into largely unregulated entities and several such entities have registered with the cftc however since the enactment of the cfma the major futures exchangeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22028crs3 continue to operate in more or less the same regulatory environment as before both the exchanges and the otc markets have experienced strong growth in trading volumes since 2000 reauthorization in the 110th congress given the cftcs satisfaction with its ro under the cfma the growth of trading volumes and continued innovation in the market s few in the congress saw the need for another thorough overhaul of the cea du ring hearings before the house and senate agriculture committees however the cftc and industry participants suggested several areas where finetuning of the cfma might be desirable several of these issues were addressed by the reauthorizati on legislation enacted by the 110th congress title x iii of the farm bill pl 110234 hr 2419 enacted over the presidents veto on may 22 2008 and authorizing appropriations for th cftc through fy2012 major provisions are summarized below energy derivatives energy markets have seen turmoil in r ecent years prices have been high and unusually volatile there have been numerous episodes of fraud and many suspect that energy prices have been dr iven artificially high by ex cessive speculation during the california electricity crisis of 2000 severe shortages were co mbined with soaring prices and several energy trading fi rms including enron were found to have manipulated the partially deregulated electricity marketing system that california had established after the collapse of enron numerous energy firms were found to have ma fictitious wash trades for purposes of manipulating prices ndor falsifying their accounting statements the cftc has charged dozens of traders with manipulating the price of natural gas by providing false information about market pri ces and supplies finally many suspect that hedge funds and other financia l speculators have driven pr ices higher than fundamental economic factors of supply nd demand would warrant and have called for more cftc oversight of otc markets andor limits on the size of speculative futures positions some observers attribute these problems in the markets to regulatory gap arguing that neither the cftc nor the federal energy regulatory commission ferc has sufficient authority or resources to enfo rce antifraud and manipulation rules particular focus of these arguments is the overthecounter otc market for energy derivatives which under the cfma is subject to very limited oversight in august 2006 the amaranth hedge fund st 2 billion in natural gas derivatives and liquidated its entire 8 billion portfoli june 2007 staff report by the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations excessive speculation in the natural gas market found that the funds collapse trigge red steep unexpected decline in prices and that amaranths large positions had cau sed significant price movements in the months before it failed the report concludes that amaranth was able to evade limits on the size of speculative positions key featur of the futures exchanges antimanipulation program by shifting its trading from ny mex to exempt and unregulated markets the reauthorization legislation creates new regulatory regime for certain otc energy derivatives markets subjecting them to number of exchangelike regulationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22028crs4 2 in futures contracts margin is the amount of money that customer must deposit with broker in order to maintain position in the market margin serves to protect the broker and the exchange from the risk of customer default if margins are set too high trading becomes too expensive and volume drops if they are too w exchange members and the clearing house are vulnerable to credit or default riskthe provisions would apply to electronic trading facilities markets where multiple buyers and sellers are able to post orders and execute tran sactions over an electronic network if the cftc determines that these markets currently exempt from most regulation play significant role in setting ergy prices they will be required to register with the cftc and comply with several regulatory core principles aimed at curbing manipulation and excessive speculation they will be required to publish andor report to the cftc information relating to prices trading volume and size of positions held by speculators and hedgers these new regulatory requirements apply onl to electronic markets that have come to resemble the regulated futures exchanges bilateral otc derivative contracts between two principals eg between swap dealer and an institutional investor customer that are not executed on trading facility where multiple bids and offers are displayed will continue to be largely ex empt from cftc regulation security futures security futures are futures contracts base d on single stocks or narrowbased stock indexes until the cfma these contracts we re not permitted largel because of concerns that they might be used to manipulate st ock prices the cfma provided for joint regulation of the new contracts by the securities and exchange commission sec and the cftc perhaps as result the process of writing trading rules was slow the first contracts were not traded until 2003 trading volumes in security futures trading remain very low relative to the stock option market the only currently active ma rket is onechicago joint venture between the chicago board of trade cbot the chicago mercantile exchange cme and the chicago board options exchange cboe during 2007 total of about 81 million security futures contracts were traded by contrast 2007 stock option volume on the cboe in 2007 was 9445 million contracts singlestock futures volume may continue to grow but the product has had difficulty competing with the highly liquid and wellde veloped stock options market which offers contracts that permit most if not all the i nvestment strategies th at security futures do during the reauthorization hearings in ma rch 2005 several witnesse s argued that the dual regulatory regime is cumbersome and hampers trading cftc chairman brown hruska stated that the cftc would continue to work with the sec to reduce duplicative regulation representatives of the chicago futures exchanges called for an amendment to the cfma to allow security futures to trade like any other futures contract this would set aside the joint cftcsec oversight arrangement and allow the futures exchanges to set margin requirements on security futures as they do on all other futures contracts2 at present margins are set at 20 of the unde rlying stocks value figure that washttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22028crs5 3 cftc v zelener 373 f3d 861 7th cir 2004determined by the sec and cftc to be comparable to margin requirements on stock options as the cfma requires but which is much higher than most futures margins which generally are in the range of 38 of the value of the underlying commodity by reducing margin requirements the exchanges would lower the cost of trading security futures and would likely boost trading volumes however such move would be resisted by the options exchanges who would argue unfair competition and by the sec which would be concerned about the possibility of manipulation of stock prices section 13106 of the reauthorization legisla tion directs the cftc and sec to permit riskbased or portfolio margining for security futures by september 30 2009 this would have the effect of lowering margins for traders with partially offsetting positions in stock options and securities futures and would reduce trading costs somewhat the agencies are further directed to permit trading in futures based on certain foreign stock indexes also by september 30 2009 retail foreign exchange contracts the commodity exchange act generally prohibits the selling of offexchange futures contracts to small retail investors there has been some dispute over whether this prohibition applies to cont racts based on foreign curre ncy rates in 1974 congress exempted contracts based on foreign exchange and treasury securities from cftc regulation the socalled treas ury amendment the cftc has long argued that this exemption applied only to prof essional markets and that it had authority to prevent the sale of futureslike contracts to small investors the cfma addressed this question and the cftc believed it had been given clear authority but 2004 federal court case3 held that certain retail foreign exchange contr acts were not futures contracts and could be legally sold in 2005 hearings cftc chairm an brownhruska suggested that additional legal authority or clarification might be needed to protect small investors from fraud both house and senate reauthorization bills in the 109th congress sought to clarify the cftcs authority over retail agreements and contracts in foreign currency s 1566 as reported included provisions designed to address the impact of the zelener decision specifying that the cftc has jurisdiction over foreign exchange contracts offered to retail customers that feature margin or leveraged financing and that are entered into for reasons other than commercial or personal use of foreign currency that is speculative contracts in testimony before the senate banking committee on september 8 2005 the presidents working group on fi nancial markets representing the federal reserve the treasury the sec and the cftc recommended that the retail foreign exchange language in s 1566 be amended to ensure that it did not inadvertently impose restrictions on large foreign exchange contracts traded by banks and other institutional investors floor amendment satisfactory to all regulators was expected to be offered by chairman chambliss of the agriculture committee and chairman shelby of the banking committee however s 1566 never reach ed the senate floor during the 109th congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22028crs6 the 110th congress legislation contains provisions similar to this regulatory agreement clarifying the cftcs authority over retail contracts and preserving the ability of banks and other financial institutions to continue their foreign exchange trading without cftc regulation
