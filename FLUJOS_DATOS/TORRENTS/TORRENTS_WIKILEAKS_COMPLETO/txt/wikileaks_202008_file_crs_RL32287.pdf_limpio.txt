partnership among all leve ls of government as congress continues to deba federal respons ibilities in this new policy arena members may wish to assess the reach of state policies the information presented in this report along with summaries of statutory authorities presented in the companion reports on each jurisdiction the fifty states the district of columbia and the insular areas are intended to help members evaluate the relationships among federal and state policies this informati on might be used to answer questions such as the following what is the range of legislation enacted by the states including the insular areas and the district of columbia regarding the preparation for and management of th consequences of terro rist attacks natural disasters or significant accidents if congress enacts policies that direct action to be taken in certain areas such as the development of capability standards or response procedures or placing conditions on federal assistance what will be the impact in those states that have established policies in these areas what are the policy gaps what areas might be better addressed through state action should the fe deral government step in if some states have not acted if so under what conditions should there be federal presence to considerable extent state statutory authorities appear to be relatively uniform all state statutes provide cons iderable discretionary authority to the governor in emergency situations als since federal law requires or encourages certain actions all states have enacted similar laws in some areas such as the establishment of state and local entities w ith responsibility for zardous material or chemical incidents or the acceptance of federal disaster assistance some differences exist among the state authorities such as the types amount and conditions under which aid is to be provided to disaster victims also some states have enacted provisions to ensure that nonfederal funds are made available for preparedness or recovery while others rely upon federal sources with state funds authorized to meet cost share requirements the national conference of state legislatures ncsl through contract with the congressional research service crs compiled information in calendar year 2003 that was used to develop profiles of emergency management and homeland security statutes in the 50 states the district

statutory aut horities in the states district of columbia and insular areas summary overview the homeland security act of 2002 hsa and other legislation enacted after the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 constituted major change in federal statutory authorities re lated to preparation for and res ponse to enemy attacks natural disasters and other emergency situations1 the hsa elevated the federal role in some domestic security areas that prior to the attacks were generally perceived to be the responsibility of state government s the enhanced federal responsibilities were balanced however with the adoption of policies th at require or encourage partnership with state and local governments2 and provide that state laws generally are not preempted3 the congressional

envisione d in the hsa is to be developed throughout calendar year 2003 ncsl sta ff working in conjunction with crs reviewed state statutory codes to deve lop profiles of homeland security and emergency management authorities statutory provisions were identified by means of database search of terms applied to the codified statutes available in calendar year 20036 also manual searches of state inde xes were employed to supplement the database searches the profiles each issued as separate crs report and listed in the appendix to this report are intended to provide succinct summaries of the more significant emergency management and hom eland security statutory provisions citations to the sources of statutory information are provide d to enable readers to review statutes texts to facilitate comparisons among the states summaries of statutory provisions have been grouped into the following eleven categories each state profile report listed in table 1 of this report presents information in each of these categories as does this summary report summary statements on the more significant or comprehensive provisions entities with key responsibilities agencies and officials with the most pertinent duties preparedness duties and authorities that enable citizens and officials to prepare for emergencies declaration procedures authority and methods used by governors to initiate emergency responseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32287crs3 7 in addition to the citations listed in each report the following internet site facilitates reviews of state codes httpwwwllsdcorgsource bookstateleghtmal visited march 4 2004types of assistance most significant types of aid authorized to be provided to entities or residents affected by disaster mutual aid authorities that enable

preparation hazard mitigation policies that direct or allocate resources to prevent disasters or lessen their imp act if they cannot be prevented continuity of government operations provisions that guide the continued operation of g overnment in the event standard procedures cannot be followed other authorities that do not readily fit into the preceding categories such as civil service protections liability and benefits for employees and volunteers and key terms defined table that identifies and cites references to the terms most pertinent to homeland security and emergency management authorities in addition to information presented in each of these categories each profile includes reference to an internet addre ss that may be used to search for these statutory provisions online7 limitations and caveats this summary and the associated st ate profiles themselves are based upon database searches completed by crs and ncsl staff using such terms and variations as disaster emergency terrorism attack and contingency among others different related sear ch terms could yield other results the information included in the profiles and used to develop this summary illustrates significant state provisions most pertinent to the congressional debate on homeland security policy related or ta ngential issues such as school violence agricultural terrorism militia or national guard authority and aspects of bioterrorism may be addressed in statutes other than those cited in th profiles the policy fields of emergency management and homeland security overl ap touch upon other fields and fit into broad general governance f unctions these summaries can at best partially highlight the pertinent author ities general statutory provisions thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32287crs4 authorize filling vacancies in state offices or set forth the duties of public safety officers are not included in the profiles unless they include references to significant emergency situations the material in this report drawn from the profiles necessarily represents an abbreviated illustration of pertinent provisions of state statutes to the extent possible each profile includes summary clauses or sentences that provide general information on the text one exception is found in the key terms sections the profiles developed for each state do not contai n summaries of the text of definitions largely due to concerns with the size of the profiles but also because some definitions either made refe rence to other statutory provi sions or repeated the term to be defined the specifi c state statute re ferenced in each profile should be consulted to identify the meaning of each term defined in state statutes summary of major findings although each state legislature consider s and modifies statutory proposals to suit the particular needs of state resident s model or suggested legislative proposals have circulated among the states as result the legislation is similar in certain respects all states provide authority to the governor to take emergency action require that certain actions be taken to ease the impact of attacks or other disasters and define key terms all st ates provide for continuity of government and authorize the negotiation or adoption of mutual aid agreements differences may still be found however as some states have enacted provisions that pertain to specific circumstances or legislative priorities the remainder of this report provides examples of some distinctive elements of state homeland security and emergency management authorities entities with key responsibilities governors serve as commandersinchief of their state militias and assume special powers upon the declaration of disa ster emergency enemy attack or riot although the governors powers vary from st ate to state emergency powers in all states generally include authorities such as the following suspend statutory and regulatory provisions that otherwise mig ht hinder response to disaster require hospitalization for those injured during disaster control ingress and egress into the emergency area direct the evacuation of residents and prescribe transportation routes provide temporary shelter co mmandeer property with compensation control or suspend utility services and limit or suspend the sale and possession of alcohol firearms

earthquakes forest fires floods dam safety drought to advise nd coordinate disast er preparedness and provide recommendations to reduce future sses and train for response recovery and reconstruction most states reportedly have created homeland security offices task forces or by gubernatorial executive order or appointme nt this report does not include such entities but only addresses those statutorily created oklahoma created an office of homeland security by statute in number of states the office of emergency management was given th responsibility to monitor and respond to homeland security concerns many states have determined that bot h terrorism preparedness and emergency management should use existing state resour ces number of statutes provide that the office of emergency management coor dinate first responders in almost any emergency few states have establis hed cabinet position that coordinates with the us department of homeland secur ity and provides advice to the governor about key terrorism issues such as energy and water security other coordination efforts between emergency management nd homeland security include the following examples in colorado the office

emergency and stockpiling supplies equipment and facilities for use during disaster some states authorize mobile support units to assist local governments in providing rapid response to disasters states in which nuclear power plants are located have established radiological emergency management programs also preparedness for public health emergencies is reflected in many state statutes such as the following 1 in connecticut the secretary of the office of policy and management must plan for childrens health needs in bioterrori sm preparedness and provide training in safety and security measures for childcare workers and school personnel 2 illinois has enacted legislation requi ring an emergency evacuation plan for people with disabilities who live in high rises 3 south carolina

usuallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32287crs8 requires statement of the type and location of the disaster and the needed assistance the majority of the states and the district of columbia establish deadline for the termination of the emergency declara tion usually 30 days maximum although some states allow declarations up to six months plus renewals if the emergency conditions still exist the legislature in 27 states has an oversight role and may determine that the emergency has ceased prior to the end of the declaration period in those states upon the approval of legi slative concurrent re solution the governor is required to issue declaration of ter mination of the emergency some unique or slightly different approaches to the i nvolvement of the legislature include the following the

funding the f unding can be provided for individual or family assistance or assistance to local governments to replace other lost revenue sources should the local governments be unable to meet the loan repayment schedule the governors often are given the authority to seek waiver for the local government from the federal government for repayment of the loan in addition to accepting federal funds the governors usua lly are authorized to accept services equipment supplies materials and othe r items on behalf of the state and local governments from federal and private sect or sources number of states require emergency management officials and politi cal subdivisions to use the services equipment supplies and facilities of existing departments and offices to the maximum extent possible in responding to disaster several states assist disaster victims by offering tax assistance extensions or other financial latitude in some states property ow ners are provided with waivers or reduced assessments if their property s been adversely affected by the natural disaster some specific examples of assistance follow in alaska the director of the di vision of land may make grants of state land to persons and municipal corporations to replace land rendered unusable by natural disa ster the granted lands may be put to the same purpose as those rendered unusable california has established

assistance compact emac which has been codified into state statut provides prearranged structure for state affected by disaster to request aid from other states fortyeight states have agreed to the terms of emac along with the district of columbia puerto rico and the us virgin islands california and hawaii are the two states that do not participate in emac in addition to emac other interstate

recorded in their states other states new jersey new york have mutual aid statutes that provide for mutual aid during an enemy attack in order to protect bridges tunnels and other ma jor infrastructure components funding in the majority of the states the first rec ourse for disaster funding is to reallocate departmental appropr iations to meet emergency n eeds should these reallocated appropriations prove insuffici ent the legislature may be called into special session to approve additiona l appropriations needed to re spond to the emergency or to provide nonfederal funds require d
