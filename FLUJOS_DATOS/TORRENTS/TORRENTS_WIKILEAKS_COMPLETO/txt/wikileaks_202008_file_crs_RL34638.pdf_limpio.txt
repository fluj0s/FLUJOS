of prescription drugs furthermore its report did not include those fees in its representation of the fy2009 request as the end of fy2008 approached the full senate had not considered the bill and the

enforcement functions of fda in hearings and proposed legislation various committee members have requested information on inspection staffing by program area however agency statements suggest that field inspectors may be redeployed to meet critical needs such as foodborne outbreaks rather than being permanently assigned to one program area some studies suggest that budget constraints have prevented fda from making all of its required inspections for example 2007 gao report found that fda had not inspected certain domestic medical device manufacturing establishments once every two years as required by law 11 in addition deaths associated with contaminated heparin bloodthinning drug ve added to concern about whether the fdas field activities are adequate thus field activity funding

program was 268 million 181 million in budget authority and 87 million in user fees 19 million 78 increase over fy2008 the increase would provide additional budget authority to cover blood and tissue safety and to help cover costofliving pay increase for the entire program the requested amount for user fees includes increased revenue from pdufa up 43 million to 744 million mdufa up almost 1 million to 115 million and the new fee for review of dtc advertisements 14 million the senate committee recommendation 268 million total matched the budget authority request but did not include the requested fees for dtc advertisement review for fy2009 congress has been considering legislation that would allow fda to approve abbreviated applications for followon biologics 16 the bush administration requested that the legislation include among other things public guidance process prescribed data requirements safety labeling related to interchangeability intellectual property protections and the implementation of new user fees to cover the associated costs key challenge will be negotiating compromise among several existing legislative proposals and the position of the new

ensure their safety and effectiveness and regulates the safety of animal feeds including pet food17 the program is administered by fdas center for veterinary dicine cvm fda claims that 70 of cvms work is devoted to the safety of the food supply largely through its activities to ensure the safety of drugs and feeds used for foodproducing animals in fy2008 the program was funded through both budget authority and user fees for brandna animal drugs authorized by the animal drug user fee act adufa 18 the fy2009 request for the animal drugs and feeds program was 132 million 17 million 153 increase over fy2008 the total requested amount consisted of 114 million in budget authority 14 million in aut hority for adufa and 4 million for proposed animal generic drug user fee act agdufa19 more than 7 million of the requested increase would be used to support the protecting americas food supply initiative including the development of processing and ingredient standards for animal foods as required by fdaaa20 the increase would also allow workforce development and the expansion of existing product safety and activities in july 2008 the senate committee recommended 128 million total this matched the budget authority request and included the requested fees for adufa contingent upon its reauthorization but did not include the requested fees for agdufa which had not yet been authorized the animal drugs and feeds program faces challenges similar to those for comparable activities in the other programs these challenges include evaluating drug approvals efficiently without compromising safety monitoring drug safety after approval and developing effective strategies to ensure the safety of imports
