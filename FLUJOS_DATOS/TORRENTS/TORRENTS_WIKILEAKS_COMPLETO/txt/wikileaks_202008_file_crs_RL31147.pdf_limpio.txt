report rl31015federal and state regulation of research involving human fetal tissue research involving human fetal tissue has provided significant medical developments fetal tissue research assisted with the creation of vaccines for polio and rubella1 transplantation studies with human fetal tissue have shown promise in treating juvenile diabetes and other ailments2 however despite these accomplishments research involving human fetal tissue remains controversial because human fetal tissue is derived from aborted fetuses such research is often entangled with the politics of abortion those who believe that fetus is human being consider research involving human fetal tissue to be unethical3 opposition to fetal tissue research and transplant ation led to moratorium on federal funding for fetal tissue transplantation research in 1988 this moratorium continued until the passage of the nih revitalization act of 1993 nih act this report will review the federal governments regulation of fetal tissue research and transplantation the report will also discuss state regulation of fetal research and cases that have considered the legitimacy of such regulation background the terms fetal tissue research and fetal tissue transplantation research are used to describe two distinct types of research involving human fetal tissue the term fetal tissue research encompasses research with fetal tissue to develop therapies evaluate risk factors and develop cell lines4 the term fetal tissue transplantation research refers to research involving procedure in which cells taken from fetus are processed and injected into the faulty organs of people suffering from particularhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31147crs2 5see goddard supra note 1 at 378 see also cory zion the legal and

secretary of health and human services hhs to use human fetal tissue for transplantation in research protocol6 in response to the request the assistant secretary issued temporary moratorium on the federal funding of fetal tissue transplantation research the moratorium was intended to last until an nih advisory panel could study and report on the ethical legal and scientific issues associated with fetal tissue transplantation research7 although the panel eventually recommended continued funding for fetal tissue transplantation research pursuant to certain guidelines the moratorium was extended indefinitely by the secretary of hhs in 19898 the secretary maintained that fetal tissue transplantation research would increase the incidence of induced abortions9 legislative attempts to override the secretarys decision were either not enacted or were vetoed by president bush10 shortly after assuming office president clinton instructed the secretary of hhs to lift the ban on federal funding11 on february 5 1993 the moratorium was officially rescinded in march 1993 nih published interim guidelines for research involving the transplantation of human fetal tissue12 these guidelines were later incorporated into the nih acthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31147crs3 1342 usc 289g1e1 1442 usc 289g1e2 15see 42 usc 289g1a2 1642 usc 289g1b1 1742 usc 289g1b2federal regulation of research involving fetal tissue research involving fetal tissue is regulated primarily by three federal statutes the restrictions imposed by these statutes are described in this section nih revitalization act of 1993 under the nih act the secretary of hhs may conduct or support research on the transplantation of human fetal tissue for therapeutic purposes the secretary may provide support for research only if the applicant for financial assistance agrees to conduct the research in accordance with applicable state law13 similarly the secretary may conduct research only in accordance with applicable state and local law14 fetal tissue that is used for transplantation research under the nih act may be obtained pursuant to spontaneous or induced abortion or pursuant to stillbirth15 however before the fetal tissue may be used in research written statements must be made by the woman providing the tissue by the attending physician who obtains the tissue and by the principal researcher each of these statements requires specific declarations in her written statement the woman providing the tissue must declare that 1 she is donating the tissue for use in transplantation research for therapeutic purposes 2 the donation is being made without any restriction on the recipient of the tissue and 3 she has not been told of the identity of the recipient16 the physicians written statement must declare that 1 the womans consent for the abortion was obtained prior to requesting or obtaining consent for the tissue donation 2 there was alteration of the timing method or procedures used to terminate the pregnancy for the purpose of obtaining the tissue 3 the abortion was performed in accordance with applicable state laws 4 the tissue was donated in accordance with the requirements set out in the mothers statement and 5 the woman has been fully informed of the physicians interest if any in the research to be conducted and has been fully informed of any known medical risks or risks to her privacy as result of the donation17 finally the individual with the principal responsibility for conducting the research must declare that 1 he is aware that the tissue is human fetal tissue obtained pursuant to spontaneous or induced abortion or pursuant to stillbirth 2 the tissue was donated for research purposes 3 he has provided information about the tissue to other individuals involved with the research 4 he will require prior to obtaining consent from transplantation recipient written acknowledgment that the recipienthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31147crs4 1842 usc 289g1c 1942

receipt or transfer of any human fetal tissue for valuable consideration if the transfer affects interstate commerce19 moreover the nih act provides it shall be unlawful for any person to solicit or knowingly acquire receive or accept donation of human fetal tissue for the purpose of transplantation if the donation affects interstate commerce the tissue will be or is obtained pursuant to an induced abortion and 1 the donation will be or is made pursuant to promise to the donating individual that the donated tissue will be transplanted into recipient specified by such individual 2 the donated tissue will be transplanted into relative of the donating individual or 3 the person who solicits or knowingly acquires receives or accepts the donation has provided valuable consideration for the costs associated with such abortion20 persons violating these restrictions shall be subject to fines imprisonment for not more than ten years or both21 violations involving the payment of valuable consideration shall result in fines reflecting not less than twice the amount of the valuable consideration received22 although the nih act responded to numerous concerns involving fetal tissue transplantation research it also aroused criticism for its ambiguity for example it has been argued that congress failure to define the term therapeu tic purposes could result in the transplantation of fetal tissue to enhance the bodys normal functioning23 it has also been argued that the acts use of the term valuable consideration could result in abuse by those who transport or process human fetal tissue24 uncertainty about what constitutes reasonable payments could result inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31147crs5 25see 42 usc 289g 2642 usc 289ga1 2742 usc 289ga2 28id 2942 usc 274ea 3042 usc

research extension act of 1985 the health research extension act of 1985 extension act restricts research or experimentation on nonviable living human fetuses ex utero and living human fetuses ex utero whose viability has not been determined25 under the extension act the secretary of hhs may conduct or support research or experimentation on the specified fetuses in only two situations the secretary may conduct or support research or experimentation that enhances the wellbeing of the fetus or enhances the probability of its survival26 the secretary may also conduct or support research or experimentation that is undertaken to develop important biomedical knowledge that cannot be obtained by other means27 this type of research or experimentation must pose added risk of suffering injury or death to the fetus28 national organ transplant act the national organ transplant act nota makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly acquire receive or otherwise transfer any human organ for valuable consideration if the transfer affects interstate commerce and the organ is to be used in transplantation29 the term human organ includes fetal organs30 reasonable payments associated with the removal transportation processing and storage of the organs are excluded from the definition of valuable consideration31 violation of notas prohibition shall result in fines not to exceed 50000

alternate legislation to specifically regulate fetal research35 at least nineteen states restrict fetal research36 for example north dakota law provides person may not use fetus or fetal organs or tissue resulting from an induced abortion in animal or human research experimentation or study or for animal or human transplantation except for diagnostic or remedial procedures37 the validity of state laws that restrict fetal research has been considered in four federal circuits38 in general the courts have concluded that the language of the state fetal research statutes is unconstitut ionally vague39 these courts have found that the statutes use of the terms experiment experimentation or investigation fail to provide adequate guidance on the conduct that is prohibited in forbes v napolitano the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit found arizonas fetal research statute unconstitutionally vague under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment40 the court indicated
