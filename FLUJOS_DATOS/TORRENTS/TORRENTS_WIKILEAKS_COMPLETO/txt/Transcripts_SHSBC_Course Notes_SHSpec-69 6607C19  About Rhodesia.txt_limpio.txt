6607c19 shspec69 about rhodesia lrh has just come back from rhodesia around february 1966 lrh was holding the mockup his body together with sticking plaster the organization was going fine tech was wrapped up lrh put things on wait his case for one thing he decided to take vacation he spent thirty days in palmas the organization was running fine clear 1 john mcmasters was made during february of 1966 while lrh was in palmas lrh decided to go to south africa he wanted to locate an alternate base for ots in case of war or political takeover he couldnt figure out why he couldnt do this the reason was that he hadnt defined the purpose of such base the purpose was 1 an alternate base for scientology in case of war or political takeover 2 to serve as base from which to put in ethics on the planet so tech could go in 3 to put in economics so that people can support orgs and the orgs can flourish see later part of this lecture p 749 below lrh went to rhodesia he conceived of type of constitution they could use to solve their difficulties the government liked it lrh recalled that he had some assets in south africa he decided to invest them he bought house and learned that he could buy hotel in the wilderness for 5500 pounds and did he bought farm he was watching the economics and behavior of the wog world and getting kick out of being out there making friends with tough characters his usual friends rhodesian culture is still victorian it is small civilization in the middle of howling wilderness it is more sophisticated than london rhodesia has lots of land minerals precious metals and beautiful climate it is untouched and could easily be developed lrh met the governmental highups he was very acceptable to them he didnt discuss scientology at all he was examining the wog world and he didnt want to unwog it he went on tv and radio he had authority but he was solving lots of problems each individual rhodesian would agree with lrhs solutions but warned him that other rhodesian would agree with him because the solutions were too advanced lrh went down to his hotel at lake kariba he supplied the hotel with twoton trucks local industry started to use his trucks to transport goods and the area boomed lrh started furniture factory colony started to sprout just the fact of lrhs being interested in the country and seeing hope for it caused production to rise then lrh wondered how he was going to leave to go back to saint hill he was woven too tightly into the picture with staff of nine personal staff and twentynine general staff the pick of the exconsular domestic staffs white rhodesians kept telling lrh how to handle the african he realized that they didnt know anything about africans because they didnt recognize that they were people they would say they are sullen youve got to watch them but the reason they are sullen is acknowledgment bad 8c overexpectation and outgradient they were taking people with experiential background in politics or economics and expecting more of them than they were trained to do lrh made his staff happy by telling them that they werent rhodesians anymore that they were americans they were very spitandpolish enthusiastic and hardworking so in four months lrh was very acceptable to both races and even to extreme moderates as well as to extreme rightest whites reporter from the london daily mail told the minister of information what bad fellow lrh was the minister instantly told prime minister smith what bad fellow he was smith told the cabinet the same story and the next morning the rhodesian front committee was charging down to see lrh when they found out that his visa wasnt going to be extended because they knew that it was all lies smith had been built up as too fair and too honest his popularity had begun to decline because he hadnt worked miracles and because his communication was going out then he told the committee various things such as that lrhs business associates were complaining about him lrh had in fact only three business associates and one of them was there and denied the story smith said that lrh had been deported from australia but lrhs passport had record of having entered australia he said that lrh was wanted all over and had criminal record these people however knew that lrhs credit was in the stars all over the world they saw smiths feet of clay and walked out so lrh could leave covered with laurels as result of this expedition lrh found out that you cant locate base that you dont know the purpose of that was why he had trouble locating ot base now he knows what ot base has to do it has to put in ethics on planetary basis so that tech can be gotten in as you associate with the public and try to tell them about scientology you have trouble with the public because their ethics are out and for other reason one sp in rhodesia has wrecked the country and is keeping the whole scene enturbulated the only real threat to scientology is that an atom war or political takeover could prevent the organization from going ahead to clear people in addition to ethics but less vital than ethics economics has to be gotten straightened out economics is very simple subject with very plain laws it has nothing to do with politics and ideology actually economics exists as subject the purpose of which is to get people enough to eat etc man violates the laws of economics all the time for ideological and political purposes the already existing economic systems of the planet are usable in modified form and we need them to improve in order to allow for an expansion of our organization there has to be workable enough economics on the planet so that people can support orgs and the orgs can flourish and expand total subsidy of processing doesnt work because there is contribution from the pc people have to contribute to benefit from auditing so the economic purpose is secondary purpose of ot base also ethics is hard to get in on starving people ethics is out on earth and the out ethics prevents easy dissemination nearly every human being on this planet that is in trouble is in trouble because ethics are out in england someone stole and sold lrhs research papers which were then represented as the current practice of scientology very different thing people are killed in wars because of one sp in the government the only reason for war is few sps we could go and sort out key sps in international situations what we would do about it is something else political systems exist only to solve the problem of succession of rulers otherwise everyone could agree on benevolent monarchy the answer is of course not to have successors clear the monarch but political systems are not concerned with the happiness or productivity of people the only source of our individual personal difficulties is not having ethics in in the society around us the only reason why you are having difficulty as an individual is not having ethics in in your immediate environment weve got to shift gears in our emphasis we have been getting ethics in on our fellow scientologists with great enthusiasm now we are familiar with the system and how it works we have erred by getting ethics in too heavily on scientologists and too lightly on the environment it is time to reverse the emphasis there isnt any point in getting ethics in on willing person just because he is stupid doing that just makes the person sullen ethics should be directed at willful acts of sabotage real sp is not just anyone he intends to damage you he is real nut he intends to knock you down he is not just difficult person he is real monster upgrade your idea of what an sp is like sps amount only to 25 of mankind find out if the guy is driving people into sanitariums strewing social wreckage about and smashing statistics we have only had one real sp on staff just because person shows up on an s and d doesnt mean that he is real sp maybe he is just making someone unhappy dont fling the title around lightly within scientology outside scientology dont worry about making mistake and accusing someone wrongly just get ethics in real hard first and correct the mistakes later weve got to put in ethics fast to prevent disaster it was great to find that the organization could continue without lrh it was great to find that you could make more clears you made 22 to celebrate his return lrhs immediate program is to finish his own clearing he has found that people dont make it with their grades out then he will start ot research every time he tries to put together the scope of ot he has to run off the invalidation any statement you can make about ot falls short of the truth
