congress removing terrorist sanctuaries the 911 commission recommendations and us policy summary the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states the 911 commission issued its final report on july 19 2004 major recommendation in the report was that the us government should identify and prioritize actual or potential terrorist sanctuaries and for each to employ realistic strategy to keep possible terrorists insecure and on the run using all elements of national power us strategy to combat global terrorism even prior to 911 included efforts to deny sanctuary to terrorist groups by isolating and applying pressure on states that sponsor or acquiesce to terrorists on their territory and by strengthening the counterterrorism capabilities of countries that cooperate with the united states but need help for years us officials exerted considerable diplomatic pressure on the taliban government to expel qaeda from afghanistan the united states also pressed the government of pakistan to crack down on terrorist sanctuaries within its own borders and to use its influence with its then taliban ally these efforts were largely unsuccessful until the 911 attacks caused many governments to change their approach and cooperate more extensively with the united states in the fight against terrorism after 911 us efforts to deny terrorists sanctuary were substantially increased worldwide the national strategy for combating terrorism released by the white house on february 14 2003 placed strong emphasis on closing down terrorist sanctuaries using all available instruments military force law enforcement diplomacy economic assistance etc the strategy report addressed the need to eliminate conditions that produce terrorist sanctuaries especially in failed states the 911 commission identified six primary regions that serve or could serve as terrorist sanctuaries these included western pakistan and the pakistan afghanistan border region southern or western afghanistan the arabian peninsula especially saudi arabia and yemen and the nearby horn of africa including somalia and extending southwest into kenya southeast asia from thailand to the southern philippines to indonesia west africa including nigeria and mali and european cities with expatriate muslim communities in all of these regions the united states and its allies have mounted campaigns to deny safe havens for terrorists number of bills were introduced in congress in 2004 to implement the 911 commission recommendations and related measures pl 108458 the national intelligence reform act of 2004

report the 911 commission report on july 19 2004 the report offered number of recommendations to strengthen us efforts to combat terrorism one strong recommendation was that the us government should identify and prioritize actual or potential terrorist sanctuaries2 for each it recommended realistic strategy to keep possible terrorists insecure and on the run using all elements of national power the commission stressed that the united states should reach out listen to and work with other countries that can help the rationale given for devoting special attention to denial of sanctuaries was that complex international terrorist operation aimed at launching catastrophic attack cannot be mounted without the time space and ability to perform competent planning and staff work command structure able to make necessary decisions and possessing the authority and contacts to assemble needed people money and materials opportunity and space to recruit train and select operatives with the needed skills and dedication providing the time and structure required to socialize them into the terrorist cause judge their trustworthiness and hone their skills logistics network able to securely manage the travel of operatives move money and transport resources like explosives where they need to go access in the case of certain weapons to the special materials needed for nuclear chemical radiological or biological attack reliable communications between coordinators and operatives and opportunity to test the workability of the plan the commission stressed the value to qaeda of its afghan sanctuary under the taliban government as well as of its logistical networks running through pakistan and the united arab emirates in preparing the 911 attack and other operations the report also emphasized the lax internal security environments in western countries including the united states that the terrorist were able to exploit the commission stated that to find sanctuary terrorist groups have fled to some of the least governed most lawless places in the world the united states was seen as facing an enormous challenge finding ways to extend its reach and influence to some of these remote areas the commission warned that every policy decision made 1 prepared by francis t miko specialist in international relations 2 the 911 commission report final report of the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states july 2004 section 122 p 365367 crs2 needed to be viewed through this lens for instance iraq could not be allowed to become failed state because it could become primary breeding ground for attacks against americans at home similarly the report stressed that us and allied efforts to achieve stability in afghanistan must succeed or else the taliban warlords and drug traffickers might prevail and allow the country to again become potential refuge for qaeda or likeminded terrorist groups as the commission report pointed out us efforts were underway even prior to 911 to get governments especially those of afghanistan and pakistan to deny sanctuary to qaeda and other terrorist groups but these efforts were largely unsuccessful until the 911 attacks caused many governments to change their course us policy to combat global terrorism has long included the objective of denying sanctuary to terrorist groups by isolating and applying pressure on states that sponsor terrorism or tolerate terrorists on their territory and by strengthening the counterterrorism capabilities of countries that cooperate with the united states but need help the national strategy for combating terrorism released by the white house on february 14 2003 stressed the broad scope of us policy aimed at denying terrorists sanctuaries3 what was termed the second front of us strategy gave priority to denying terrorists the sponsorship support and sanctuary that enable them to exist gain strength plan and execute their attacks the strategys stated focus was threefold 1 to convince all states of their responsibility to combat terrorism 2 to target aid to countries with the will but not the means to combat terrorism and 3 to take action against states that are unwilling to meet their obligation to fight terrorism military force and law enforcement remained major tools of the new strategy however the strategy document also emphasized other instruments such as diplomacy economic assistance and programs to strengthen governance the aim was to choke off the lifeblood of terrorist groups in language very similar to that of the 911 commission report the strategy document spoke of denying access to territory funds equipment training technology and unimpeded transit more broadly the strategy sought to eliminate conditions that produce terrorist sanctuaries especially in failed states the strategy spoke of the need to build powerful coalition of nations against terrorism including reorienting existing partnerships and creating new mechanisms of cooperation it stressed that the united states was recasting its relations and forging new cooperation with russia china pakistan and india after 911 the united states rallied much of the worlds support for the war against qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan and for global crackdown against terrorists and their money the united states was able to enlist allies as well as russia and china in support of the war effort in what many experts saw as fundamental shift in russian policy with potential longterm consequences for us russian relations president putin allied himself fully with the united states in the struggle even showing understanding on the sensitive issue of us use of bases in neighboring former soviet republics the united states gained more qualified 3 httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases200302counter_terrorismcounter_terroris m_strategypdf crs3 support from china which stopped short of specific military assistance the united states also succeeded in gaining crucial operational support from pakistan and the central asian republics in particular uzbekistan tajikistan and kyrgyzstan large coalition of countries as well as nato as an organization remain engaged in afghanistan and elsewhere around the world small numbers of us forces have been deployed to the philippines to help local authorities root out terrorists believed to be affiliated with qaeda us and allied forces have also been sent to the middle east and horn of africa to intercept terrorists the united states has sent military advisors to the republic of georgia to help eliminate terrorist groups operating from its territory since president bushs state of the union speech in 2002 singling out iran and north korea along with iraq as an axis of evildiplomatic pressure has been mounted on the north korean and iranian governments to give up their nuclear weapons ambitions and end their support for terrorism and the regime of saddam hussein has been removed from power in november 2003 the bush administration signaled that it would begin consultations with us allies and host nations on the issue of possibly moving us bases in order to better position forces to meet the new global threats including the ability to attack terrorists in their sanctuaries planning for such redeployment has reportedly advanced considerably though most details have not yet been made public the united states also uses economic carrots and sticks to gain cooperation from governments and to strengthen their capacity to deny sanctuary to terrorists the united states has strong economic sanctions regime in place barring us foreign assistance to states that support terrorism the united states also uses foreign aid and economic incentives to encourage states to cooperate in efforts to eliminate terrorist sanctuaries providing new resources to assist unstable countries with impoverished and alienated populations in march 2002 the administration unveiled plan to increase us foreign aid over the next several years to poorer developing countries through the millennium challenge account4 although this initiative is linked to good governance rather than antiterrorism it could be seen as supporting both the 911 commission report identified six primary areas in particular that do or could serve as terrorist sanctuaries these include western pakistan and the pakistanafghanistan border region southern or western afghanistan the arabian peninsula especially saudi arabia and yemen and the nearby horn of africa including somalia and extending southwest into kenya southeast asia from thailand to the southern philippines to indonesia west africa including nigeria and mali and european cities with expatriate muslim communities especially in central and eastern europe where security forces and border controls are less effective the following sections assess the current situation and us efforts in each 4 see crs report rl32427 millennium challenge account implementation of new us foreign aid initiative june 30 2004 crs4 legislation number of bills were introduced in congress in 2004 to implement the 911 commission recommendations and related measures five of them in particular sought to implement recommendations regarding the eliminations of terrorist sanctuaries s 2774 introduce by senator john mccain raz and john lieberman dcn on september 7 2004 hr 5024 introduced by representative nancy pelosi on september 8 2004 and hr 5040 introduced by representative christopher shays rct and representative carolyn maloney dny on september 9 2004 hr 10 was introduced on september 24 2004 by house speaker dennis hastert s 2845 was introduced in the senate by susan collins r s 2845 the national intelligence reform act of 2004 as amended was passed by the house and senate and signed into law by the president on december 17 2004 pl 108458 it included provisions on terrorist sanctuaries taken from several of the bills under the legislation the president was to develop strategy for addressing and where possible eliminating terrorist sanctuaries and list in priority order actual and potential terrorist sanctuaries he was to outline strategies for disrupting or eliminating the sanctuaries describe efforts by the us government including successes and setbacks to work with other countries bilaterally and multilaterally to address or eliminate each actual or potential terrorist sanctuary and disrupt or eliminate the security provided to terrorists by such sanctuaries and describe long term goals and actions to reduce the conditions that allow the formation of terrorist sanctuaries the act amended section 6j of the export administration act of 1979 50 usc app 2405 j to include explicitly countries providing sanctuary to terrorists or terrorist organizations under the definition of countries supporting international terrorism the act also required that the annual report patterns of global terrorism address the issue of terrorist sanctuaries steps countries are taking to eliminate them and us strategies and efforts to work with other countries the act requires the president to submit report to congress not later than 180 days after enactment of the act including section on terrorist sanctuaries and what is being done to eliminate them the 109th congress is likely to address terrorist sanctuaries in its authorization and appropriations legislation as well as in its oversight of the global war on terrorism western pakistan and the pakistanafghanistan border region5 the 911 commission report emphasizes that the mounting of largescale international terrorist attacks appears to require sanctuaries in which terrorist groups can plan and operate with impunity it also notes that qaeda was aided substantially by its former sanctuary in afghanistan and its logistical networks 5 prepared by k alan kronstadt analyst in asian affairs crs5 through pakistan the report further notes that pakistans vast unpoliced areas remain attractive to terrorist groups almost all of the 911 attackers traveled the northsouth nexus from kandahar in afghanistan through quetta and karachi in pakistan according to the report the commission identifies the government of president pervez musharraf as the best hope for stability in pakistan and afghanistan and recommends that the united states make longterm commitment to provide comprehensive support for islamabad so long as it is committed to policy of enlightened moderation according to the us departments of state and defense pakistan has afforded the united states unprecedented levels of counterterrorism cooperation by allowing the us military to use bases within the country helping to identify and detain extremists and deploying tens of thousands of its own security forces to secure the pakistanafghanistan border top us officials regularly praise pakistani anti terrorism efforts the state department reports that islamabad has captured 550 alleged terrorists and their supporters and has transferred more than 400 of these to us custody including several top suspected qaeda leaders pakistan also ranks fourth in the world in seizing terrorist assets according to state among the security related assistance provisions to pakistan from the united states since 2001 are surveillance radars nightvision goggles and transport aircraft and helicopters equipment meant to enhance pakistans ability to support operation enduring freedom and to secure its borders pakistan is known to be base for numerous usdesignated foreign terrorist organizations and qaeda founder osama bin laden his associate egyptian islamic radical leader ayman alzawahiri and taliban chief mohammed omar may themselves be in remote area of pakistan near afghanistan despite pakistans crucial cooperation there have been doubts about islamabads commitment to core us concerns in the vast lawless zones of the afghanpakistani border region where islamic extremists find sanctuary especially worrisome are indications that members of the taliban may continue to receive logistical and other support inside pakistan senior us senators and state department officials have voiced such worries including concern that elements of pakistans intelligence agencies might be helping members of the taliban and perhaps even qaeda since the talibans ouster from power in kabul and subsequent retreat to the rugged mountain region near the pakistanafghanistan border what the us military calls its remnant forces have been able to regroup and to conduct hitandrun attacks against usled coalition units often in tandem with suspected qaeda fugitives these forces are then able to find haven on the pakistani side of the border which islamabad does not allow us forces to cross many of the extremists operating in this region have links to indigenous pakistani terrorists groups that operate in the city of karachi and two lethal december 2003 attempts to assassinate president musharraf were blamed on jaishemohammed and qaeda terrorists musharraf has claimed that up to 600 unwanted foreigners are active in the tribal areas and he has acknowledged that islamic extremists have infiltrated the lower levels of pakistans security apparatus in an effort to block infiltration along the pakistanafghanistan border islamabad had by the end of 2002 deployed some 70000 troops to the region in crs6 april 2003 the united states pakistan and afghanistan formed tripartite commission to coordinate their efforts to stabilize the border areas in june 2003 in what may have been response to increased us pressure islamabad for the first time sent its armed forces into the traditionally autonomous western federally administered tribal areas fata in search of qaeda and taliban fighters who have eluded the usled campaign in afghanistan by september 2003 islamabad had up to 25000 troops in the fata and major border operation reportedly took place in coordination with usled forces on the afghan side of the border after the two attempts on president musharrafs life the pakistan military increased its efforts in the fata the islamabad government also has made progress in persuading pashtun tribal leaders to undertake their own efforts by organizing tribal lashkars or militias for the express purpose of detaining or at least expelling wanted fugitives such militias have been unsuccessful to date islamabads more energetic operations in the western tribal regions also have brought vocal criticism from musharrafs detractors among islamist groups many of whom accuse him of taking orders from the united states some observers worry that increased government pressure on tribal communities and military operations in the fata may create backlash sparking unrest and strengthening proal qaeda sentiments there during march 2004 the united states pakistan and afghanistan intensified their coordinated military operations in the mountainous afghanpakistani border region and pakistani troops fought pitched 12day battle with islamic militants in traditionally autonomous tribal area more than 130 people were killed in the fighting including 46 pakistani soldiers but high value qaeda or taliban targets were reportedly killed or captured up to 6000 pakistani soldiers were involved in the battle which encouraged many observers as sign of president musharrafs sincerity in the effort to uproot terrorists and their supporters on pakistani territory but which also apparently exacerbated already volatile anti musharraf sentiments held by many ethnic pashtuns in the region on april 24 2004 in what came to be known as the shakai agreement islamabad took new tack of seeking reconciliation with pashtun militants and the foreign radicals they are accused of harboring by allowing foreign fighters to remain in the region if they turn in their weapons and renounce terrorism by early june 2004 this strategy apparently had failed and the government rescinded its amnesty offer to five key tribal militants in south waziristan more than 20000 troops backed by fixedwing aircraft and helicopter gunships engaged in offensive operations that included the killing of one of the most defiant militant pashtun leaders nek mohammed who was described by pakistani military spokesman as an agent of qaeda more than 100 people were killed including some 20 pakistani soldiers also in early june authorities in south waziristan shuttered more than 6000 merchant shops in an effort to use economic pressure against tribesmen who are providing shelter to foreign militants the south waziristan agency chief administrator has said that the islamabad government would continue enforcing economic sanctions on the region until its demands were met including the handover of two wanted tribal militants maulvi abbas and mohammed javed as of late july sporadic and lethal clashes between pakistani soldiers and islamic militants continue in the border areas and pakistans islamist political leaders continue to demand an end to military operations in the fata on july 29 some nine months after such military operations began pakistan announced crs7 having captured genuine highvalue target tanzanian national ahmed khalfan ghailani who had appeared on the fbis mostwanted list after his indictment for murder in connection with the 1998 bombings of two american embassies in east africa in midjune 2004 pakistan army spokesman drew direct links between six weeklong spate of mostly sectarian bombings and killings in karachi and government efforts to root out militants in south waziristan at least 72 people were killed between may 3 and june 10 including ten murdered when suspected islamic militants attacked the motorcade of top pakistani army commander in karachi the general was unharmed the attacks raised concerns that the musharraf government is finding it difficult to control domestic extremism especially among some elements of pakistans security apparatus itself latejuly reports that the pakistani government is again seeking to resolve conflict in its western regions through accommodation with militants based on the shakai agreement suggest that islamabad may be confounded by the continued and vehement resistance being shown in the face of military operations us antiterrorist operations in afghanistan6 the usled war in afghanistan that began october 7 2001 operation enduring freedom oef in the immediate aftermath of qaedas september 11 2001 attacks on the united states sought to deny afghanistan as base of operations for qaeda by overthrowing the taliban leadership of that country the taliban had come to power in kabul in 1996 and had refused repeated us requests to expel qaeda terrorists in afghanistan including qaeda founder osama bin laden as result of the war the taliban government collapsed in november 2001 leading to the establishment of prous government led by president hamid karzai the united states is attempting to promote stability and in so doing keep afghanistan inhospitable to any regrouping of qaeda the taliban or other terrorist groups the pillars of the security effort are 1 oef combat operations 2 patrols by unmandated international security assistance force isaf 3 the formation of provincial reconstruction teams 4 the establishment and training of an afghan national army and police force and 5 the demobilization of local militias oef is usled combat mission against qaeda and taliban remnants that are still active primarily in southern and eastern afghanistan qaeda militants reportedly want to regroup in parts of afghanistan to train and plan terrorist attacks while taliban fighters want to discredit the karzai government and hopefully regain power in afghanistan oef forces do not conduct peacekeeping missions or routinely patrol afghan neighborhoods that role is left to isaf which operates in kabul and konduz and is planning to expand to other cities as well the united states maintains about 17000 oef troops in afghanistan and coalition forces are contributing another 2000 to oef although the main focus of us operations is in sparsely populated areas where the taliban and qaeda still operate some 6 this section was prepared by kenneth katzman specialist in middle eastern affairs on july 29 2004 crs8 militants have infiltrated afghan cities to commit terrorist attacks such as september 5 2002 car bombing in crowded marketplace in kabul and virtually simultaneous assassination attempt against president karzai other urban terrorist attacks attributed to taliban activists include the bombing of marketplace in qandahar on december 5 2003 and two february 2004 suicide bombings against isaf troops in kabul to combat these threats oef forces in partnership with ustrained troops of reborn afghan national army ana are almost constantly on the offensive particularly in qandahar province and the several provinces north of it qandahar had been the power base of the taliban about 2000 us troops participated in one of the largest antitaliban sweeps operation avalanche december 8 30 2003 conducted since the fall of the taliban during marchjuly 2004 2400 us marines along with ana soldiers conducted operation mountain storm against taliban remnants in and around uruzgan province the home province of mullah omar the marines departed afghanistan in late july 2004 at the conclusion of the operation other significant operations against militants have taken place in southeastern afghanistan since may 2004 as part of planned spring offensive another sweep operation began in midjuly 2004 to help secure the scheduled october 9 2004 presidential election oef forces continue to hunt in afghanistan and possibly over the border into pakistan for bin laden he reportedly escaped the usafghan offensive against the qaeda stronghold of tora bora in eastern afghanistan in december 2001 another target of oef is the faction of afghan islamist leader gulbuddin hikmatyar major leader of the antisoviet resistance during the 1980s and who is now allied with qaeda and taliban remnants hikmatyars traditional power base is in and around the eastern city of jalalabad where his insurgent followers are active on february 19 2003 the us government formally designated hikmatyar as specially designated global terrorist under the authority of executive order 13224 that order subjected named terrorists and terroristrelated institutions to financial and other us sanctions his group hizbeislami gulbuddin hig was analyzed in the section on other terrorist groups in the state departments report on international terrorism for 2003 released april 30 2004 the group is not formally designated as foreign terrorist organization some us commanders say the combat has caused the talibanled insurgency to lose energy and that fewer than 1000 taliban and qaeda fighters remain in afghanistan7 the commander of oef us gen david barno said in february 2004 that us forces were now attempting to cultivate relations with the population in areas where taliban and other insurgents operate in order to better conduct counterinsurgency missions 7 nato afghan rebellion fading dallas morning news february 11 2004 crs9 arabian peninsula8 the arabian peninsula covering more than 12 million square miles including some rugged mountainous and desert terrain provides potential sanctuary for members of islamist terrorist groups such as qaeda poorly demarcated borders until recently often undemarcated borders between the seven states comprising the arabian peninsula are easy to traverse facilitating movement of people seeking to avoid detection the two largest and most populous arabian peninsula states the kingdom of saudi arabia and the republic of yemen are experiencing political economic and demographic pressures that have fostered discontent especially among younger generations furthermore many people in both countries are attracted to islamic fundamentalism sometimes in its more violent manifestations and are often hostile to western and nonmuslim influences or to local governments deemed to be cooperating with nonmuslim nations these factors have created fertile ground for recruitment by qaeda its affiliates and likeminded organizations qaeda leader osama bin laden is former saudi citizen his citizenship was revoked in 1994 and his ancestors came from remote part of yemen where he still has relatives many members of terrorist groups in these countries were recruited by bin laden to fight the soviet occupation of afghanistan where they acquired their initial military training and experience according to news reports newer generation of veterans who fought against us forces in iraq are supplementing the ranks of terrorist groups formerly filled by the socalled afghan arabs9 saudi arabia the september 11 2001 attacks kindled criticisms within the united states of alleged official saudi involvement in terrorism or of saudi laxity in acting against terrorist groups high percentage of the hijackers 15 out of 19 were saudi nationals some maintain that saudi domestic and foreign policies have created climate that may have contributed to terrorist acts by islamic radicals for example some believe that the saudi regime has fostered international terrorism by funding religious schools madrasas that in some cases propagate extreme forms of islam and advocate violence critics of saudi policies have also cited multiplicity of reports that the saudi government has permitted or encouraged fund raising in saudi arabia by charitable islamic groups and foundations linked to qaeda for more information see crs report rl32499 saudi arabia terrorist financing issues july 28 2004 saudi officials maintain that they are working closely with the united states to combat terrorism which they say is aimed as much at the saudi regime as it is at the united states us efforts against qaedas presence in saudi arabia have generally involved intelligence sharing technical assistance encouragement of saudi efforts to apprehend key people in terrorist groups cutting the flow of funds to these groups and enacting new laws to improve oversight of charitable donations to ensure that they are not diverted to terrorist activity some specific us or saudi measures 8 this section was prepared by alfred b prados specialist in middle east affairs 9 whitlock craig saudis facing return of radicals the washington post july 11 2004 p a1 crs10 include the following 1 establishment of joint ussaudi task force to conduct an ongoing investigation of terrorist financing in saudi arabia through scrutiny of bank accounts computer records and other financial data 2 several joint actions against large saudibased charity accused of involvement in terrorist financing the alharamain islamic foundation leading to the closure of this charity and request by the two countries that it be added to consolidated list of terrorist entities tied to qaeda 3 continued support for saudi security forces including the saudi armed forces and the national guard small number of us military advisory personnel have remained in the kingdom since the withdrawal of us forces after the iraq war also the bush administration requested small amount 25000 for saudi arabia under the international military education and training imet program in fy2005 to encourage continued saudi attendance at us military service schools10 in addition the saudi government has promulgated new laws and regulations to outlaw money laundering ban cash collections at mosques centralize control over charitable collections close unlicenced money exchanges and scrutinize clerics involved in charitable collections according to the us state department since may 2003 an increase in terrorist acts that killed saudi nationals as well as us and other expatriates appears to have galvanized saudi authorities into more proactive stance in confronting terrorist groups in saudi arabia11 in june 2004 saudi security officials killed abd alaziz muqrin leader of an apparent qaeda offshoot known as qaeda on the arabian peninsula which had claimed responsibility for several terrorist acts in 2004 along with two senior financial operatives of qaeda results of saudi police work have been mixed of 26 terrorists on the saudi governments most wanted list 12 reportedly remain at large12 according to recent report saudi government forces appear to be conducting major campaign in southwestern saudi arabia near the yemen border13 yemen as an underdeveloped country where tribal leaders often exert more control than do central government authorities yemen has long been the scene of random violence and kidnaping there are an estimated 60 million firearms among population of less than 20 million14 the prevailing climate of lawlessness in much of yemen has provided opportunities for terrorist groups to maintain presence in outlying areas of the country some qaeda sympathizers and operatives are 10 saudi arabia has received the same amount of aid under imet since fy2001 however sec 575 of pl108447 the consolidated appropriations act for fy2005 stipulated that none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available pursuant to this act could be obligated or expended to finance any assistance to saudi arabia the president may waive the prohibition if he certifies that saudi arabia is cooperating with efforts to combat international terrorism and that the proposed assistance will help that effort 11 us department of state patterns of global terrorism 2003 washington april 29 2004 12 whitlock craig saudis facing return of radicals the

qaeda us officials initially complained that yemeni authorities did not fully cooperate in the investigation of the cole bombing since the september 2001 attacks however and perhaps because qaeda attacks have continued in yemen president salih has been more forthcoming in his cooperation with the us campaign to suppress qaeda he reportedly allowed small groups of us special forces troops and cia agents to assist in identifying and rooting out qaeda cadres hiding in yemen despite sympathy for qaeda among many yemenis according to press articles quoting us and yemeni officials the yemeni government allowed us personnel to launch missile strike from an unmanned predator aircraft against an automobile in eastern yemen in november 2002 killing six passengers believed to be terrorists including qaid salim sinan alharithi key planner of the attack on the uss cole16 in its most recent annual publication patterns of global terrorism 2003 released on april 29 2004 the us state

bombings reportedly described yemen as its next target in retaliation for the detention of qaeda members by yemeni authorities17 the united states has also sought to weaken qaeda through modest aid program for yemens security forces the bush administration has requested 15 million in foreign military financing fmf for yemen together with 11 million under the international military education and training imet program some of the fmf funds will support development of coast guard designed to patrol yemens extensive coast line extending nearly 1200 miles and territorial waters and to help

terrorist plotters to move funds around the globe acquire foreign visas and passports and shelter terrorists moving between afghanistan and the middle east according to the commission report the united arab emirates was both valued counterterrorism ally of the united states and persistent counterterrorism problem due to its simultaneous policy of keeping behind the scenes contacts with the taliban in afghanistan while cooperating with us counter terrorist officials19 actions taken over the past three years kuwait qatar bahrain oman and the uae have cooperated with us officials and have

groups despite curbs on terrorist financing analysts believe that there is an undercurrent of resentment against the united states among many gulf citizens and that motivated donors could exploit weaknesses or lapses in government oversight of the banking sector in addition many gulf countries are heterogenous societies composed of gulf arabs persians arabs from other parts of the middle east and southeast asians who are drawn to the gulf for its high paying jobs with such ethnic diversity it can be easy for terrorists to infiltrate some parts of the gulf finally observers note that even if gulf states are effective in denying sanctuary to international terrorists there is still the problem of homegrown terrorism which many observers believe could be more serious problem in the years to come in order to preempt the development of new terrorist movements in the gulf some advocate the adoption of certain social and economic reforms in order to improve local education systems and provide more opportunities for gainful employment of young people some gulf states have taken small steps 19 the uae was one of three governments to officially recognize the taliban regime in

2001 terrorist attacks the united states has considered southeast asia to be second front in its global campaign against islamist terrorism21 indonesia and the southern philippines have been particularly vulnerable to penetration by antiamerican islamic terrorist groups indonesia and malaysia are majority muslim states the southern philippines has sizeable and historically alienated and separatistminded muslim minority and southern thailand has majority muslimethnic malay populatedareas with longstanding separatist aspirations since the attacks us attention in the region has been focused on qaedas activities in southeast asia which as documented in the 911 commission report played critical role in the networks rise qaeda has used its southeast asia cells to help organize and finance its global activities including the september 11 attacks and to provide safe harbor to qaeda operatives such as the convicted organizer of the 1993 bombing of the world trade center ramzi yousef us attention also has been focused on indigenous radical islamist groups in southeast asia particularly the jemaah islamiyah ji terrorist network that are known or alleged to have ties to qaeda many of these groups threaten the status quo of the region by seeking to create independent islamic states in majoritymuslim areas overthrow existing secular governments andor establish new supranational islamic state encompassing indonesia malaysia singapore the southern philippines and southern thailand22 in pursuit of these objectives they have planned and carried out violent attacks against civilian and noncivilian targets including american and other western institutions these include the deadliest terrorist attack since september 2001 the october 12 2002 bombing in bali indonesia that killed approximately 200 people mostly westerners to combat the threat the bush administration has pressed countries in the region to arrest suspected terrorist individuals and organizations deployed over 1000 troops to the southern philippines to advise the philippine military in their fight against the violent abu sayyaf group increased intelligence sharing operations

after the september 11 attacks at least one senior pentagon official floated the idea of taking military action against terrorist targets in southeast asia as surprise alternative to attacking afghanistan the 911 commission report p559 note 75 douglas feith war plan that cast wide net washington post august 7 2004 22 the 911 commission report crs14 successes have been in the area of law enforcement hundreds of ji members have been arrested reportedly crippling the networks ability and possibly reducing its ability to carry out largescale attacks against western targets in the near future the responses of countries in the region to both the threat and to the us reaction generally have varied with the intensity of their concerns about the threat to their own stability and domestic politics in general singapore malaysia and the philippines were quick to crack down on militant groups and share intelligence with the united states and australia whereas indonesia began to do so only after attacks or arrests revealed the severity of the threat to their citizens that said combating antiamerican terrorism in southeast asia presents the bush administration and congress with delicate foreign policy problem most regional governments feel threatened by homegrown or imported islamic militant groups and therefore have ample incentive to cooperate with the us antiterrorist campaign however southeast asian governments have to balance these security concerns with domestic political considerations although proponents of violent radical islam remain small minority in southeast asia many governments view increased american pressure and military presence in their region with ambivalence because of the political sensitivity of the issue with both mainstream islamic and secular nationalist groups the rise in antiamerican sentiment propelled by the usled invasion and occupation of iraq makes it even more difficult for most governments to countenance an overt us role in their internal security the challenge is to find way to confront the terrorist elements without turning them into heroes or martyrs in the broader southeast asian islamic community furthermore the continued activities of qaeda and jemaah islamiyah will require coordinated international response in region where multinational institutions and cooperation are weak strategies for combating terrorism in southeast asia to date the us approach to fighting terrorism in southeast asia primarily has been bilateral rather than multilateral in nature and generally has been limited to the law enforcement rather than the military realm in the near term barring another major terrorist attack it is difficult to foresee these features of us strategy changing since they are based upon features of international relations in southeast asia relatively weak multilateral institutions the poor history of multilateral cooperation and the wariness on the part of most regional governments of being perceived as working too closely with the united states rectifying these deficiencies could be elements of the longterm goal of competing against terrorist ideologies decapitation the 911 commission recommends conceptualizing the battle against islamist terrorism as twopronged campaign on the one hand aimed at disrupting the leadership of qaeda jemaah islamiyah and likeminded terrorist networks and on the other hand competing against the rise of radical ideologies within the islamic world that inspire terrorism23 to date us policy in southeast asia necessarily has been focused on the first goal which is more immediate and requires an emphasis on the policy tools necessary to kill and capture specific individuals locate and destroy terrorist training facilities and identify terrorist financing networks thus far extensive cooperation among police and intelligence 23 the 911 commission report p361365 crs15 services have netted over 200 of jis leaders and is thought to have crippled jis capabilities significantly however jis networkbased structure and its suspected ability to reconstitute its leadership means that arrests alone are unlikely to cause the network to collapse capacity building the second goal is more complex for essentially it aims at reducing the appeal of violent islamism by strengthening national governments ability to provide their muslim citizens with an attractive alternative although southeast asian societies and governments in general are more tolerant representative and responsive than those in the middle east and south asia islamist terrorist groups have been able to exploit the sense of alienation produced in part by the corruption and breakdown of institutional authority in indonesia and by the marginalization of minority muslim groups in the southern philippines and southern thailand strategies for dealing with this problem include greater emphasis on attacking the institutions that support terrorism and building up regional governments institutional capacities for combating terrorist groups and for reducing the sense of alienation among muslim citizens24 options include placing priority on discovering and destroying terrorist training centers which have proven extremely important to ji and the philippine separatist group the moro islamic liberation front milf which is believed to be providing ji with terrorist training camps on mindanao25 strengthening the capacities of local governments judicial systems through training and perhaps funding in an effort to reduce the corruption and politicization of the judicial process work with indonesia the philippines and other countries to better manage communal tensions and identify religious flash points before they erupt sectarian violence has proven to be fertile ground for ji and other terrorist groups to recruit and raise funds26 building up staterun schools so that muslims are less likely to send their children to radical madrassas where extremist brands of islam are propagated the 911 commission recommends creating new multilateral international youth opportunity fund that would seek to improve primary and secondary education in muslim communities27 the bush administration moved in this direction in october 2003 when it launched 157 million program to help 24 zachary abuza funding terrorism in southeast asia the

piracy gun running and other types of smuggling particularly in the straits of malacca and the waters between sulawesi and the southern philippines the us military could play role here perhaps in coordinating with japan the coast guard of which has been conducting bilateral exercises with selected southeast asian countries two difficulties are that malaysia only recently established coast guard and indonesia has nearly dozen agencies that claim responsibility for guarding indonesian waters in which about onequarter of the worlds piracy incidents occurred in 2003 assisting in developing frameworks such as harmonized extradition agreements and evidentiary standards to more effectively prosecute terrorists and facilitate investigations and data sharing with regional partners the 911 commission argues that tracking terrorism financing must remain front and center in us counterterrorism efforts notwithstanding increased police cooperation most southeast asian countries do not appear to have made commensurate efforts to locate freeze and at minimum disrupt the flow of the assets of islamic terrorist groups as of december 2003 terrorist funds had been seized in the region despite assessments by us officials that qaeda has increasingly relied on southeast asia to move its money and hide its assets because authorities in the middle east have heightened scrutiny of the networks operations indonesia the philippines and burma remain on the organization for economic cooperation and developments list of noncooperative countries in the fight against money laundering although shutting down informal financing mechanisms such as cash donations and the informal hawala system of transferring money would be next to impossible feasible actions include shutting down

terrorist money can be used as an important intelligence tool to better understand how terrorist networks operate31 us public diplomacy ultimately convincing regional governments to increase antiterrorism cooperation will depend upon reducing the political costs of doing so muslim southeast asia currently is undergoing something of spiritual awakening with islamic consciousness rising and influencing the opinion of moderate muslims polls indicate that us actions in the middle east particularly in israel and iraq have led to steep rise in antiamericanism making overt cooperation with us counterterrorism operations more difficult as increasing numbers of muslims in southeast asia see us policy as antimuslim singapores prime minister goh chok tong for instance has argued that more balanced and nuanced approach by the united states towards the israelipalestinian conflict must become central pillar to the war on terrorism in order to maintain credibility in southeast asia32 additionally there appears to be perception among some southeast asians that the united states has relied too heavily on hard military power to combat terrorism not only in afghanistan and iraq but also in southeast asia while these perceptions of an overly militaristic us response in southeast asia may be overblown particularly by being colored by us politics in the middle east they may indicate disconnect between the united states approach to the war on terror and its regional friends and allies such division has the potential to limit the degree to which regional states will cooperate with the united states in the war on terror to counter these sentiments the united states could expand its public diplomacy programs in southeast asia to at least provide an explanation for us actions in the region and other parts of the world many of these programs were reduced significantly in the 1990s after the end of the cold war the 911 commission specifically recommends increasing

antiterrorist units the subregion is focusing on countering coastal and maritime terrorist activities as part of the usled combined joint task forcehorn of africa cjtfhoa mission which is aimed at detecting disrupting and defeating international terrorist groups despite these efforts the risk of terrorism in many african countries remains high in november 2002 kenya became the site of another terrorist attack just four years after the us embassy bombings in kenya and tanzania in june 2003 the international atomic energy agency iaea issued warning on illicit trafficking of materials commonly used for making dirty bombs subsequently an iaea team was sent to nigeria and tanzania to investigate the seized materials in addition to east africa the sahel region of africa has grown vulnerable to terrorism in september 2003 the south africa institute of security studies reported that since 1990 terrorist attacks have claimed the lives of some 6000 africans 20 of deaths caused by international terrorist attacks qaeda and proal qaeda groups in africa have presence in number of african countries especially in kenya and somalia clear indications for claims that terrorist groups have sought or may seek sanctuary in certain west african countries such as nigeria are generally lacking while there are some indications that international terrorists may have undertaken operational activities in others such as sierra leone or liberia though evidence for such claims is contested in general the international terror threat against us and local national interests is likely to continue to grow in several parts of africa because of porous borders lax security political instability and lack of state resources and capacities somalia in late september 2001 the bush administration added alittihad somalibased group to list of terrorismrelated entities whose assets were ordered frozen by presidential executive order bush administration officials accused alittihad of links with qaeda the administration did not offer evidence to prove its allegations but some officials asserted that links between the two organizations dated back to the us presence in somalia during operation restore hope 19921994 in early november 2001 federal authorities raided several somaliowned money transfer businesses in the us operated by albarakaat companies the bush

albarakaat and individuals associated with the money transfer business sector are directly linked to qaeda in september 2002 us officials cleared three somalis and three albarakaat branches accused of ties with qaeda the three individuals and businesses were delisted from the us treasury list of terrorist supporters and their assets were also unfrozen in early december 2001 american officials reportedly visited baidoa somalia and met with faction leaders and ethiopian military officers the purpose of the oneday visit was not acknowledged by washington but reporters in the region stated that these officials asked about terrorist networks in somalia bush administration officials are concerned that qaeda members may flee to somalia from afghanistan the united states and its allies have intensified their search for qaeda members in the horn of africa us allies are searching fishing boats and vessels off the coast of somalia us surveillance planes have been flying over somalia in march 2002 germany reportedly deployed six ships and several thousand troops to the horn of africa to monitor and intercept terrorists and prevent them from establishing bases in the region in 20032004 ethiopia arrested number of nonsomali terror suspects from somalia the absence of central government in somalia is one of the major factors that makes somalia potentially attractive to international terrorist organizations kenya the east african country is the only country in subsaharan africa with current known qaeda presence kenya suffered two major terrorist attacks in the last six years on november 28 2002 simultaneous terrorists attacks struck mombasa kenya just four years after the 1998 embassy bombings suicide bombers drove fourwheel drive vehicle packed with explosives

the mombasa airport the 261 passengers on board the carrier escaped injury and the plane landed safely in tel aviv observers assert that the synchronized attacks illustrate common tactic linking both the 1998 and 2002 terrorists incidents suicide bombing against soft targets appear consistent with those carried out in saudi arabia and morocco in may 2003 in june 2003 kenyan authorities announced that four people were charged with murder for the hotel bombings35 other suspects include fazul abduallah mohammed aka abdul karim and saleh ali saleh nabhan mohammed was also named in connection with

potentially provide sanctuary for terrorists as suggested by the 911 commission report at present such an outcome appears to be only theoretical possibility international terrorist groups suspects or international radical islamic militants have been publicly reported to have presence in nigeria and nigerian officials have issued press statements indicating that they do not believe that the qaeda organization is active in the country39 while nigeria has large muslim population that includes some radical elements and supporters of salafistoriented theologies40 as well as numerous selfprofessed

oil production and export facilities as strategic target both for armed attack operations and as base for building political support or recruiting followers the potential for such an outcome is suggested by comment attributed to usama bin laden who in taped message labeled nigeria along with jordan morocco pakistan saudi arabia and yemen as being among the most qualified regions for religious and political liberation41 liberia and sierra leone press reports evidence in court cases policy analyses and reports among other sources suggest that international terrorist groups may have sojourned in liberia and traveled to sierra leone in order to buy rough diamonds reportedly for use in terrorist financing activities42 in one instance it is alleged that qaeda operatives visited northeast sierra leone entering the country from neighboring liberia to purchase such diamonds43 the arrival and stay in liberia of the qaeda representatives and their subsequent visits to sierra leone were allegedly facilitated by officials of the government of the thenpresident of liberia charles taylor and members of the revolutionary united front ruf now defunct sierra leonean rebel group the operatives were allegedly based at and operated out of liberian governmentprotected safehouse in the liberian capital monrovia second alleged example of the use of west africa as base for providing support to terrorist groups is more diffuse indirect and longstanding diverse observers of west africa including some us government officials assert that some members of the large often multigenerational and permanent lebanese diaspora that is resident in the region routinely contribute to the financing of hizballah lebanese shia group that is us designated foreign terrorist organization us counterterrorism efforts in littoral west africa the question of whether qaeda sought temporary sanctuary in liberia or sierra leone and what us response if any may be appropriate is controversial while some us officials believe that there is reasonable possibility that qaeda operatives were involved in purchasing sierra leonean diamonds the fbi has reportedly repeatedly investigated these allegations and has found firm evidence establishing the claims the claims in this view have not been proved an assertion with which the central intelligence agency reportedly concurs similarly the 911 commission 41 text of bin ladins message broadcast by aljazeera 11 february bbc monitoring newsfile feb 11 2003 42 these allegations are discussed at length in crs report rl30751 diamonds and conflict background policy and legislation pp 710 and 2526 43 some observers postulate that the diamonds were purchased as means of wealth savings and asset preservation rather than in order to directly finance qaeda operations diamonds are compact concentrated and highly fungible form of wealth that is difficult to trace but can be easily concealed and transported the qaeda representatives reportedly purchased diamonds at premium at prices that exceeded thenprevalent local market rates and which created temporary scarcity in the supply of rough diamonds in the region of sierra leone where the purchases were made crs22 report states that the commission had seen persuasive evidence that qaeda funded itself by trading in african conflict diamonds p 171 though it did not categorically deny that such links may exist however those that believe the evidence is compelling44 assert that us intelligence agencies findings the apparent basis of the 911 commissions findings see footnote 129 are wrong and will damage international efforts to ensure that rough diamonds are not used to fund terrorism45 there are also some indications that us officials are divided about the credibility of the allegations and may be further investigating the link similarly some members of congress reportedly view the allegations as credible46 interrogation of one of the operatives alleged to have purchased diamonds in sierra leone ahmed khalfan ghailani may result in confirmation or dismissal of the claims ghailani was reportedly captured in pakistan in late july 200447 aside from the qaedadiamond linkages issue review of news sources and informal discussions with us officials indicates that there appear to be few overt or apparent indications that there is current or immediate

european union eu have been reliable partners for the united states in the fight against terrorism they have significantly strengthened their legal and administrative abilities to counter terrorists in the years since september 11 and made improving law enforcement cooperation with the united states top priority the 2001 attacks and the subsequent discovery of qaeda cells in europe shocked european leaders and publics immediate and unprecedented european efforts following september 11 to track down suspects and freeze financial assets often in close cooperation with us authorities produced numerous arrests in western europe especially in belgium france germany italy spain and the united kingdom germany and spain were identified as key logistical and planning bases for the attacks on the united states as result it quickly became evident that europes different legal systems the largely open borders of the then15 member eu liberal asylum laws and strong privacy protections allowed terrorists and other criminals to move around easily and evade arrest and prosecution the large muslim populations in many western european countries often provided cover for terrorist cells as well as fertile recruiting grounds drawing especially from young disenfranchised muslim populations that have not been wellintegrated into mainstream european society the lack of sizable muslim communities in most central and eastern european countries has made this region less of known sanctuary although laxer border controls and weaker governments especially in the balkans still pose concerns the march 11 2004 terrorist bombings in madrid spain further confirmed for analysts and policymakers that europe remains both target and base for qaeda and qaedainspired terrorists49 to respond to these threats european governments have sought to tighten their domestic laws against terrorism and terrorist financing and many have taken steps to reform immigration and asylum laws to prevent terrorists from gaining footholds in their countries especially notable are eu initiatives since september 11 to boost police and judicial cooperation bring down traditional barriers among law enforcement and intelligence agencies and harmonize national laws against terrorism among other steps the eu has established common definition of terrorism and list of terrorist groups an eu arrest warrant enhanced tools to investigate terrorist financing and new measures to strengthen external eu border controls the eu has been working to bolster europol its fledgling joint

useuropean extradition treaties the mla treaty will give us authorities access to european bank account information speed the processing time for mla requests and permit joint investigations despite these strides european governments and the eu still face significant political legal and cultural hurdles as they seek to introduce more effective law enforcement tools against terrorism the march 2004 terrorist attacks in spain highlighted these ongoing implementation problems national police and intelligence services have remained reluctant to share information with europol or with each other several of the madrid suspects were reportedly known to security services in spain and in other eu states but fell through communication cracks and legal loopholes50 furthermore agreed eu measures such as the euwide arrest warrant have bogged down in the legislative processes of individual member states the warrant was supposed to have taken effect on january 1 2004 but only eight of the eus then15 members had transposed the warrant into national law the warrant is still not in force in seven members of the enlarged eu of 25 like the united states european governments have had to balance their counterterrorism efforts against wellestablished civil liberty protections and democratic ideals for example the evidentiary bar is still set very high in most european countries although there have been hundreds of terroristrelated arrests throughout europe in recent years critics assert that many suspects have been released because of lack of sufficient or admissible evidence and there have been few successful prosecutions as of january 2004 for example only six of the 544 people arrested under uk antiterrorist legislation since september 11 had been convicted51 cooperation challenges also remain between the united states and europe european opposition to the use of the death penalty in the united states may still slow or prevent the extradition of terrorist suspects different data protection regimes have complicated quick and robust useu cooperation in the area of border controls and travel security and some european officials complain that the united states

terrorist groups as some countries in western europe in part because most countries in the region have not attracted large numbers of muslim immigrants in recent decades however concerns have been raised about several countries in southeastern europe with large muslim populations especially bosnia and herzegovina one area of particular concern in bosnia is the presence of islamic fundamentalist fighters from the 19921995 war in bosnia most left bosnia at us insistence after the deployment of the natoled peacekeeping force in 1995 however some stayed behind and became bosnian citizens in addition some islamic charities and humanitarian groups that proliferated during and after the war have served as qaeda fronts for planning attacks in bosnia and elsewhere some qaeda operatives in bosnia reportedly have had connections to members of bosnias intelligence service another legacy of bosniak wartime cooperation with islamic militants terrorist groups have also operated from albania there have been few reports of terrorists operating from kosovo52 it should be stressed that opposition to terrorism among indigenous muslims in the balkans has been remarkably strong bosniaks and albanians are generally more secular in outlook than muslims elsewhere most view themselves as part of europe and are grateful for the perceived us role in defending them against serbian aggression in the 1990s efforts by islamic extremists to recruit local muslims into their organizations have met with limited success53 the state department patterns of global terrorism reports for 2002 and 2003 noted that the countries of southeastern europe have taken steps to combat terrorism bosnia has transferred terrorist suspects to us control shut down nongovernmental organizations with links to terrorism and frozen terrorist assets albania has taken similar steps however as noted by the 911 commission report border controls and security services in central and eastern europe are not as effective as their western counterparts the situation is improving in new eu member states in central europe due to substantial eu assistance in bringing their border controls up to eu standards
