homeless assistance grants distribution of funds introduction homelessness in america has always existed but it did not come to the publics attention as national issue until the 1970s and 1980s when the characteristics of the homeless population and their living arrangem ents began to change throughout the early and middle part of the 20th century homelessness was typified by skid rows areas with hotels and singleroom occupancy dwellings where transient single men lived1 skid rows were usually removed from the more populated areas of cities and it was uncommon for individuals to actually live on the streets2 beginning in the 1970s however the homeless population be gan to grow and become more visible to the general public according to studies from the time homeless persons were longer almost exclusively single men but included women with children their median age was younger they were more r acially diverse in previous decades the observed homeless population was largely white they were less likely to be employed and therefore had lower incomes they were mentally ill in higher proportions than previously and individuals who were abusing or had abused drugs began to become more prevalent in the population3 number of reasons have been offered for the growth in the number of homeless persons and their increasing visibility many cities demolished skid rows to make way for urban development l eaving some residents without affordable housing options4 other possible factors contribu ting to homelessness include the decreased availability of affordable housin g generally the reduced need for seasonal unskilled labor the reduced likelihood th at relatives will accommodate homeless family members the decreased value of public benefits and changed admissions standards at mental hospitals5 the increased visibility of homeless people was due in part to the decriminaliza tion of actions such as pub lic drunkenness loitering and vagrancy6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33764crs2 7 these programs included the emergency food and shelter program pl 988 the emergency shelter grants program pl 99591 and the transitional housing demonstration program pl 99591 in 1987 all three were incorporated into the stewart b mckinney homeless assistance act pl 10077 although the transitional housing demonstration program was renamed the supportive housing demonstration program 8 for information about other programs cr eated by the mckinney act see crs report rl30442 homelessness targeted federal programs and recent legislation coordinated by libby perl 9 in addition to funds for the four grant pr ograms the congressional appropriation has also at times contained funds for items like training and technical assistance data collection and the interagency council on homelessness these amounts make up small percentage of continuedin the 1980s congress first responded to the growing prevalence of homelessness with seve ral separate grant programs signed to address the food and shelter needs of homeless individuals7 then in 1987 congress enacted the stewart b mckinney homeless assistance act mck inney act which created number of new programs to comprehensively addre ss the needs of homeless people including food shelter health care nd education pl 10077 th act was later renamed the mckinneyvento homeless assistance act m ckinneyvento in pl 106400 after its other prominent sponsor bruce f vento8 among the programs authorized in the mckinney act were four grants to provide housing and related ssistance to homeless persons the emergency shelter grants esg program the supportive housing demonstration program the supplemental assistance for facilities to assist the homeless safah program and the section 8 moderate rehabilitation assistance for single room occupancy dwellings sro program these four programs administered by the us department of housing an d urban development hud were created to provide temporary and permanent housing to hom eless persons along with supportive services over the years congress has changed the makeup of the homeless assistance grants but there are still four currently funded programs three of which were part of the original mckinney act the four existing grants are the esg program the supportive housing program shp the shelter plus care sc program and the sro program this re port describes how hud distributes the four homeless assistance grants the role of congress and hud in the funding process since creating the four homeless assist ance grants in 1987 congress has played decreasing role in how funds are allocated among them initially from fy1987 to fy1994 congress appropriated f unds separately for each of the four programs however beginning in fy1995 and conti nuing to the present congress has appropriated one lump sum fo r all four programs and hud has then determined how those funds are distributed among the esg shp sc and sro programs for distribution of the grants from fy1987 through fy2007 see table 1 9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33764crs3 9 continued the total appropriation 10 department of housing and urban development notice of funding availability continuum of

approximate ly 1586 billion in fy2008 pl 110161 hud first allocates portion of the total appropriation to the esg program this amount is generally between 13 and 15 of the total appropriation hud bases this range of funding on the proportion of funds congress devoted to the program in its fy1994 appropriation after hud has set aside the esg funds from the appropriation it sets aside funds to renew sc perman ent housing contracts in separate account10 in every hud appropriations act since fy2001 congress has required hud to provide funds to renew ex isting sc contracts on an annual basis as long as hud determines that the s c projects are needed and meet program requirements the amount remainin g after the esg funds and sc renewal funds are deducted from the total appropriation is then available for the shp and sro programs and for new sc projects th remaining funds are not specifically dedicated to any of the three programs after determining which funds are av ailable for the esg program sc renewals and the shp sc and sr programs hud uses two methods to distribute the funds to grant ees one for the esg program and another for the three remaining programs hud awards the funds allocated to the esg program through formula allocation and the shp s c and sro program funds through competitive application system for this reason the shp sc and sro programs are sometimes called the competitive homeless assistance grantshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33764crs4 table 1 funding for homeless assistance grants fy1987fy2008 in thousands fiscal yearemergency shelter grants esg

since its inception after the cdbg formula determines th amount of esg funds each state and community receives they in turn allocate the funds to local government entities and nonprofit organizations that provide services for homeless persons these recipient organizations may use funds for four main purposes the renovation major rehabilitation or conversion of buildings into emergency shelters services such as employment counseling health care and education homelessness prevention activities such as assistance with rent or utility payments and operational and administrative expenses13

competitive grants the three competitive homeless assist ance grants each perform somewhat different functions but all th ree have unified focus in that they concentrate on the longerterm needs of homeless individuals and families rather than their emergency requirements these longerterm need s include transitional housing up to 24 months permanent housing and supportiv services supportive services are designed to help homeless individuals with variety of issues that might prevent them from being able to find and ma intain permanent housing for example employment counseling health care

address the needs of homeless persons and the method through which service providers apply for hud funds41 under the coc strategy local communities establish coc advisory boards made up of representatives from local government agen cies and service providers who meet to establish local priorities and strategies to address homelessness in their communities the coc plan that results from this process is meant to contain elements that address the continuum of needs of homeless persons prevention of homelessness emergency shelter transitional housing permanent housing and supportive services provided at all stages of housing42 the coc system was created in 1993 as the innovative homeless initiatives demonstra tion program grant program that provided funding to communities so that they could become more cohesive in their approach to serving homeless people43 since then nearly every community in the country has become part of coc with approximately 468 cocs in existence as of 2008 including those in the territories44 since the fy1996 grant application process for the competitive homeless assistance grants the coc system has also been the vehicle through which local service providers apply for hud competitive grants45 the process of applying for the competitive homeless assistance grants begins at the local level when individual applicant organizations apply to their coc advisory boards to be included in unified coc application to hud for funding tinuums have flexibility in how they set up their application processes called the review and ranking process and may have written guidelines available for applicants hud requires that the process be fair and cocs must explain in their grant pplications to hud the methods they use to ensure fairness together with list of any complaints they received from applicant organizations46 applicant organizations may also address fairness and other concerns directly to hud httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33764crs12 each coc selects the homeless assist ance projects that it thinks should be funded and prioritizes them in list that is included in an overall coc application to hud the coc application packet accompanying the list has multiple parts it includes an overall coc appli cation with information about the coc structure and assessment of community needs and individual applications for each listed project that the coc recommends fo r funding continuums send the entire application packet to hud which in turn determines the projects that will be funded and how much funding each will receive note that hud determines funding at the individual project level not the coc level although hud considers factors involving the coc in making its decisions hud determination of coc pro rata need before the coc applications even arrive at hud the agency goes through process where it calculates each communitys pro rata need pro rata need is meant to represent the dollar amount that each community cities and counties needs in order to address homelessness hud determines pro rata need amount fo r each community and then adds together the individual need amounts of the communitie s within coc to arrive at pro rata need amount for the entire continuum this coc pro rata need amount is essentially the maximum amount of hud homeless assi stance grant funds for which coc can qualify pro rata need doe s not include amounts needed to renew sc contracts or amounts for new samaritan bonus or rapi d rehousing projects these two latter projects are described in the next sections of this report cocs qualify for either preliminary pro rata need pprn level or hold rmless need hhn level preliminary pro rata need to calculate preliminary pro rata need hud takes the proportion of funds each commun ity is entitled to under the esg program which uses the cdbg formula and mu ltiplies this proportion by the total amount of competitive funds available to grantees after subtracting th amount needed for sc renewals to arrive at dollar amount of pre liminary pro rata need for example if city is eligible for 008 of total esg funds and 11 billion is available for the competitive homeless assistance grants in given year the dollar amount of preliminary pro ra ta need assigned to that community is 960000 the preliminary pro rata need amount for each city and county within coc is then added together to arrive at total prelimin ary pro rata need amount for the coc hold harmless pro rata need hud applies hol d harmless level of need in cases where the total cost of cocs oneyear renewal of shp contracts exceeds the preliminary pro rata need amount in these cases an amount equal to the difference between preliminary pro rata need and the cost of shp renewals is added to preliminary pro rata need to bring the coc up to hold harmless level effectively this means that the cost of shp oneyear renewals is the hold harmless level for example continuums total cost of re newing shp contracts is 4 million but the preliminary pro rata need is only calculated to be 23 million the difference between these two amounts 17 million is dded to preliminary pr rata need 23 million to arrive at the hold harmless need level of 4 million beginning with the fy2005 grant competition cocs may choose to reallocate their hold harmless need from existing shp projects to new projects under any of the three competitive

changing the way that renewals of the competitive shp and sc contracts are treated and making changes to the factors in the cdbg formula mckinneyvento reauthorization legislation in the 110th congress two bills have been introduced in the 110th congress that would reauthorize the mckinneyvento homeless assistance gran ts in the senate the community partnership to end home lessness act s 1518 was approved by the committee on banking housing and urban affairs on september 19 2007 in the house the homeless emergency assistance and rapid transition to housing hearth act hr 840 was approved by the house financial services committee on july 31 2008 both bills would authorize the homeless assistance grants at 22 billion beginning in fy2010 under hr 840 nd fy2008 under s 1518 many of the differences between the two bills as in troduced were resolv ed when the house financial services committee marked up hr 840 this section describes the contents of the two bills after ma rkup by their

would longer have to apply for one of three grants depending on the type of housing and services they wanted to provide instead one consolidated grant would provide funds for permanent housing transitional housing supportive services and homelessness prevention activities in s 1518 the consolidated program would be re named the community homeless assistance program in hr 840 it would be called the continuum of care program both s 1518 and hr 840 would main tain some aspects of the current continuum of care applicati on system and codify the system in law under both proposals hud would review applications from collaborative applicants local entities that would determine funding priorities and jointly submit single application to hud on behalf of all local applicant organizations much like the continuum of care currently alt hough cocs submit one application hud must still review the individual project applica tions from organizations seeking funding this change from separate project applica tions to single coc application would mean the difference between hud review ing hundreds rather than thousands of applications however hr 840 nd s 1518 would also allow

at least 30 of funds not including those for permanent housing rene wals be used to provide permanent supportive housing to disabled individuals or families with an dult member who has disability this requirement would be reduced pr oportionately as communities increase permanent housing units for those individuals and families s 1518 and hr 840 would also both require that at least 10 of funds be used to provide permanent housing for families with childre n communities that are successful in reducing or eliminating homelessness through permanent housing would receive bonuses that they could use for any purpose including homelessness prevention the two bills would also institute new program that would allow certain high performing communities to have greater flexibility in the way that they use their funds to be designated highperfor ming community would have to meet requirements regarding the average length of homelessness in their communities repeat instances of homele ssness outreach activities nd effectiveness in reducing homelessness communities could then us funds for any eligible activity without regard to the bills requirements for permanent housing although both hr 840 and s 1518 would initially continue to use pro rata need to determine how funds are distri buted s 1518 would require hud to create new formula for determining need within two years after the bills enactment hud would be required to consider using the following factors in its formula the number of homeless individuals in ge ographic area housing shortages severe housing problems among extremely lowincome households and poverty rates another difference between the bills is that s 1518 would renew all permanent housing contracts through the section 8 projectbased account whereas hr 840 would make renewal th rough section 8 optional if suffi cient funds were available for yearlong renewals of all sec tion 8 projectbased contracts definition of homeless and chronically homeless both hr 840 and s 1518 would expand the definition of homeless individual in that is codified in the mckinneyvento homeless assistance act61 under current law homeless individual is defined as an individual who lacks fixed regular and adequate nighttime residence and who resides in temporary shelter including welfare hotels congregate shelter and tr ansitional housing for the mentally ill an institution with qualifications or place not signed for human habitation s 1518 would change the current defin ition of homeless individuals to include those residing in campgrounds and in tr ansitional housin g not just transitional housing for the mentally ill as in current law as well as persons living in hotels or motels paid for by govern ment entity in addition s 1518 would include

who are sharing housing due to economic hardship those living in hotels motels or campgrounds due to lack of alternative accommodations and those living in substandard housing however at markup the house financial servi ces committee dopted finition of homelessness in hr 840 similar to the definition in s 1518 person or family would be considered homeless if they are being evicted from their residence within 14 days if they are residing in hotel nd do not have the resources to stay for more than 14 days or if they are living with another family and there is credible evidence that they will not be able to stay for more than 14 days the bill would also consider homeless anyone who is fleeing situ ation of domestic violence or other lifethreatening condition in addition h r 840 would allow communities to serve families with children or unaccompanied outh who are defined as homeless under other federal programs under certain circumstances for example the education for homeless children and youth program head start nd the runaway and homeless youth program both hr 840 and s 1518 would expand the current definition of chronically homeless which is fined in regulation62 under the regulation the term currently is defined as an unaccompanied individual who has been homeless continuously for one year or on four or more occasions in th last three years and who has disability the two bills would include in the definition homeless families with an adult member who has disability in addition the finition in both hr 840 and s 1518 would include persons released from

homeless persons has been questioned two gene ral accounting office now government accountability office reports from the late 1980s noted that the cdbg formula might not be the best way to target funds to areas that most n eed homeless assistance funds75 congress too has questioned the relationship between the formula and homelessness in fy2001 the senate appropriations committee noted that

cdbg program was enacted to target funds to communities that are in need of community development it awards funds to metropolitan cities nd urban counties 70 of funds and to the states for use in areas that do not receive funds directly 30 of funds78 the cdbg formula uses combination of five factors to award f unds to recipient communities the cdbg formula uses four separate methods to aw ard funds this paper does not discuss the details of these methods the five f actors are population the number of persons in poverty housing overcrowding homes in wh ich there is more than 101 persons per room the age of housing the number of housing structures built prior to 1940 and the extent of growth lag in given comm unity the lack of population growth in community compared to the growth rate it would have had if it had grown at the rate of other communities79 the factors are measured as ratios between the recipient community and all grant recipients th cdbg formula was last changed in 1977 pl 95128 proposed changes to the cdbg formula in 2005 hud issued report that both analyzed the effectiveness of the cdbg formula in targeting communities that are in need of development and proposed alternative factors for the formula80 the hud report reviewed several shortcomings of the formula among its criticisms was that the use of the population vari able means that some fastgrowing communities with low development needs may still receive increasing cdbg grants81 another criticism was that the povert variable may provide college towns with disproportionate share of funds by counting college students as living in poverty82 third potential problem with the formula the report noted was that the age of housing and growth lag factors do not necessarily reflect communities
