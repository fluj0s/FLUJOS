president indirectly through presidential electors established by article ii section 1 clause 2 of the us constitution this electoral college system has evolved continuously since the first presidential elections despite number of close contests the electoral college system has selected the candidate with the most popular votes in 47 of 51 presidential elections since the current voting system was established by the 12th amendment in 1804 in three cases however candidates were elected who won fewer popular votes than their opponents and in fourth four candidates split the popular and electoral vote leading to selection of the president by the house of representatives these controversial elections occur because the system requires majority of electoral not popular votes to win the presidency this feature which is original to the us constitution has been the object of persistent criticism and numerous reform plans in the contemporary context proposed constitutional amendments generally fall into two basic categories those that would eliminate the electoral college and substitute direct popular election of the president and vice president and those that would retain the existing system in some form while correcting its perceived defects reform or abolition of the electoral college as an institution would require constitutional amendment so these proposals take the form of house or senate joint resolutions three relevant amendments have been introduced in the 110 th congress hjres 36 representative jesse jackson jr would provide for direct popular election requiring majority of votes for election hjres 4 the every vote counts amendment r epresentative gene green et would also provide for direct popular election but would require popular vote plurality rather than majority for election it would also confer additional powers to regulate presidential elections on the states and federal government the third sjres 39 senator bill nelson of florida would establish direct popular election as well as authorize congressional authority over certain aspects of election administration supporters of direct election advanced another option in 2006 the national popular v ote npv plan this would bypass the electoral college system through multistate compact enacted by the states relying on the states constitutional authority to appoint electors npv would commit participating states to choose electors committed to the candidates who received the most popular votes nationwide notwithstanding results within the state npv would become effective when adopted by states that together possess majority of electoral votes 270 at the present time four states with combined total of 50 electoral votes hawaii 4 illinois 21 maryland 10 and new jersey 15

elect the president and vice president of the united states under complex arrangement of constitutional provisions federal and state laws and political party practices known as the electoral college system1 despite occasional close elections this system has selected the candidate with the most popular votes in 47 of the past 51 elections since the 12th amendment was ratified in 18042 these other elections have been negatively characterized by some commentators as electoral college misfires in three instances 1876 1888 and 2000 the electoral college awarded the presidency to candida tes who won majority of electoral votes but gained fewer popular votes than their principal opponents in fourth case 1824 the house of representatives decided the contest by contingent election because candidate had an electoral vote majority3 these controversial elections occurred because the system requires majority of electoral not popular votes to win the presidency and this feature which is original to us constitution has been the object of persistent criticism and numerous reform plans the most recent instance in which the popular vote runner up received majority in the electoral college occurred in 2000 when george w bush and richard b cheney were elected over gore jr and joseph i lieberman despite having won fewer popular votes the 2000 election outcome hinged on the state of florida where popular vote totals were extremely close but uncertain after the polls closed this was due in part to confusing ballots and poorly maintained machinery in some florida counties which contributed to uncertainties over which candidate had won the popular vote various attempts to conduct recounts or ascertain individual voters intentions led to bitter and protracted struggle that continued for over month following election day supreme court decision4 ended further recounts leading to certification of bushcheney electors in florida and the republicans subsequent election following the 2000 presidential election both the electoral college system and the shortcomings of election administration procedures and voting machinery the latter two historically responsibility of state and local governments were criticized while number of constitutional amendments were proposed the 107th congress addressed the latter element of this issue with the enactment of the help america

following the presidential election of 1804 it repl aced the cumbersome dual voting system by electors that had resulted in constitutional crisis in the 1800 election the two systems are sufficiently different that 1804 may be considered fresh start for the electoral college for further information on the original constitutio nal provisions and the election of 1800 please consult crs report

rutherford b hayes was elected with slim electoral vote majority over samuel tilden who gained more popular votes and 1888 when benjamin harrison gained the presidency with comfortable electoral vote majority but fewer popular votes than incumbent president grover cleveland the election of 1824 unique in american political history saw the electoral and popular vote split among four major candidates as candidate received an electoral vote majority the house chose from among the three top candidates electing john quincy adams although andrew jackson enjoyed popular and electoral vote

state and local governments in meeting the acts goals5 the successful passage of v contrasted with the lack of legislative activity in recent congresses on proposed constitutional amendments that would eliminate or reform the electoral college system the contrast serves to highlight the comparative difficulties faced by wouldbe electoral college reformers the fundamentals of the electoral college system were established by the constitution and can only be altered by constitutional amendment much more difficult process than the passage of legislation moreover v as prospects for enactment were boosted by the fact that while few would defend the sometimes embarrassing failures in voting technology that contributed to passage of the act efforts to eliminate the electoral college would arguably be vigorously opposed in congress and the public forum by its various advocates and defenders not all approaches to electoral college reform necessarily involve action at the federal level however in 2004 for instance colorado voters rejected proposed amendment to the state constitution that would have established the proportional system one variant of electoral college

number of factors in support of their proposal at the core of their arguments they assert that the process would be simple national and democratic they assert that direct popular election would provide for single democratic choice allowing all the nations voters to choose directly the two highestranking executive branch officials in the united states government the president and vice president further the candidates who won the mo st popular votes would always win the election under some direct election proposals if presidential ticket received at least 40 of the vote the voters would then choose between the two tickets that gained the most votes in runoff election other direct election proposals would substitute election by joint session of congress for runoff if ticket received at least 40 of the vote every vote would carry the same weight in the election matter where in the nation it was cast state would be advantaged nor would any be disadvantaged direct election would eliminate the potential complications that could arise under the current system in the event of presidential candidates death between election day and the date on which electoral vote results are declared since the winning candidates would become presidentelect and vice presidentelect as soon as the popular returns were certified 7 all the various and complex mechanisms of the existing

pointing to what they assert are flaws in direct election direct election proponents claim their plan is more democratic and provides for majority rule yet most direct election proposals require that victorious candidates gain as little as 40 of the vote less than majority in order to be elected others moreover include minimum vote threshold at all these critics ask how could plurality presidents be reconciled with the requirement for strict majority rule demanded by direct elections proponents opponents maintain that direct popular election without the filtering device of the electoral college might result in political fragmentation as various elements of the political spectrum form competing parties and regionalism as candidates claiming to champion the particular interests of various parts of the country entered presidential election contests further they assert that direct electi on would foster acrimonious and protracted postelection struggles rather than eliminate them for instance as the presidential election of 2000 demonstrated close results in single state in close election are likely to be bitterly contested under direct election those favoring the electoral college argue every close election might resemble the postelection contests in 2000 not just in one state but nationwide as both parties seek to gain every possible vote such rancorous disputes could have profound negative effects on political comity in the nation and in the worst case might undermine the stability and legitimacy of the federal government to those who suggest that the struggle over floridas popular vote returns in 2000 was unique they could cite the example of ohio in 2004 where multiple legal actions were pursued even though the popular vote margin for the winning candidates exceeded 118000 9 g7g149g142g140g157g152g155g138g149g561g5g152g149g149g142g144g142g561g20g142g143g152g155g150g561 reform measures that would retain the electora l college in some form have included several variants most versions of these plans would eliminate the office of elector would award electoral votes directly to the candidates and would retain the requirement that majority of electoral votes is necessary to win the presidency in common with direct election most would also require joint tickets of presidentialvice presidential candidates practice currently provided by state law the three most popular reform proposals include 1 the automatic plan which would award electoral votes automatically and on the current winnertakeall basis in each state 2 the district plan as currently adopted in maine and nebraska which would award one electoral vote to the winning ticket in each congressional district in each state and each states two additional electoral votes awarded to the statewide popular vote winners and 3 the proportional plan which would award each states electoral votes in proportion to the percentage of the popular vote gained by each ticket more detailed

college either as presently structured or reformed offer various arguments in its defense they reject the suggestion that it is undemocratic electors are chosen by the voters in free elections and have been in nearly all instances since the first half of the 19 th century the electoral college system prescribes federal election of the president by which votes are tallied in each state the united states is federal republic in which the states have legitimate role in many areas of governance not the least of which is presidential elections the founders intended that choosing the president would be an action american voters take both as citizens of the united states and as members of their state communities while electoral vote allocation does provide the constant two or senatorial electors for each state regardless of population defenders believe this is another federal element in our constitutional system and is less justifiable than equal representation for all states in the senate moreover the same formula also assigns additional electors equal in number to each states delegation in the house of representatives further defenders reject the suggestion that less populous states like alaska delaware montana north dakota sout h dakota vermont and wyoming as well as the district of columbia each of which casts only three electoral votes are somehow advantaged when compared with california currently 55 electoral votes these 55 votes alone they note constitute more than 20 of the electoral votes needed to win the presidency thus conferring on california voters and those of other populous states voting power advantage that far outweighs the minimal arithmetical edge conferred on the smaller states 10 the electoral college system promotes political stability they argue parties and candidates must conduct ideologically broadbased campaigns throughout the nation in hopes of assembling majority of electoral votes the consequent need to forge national coalitions having wide appeal has been contributing factor in the moderation and stability of the twoparty system they find the faithless elector phenomenon to be specious argument11 only nine such electoral votes have been cast against instructions since 1820 and none has ever influenced the outcome of an election moreover nearly all electoral 10 for additional information on the

mischief by eliminating the office of elector g5g152g151g561 supporters of direct election and critics of the electoral college counter that the existing system is cumbersome potentially antidemocratic and beyond saving the following asserted failings are frequently cited the electoral college direct election supporters assert is the antithesis of their simple and democratic proposal it is they contend philosophically obsolete indirect election of the president is an 18 th century anachronism that dates from time when communications were poor the literacy rate was much lower and the nation had yet to develop the durable sophisticated and inclusive political system it now enjoys they find the 12th amendment provisions that govern cases in which candidate attains an electoral college majority contingent election to be even less democratic than the primary provisions of article ii section 112 by providing fixed number of electoral votes per state that is adjusted only after each census they maintain the electoral college does not accurately reflect state population changes in intervening elections they assert that the two constant or senatorial electors assigned to each state regardless of population give some of the nations least populous jurisdictions disproportionate advantage over more populous states from this viewpoint the office of presidential elector itself they note and the resultant faithless elector phenomenon see footnote 10 provide opportunities for political mischief and deliberate distortion of the voters choice they argue that by awarding all electoral votes in each state to the candidates who win the most popular votes in that state the winnertakeall system effectively disenfranchises everyone who voted for other candidates moreover this same arrangement is the centerpiece of one category of electoral college reform proposal the automatic plan for more on the proportional plan see the appendix to this report critics further note that although all states currently provide for choice of electors by popular vote state legislatures still retain the constitutional option of taking this decision out of the voters hands and selecting electors by some other less democratic means 13 this option was in fact discussed in florida in 2000 during the postelection recounts when some members of the legislature proposed to convene in special session and award the states electoral votes 12 for more detailed information on the contingent election process please consultcrs report rl32695 election of the president and vice president

this option demonstrates that even one of the more democratic features of the electoral college system is not guaranteed and could be changed arbitrarily by politically motivated state legislators14 finally the electoral college system has the potential to elect presidential and vice presidential candidates who obtain an electoral vote majority but fewer popular votes than their opponents as happened in 2000 1888 and 1876 while system that allows such perceived miscarriage of the popular will might have been acceptable in the 19 th century opponents maintain that it has place in the 21st

introduced in the 110 th congress hjres 4 and hjres 36 g10g495g12g495g561g20g142g156g495g561g346g561 this measure the every v ote counts amendment was introduced by representative gene green of texas on january 4 2007 representatives brian baird and william d delahunt joined as cosponsors on january 9 on february 2 it was referred to the subcommittee on the constitution civil rights and civil liberties of the house committee on the judiciary further action has been taken since that time sections 1 3 4 and 5 of the proposed amendment deal with the election process section 1 specifies election by the people of the several states and the district constituting the seat of government this provision recapitulates existing requirements of state residence or residence in the district of columbia and implicitly excludes puerto rico and us territories 15 section 3 sets plurality rather than majority requirement for election section 4 establishes in the constitution the joint candidacies currently provid ed in state law section 5 empowers congress to provide by law for 1 the death of candidates prior to election day and 2 any tie vote in presidential election the section 5 language appears to give congress broad authority in these situations arguably extending to various options in the event of the death of candidate or candidates this might include such options as rescheduling elections andor the date for casting electoral votes in the event of tie the amendment would arguably empower congress to provide for second round election to the break the deadlock or authorize congress itself to break tie it is less clear whether the amendment would make an implicit gran t of authority to congress to intervene in the process of replacing party candidates under such circumstances an eventuality that has 14 conversely the national popular vote movement examined later in this report relies on the states authority to appoint their electors as they please as the linchpin of their proposal 15 number of election proposals in recent years including hj res 36 in the 110th congress which is examined later in this report have suggested that voters in the insular areas should also have the right to vote for president and vice president based largely on the fact that they are us citizens

procedures16 if so this would constitute departure from current practice and political tradition by empowering congress to intervene in the internal workings of the political parties section 2 of the proposed amendment contains three elements relating to voter qualifications first it specifies that voters for president and vice president shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of senators and representatives this sentence builds on and explicitly extends to the presidential electorate existing constitutional voter qualifications stated in article i section 2 for the house and the 17 th amendment for the senate and as further defined and guaranteed by the 14th 15th 19th 24th and 26th amendments next if adopted it would empower the states to set less restrictive qualifications with respect to residence in contemporary practice most states have reduced voting residence requirements to an average of 30 days since the states already possess the power to reduce or eliminate these periods this section might be regarded as redundant or perhaps as providing encouragement admonishment or constitutional imprimatur to efforts to adopt shorter residency requirements for voters or to eliminate them altogether finally section 2 proposes to empower congress to establish uniform residence and age requirements here again this provision would arguably constitute mandate for potential expansion of federal control over elections v oting residence requirements as noted previously have been traditionally state responsibility but the amendment would vest in congress authority to preempt state laws in this area at least for presidential elections similarly congress would be empowered by the amendment to establish lower or higher voting age for presidential elections than is currently provided in the 24 th amendment17 criticisms of both uniform residence and age requirements might expect to be countered by the argument that federal elections are nationwide expression of the public will for which national voting requirements are fully justified section 6 of the proposed amendment sets the time wh it would come into force if ratified that is for the first presidential election that occurs one year or longer after the date on which the amendment has been declared to be ratified for instance if the amendment were successfully proposed by congress in 2008 and ratified by the states in 2009 it would be effective with the presidential election of 2012 g10g495g12g495g561g20g142g156g495g561g345g348g561 this measure was introduced by representative jesse jackson jr on february 13 2007 on march 1 the resolution was referred to the subcommittee on the constitution civil rights and civil liberties of the house committee on the judiciary further action has been taken since that time 16 for instance in 1972 senator thomas f eagleton resigned as democratic party vice presidential nominee on august 1 1972 he was replaced by r sargeant shriver whose nomination was approved by the democratic national committee as provided for in party rules on august 8 17 although hjres 4 did not specify vehicle by which congress could effect these changes legislation seems to be the likely candidate since the amendment referred explicitly to presidential elections only further constitutional amendment would probably be required if these provisions had applied to other elections as well such as those for state and local elected officials httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34604g7g149g142g140g157g152g155g138g149g561g5g152g149g149g142g144g142g561g20g142g143g152g155g150g561 g561

the president and vice president by the citizens of the united states citizens without regard to whether the citizens are residents of state the meaning of this language may be open to differing interpretations for instance it would likely be interpreted as empowering citizens registered in puerto rico or us territories to vote for president it might however also be considered to require state and local authorities to permit any citizen to vote in presidential election without regard to existing residence or voter registration arrangements if so this could lead to complications in vote counting and registry and increased costs for local authorities they might arguably feel constrained to institute one ballot for the presidential vote and separate one for down ballot elections in order to ensure that only voters who are registered in the jurisdiction cast votes for state and local office here again however the argument may be made that election of the president and vice president is of such profound national importance it must transcend the convenience of state and local governments section 2 of hjres 36 declares that the persons having the greatest number of votes shall be elected so long as such persons have majority of the votes cast this provision of the proposed amendment differs from most direct election pr oposals which more commonly establish 40 plurality or simple plurality to elect more problematic however is the fact that while it establishes majority requirement hjres 36 does not incorporate any procedures for elections in which candidate wins majority 18 since popular vote plurality elections occur with some regularity this omission could be remedied in committee and might include such procedures as runoff election or election by congress under such circumstances an additional option would be to empower congress to provide by legislation for such events leaving selection of the vehicle to the judgment of the legislature g21g495g12g495g20g142g156g495g561g345g351g561 this measure was introduced by senator bill nelson of florida on june 6 2008 it was referred to the senate committee on the judiciary the same day further action has been taken on it since that time section 1 of this proposed amendment to the constitution would establish direct election of the president and vice president unlike some other direct election proposals it would not require majority or plurality threshold of popular votes to elect but the attainment of some level of plurality in order to win the presidency is common sense inference major change proposed by the measure is that section 1 would also extend participation in presidential elections beyond the states and the district of columbia to the territories of the united states this expansion could arguably be justified on the grounds that inhabitants of most us territories are citizens and therefore deserve the right to vote supporters might suggest this to be the further and logical extension of the right to vote for president in the same tradition as the 23 rd amendment which granted this right to residents of the district of columbia prior to the amendments ratification in 1961 inhabitants of washington d c had much in common with 18 such elections occur with relative frequency for instance candidate received majority of the popular vote in five of the last 12 presidential elections 1960 1968 1992 1996 and 2000 richard m scammon alice v mcgillivray and rhodes cook america votes 26 washington cq press 2006 pp 834

us citizens who did not reside in state and could not vote for president and vice president opponents might point out that while the territories are us possessions and that many of their inhabitants are citizens they are not states and as group are unlikely to be admitted to the union at the near future this amendment they might argue would violate the principles of federalism and devalue the institution of statehood nor they might add is the situation analogous to that of the district of columbia which was part of the nation since independence by comparison the territories and other us dependencies were largely acquired in the late 19 th and early 20th centuries generally by treaty or purchase moreover they might add in the case of american samoa its inhabitants are not us citizens but rather american nationals additional questions might be raised as to the precise status of certain entities under us jurisdiction whose political status remains arguably indefinite and anomalous section 2 of the proposed amendment would expand congressional authority over the presidential election process in several respects first it would empower congress to determine the time place and manner of holding the election this extends the existing grant of authority over congressional elections provided in article i section 4 clause 1 of the constitution this section would also authorize congress to determine ent itlement to inclusion on the ballot this language would potentially supercede existing arrangements on ballot placement and status which have traditionally been state responsibility section 2 concludes by proposing further extension of congressional authority to the manner in which the results of the election shall be ascertained and declared supporters of these elements of section 2 might argue that they are necessary to ensure that presidential elections are administered fairly and equitably with respect to ballot access they might assert that existing state requirements are excessive and deliberately stringent that they simultaneously guarantee ballot placement for the two major parties and impede access by new parties and independent candidates similarly th ey might suggest that congressional power over vote counting and election ascertainment would guarantee uniform and efficient national standards for election administration eliminating patchwork of existing state requirements and providing stronger deterrence to potential vote fraud opponents might assert that these grants of authority if embodied in legislation would be usurpation of functions long performed at the state level such legislation would they might assert constitute further infringement on state authority and could lead to duplicative and needlessly complex election administration systems as state authorities tried to reconcile competing and possibly conflicting state and federal procedures they might further assert that legislation stemming from the provisions of section 2 would impose heavy costs on the states as they seek to meet federal requirements it could be noted however that precedent exists for federal assistance in this area congress has provided grants financial to the states to help them meet new voting systems standards mandated in the help america v ote act v pl 107252 116 stat 1666 19 opponents might note in rebuttal that v grants are expected to be temporary expedient they might further questi on the willingness of congress and the federal government to assume permanent responsibility for and the increased expenses associated with greater control over these aspects of the presidential election administration process 19 for additional information on hava please consult crs report rl32685 election reform the help america vote act

the fundamental arrangements of the electoral college some elements of the system could be changed by measures adopted in the states as noted previously the constitution gives the states plenary power in the ways they choose to pick presidential electors the language in article ii section 1 clause 2 is notably broad and general each state shall appoint in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct number of electors equal to the whole number of senators to which the state may be entitled in congress this breadth of authority was intended by the founders who sought to provide considerable discretion to the several states as to how they would choose and allocate presidential electors 20 in other words the states are free to experiment with systems of elector selection and electoral vote and allocation up to point indeed it may be argued that with such experiments the states fulfill their traditional role as laboratories in which potential national policy initiatives can be developed and tested this report has previously identified several areas in which the states have exercised their prerogative in the past first all 50 states and the district of columbia dc currently provide for joint tickets in which the public casts single vote for electors pledged to single pair of candidates next the states and dc provide for popular election of presidential electors finally in all but two jurisdictions maine and nebraska 21 the electors are chosen bloc under the general ticket system that is the group or ticket electors pledged to the candidates who win plurality of popular votes in the state are elected as group three recent efforts to effect change by using the power accorded to stat in article ii section 1 clause 2 are discussed below

dominant today although the plan is examined in greater detail in the appendix briefly it would require electors and electoral votes to be allocated in each state according to the percentage of popular votes won by the competing candidates for example assume state x is allocated 10 electoral votes next assume in the election candidate a22 receives 60 of the popular vote candidate b receives 30 and candidate c representing third party or independent candidacy receives 10 under the winnertakeall plan candidate would win all 10 electoral votes under the proportional plan 20 this power is not however absolute federal court decisions have struck down state laws concerning appointment of electors that were found to be in violation of the 14th amendments guarantee of equal protection for

three and candidate c would receive one vote on november 2 2004 colorado voters considered proposed state constitutional amendment23 that would have established just such proportional system in that state if the amendment had passed and survived legal challenges it would have provided proportional allocation of colorados presidential electors for 2004 and all future presidential elections this was possible through citizen action because colorado is one of the 18 states that provide for the proposal and approval of amendments to their state constitutions by popular vote 24 the amendment sought to allocate electoral votes and electors based on the proportional share of the total statewide popular vote cast for each presidential ticket the percentage of the vote each ticket received would have been multiplied by colorados total of nine electoral votes these figures would then have been rounded up or down to the nearest whole number of electors and electoral votes but any ticket that did not receive at least one electoral vote under this method would have been eliminated from the total if th sum of whole electoral votes derived from this computation were to be greater than nine then the ticket receiving at least one whole electoral vote but fewest popular votes would have had its electoral vote total reduced by one this process would have continued until the computed allocation of votes reached nine conversely if the sum of whole electoral votes awarded after rounding the percentages of popular votes were less than nine then such additional electoral votes as necessary to bring the number up to nine would have been allocated to the ticket receiving the most popular votes until all nine electoral votes were so allocated in the event of popular and electoral vote allocation tie ie candidates and b each receiving 45 electoral votes then the colorado secretary of state would have determined by lot who would receive the evenly split electoral vote 25 at the time questions were raised as to whether this effort to change the allocation formula for colorados electoral votes by initiative was constitutional specifically the us constitution in article ii section 1 clause 2 provides that each state shall appoint in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct number of electo rs equal to the whole number of senators and representatives to which the state may be entitled in the congress since the early years of government under the constitution the state legislatures have generally exercised this grant of power by authorizing the voters to choose electors and they have usually specified the winner takeall or general ticket system as the means by which the voters decision is used to allocate electors and electoral votes the fact that colorados proposed amendment 36 would have altered the formula for awarding electoral votes by vote of the people not the legislature was the salient issue in contention the colorado legislatures right under article ii to establish proportional system was not in dispute the question rather was did the colorado legislature have authority to subdelegate its article ii powers to determine and change the existing method of appointing electors to popular vote could the voters of colorado have acted in place of or as the state legislature the colorado constitution specifically empowers the people of the state to to propose laws and amendments to 23 amendment 36 24 for detailed information on ballot placement requirements in colorado please consult council of state governments the book

independent of the general assembly 26 proponents of amendment 36 argued that this was sufficient authority to change the allocation of electoral votes by popular vote further it could have been argued that the us constitutions failure to expressly prohibit this procedure or others like it provides an implicit endorsement of such actions on the other hand opponents could have counterargued that the us constitution clearly delegates this power to the state legislatures and only the state legislatures 27 moreover commentary on the colorado process of amendment by initiative noted that an amendment is not valid just because the people voted for it the initiative gives the people of state power to adopt constitutional amendment which violates the federal constitution28 on august 13 2004 colorados secretary of state announced that the proposed amendment had gained sufficient voter signatures to qualify for inclusion on the ballot at the november 2 general election29 after spirited campaign that stirred some national interest amendment 36 was ultimately defeated by vote of 1307000 to 69700030 for the record if the amendment had been in effect for the 2004 election the bushcheney ticket would have received five electoral votes while kerryedwards would have receiv ed four under the winnertakeall system the republican ticket received all nine colorado electoral votes

representation filed legislative ballot measure with the california attorney general the proposed statute the presidential election reform act incorporated standard district system for choosing presidential electors and hence awarding electoral votes32 the organizers sought sufficient voter petitions to place the item on statewide ballot at the june 3 2008 california congressional state and local primary supporters of the proposal asserted that the winnertakeallgeneral ticket system discounted and disenfranchised millions of california voters in the presidential election for instance in 2004 the democratic kerryedwards ticket received 543 of the popular vote and all 55 electoral votes while the republican bushcheney ticket which received 444 of the popular vote gained none33 if on the other hand the district system had been in place in california in 2004 kerryedwards would have received 33 electoral votes and bushcheney 2234 opponents claimed that californians for equal representation was republicandominated group whose goal was to obtain republican electors in state that has voted democratic in presidential contests since 1992 noting in support of this argument that most of the groups funds had been contributed by republicanconnected donors 35 california counts the advocacy group coordinating support for the measure denied the allegation and countered by releasing lists of democratic and independent voters who contributed to the effort36 the proposed measure was also criticized on constitutional grounds vik amar legal commentator argued that the california presidential election reform act was legislative initiative that would likely be found unconstitutional if challenged he based his assertion on the argument noted previously in discussions of colorado amendment 36 that the constitutional grant of power to the states to appoint electors in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct ought to be narrowly construed by this reasoning legislative act passed by initiative would not meet the constitutional standard because the constitution requires action by the state legislature and only the legislature to change the process37 the proposed california presidential election reform act thus became an object of political and constitutional controversy almost from the start in addition proponents faced the obstacle of collecting supporting petitions from number of registered voters sufficient to meet the california state initiative threshold which required signatures of number of voters equal to 5 32 californians for equal

number of states whose total electoral votes equal or exceed 270 the current majority required to elect under the constitution in the event the national popular vote were tied the states would be released from their commitment under the compact and would choose electors who represented the presidential ticket that gained the most votes in each particular state states would retain the right to withdraw from the compact but if state chose to withdraw within six months of the end of presidential term the withdrawal woul d not be effective until after the succeeding president and vice

the npv compact to be honored by participating states it appears unlikely however that supporters of the measure will reach this optimistic goal this year gauging the plans longterm prospects it is apparent that npv has had relatively successful year in the state legislatures what remains to be seen is whether state approvals earlier in 2008 indicated the beginning of trend toward approval or high water mark for the effort it should be noted that the measure has been vetoed by the governors of rhode island and vermont and is pending in california where governor schwarzenegger vetoed an

of and opposition to the national popular v ote proposal embrace points generally similar to the pros and cons for direct popular election examined earlier in this report in most plans to establish direct election of the president the central issue is question of one big thing versus many thingsthat is the simplicity logic and democratic attractiveness of the direct election idea as compared to the more complex array of related but arguably less compelling factors cited by supporters of the existing system 51 the national popular v ote movement advocates the npv compact on the grounds of fairness and respect for the freely expressed voice of the voters which is the cornerstone of all direct popular election plans in particular it advocates national vote that facto eliminates the role of states by binding them to support the nationwide vote winners notwithstanding the results in their own jurisdictions according to its own website the ce ntral argument in its favor is that the compact would guarantee the presidency to the candidate who receives the most popular votes in all 50 states and the district of columbia52 it would guarantee at least plurality president and vice president thus eliminating any possibility of presidents who won fewer votes than their opponent one of the most widely criticized aspects of the electoral college system it would also reduce the likelihood of other problem areas under the existing system including the faithless elector disenfranchisement under the winnertakeall system arithmetical advantage derived by less populous states and the potential for contingent election under the 12th amendment53 it is difficult to underestimate the appeal of this simple yet arguably compelling proposal the candidates who win the most votes should win the presidency and vice presidency opponents by comparison have cited many of the assertions examined in the procon section of this report these may be categorized as philosophical and political criticisms of the npv plan generally they do not deny the appeal of the argument favoring direct popular election and the npv plan they suggest however that the various benefits conferred by the electoral college 51 the fox knows many things but the hedgehog knows one big thing this quotation of the greek poet archilochus by sir isaiah berlin in his essay the hedgehog and the fox has come to be widely applied to the comparative ways of knowingthe comprehension of single overarching principle or fact versus that of detailed and interconnected array of related facts ideas and principles

outweigh the one big thing attractiveness of npv among these are assertions that the current arrangement is fundamental component of federalism it confers voting power not on less populous states but on residents of more populous states and in particular minority voters in these states it promotes moderate and geographically inclusive twoparty system and it deters postelection strife and controversy by magnifying the winners electoral vote margin in most elections54 further philosophical criticism rests on the grounds of the concurrent majorities tradition this concept holds that in order for any policy proposal to be able to claim legitimacy in continentspanning federal republic such as the united states it needs to gain broad acceptance by majority of citizens representing wide range of geographic regions within limited period of time this concept has never been written into law or the constitution but congress has historically honored the concurrent majorities idea by requiring that most constitutional amendments be approved by the states within sevenyear period following an amendments proposal by congress where critics may ask is similar time limit governing the national popular v ote proposal what is the date certain after which an effort to adopt npv would expire or return to square one 55 if the npv approaches its own benchmark of 270 electoral votes on or before july 20 of presidential election year the trigger date set by the proposed compact what sort of disruptive effect would this have on the presidential nominating campaign or for that matter on the measured deliberations of the legislatures of states that have rejected the npv compact or those in which pro npv legislation was never introduced npv supporters have also suggested practical benefit to nearly all non battleground states from the compact they maintain that presidential nominees and their organizations would spread their presence and resources more evenly as they campaigned for every vote nationwide rather than concentrate on winning key states candidates have reason to poll visit advertise organize campaign or worry about the concerns of voters of states that they cannot possibly win or lose this means that voters in two thirds of the states are effectively disenfranchised in presidential elections because candidates concentrate their attention on small handful of battleground states in 2004 candidates concentrated over twothirds of their money and campaign visits in just five states over 80 in nine states and over 99 of their money in just 16 states 56 for

spending because even though it controls the largest number of electoral votes the golden state has been regarded in recent elections as being reliably democratic in its presidential sympathies similar arguments would apply to texas state that has voted for republican presidential nominees since 1980 opponents might argue that spreading campaign spending resources in states that arent battlegrounds is questionable goal with which to justify such profound change in the presidential election process campaign appearances spending by campaign organizations and collateral spending generated by the attendant media they might continue were never intended to be local economic stimulus package nor are the amounts in question sufficient to make much of difference in any state with the poss ible exception of sparselypopulated new hampshire during its quadrennial primary campaign moreover they might continue it is equally dubious to assert that nominees will slight the concerns of citizens of the states from which they draw their greatest support or that concentrated campaigning in the battleground states somehow disenfranchises voters in others writing in the wall street

would lead to geographically narrower campaigns for election efforts would be largely urban rural states like maine with its 74000 votes in 2004 wouldnt matter much compared with new yorks 74 million

objections to the national popular v ote plan have also been raised on constitutional grounds one observer derek t muller writing in election law journal asserts first that npv is an interstate compact within the meaning of the constitution and as such it must be approved by congress before it could take effect 58 the author reviews the history of interstate compacts and their interpretation over the past two centuries noting that under the current interpretation certain types of interstate agreements or compacts do not require the explicit consent of congress these may be entered without the consent of congress because they do not affect national sovereignty or concern the core meaning of the compact clause 59 they are in effect not compacts in the constitutional sense he goes on to assert that the national popular v ote agreement is however an interstate compact that would require explicit congressional approval because of the ways it binds the states to particular course of action places time limits on their ability to withdraw from npv and more generally meets or exceeds conditions historically found to define interstate compacts by the supreme and other us courts 60 57

inherently unconstitutional unless specifically approved by congress reviewing the record of federal court decisions concerning interstate compacts the author asserts that th npv compact would enhance the political power of participating states but reduce that of those that did not join the compact states have an interest in appointing their electors as they see fit and the presidential electors clause of the constitution grants this exclusive authority to the states technically the noncompacting sister states can still appoint electors but the interstate compact makes such an appointment meaningless the outcome of the electoral college would be determined by an arranged collective agreement among compacting states regardless of what noncompacting states do about it this evisceration of political effectiveness is sufficient interest to invoke the constitutional safeguard of congressional consent 61 the national popular v ote movement agrees with mr mullers thesis as to whether npv is an interstate compact in every vote equal the movements major written source concludes the subject matter of the proposed agreement among the states to elect the president by national popular vote concerns the manner of appointment of states presidential electors the us constitution gives each state the power to select the manner of appointing its presidential electors thus the subject matter of the proposed interstate compact is state power and an appropriate subject for an interstate compact 62 contrary to mr muller however every vote equal maintains that the constitution implicitly permits valid interstate agreements without the need for congressional approval on any subject that falls within the states constitutional authority63 the authors further note that since the npv compact would concern the manner of appointment of states electors power that resides exclusively with the states the agreement would therefore be an appropriate subject for an interstate compact 64 they go on to assert that the supreme court has twice rejected the argument that an interstate compact was unconstitutional because it impaired the sovereign rights of non member states or enhanced the political power of the member states at the expense of other states as has been asserted by npv opponents65 other questions have been raised concerning whether the national popular v ote compact might violate the v oting rights act66 writing in columbia law review david gringer maintains that npv may be at variance with several provisions of the act specifically he argues that the plan conflicts with section 2 of the act because moving from statebased to national popular vote dilutes the voting strength of given states minority population by reducing its ability to influence the outcome of presidential elections67 gringer also asserts that the npv compact may 61 muller the compact clause and the national popular vote interstate compact p 391 62 john r koza barry fadem et

the problematic 2000 presidential election the trend has continued only two relevant amendments have been introduced thus far in the 110th congress this arguable lack of congressional interest and demonstrable lack of legislative activity contrast strongly with the period between 1950 and 1979 when electoral college reform measures were regularly considered in the senate and house judiciary committees and proposed amendments were debated in the full senate on five occasions and in the house twice 71 from those proposals that have been offered two trends are noticeable to the long term observer first the volume of proposed amendments that would reform the electoral college as opposed to those that would eliminate the electoral college and substitute direct popular election has declined almost to zero second the scope of proposed direct popular election amendments is arguably evolving in complexity and detail it is unclear whether the first development reflects decline in support for the electoral college either as it exists or reformed lack of organized interest in these reform proposals or simply 68 covered jurisdictions were defined in the act as effectively those in which there was evidence of discrimination against minority voting rights in the years prior to passage of the original voting rights act in 1965 they include eight states and local jurisdictions

inclined to support or defend the current system in some form it is likely that if direct election amendment gained broad congressional support and began moving toward congressional approval and proposal to the states members who support the current system in some form would coalesce to defend the electoral college alternatively they might be spurred by the prospect of action to propose reform measures that would address problem areas of the current system this was the case the last time direct election amendment came to the floor in the senate during the 95 th congress 1979 198072 another apparent trend is that recent reform proposals go beyond the concept of simply substituting direct election for the electoral colleg in recent congresses these amendments have been more likely to include provisions that would enhance and extend the power of the federal government to legislate in such areas as residence standards definition of citizenship national voter registration inclusion of us territories and associated areas in the presidential election process establishment of an election day holiday ballot access standards for parties and candidates etc 73 this trend it may be posited reflects frustration on the part of many voters and their elected representatives over the uncertainties and inconsistencies in local election administration procedures that were revealed in the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections if the amendments in which such provisions have been incorporated were to be proposed and ratified they could be used to set broad national election standards provided congress chose to exercise the new authority granted in these proposals which would supersede many current state practices and requirements this eventuality raises two possible issues the first is the question of whether such federal involvement in traditionally state and local practices would impose additional costs on state and local governments and thus be regarded as an unfunded mandate indeed bills that had the effect of imposing cost on state and local election authorities might be subject to points of order on the floor of both the house and senate 74 one response by the state and local governments might be to call for federal funding to meet the increased expenses imposed on them by federal requirements precedent for this exists in the gr ant program incorporated in the help american vote act va75 second issue is related to the consequences of such an amendment and centers on perceptions as to whether it might be regarded as constitutionally dubious federal intrusion into state and local responsibilities for instance more farreachin g scenario might include the gradual assumption of the entire election administration structure by the federal government in this hypothetical case questions could be raised as to 1 the costs involved 2 whether national election administration system could efficiently manage all the varying nuances of state and local conditions and 3 what would be the long term implications for federalism conversely it could be asserted that national election administration structure is appropriate for national elections and that state or local concerns are counterbalanced by the urgent requirement that every citizen be enabled and encouraged to vote and that every vote should be

action of the electoral college in 2000 in which george w bush was elected with small majority of electoral votes but fewer popular votes than gore jr would lead to serious consideration of proposals to reform or eliminate the electoral college notwithstanding these circumstances none of the proposals introduced in either the 107th through 110th congresses received more than routine committee referral to date in the 107th congress attention focused on proposals for election administration reform resulting in passage of the help america v ote act v in 2002 as noted previously this legislation substantially expanded the role of the federal government in the field of voting systems and election technology through the establishment of national standards in these areas and the provision of federal assistance to the states to improve their registration and voting procedures and systems76 the congressional response to the 2000 election controversy wa s incremental rather than fundamental other factors may also contribute to the endurance of the electoral college system perhaps foremost is the fact that the us constitution is not easily amended stringent requirements for proposed amendments including passage by twothirds vote in each chamber of congress and approval by threefourths of the states generally within sevenyear time frame have meant that successful amendments are usually the products of broad national consensus sense that certain reform is urgently required or active longterm support by congressional leadership 77 in many cases all three aforementioned factors contributed to the success of an amendment78 further while the electoral college has always had critics its supporters can note that it has selected the peoples choice in 47 of 51 presidential elections held since ratification of the 12th amendment rate of 92279 in the final analysis given the high hurdlesboth constitutional and politicalfaced by any proposed amendment it seems unlikely that the electoral college system will be replaced or reformed by constitutional amendment unless or until its alleged failings become so compelling that large concurrent majorities in congress the states and among the public are disposed to undertake its reform or abolition the presidential election of 2008 may prove to be bellwether on the future of electoral college reform in congress if the election produces cl ear majority in both electoral and popular votes 76 for additional information on the help america vote act pleasecrs report rl32685 election reform the help america vote act and issues for congress by eric fischer and kevin j coleman 77 article v of the constitution also provides for amendment by convention which would assemble on the application of the legislatures of twothirds of the states any amendments proposed by such convention would also require approval of threefourths of the states this alternative method however has never been used 78 these conditions have been met in some cases only after long period of national debate for example the 19th amendment which extended the right to vote to women was the culmination of decades of discussion and popular agitation in other instances amendments have been proposed and ratified in the wake of sudden galvanizing event or series of events an example of this may be found in the 25 th amendment providing for presidential succession and disability which received widespread national support followi ng the 1963 assassination of president john f kennedy 79 the exceptions as noted earlier were the elections of 1876 1888 and 2000 when candidates were elected who had majority of electoral votes but fewer popular votes than their major opponents the one case in which the electoral vote was hopelessly fragmented among four candidates occurred in 1824 when contingent election resolved the electoral college deadlock even in this case the president john quincy adams was able to govern successfully despite criticism that he was selected in the house of representatives

has enshrined the role of the states as laboratories of reform in which innovative policy experiments could be tested on limited scale and if successful ultimately adopted at the federal level in the question of electoral college reform at least some of the states appear to have assumed their classic role by implementing policy alternatives maine and nebraska for instance have followed the district system for decades regrettably perhaps from the laboratory standpoint neither state has yet split its electoral vote by congressional district arguably the most compelling recent developments in the field of electoral college reform have emerged at the state level two of these colorado amendment 36 in 2004 and california counts in 20062007 were unsuccessful but both aroused interest and support and criticism for their attempts to reform the electoral college within the two respective states perhaps more noteworthy or at least better publicized has been the national popular v ote campaign well organized nationwide initiative that has drawn bipartisan support from wide range of state and local office holders moreover its advisory board includes seven former us senators and representatives representing both parties as noted earlier in this report the legislatures of four states disposing total of 50 electoral votes have approved the npv compact to date with final action pending in one more although many state legislative sessions for 2008 have ended at the time of this writing action remains theoretically possible in california maine north carolina rhode island and washington whose formal ag reement to the compact would provide an additional 88 electoral votes to the tally of participating states it is difficult to foresee the ultimate course of the npv movement at the time of this writing its future like that of constitutional reform arguably depends on the results of the 2008 presidential election as noted earlier in this report clearcut decision in 2008 resulting in the election of president and vice president who clearly are the peoples choice might lead to loss of momentum by the national popular v ote scheme without compelling reason to proceed the effort might stall on the other hand if 2008 produces closely contested electionin either the electoral or popular vote or bothor if it pr oduces second nonplurality president in eight years then it is much more likely that the npv movement would be energized and gain additional accessions in the 2009 state legislative sessions indeed problem election might stimulate surge of action as state legislatures seek to approve the compact leading to an atmosphere not unlike the competition to hold the earliest presidential primaries and caucuses it is also possible under these circumstances that congress could simultaneously pursue constitutional reform of the electoral college system with renewed interest and energy thus overshadowing the npv campaign in these circumstances supporters might continue to argue in favor of npv on the grounds that it could achieve the desired resultsdirect election of the president and vice presidentsooner than would be possible under constitutional amendment provided it survived any challenges to its legality or constitutionality

against proposals to establish district plan variant in place of the current then and now general ticket or winnertakeall system of allocating electoral votes in the course of senate floor debate on this question in 1956 he paraphrased comment by viscount falkland 17th century english statesman declaring of the electoral college it seems to that falklands definition of conservatism is quite appropriate in this instancewhen it is not necessary to change it is necessary not to change 80 this aphorism may offer key to the future prospects of the electoral college to date policymakers have generally concluded that it has not been necessary to change the existing system or perhaps more accurately there has been compelling call for change the first and only major constitutional overhaul of the electoral college system to date the 12th amendment was direct response to turmoil accompanying the presidential election of 1800 this was fundamental crisis of regime that once surmounted motivated congress to propose major reform in very short time as long as the electoral college system functions well enough to avoid provoking national crisis of similar scale it may remain unchanged

detailed descriptions of the three most frequently proposed plans to reform the electoral college one criticism leveled at each of the electoral college reform plans reviewed below is that the decennial reassignment of electoral votes provides for adjustment in electoral votes to would reflect variations in population growth among states between censuses for instance the allocation of electoral votes following the 2010 census will remain in effect for the 2012 2016 and 2020 presidential election g22g145g142g561g3g158g157g152g150g138g157g146g140g561g18g149g138g151g561 this reform proposal would award all electoral votes in each state directly to the winning candidates who obtained the most votes statewide in almost all versions plurality would be sufficient in individual states to win the states electoral votes most versions provide for some form of contingent election in congress in the event candidate wins nationwide majority of electoral votes this alternative would constitutionally mandate the general ticket or winner takeall system currently used to award electoral votes in 48 states and the district of columbia proponents of the automatic plan argue that it would maintain the present electoral college systems balance between federal and state power and between large and small states proponents note that the automatic plan would eliminate the possibility of faithless electors 81 further the automatic plan would help preserve the present twoparty system under statebystate winner takeall method of allocating electoral votes this they assert is strength of the existing arrangement because it tends to reward parties that incorporate broad range of viewpoints and embrace large areas of the nation opponents on the other hand note presidential elections are still indirect under the automatic system they further assert that minority 82 presidents could still be elected under the automatic system and it still provides electoral vote recognition of the views and opinions of voters who choose the losing candidates g22g145g142g561g6g146g156g157g155g146g140g157g561g18g149g138g151g561 this reform proposal would continue the current allocation of electoral votes by state and in common with most reform plans would eliminate the office of presidential elector it would 81 faithless electors are those who vote for candidate other than the one to whom they are pledged for instance in 2000 district of columbia democratic elector pledged to the gorelieberman ticket cast blank ballot as protest against the election results in general in 1988 west virginia democratic elector reversed the order of candidates voting for lloyd bentsen for president and michael dukakis for vice president 82 presidents and vice presidents elected with an electoral vote majority but fewer popular votes than their major opponents

congressional district or other ad hoc presidential election district of each state two electoral votes reflecting the two additional constant or senatorial electoral votes assigned to each state by the constitution would be awarded to the statewide vote winners this alternative would constitutionally mandate the system currently used to award electoral votes in maine and nebraska83 proponents of the district plan argue that it would more accurately reflect the popular vote results for presidential and vice presidential candidates than the winner takeall method or the automatic plan because by allocating electoral votes according to popular vote results in congressional districts it would take into account political differences within states84 they also suggest that in states dominated by one party the district plan might provide an incentive for greater voter involvement and party vitality because it would be possible for the less dominant party to win electoral votes in districts where it enjoys higher level of support eg upstate new york versus the new york city metropolitan area or northern california vs the angeles and san francisco metropolitan areas opponents would note that the district plan retains indirect election of the nations chief executive that the potential for minority presidents would continue and that it might actually weaken the twoparty system by encouraging pa rties that promote narrow geographical or ideological interests and that may be concentrated in certain areas in fact they might suggest that adoption of the district plan would encourage gerrymandering as the parties maneuvered for advantage in presidential elections nebraska split its district votes presidential election for the first time in the 2008 awarding four electors to republican candidate senator john mc cain who won two congressional districts and the statewide vote and one to the democratic nominee senator barack obama who received the most popular votes in states second congressional district 85 maine has yet to split its electoral votes under the district plan 83 the district plan is permissible state option under the constitution which does not specify any particular method for awarding electoral votes in fact the district plan was widely used in the 19th century 84 the question of what districts would be used under district plan has been considered over time the use of either ad hoc presidential election districts or existing congressional districts could be mandated or states could be offered the option of using either method the ad hoc district variant of the district plan would empower the states to create special presidential election districts one for every seat the state holds in the house of representatives while rewarding the two senatorial electors to the statewide vote winner further variation might be to eliminate the senatorial electors and establish number of presidential election districts equal to the total senate and house delegations in each state any such districts would undoubtedly need to conform to existing supreme court mandates that they be as equal in population as possible in order to assure that the doctrine of one person one vote is observed the minimal population differences between congressional districts and the fact they are already in existence might argue for their use on the other hand in contemporary practice congressional districts do not always follow the boundaries of existing political subdivisions recognized regions or less formal communities thus vitiating one of the arguments in favor of the district system that it takes into effect the different political leanings of different parts of state these options might open an opportunity for experiment on the states as laboratories for the nation model 85 robin tyvser obama wins electoral vote in nebraska omaha worldherald november 8 2008 available at httpwwwomahacomindexphpu_page2835u_sid10481441

popular vote gained by each ticket some versions known as strict proportional plans would award electoral votes in proportions as small as thousandths of one vote that is to the third decimal point while others known as r ounded proportional plans would use various methods of rounding to award only whole numbers of electoral votes to competing candidates as noted in the main body of this report voters in colorado rejected proposed state constitutional amendment amendment 36 at the november 2 2004 general election that would have established rounded proportional system in that state86 for further information on this proposal please consult crs report rl32611 the electoral college how it works in contemporary presidential elections by thomas h neale proponents of the proportional plan argue that it comes closer than other reform plans to electing the president and vice president by popular vote while still preserving the state role in presidential elections they also assert that the proportional plan reduces the likelihood of minority presidentsthose who win with majority of electoral votes but fewer popular votes than their chief opponent they also suggest that this option would more fairly account for public preferences by allocating electoral votes within th states to reflect the actual support attained by various candidates particularly in the strict as opposed to rounded version of the proportional plan while still retaining the role of the states opponents again suggest that it retains indirect election of the president which they assert is inherently less democratic than direct popular election they also note that the proportional plan could still result in minority presidents and vice presidents and by eliminating the magnifier effect of the automatic and district plans might actually result in more frequent electoral college deadlocks situations in which candidate receives the requisite majority of electoral votes

constitution does not currently provide for fractions or parts of electoral votes so strict proportional system would require constitutional amendment since rounded proportional plan or system would award whole electoral votes it is currently permissible state option under the constitution
