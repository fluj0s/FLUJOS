restrictions on lobbying by certain nonprofit organizations as well as general public disclosure and reporting requirements rela tive to lobbying activities of most organizations there are in fact several overlapping laws rules and regulations which may apply to various nonprofits which engage in lobbying activities in some instances the rules and restrictions that apply may be determined by the section of the internal revenue code under which an organization hol ds its taxexempt status in other instances certain rules and regulations ma apply depending on th type of nonprofit organization and whether it receives fede ral grants loans or awards finally organizations depending on the amount and ty pe of lobbying in which they engage may be required to file pub lic registration and disclosu re reports under the federal lobbying disclosure act of 1995 as amende d it should be emphasized that the definitions of the rms lobbying or advo cacy and which pa rticular

charities are generally restricted from lobbying in practical sense by tax provisions which penalize expenditures by the private foundati on for most forms of lobbying activities although the law expressly exempts from the definition of lobbying such activities as issuing nonpartisan analysis study or research and engaging in socalled selfdefense lobbying12 private foundations differ from

internal revenue code this provision which is commonly called the simpson amendment prohibits section 501c4 civic leagues and social welfare organizations from engaging in any lobbying activities even with their own private funds if the organization receives any federal grant loan or award15 the restrictions of the simpson ame ndment originally c overed all 501c4 organizations which received federal monies by way of an award grant contract loan or any other form16 the term contract howev er was subsequently removed from the provision by pl 10499 section 129 leaving the prohibition on lobbying activities with an organizati ons own funds as condition to the receipt of federal moneys only upon 501c4 grantees and those seeking an award or loan but allowing unlimited lobbying activities with organizational f unds for 501c4 contractors of the federal government the simpson amendment now reads an organization described in section 501c4 of the internal revenue code of 1986 which engages in lobbyin g activities shall not be eligible for the r eceipt of federal funds constituting an award grant or loan the legislative history of the provisi on clearly indicates that 501c4 organization may separately incorporate an affiliate d 501c4 which would not receive any federal funds and whic h could engage in unlimited lobbying17 the method of separately in corporating an affilia to lobby or to receive and administer federal grants which was described by the amendment s sponsor as splitting was apparently intended to place degree of paration between federal grant money

into tw separate 501c4s they could have one organization which could both receive funds and lobby without limits19 it may also be noted that while 501c 4s which receive certain federal funds may not engage in lobbying activities the term lobbying activities as used in the simpson amendment prohibition in secti on 18 of the lobbying disclosure act is defined in section 3 of that legislation to include only direct lobbying contacts and efforts in support of such contacts such as preparation planning research and other background work intended for us in such direct contacts20 lobbying contact under the lobbying disclosure act is an oral or written communication including an electronic communication to covered executive branch official or covered legislative branch official which concerns the formulation modi fication or adoption of legislation rules regula tions policies or programs of the federal government21 organizations which use their own private resources to engage only in grass roots lobbying and public advocacy including specifically any communication that is made in speech article publication or othe r material that is distributed and made available to the public or through radio television cable televi sion or other medium of mass communication22 would therefore not appear to be engaging in any prohibited lobbying activities under this provision the lobbying disclosure acts definitions of lobbying activities nd lobbying contacts exclude and do not independently apply to activ ities which consist only of grass roots lobbying and public advocacy23 similarly since the term lobbying activitie s relates only to the direct lobbying of covered federal officials the simpson amendment would not appear to limit in any way an organizations use of its own private resources to lobby state or local legislators or other state or local gove rnmental bodies or units while direct lobbying of the congress or of certain high level executive branch officials is covered under the lobbying disc losure act as lobbying contact and thus by definition lobbying activity the acts of testifying before congressional committee subcommittee or task force or of submitting
