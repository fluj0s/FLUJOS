jdp 110 iii preface 1 purpose the purpose of joint doctri ne publication jdp 110 prisoners of war internees and detainees is to provide high level joint doctrinal guidance on how to deal with persons who fall into the hands of uk armed forces during military operations whether prisoners of war pw civilian internees or those detained as result of suspected or act ual criminal activity 2 this edition of jdp 110 is written primarily for the benefit of the uk operational commander responsible for uk forces compliance with domestic uk law international law and th law of armed conflict loac it should prove useful to those involved in operationa l planning when the issues covered in this publication may arise it is also intended to assist those responsible for all aspects of force protection

opment dfid non governmental organisations ngos and inte rnational organisations ios such as the international committee of the red cross icrc 3 context jdp 110 has been titled prisoners of war internees and detainees and should be read in conjunction with 3 subordinate joint tac tics techniques and procedures jttps developed by the provos t marshal army as lead agent in concert with joint and singleservice subj ect matter experts and published alongside jdp 110 they are jdp 1101 prisoners of war b jdp 1102 internees c jdp 1103 detainees the separation of these tactical publicatio ns reflects the requirement for differing approaches to the range of possible categorisations of those captured interned or detained by uk armed forces ployed on operations abroad 4 structure jdp 110 is laid out in 5 chapters chapter 1 introduces the fundamental tenets law and policy governing this doctrine chapter 2 outlines the standards of treatment to be afforded in all circumstances nd provides context within which the detailed guidance in jdp 1101 jdp 1102 nd jdp 1103 should be read chapter 3 explores the consequences of failing to adhere to the standards of treatment of captured or detained persons chapter 4 outlines the principles governing the determination of captured or detained persons status chapter 5 discusses the planning necessary for the successful c onduct of prisoner handling operations and jdp 110 iv gives information on sources of legal and policy advice available to planning staffs and those charged with such activity in the field 5 the annexes throughout jdp

the inclusion of tactical guidance in higherlev doctrinal publication this approach has been adopted in order to prevent unnecessary duplication in th 3 jttps subordinate to jdp 110 b ensure that

clearly understood and accepted doctrine that ca n be exploited by nation and its likely partners particularly in those situations asso ciated with crisis and conflict it is uk policy that national doctrine should be cons istent with nato doctrine terminology and procedures other than when the uk has elected not to ratify nato doctrine however national doctrine should always cater for those areas not adequately covered by nato doctrine as well as influence the development of allied doctrine these requirements are met by the hierarchy of joint doctrinewarfare publications jdpjwps 3

course of military operati ons members of uk armed forces must expect and be prepared to hold personnel who are longer willing or able to continue fighting as well as other personnel who merit detention or internment on other grounds prisoner handling desc ribes all aspects of dealing with persons who fall into the hands of uk armed forces during operati ons whether categorised as prisoners of war pw internees or detainees 102 this publication sets out the fundamental rules and principles that apply to all such activity and is intended to provide gu idance at the operational level jdp 110 prisoners of war internees and detainees addresses the entire range of captured interned or detained persons likely to be encountered by uk forces across the spectrum of military operations it is acco mpanied by 3 joint tact ics techniques and procedures jttps developed in parallel with it jdp 1101 prisoners of war jdp 1102 internees and jdp 1103 detainees these jttps give guidance on the detailed rules that apply to the handling of each of the categories of individuals held by uk armed forces1 103 the capture internment or detention of persons has always been feature of the planning and conduct of operations whet her in time of conflict for example the capture of pw or the internment of ci vilians or during peacetime operations for example the arrest and detention of criminal suspects or internment of those who pose an imperative threat to security duri ng armed conflict the taking of pw brings many practical advantages it reduces the enemys numerical strength and fighting capacity lowers the enemys morale nd may constrain the tactics of enemy commanders pw are also an important pot ential source of intelligence similarly during other types of operations internment or the arrest of criminal suspects may bring advantages in terms of stabilising the situation on the ground and in enhancing force protection 104 conversely the abuse or illtreatment of any such individua ls can benefit an adversary in many ways such allega tions may form the basis of powerful propaganda undermine the credibility of uk forces and invite international condemnation deterioration in domestic support is equally likely the abuse of pw internees and detainees is not only unla wful it is fundamental misdirection of military effort it may also indicate wide r breakdown in the internal discipline of unit or formation in turn producing adverse consequences of its own 1 separate detailed guidance regarding the eliciting of intellige nce from captured persons

armed forces must comply with the law of armed conflict loac3 during armed conflict during all other types of operations such as peace keeping operations or maritime interdiction operations uk armed forces must comply with the applicable international uk and forei gn national law whichever law applies in specific operation4 all captured interned or detained persons regardless of their status or categorisation are entitled to be treated humanely in ternational law lays down standards of treatment that must be obser ved at all times beyond certain basic standards of humane treatment these persons are also entitled to varying degrees of enhanced rights and protections depending on their status or categorisation and the nature of the operation all persons deta ined by uk armed forces during the course of military operations shall be treated huma nely from the moment they fall into the hands of uk forces until release5 uk armed forces are res ponsible for the safety and protection of all persons captured or detained by them until their release6 106 violations of the law governing the treatment of captured interned or detained persons whether or not loac applies in particular situation those held in ukrun holding facilities may have rights under various international human rights treaties such as the european conven tion on human rights the international covenant on civil and political rights nd the convention against torture and inhuman or degrading treatment these obligations may require not only humane treatment and the absence of abuse but also proper exercise of command responsibility to prevent abuse as well as an effective system for investigating accusations of prisoner abuse or death in custody all alleged violations of the law committed by uk personnel must be promptly reported through the chain of command and thoroughly investigated where appropr iate disciplinary action should be taken and corrective action should follow in order to prevent future occurrences7 107 determination of status having captured an individual uk forces must determine that individuals status by refe rence to the circumstances in which the operation is being conducted and the applicable law in the case of pw should an individuals status not be obvious from the out set it will be the ruling of competent uk military court or tribunal8 that will determine the status of an individual if it is evident or subsequently determined that the individual is entitled to pw status then he9 should be handled in accordance with jdp 1101 if it is evident or subsequently 2 in this context the term detained persons do not include refugees or displaced persons 3 see jsp 383 joint service manual of the law of armed conflict chapters 89 4 see jwp 346 legal support to joint operations 5 see paragraph 129 6 see chapter 2 7 see chapter 3 8 geneva convention iii article 5 9 references to the masculine gender throughout should be taken to refer equally to females it should

w ith the procedures outlined in either jdp 1102 or jdp 1103 pending determination of status and in cases where doubt exists and cannot be resolved all persons captured during interna tional armed conflict are to be accorded pw status10 108 planning training and advice dealing with captured interned or detained persons is complex and calls for exper tise across range of military and other disciplines in the planning and conduct of such activity the delivery of appropriate training is essential speci alist staff policy and legal advice are invariably required11 section ii categories of

protocols i ap i relating to the protection of victims in international armed conflicts international armed conflict recognised categories of prisoner 110 during an international armed conflict there are 4 categories of prisoner recognised by the gcs12 prisoner of war 13 pw is defined at artic 4 of gc iii as one who while engaged in combat under orders of his government is captured by the armed forces of the enemy as such he is immune from the law of the capturing state for warlike acts preceding his capture that do not amount to breaches of loac he is also entitled to the rights and protections guaranteed under gc iii pw include for exampl member of the armed forces organised militia or volunteer corps and person who accompanies the armed forces without being mber thereof contractors reporters merchant marine and civil aviation crews it shou ld be noted that pw may also include civilians who on the approach of the enemy spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units provided that they carry arms openly and respect the law of armed conflict this type of spontaneous uprising known as levee masse should be distinguished from unl awful civilian participation in hostilities14 pw provisions usually apply only during an international armed conflict15 and only to the parties to that conflict not for example to peacekeeping forces or terrorist groups 12 it should be noted that the us recogni ses further category of prisoner during international armed conflict the enemy combatant the us defines an enemy combatant as for ex ample member or agent of any international terrorist organisation against which the us is engaged in an arme d conflict the us takes the view that these enemy combatants while entitled to be treated humanely subject to military necessity are not entitled to the privileges and protections of the geneva conventions the uk does not recognise this category of prisoner or any of the subcategories of enemy combatant for example those possessing information of value or civilian interned for his own protection 13 see jdp 1101 14 see paragraph 111b 15 although the parties to noninternational armed conflict may agree between themselves to apply the pw provisions to any captured enemy combatants this is rare see graph 405 see paragraphs 112113 for the categories of captured or detained person in noninternational armed conflicts jdp 110 15 b internee16 an internee is defined in gc iv as civilian who is interned during an international arme d conflict or belligerent occupation for security reasons or for protection or because he has committed an offence against the detaining power during in ternational armed conflict civilian that is noncombatant interned by uk forces for committing criminal offence against members of uk forces w ill be classified as an internee and not detainee the term detainee is used outside of situation of international or internal armed co nflict to describe persons who are arrested on suspicion that they may have committed criminal offence 17 since they are civilians internees also qualify for protected status in accordance with gc iv wh ich establishes procedures that must be observed when depriving civilians of their liber ty in particular gc iv article 78 imposes an obligation on the uk to ensure that the requirement to intern an individual civilian is subject to periodic review c retained persons under gc iii article 33 retained persons are those captured enemy personnel who may be reta ined in order to carry out their duties on behalf of other pw whilst being held they are to receive the benefits and protection accorded to pw any retained personnel who are not required shall be repatriate d as soon as possible to the party to which they belong enemy personnel falling within one of the following categories are eligible to be certified as retained personnel 1 medical personnel exclusiv ely engaged in the search for collection tran sport or treatment of the wounded or sick b prevention of disease andor c staff administration of medical units and establishments 2 chaplains attached to enemy armed forces 3 staff of national red cross or red crescent societies and other voluntary aid societies duly rec ognised and authorised by their governments d prisoners of indeterminate status 18 these are defined as persons in the custody of uk armed forces who have not yet been classified as pw internee or retained person pending termination of that prisoners legal status he is to be treated as pw unle ss and until differe nt legal status and 16 see jdp 1102 17 see paragraph 113 18 see jdp 1101 jdp 110 16 accompanying protections have been blished by competent authority in accordance with the procedures established by law and policy19 those denied protected status during i nternational armed conflict unlawful belligerents 111 although not specifically mentioned in th gcs there are traditionally 2 types of unlawful belligerents denied protected status under international law during an international armed conflict those categories of combatant who although authorised to fight by party to the conflict ar nevertheless denied pw status for example spies20 saboteurs21 and mercenaries22 b civilians who participate directly in hostilities will be unlawful belligerents unless they are part of 1 levee masse 23 2 an organised liberation movement 3 an organised resistance movement civilians who unlawfully participate in hostilities are not to be confused with irregular forces irregular forces pr ovided that they are under responsible command and subject to internal military discipline carry their arms openly otherwise distinguish themselves from the civilian population and conduct their operations in accordance with the ws and customs of war are to be treated as pw on capture civilia ns who engage in hostilities without distinguishing themselves from the civilian population are unlawful belligerents and so are denied protected st atus however they are to be treated humanely upon capture although denied the protections due to lawf ul belligerents these unlawful belligerents remain entitled to the basic standards of human itarian treatment laid out in chapter 2 lawful enemy combatants who do not co mply with the law of armed conflict loac are nevertheless entitled to full pw status24 19 for determination of status see chapter 4 20 spy is one who in disguise or under false pretences penetrates behind enemy lines of belligerent to obtain information with the intent of communicating that information to the hostile party 21 saboteurs penetrate into the territory of an adversary without openly bearing arms in order to perpetrate hostile acts 22 mercenaries are not members of the armed forces of party to the conflict but participate in combat for personal gain merely having nationality other than that of the party on whose side soldier fights does not automatically make that soldier mercenary it is the motivation of personal enrichment that counts 23 see paragraph 110a 24 although entitled to pw status an enemy combatant who has violated loac can expect to be tried and punished by the uk authorities see paragraph 304 jdp 110 17 persons interned or detained in oper ations not amounting to international armed conflict addi tional protocol ii 112 where operations take place during hostilities that do not amount to an international armed conflict the law governing the treatmen t of persons interned or detained by uk forces differs from that desc ribed in paragraphs 110111 the law of the nation in which hostilities are taking place international human rights treaties to which the uk is party25 and other international laws will all govern the situation the applicable international law was supplemen ted in treaty additional to the geneva conventions 1977 additional protocol ii ap ii noninternational armed conflicts which developed and supplemented the humanitarian protections provided by common article 3 of the gcs26 in internal armed conflicts 113 internees and detainees 27 during hostilities not am ounting to international armed conflict uk forces can expect to deal with 2 cla sses of captured or detained persons internees uk forces operating abroad may have power to intern civilians under the host nations law wher they pose an imperative threat to the security of the force28 such power may derive from the host states own domestic law or from security c ouncil resolution internees may be disarmed but must be allowed to keep all of their personal property unless it is of evidential value or must be conf iscated for security reasons and steps should be taken to establish their identity internees must be treated humanely the basis upon which individuals are in terned must be made subject to periodic review b criminal detainees uk armed forces opera ting abroad may have the power derived from the host states own domestic law to participate in the arrest of criminal suspects or may assi st the host nations authorised personnel in the arrest of persons in the case of criminal suspects or indicted persons they should be handed over to the appropr iate local authorities at the earliest opportunity provided that there is reason to believe that they will suffer torture or summary execution29 they may be disarmed but must be allowed to keep all of their personal property unl ess it is of evidential value or must be confiscated for security reasons and st eps should be taken to establish their identity criminal detainees must be treated humanely 25 for example the european convention on human rights the international covenant on civil and political rights see paragraph 106 26 see paragraph 202 27 see jdp 1102 and jdp 1103 28 accordingly such internees are often referred to as security internees 29 see paragraph 130 guidance should be sought through the chain of command jdp 110 18 section iii international and national organisations 114 commanders should be aware of the ra nge of nonmilitary governmental and independent national and inte rnational organisations that play pivotal role in assisting in and overseeing rrangements for the treatment of captured or detained persons these include the international committee of the red cross united nations agencies with responsibilities for huma nitarian issues attendant on any conflict and uk governmental departments for ex ample department for international development dfid foreign and commonwealth office fco and the governments postconflict reconstructi on unit various nongovernmental organisations ngos will also take an ac tive interest in the conditions under which captured or detained persons are held and the treatment th ey receive such as amnesty international and human rights watch 115 media organisations media organisations w ill inevitably take close interest in the arrangements for and treatment of captured or detained persons their number and the circumstances under which they are captured are matters of legitimate public interest but those entitled to pw status must not be made the object of public curiosity gc iii article 13 care should be taken to ensure that media personnel embedded with uk forces do not disregard th is rule additionally there will usually be legal and policy objections to exposing in ternees and detainees to the media the joint task force commander jtfc and his staff should expect to spend significant amount of time dealing with national and in ternational media orga nisations and this will call for carefully managed media plan30 any approach by the media is to be referred in the first instance to the media operations staff at the joint task force headquarters jtfhq who should liaise closel with j1 staff in handling the issues raised mod itself is the sole release authority for images of captured interned or detained persons the international committee of the red cross 116 the most important of the internationa l organisations is the international committee of the red cross i crc an independent intern ational organisation whose unique mandate and legal status set it apart from ngos in most of the countries in which it works the icrc has concluded headquarters agreements with national authorities through these ag reements the icrc enjoys the privileges and immunities normally only granted to intergovernmental or ganisations such as the for example immunity from legal process and the invi olability of its premises archives and documents such immunities are vital in preserving the icrcs impartiality and above all independence th icrc has number of role s stemming from its principal responsibility for monitoring the applicati on of the gcs and aps by states parties 30 see jwp 345 2nd edition media operations jdp 110 19 giving aid to and improving the conditions of captivity for pw wounded sick and shipwrecked members of the armed forces acting on behalf of civilian populations to relieve suffering and acting as central tracing agency fo r pw civilians especially internees in the power of party to the conflict and missing persons the icrc has vital role to play in advising states of thei r obligations to treat prisoners humanely and is often influential in persuading states to meet their obligations in this regard31 117 handling of international commi ttee of the red cross reports crucial element supporting the role of the icrc is the fact that they do not criticise governments publicly and that their reports to governments remain confidential it is important that this confidentiality is not compromised by the disclosure of icrc reports or the results of an icrc visit to the media or others although not obliged to do so as matter of practice the ic rc will notify the commanders of uk holding facilities of their visit and they have legally based right to immediate free and unfettered access to all places where indivi duals who qualify as protected persons may be for example pw civilian internees re tained personnel the wounded and sick32 the icrc may also conduct interviews with such protected persons without witnesses being present33 having conducted an inspection vi sit the icrcs likely responses are report in the form of local wo rking paper often copied to the permanent joint headquarters and mod service personnel policy sp pol b report on specific facilities or on specific individuals or groups of individuals c standard report on all facilities in theatre d formal intervention via the br itish embassy in geneva all icrc reports handed over in theatre are to be forwar ded immediately through the jtfc to mod in most cas and in every case where there has been criticism of facility or of the handling of particular prisoner ministers will be informed and press lines prepared an investigation shoul d be initiated where this has not already been done when the icrc has suggested changes to the holding facility regime the mod would need to know what practical step s could be taken in theatre to meet the concerns expressed icrc reports held by mod and any information contained in the reports are exempt fro m disclosure under the freedom of information act 2000 during coalition operations icrc reports are only to be released to combritfor combritfor may release th report to the senior br itish officer within the 31 see jdp 1101 and jsp 383 joint service manual of the law of armed

pjhq or mod further release to the coalition headquarters eg nato hq for distributio n to nonbritish staffs will only be authorised by mod after consultation with fco and icrc section iv the protecting power 118 under the gcs of 1949 the treatment of pw interned civilians and the inhabitants of an occupied territory is to be monitored by neutral nation known as the protecting power owing to the diffic ulty of finding nation which opposing belligerents would agree is truly neutral international humanitarian organisations such as the icrc have in th past been authorised by th parties to the conflict to perform at least some of the functions of the protecting power these include the investigation of the treatment and administ ration of pw and civilian internees in recent conflicts nations have been opposed to appointing the icrc officially to the role of protecting power because of concer n that if the opposing belligerent rejects the appointment it might lead to them refusing all access to prisons and prisoners by the icrc in breach of the gcs 119 definition 34 the protecting power is non belligerent state which has been designated by party to the conflict and ac cepted as such by other parties to the conflict the protecting power must agree to carry out the functions assigned to it substitute is an organisation acting in place of the protecting power when such agreement cannot be reached 120 discharge of responsibilities the protecting power will discharge its responsibilities through representatives the normal diplomatic and consular personnel of the protecting power b delegates persons appointed by the protecting power to discharge its functions under the gcs delegates will normally be nationals of the protecting power or of another neutral st ate members of the icrc may also be appointed delegates by the protecti ng power it will normally be the delegates who ensure through physical ch ecking that pw and internees are being treated correctly 121 inspection facilities representatives and delegates of protecting powers and icrc delegate s have the right35 to investigate the treatme nt and administration of protected persons wherever th ey may be and are to be allowed to interview them 34 api article 5 35 gc iii article 26 jdp 110 111 without witnesses being present they are to be given every assistance in this work this right can be temporarily suspended by mod for reasons of imperative military necessity it should be noted that the tr eatment by the uk of its pw and the standing of the uk in the eyes of th international community will depend to large extent on the manner in which the protecting power re ports that pw are being treated the provision of full and open inspection f acilities and scrupulous adherence to the principles in this document will assist in showing that the uk takes its obligations towards captured or detained persons seriously36 122 internment camps it is noteworthy that the protecting power and the icrc are also appointed to monitor the conditions under which civilian internees are held in internment camps and where the uk is an occupying power the uks treatment of inhabitants of an occupied territory 123 criminal detention facilities by contrast neither the icrc nor the protecting power has legal right to insp ect facilities where crim inal detainees are being held by uk forces however as matter of policy it may be in the uks interests to authorise inspection of these detention facilities the cds directive for the operation will normally give direction concerning icrc access any such requests should be forwarded through the chai n of command for authorisation section v the national information bureau 124 gc iii article 122 places duty on all pa rties in conflict to open national information bureau nib at the outset of hos tilities there is also requirement for neutral and nonbelligere nt nations to open bureau if there is likelihood of those who might be categorised as pw or intern ees finding their way into neutral or non belligerent territory in operations other than armed conflict it is uk policy that captured or detained persons are entitled to be treated humanely in accordance with the uks international human rights obligations37 and this will normally include the opening of nib the nib exis ts to gather and pass on important information used to monitor the details whereabouts and health of pw internees and detainees and to facilitate contact with their nextofkin 125 gc iii also provides for the establishment of central information bureau in neutral country which is normally the prot ecting power see section iv to which all of the nibs report in practice this role is subsumed by the central tracing agency of the icrc38 126 recordkeeping the importance of ensuring th at accurate records are kept from the moment of capture internment or arrest cannot be overemphasised it is 36 see annex 5c 37 see chapter 2 38 see paragraph 116 jdp 110 112 essential that accurate reports and return s are submitted to the icrc or protecting power the details of the information to be recorded are to be found in jdp 1101 jdp 1102 and jdp 1103 but should include information about an individuals identity surname first names rank service personnel or serial nu mber for example national insurance number or equivalent for civilians pl ace and full date of birth nationality gender date and place of capture status last place of detention authority of capture the name and address of th person to be notified of capture relationship of that person the addre ss to which mail for the pw or internee may be sent and an indication whether the pw or internee consents to having his details released to th state on which he

on the uk to transfer injured or sick persons to the uk for treatment if transfer is contemplated this would have to be policy decision and lega l advice should be sought as soon as possible41 d transfer to host stat at the end of period of occupation the procedures regulating the transfer of cap tured or detained persons can be found in jdps 1101 1102 and 110342 129 the transfer of persons from uk facilities to holding facilities run by other nations military forces or law enforcement agencies requires close liaison the policy considerations attendant on such transfer s will vary depending upon the categories of person involved and the reasons behind the tran sfer for example in the case of pw the capturing state remains responsible for the conditions in which the pw are held even after transfer to another state it is also importa nt to recognise that not all persons may be transferred to locations outsi the territory where they were captured or detained as general ru it should be noted that while pw may be transferred to locations outside the territory where they were first capture d it is not permitted to transfer civilian internees or detainees to locations outside the territory where they were first captured or detained if there ar compelling medical reasons for proposed transfer outside of the territory where inte rnees or detainees were first interned or detained then further legal advice should be sought 130 liaison between uk forces and co alition partners allies and national authorities is essential to ensure that the uk abides by its continuing legal obligations to protect the rights of those captured interned or detained persons for which it remains responsible it must be borne in mind that while the international legal framework regulating captured interned or detained persons is likely to be broadly agreed by coalition partners and allies ther will be some legal and policy differences which must be taken into account the ap plication of the european convention on human rights to those held in uk facilities in some circumstances may impose additional restrictions on their transfer in pa rticular if they are likely to be tried subsequently for an offence which carries the death penalty or subject to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment 41 see annex 5d generally for guidance on medical support to captured or detained

protections basic principles of humanity to be observed at all times 201 basic principles of humanity must be applied when dealing with all captured or detained persons regardless of how they are categorised prisoners of war internees and detainees must be tr eated humanely at all times to that end certain acts are prohibited the sick and wounded must be coll ected and allowed appropriate care these basic principles of humanity appl to all persons be ing held by uk armed forces regardless of whether the operation takes place during an international armed conflict noninternational armed c onflict or other operations additional protections 202 depending on the category of prisoner and the nature of operations taking place there are additional protections and rights that must be afforded to those held by uk armed forces the detail can be found in jdp 1101 prisoners of war jdp 1 102 internees and jdp 1103 detainees in broad terms they are international armed conflict during internatio

international law acts of humiliation or degradation are strictly forbidden3 the text of the applicable gcs should be displayed in each uk holding facility in english and the languages of those being held there 204 imposing discipline maintaining control and discipline within holding facility is essential jtfcs must ensure that facility commanders establish lawful rules for control and discipline of captured or tained persons because the imposition of physical or corporal punishment is inconsistent with the obligation for humane treatment commanders must understand th relationship between reward and punishment as general rule the withdrawal of privileges is often the most effective sanction for indiscipline and reward the most effective incentive for disciplined behaviour planning for the provision of such privileges is an essential component to any programme of control and discipline4 discipline as an enabling principle of successful camp management is di scussed further at annex 2a 205 the use of force the jtfc must ensure th at guard force personnel are prepared for the reasonable use of force wh necessary to protect themselves other members of the force or other captured or

uk armed forces are required by law to act humanely towards all captured or detained persons to that end the law prohibits members of uk armed forces from committing certain acts see paragraph 207 these prohibitions are of universal application any individual found offending against these prohibitions can expect to be charged with crimes under service law or domestic or international criminal law5 207 acts which are and shall remain prohi bited at any time and in any place whatsoever with respect to all classes of captured or detained persons are violence to the life health and physi cal

security c discipline section i humane treatment humane treatment 2a2 all captured persons regardless of cat egorisation are entitled to be treated humanely at all times not only will the standard of th eir treatment reflect upon the credibility and prestige of uk armed forces but any deliberate failure to abide by the uks legal obligations will result in disciplin ary proceedings being taken against those found to be involved all personnel invo lved in the handling of captured persons whether troops in the field or staff with in uk camp must understand that the humane treatment that preserves captured persons dignity not only accords with the law but is also the most effective and efficient way to manage pw internees and detainees the humane treatment of cap tured or detained personnel is key principle of successful camp management the prevention of abuse 2a3 international humanitarian law leav room for doubt in prohibiting torture and illtreatment there are circum stances in which torture or other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or puni shment can ever be justified 2a4 the closed and isolated nature of ca mps and the detention compounds within them can offer the opportunity for abus to be committed with impunity commanders responsible for any facility have an obligation to ensure that all staff are fully aware of the prohibition on torture nd cruel inhuman or degrading treatment these prohibitions must be stated in camp standing orders and operational regulations jdp 110 2a2 sexual abuse 2a5 all personnel held in custody are vulnerabl to sexual abuse this may come about through the use of force as result of other types of coercion or through barter in exchange for privileges in numbe r of countries prison rape has become widespread and serious concern in add ition to the physical and psychological damage that it causes it increases the spread of hivaids and other diseases commanders have responsibility to ensure that all capt ured or detained persons and especially women or children are safe fro m the threat of sexual abuse admission to prisoner of wari nternment camp or detainee compound 2a6 when captured person is first admitte d into facility the treatment he receives at that point is an indication of what is likely to follow it is important that staff treat every individual on admission with dignity and respect regardless of their status or demeanor every individual upo n admission shall be provided with written information in language he understa nds about the regulations governing the treatment of captured persons of his cate gory the disciplinary requirements of the facility the authorized methods of seeking information and making complaints and all matters necessary to enable him to unders tand both his rights and his obligations and to adapt himself to the life of the facility if captured person is illiterate this information should be conveyed to him by an interpreter section ii dynamic security 2a7 security is the foundation on which all efforts to develop positive custodial regimes are based dynamic security is an allembracing term it encompasses physical security walls fences locks bolts and bars and surveillance devices such as closed circuit television cctv b security procedures checks and balances ac counting for individuals and conducting random but frequent search body searches and searches of accommodation and communal areas c assessment procedures categorising prisoners and conducting regular risk assessments in order to ensure th at individuals are held in appropriate security conditions d intelligence gathering provides staff with an opportunity to anticipate any premeditated disturbances and to pre empt breaches of discipline it is also useful in identifying and dealing with bullying and can assist in preventing suicide or selfharm jdp 110 2a3 behavioural awareness monitoring to identify marked changes in mood attitude and conduct f consistent treatment it is vital that all staff are consistent in their treatment of prisoners remaining prof essional at all times and avoiding any form of favouritism or victimisation the principle of dynamic security calls for proactive approach maximum security 2a8 the security measures to which pw in ternees and detainees are subject should be appropriate to achieving thei r secure custody individua ls should only be confined to maximum security conditions where risk assessment shows them to pose such threat to safety and secur ity that the commander of the camp or detention facility has other choice individuals may be placed into secure custody if they pose danger to others b they pose danger to themselves 2a9 individuals placed under maximum security restrictions will have to be searched on regular basis to make sure th at they are not carryi ng items which can be used in escape attempts or to injure other people or themselves or contraband items the intensity and frequency of such search will vary according to circumstances commanders of pw or internment camps should introduce additional security measures for the management of violen t disruptive or otherwise dangerous individuals such measures should safeguar d against the possibility of coercion being applied to staff and may include the regula r rotation of staff to reduce the risks of pressure being applied to them by the pw internee or detainee and searching all including staff who come into contact with such individuals may be necessary searches1 2a10 commanders must issue clearly understood set of procedures that describe in detail the circumstances in which searches should be carried out who may conduct searches the methods to be used and their frequency these procedures should be designed to prevent escape and also to pr otect the dignity of prisoners and their visitors there should be procedures for regularly searching all places where prisoners live work or congregate these should include searches of living accommodation such as cells and dormitories to make sure that security features including doors and locks windows grilles and floors have not been tampered with the personal 1 see annex 2c jdp 110 2a4 property of individuals should also be subj ect to ad hoc searches staff must be specially trained to carry out these searches in such way as to detect and prevent any escape attempt or secretion of contraband while at th same time respecting the dignity of the person and showing respect for their personal possessions in particular religious artifacts the procedure for such searches should allow the subject to be present whilst the search is carried out 2a11 the type of search conducted will depend upon the circumstances for example when individuals are moving in rge numbers from their place of work back to their living accommodation it is normal to subject them to the sort of rubdown searches which are now common for all air trav elers on other occasions especially if there is reason to believe that individuals may have something secreted about their person or when they are designated as highri sk prisoners it will be necessary to carry out more detailed search 2a12 the procedures for searching visitors should be sensitive to the needs of children women and other vul nerable groups procedures for searching professional visitors such as legal representatives nd doctors should be approved by the joint task force headquarters jtfhqs j1 leg to ensure balance between security and the right of confidential professional access section iii discipline general 2a13 discipline within facility is necessary not only to ensure that captives remain in custody but also as an enabler thr ough which the provisions of the geneva conventions can be applied wellordered camps need to ope rate within set of rules and regulations that are fair and just by their nature pw and internment camps and the detention compounds within them are clos ed institutions in which large groups of people are held against their will in confined conditions it is inevitable that some inmates will break the rules and regulations physical attacks theft refusal to follow daily routine disobeying legitimate order and the smuggling of contraband goods are common transgressions discipline regulations and sanctions 2a14 the camp must have disc ipline regulations these will differ depending upon the category of those being held there the operational environment and the specifics of the theatre discipline regulations for each category of captured or detained person may be found in the appropriate tactical level guidance jdp 1101 prisoners of war jdp 110 2a5 b jdp 1102 internees c jdp 1103 detainees 2a15 investigating offences against discipline pw internee or detainee accused of an offence for which disciplinar punishment is contemplated will not be confined pending disciplinary hearing unless it is essential in the interests of order and discipline any period spent by an indi vidual in confinement awaiting hearing should be reduced to an absolute minimum for disciplinary offences as opposed to criminal offences such confin ement will not exceed 14 days 2a16 whether before or after

information regardi ng the offence of which he is accused b given an opportunity to defend the allegation c permitted to call witnesse s and to have if necessary the service of qualified interpreter jdp 110 2a6 2a18 in all cases the accused should be presen t at the hearing he should hear the evidence as it is presented and should be entitled to question the staff member who is presenting the case if an accused is not capable for whatever reason of defending himself he should be allowed to call another person to assist him or her if the case is complex one or the possible punishment severe consideration should be given to handing the investigation over to the servic police and providing the accused with legal representation 2a19 there must be clear set of legitimat procedures for dealing with such incidents and these regulations must ensure the safety of the individual both staff and inmate camp must be secure safe and wellordere d with consistency of approach neither too harsh nor too liberal the majority of captured persons will welcome firm and fair management by staff because where the staff is not in control the resulting vacuum will be filled by strongw illed inmates often to the detriment of other inmates it is also critical that the regulations are applied from the command downwards individual members of staf f may resort to delivering their own unauthorised forms of contro l if command is weak 2a20 experience has shown that providing suff icient meaningful activity for inmates prevents the onset of boredom one of the main contributing factors to disciplinary problems meaningful activity can be provi ded in the form of recreational facilities such as sports and games education and wo rk in addition inmates should keep their own quarters clean and in hygienic state family and other visits and regular access to the canteen are other methods for blishing routine and preventing boredom 2a21 the use of canteen cred its system is recommended wherever possible the method whereby all items including cigarette s and sweets are automatically supplied to inmates whilst convenient and easy to ad minister does not allow for their removal as result of disciplinary action rather the issue of the ba sic hygiene commodities such as soap and toothpaste is recommended with system of credits being paid to each captured persons canteen account w ith which they may purchase their luxury items such as cigarettes sweets and writing ma terials in this way the forfeiture of credits can be used as disciplinary sanction it is not recommended that cash is used as this can lead to bullying trafficking nd in extreme cases skewing of the local economy captured persons may have the opportunity to earn additional credits through work it may also be prudent to consider rewarding good behaviour inmates who are purposefully occupied are less disposed to illdiscipline managing breakdown in discipline 2a22 in any camp matter how well run there is always the potential for breakdown in discipline the most common examples of which are jdp 110 2a7 an individual attack on staff or other captured persons b group revolt which may include rioting or hostage taking c the smuggling of contraband goods 2a23 although not usually disciplinary issu instances of liberate selfharm are also likely to occur 2a24 in every camp there should be clear t of procedures for dealing with such incidents which should have been approved by j1 legal military provost staff mps staff within facility will have been trained in control nd restraint techniques2 and number are trained in hos tage negotiation whenever there is violent incident or prisoner has to be subdued senior member of staff should attend the scene as soon as possible report should be prepared by the facility commander and forwarded to the jtfhqs j1 branch preventing breakdown in discipline prevention is better than cure 2a25 it is rare that major incident will occu r without prior warning in most cases there will be some indication of build up of tension whether at an individual or group level this is where the benefits of dynamic security become apparent on entering an accommodation block or working area where tension is brewing an alert member of staff should immediately be aw are that something is wrong they should be able to identify any individuals who are uns ettled or likely to threaten violence it will be more difficult for cap tured persons who wish to cr eate trouble to recruit others if the general approach of staff has been fair and consistent however even where there is good dynamic security there may be an outburst of individual or collective violence 2a26 positive method for managing violent and disruptive individuals is to house them in small units of up to 10 persons this is called group isolation and it is critically different from individual segregat ion in these conditions it should be possible for professionally trained staff3 to develop strategy fo r dealing with even the most dangerous individuals if logistics allow the creation of maximum security area individuals should be able to move relatively freely within the group isolation units and to have normal routine 2a27 good relationships between staff and in mates are an essential element of dynamic security and can be put to good eff ect in deescalating potential incidents or 2 members of the agc mps are trained to home office standards in prison serv ice control and restraint techniques 3 members of the agc mps jdp 110 2a8 in

the treatment of juveniles and children 2b1 camp commandants must understand that their staff is trained primarily to oversee the detention of adults when juveniles are being held the camp commandant has an obligation to care for them in manner that ta kes account of their age and particular needs children and young persons are more vulnerable than adults and need to be protected fro m violence or abuse juveniles and the young must be housed in separate quarters unless they are be ing held within discrete family unit 2b2 as they are generally more likely to re spond to positive influences the regime for juveniles and children should emphasize education and skills training camp administrators should seek to establish links with those nongovernmental organisations ngos working with young people beyond the camp in order to extend the range of programmes available to young prisoners of war pw internees and detainees particularly in physi cal cultural and social activities 2b3 high priority should be given to main taining and developing links between the young person and his family families should be encouraged to visit the camp as often as is feasible and to maintain contact by letter special atten tion needs to be paid to the environment in which visits take place affording as much privacy and informality as possible 2b4 in many countries significant proportio n of young inmate s may have lost contact with their families be fore or as result of thei r period of detention camp commandants will need to give particular attention to identifying those young people who may need additional suppor t in reestablishing links with their families or for whom family links have irrevocably broken down the main purpose should be to avoid returning the young persons to the social circumstances that contributed to their original detention it will be important to enlist the help of the relevant governmental and nongovernmental agencies in designi ng and delivering appropriate resettlement programmes 2b5 all captureddetaine d persons under the age of 18 are to be treated as juveniles pws who are or are believed to be juveniles will be processed through the same

to the treatment of captured or detained persons 301 any deliberate failure by members of uk armed forces to observe the standards of treatment of captured or detained persons1 is likely to be an unlawful act if that unlawful act occurs during an intern ational armed conflict it may be grave breach of the geneva conventions gcs2 in all operational situations uk forces deployed overseas remain subject to english criminal law and can be tried in the uk for criminal offences committed overseas thus deliberate failu re by uk forces to observe the standards of treatment of captured or detained persons during operations not amounting to armed conflict will usually be an offence under uk law if it occurs during noninternational armed conflict it will also be an offence under the domestic law of the country where it occurs3 section i violations of international and domestic law war crimes under international law 302 typical war crimes relevant to this publication include offences against prisoners of war pw for example killing without just cause torture dangerous labour or labour of military nature4 subjecting to public insult or curiosity denial of fair trial for offences b offences against civilian internees and detainees and the civilian inhabitants of occupied territory for example killing without just cause torture forced labour deportation denial of fair trial for offences 303 grave breaches of the geneva conventions while any violation of the law of armed conflict loac is war crime certain crimes are defined as grave breaches under the geneva conventions and the additional protocols grave breaches are war crimes committed against those protected under the conventions and they invoke universal jurisdiction such that any state may try an d punish such crimes matter where they were committed or the na tionality of the accused they include 1 see chapter 2 2 see paragraph 303 3 however uk forces will usually be operating under st atus of forces agreement sofa which will provide them with immunity from the local jurisdiction 4 for example compelling enemy pw to clear land mines is war crime however pw may voluntarily assist in mine clearance operations 31 jdp 110 the wilful killing or torture of protected persons5 compelling pw to serve in the forces of hostile power the unlawful portation transfer or confinement of protected person the taking of hostages the denial of fair trial and wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to the body or health of protected persons 304 acts constituting war crimes are capab of being committed by the armed forces or by individuals belonging to the ci vilian population be lligerents have an obligation under international law to punish their own nationals whether members of the armed forces or civilians who commit war crimes members of uk armed forces can be dealt with under the relevant sections of the service discipline acts6 for all civil offences including murder or manslaught er international law also provides that belligerents have the right to punish enemy armed forces personnel and enemy civilians who fall under their control for such offences offences under uk domestic law 305 jurisdiction to punish war crimes the geneva conventions act 1957 and the international criminal court act 20017 make it criminal offence under english law to commit grave breaches of the geneva conventions and to commit crimes against humanity the civilian courts of the uk can therefore try any person of any nationality who is accused of committing war crime which is sufficiently serious to amount to grave breach however war crimes may also encompass ordinary criminal acts such as murder manslaughter or assault when such violations have been committed by service personnel they will usually be tried by court martial under the provisions of the relevant service discipline acts 306 the international criminal court the international criminal court act 2001 makes the crimes listed in the rome statute criminal of fences under english law the act recognises the primacy of english jurisdiction and allows for these crimes where committed overseas to be tried in eng lish courts only if the uk courts are unwilling or unable genuinely to exercise th eir jurisdiction in respect of such crimes will the international criminal court icc exercise jurisdicti on thus members of the uk armed forces who co mmit alleged violations of the geneva conventions will usually be tried for war crimes under the rms of the relevant service discipline act before service court martial since th uk has in place structures and procedures for investigating allegations of war crimes and bringi ng perpetrators to account through the application of the service disc ipline acts it is not expected that british service personnel would ever need to be prosecuted through the icc 5 those who at any time and for any reason find themselves in the hands of party to the conflict or occupying power of which they are not nationals gc iv article 4 those civilians interned during an international armed conflict will usually be protected persons 6 section 42 naval discipline act 1957 section 70 air force act 1955 and section 70 army act 1955 7 see paragraph 306 32 jdp 110 offences under foreign domestic law 307 where prohibited act is carried out in noninternational armed conflict it will usually be an offence against the domestic law of the country in question as well as an offence under uk law and the serv ice discipline acts where committed by service personnel it may be that the uk has concluded agreements with the country in question to ensure that the uk retain s exclusive jurisdiction over uk service personnel charged with such offences if so any such violations will be tried by uk court or courtmartial if such agre ement has been reached uk serviceman overseas who has been charged with such offences will usually be withdrawn from theatre and tried in the uk section ii command and in dividual responsibility adherence by commanders 308 at all times commanders are to comply with and require those under their command to comply with international and domestic law8 all alleged violations of international or domestic law committed by uk personnel are to be promptly reported through the chain of command thoroughly i nvestigated and appropriately dealt with the assistance of investigative authorities such as the special investigation branch sib will invariably be required in pa rticular commanders mu st seek legal advice through the chain of command before decidi ng whether or not an investigation is warranted or whether disciplinary or other action is appropriate 309 command responsibility officers in command are not only responsible for ensuring that they conduct all operations in accordance with the law but are also responsible for the conduct of their subordi nates while co mmander may delegate some or all of his authority he cannot delegate responsibility for the conduct of the forces that he commands9 the fact that commander did not order authorise or knowingly acquiesce in violation of the w by subordinate will not relieve him of responsibility for its occurrence if it is blished that he failed to exercise properly his command authority or failed otherwise to take reasonable measures to prevent violations and to investigate and correct any breaches that did occur10 310 commanding officers must ensure that all members of their units receive training and education in the law applicable to dealing with ca ptured or detained

personnel are involved personnel with authority over them are to intervene in order to prevent the commission of criminal act such in tervention will depend upon the ability of the individual and the extent of their authority but may include arguments to dissuade the offender threatening to report the criminal act repeating the orders of superiors and asking the senior individual at the scene to intercede where the criminal act imminently threatens the life of another then force may be used to the extent necessary to prevent the crime note that deadly force w ill rarely be justified it may be used only to protect life and only under conditions of extreme necessity as last resort when lesser means are clear ly inadequate to save life 312 following orders unlawful orders are not to be given and are not to be obeyed12 members of the uk ar med forces must obey all lawful orders issued by superior an order to commit an obviously criminal act whethe r given directly or indirectly such as the torture or ot her mistreatment of prisoner is an unlawful order which does not relieve subordinate of his responsibility to comply with the law the possible defence that subordinate was f ollowing orders will only succeed if the subordinate did not know and could not reas onably have recognised that the order was unlawful such circumstances are likely to be rare where an order is capable of being misinterpreted subordinate must seek clarification where an order permits such degree of latitude to subordinate that it is capable of being carried out lawfully or unlawfully it should only be carried out lawfully 11 all members of uk forces receive training in the w of armed conflict see paragraph 520 the role and responsibilities of the legal adviser legad are detaile d in jwp 346 legal support to joint operations 12 see jsp 381 aidememoire on the law of armed conflict and jwp 346 annex 2b 34 jdp 110 chapter 4 determining the status of captured persons 401 all captured interned or detained pers ons regardless of status are to be treated humanely at all times1 the determination of an individuals status is the process by which uk armed forces will establish the additional protection and privileges to which that individual is entitled as well as protecting individual rights the timely determination of captured or detained persons status ensures that the resources committed to dealing with them can be focussed as efficiently as possible 402 for the most part the appropriate categor isation of captured person should be apparent whether through the circumstances under which he or she is captured or through clear indications of status for ex ample during international armed conflict the wearing of military uniform is evidence that prisoner is combatant and so must be treated as prisoner of war pw in other types of opera tion the legal mandate2 given to uk forces to maintain order may be such that an individuals obviously criminal behaviour for example looting mer its his arrest and treatment as criminal detainee it is only during international armed conflict when an individuals status is not immediately obvious that it becomes necessary to resort to the procedures whereby status is formally determined3 section i characterising the operation 403 in order to determine the status of ca ptured person it is first necessary to determine whether or not an armed conflict exists4 and if it does whether that armed conflict is international or noninternati onal in nature the decision whether an armed conflict exists whether internatio nal or not is one which is taken at governmental level with crosswhitehall c onsultation rather then by the military on the ground or by anyone in the chain of command the type of armed conflict depends upon the status of the parties to the conflict and the nature of the hostilities the status and rights of captured or detained persons depend on answering is there an armed conflict or not if there is is it international in nature and so governed by the ge neva conventions gcs and additional protocol i 1 see chapter 2 2 for example under security council resolution 3 see paragraphs 409 411 4 the point at which situations of internal disturbances and tensions develop into an armed conflict is open to interpretation attempts to define the term armed conflict have proved unsuccessful and st ates have frequently been reluctant to admit that state of armed conflict exists usually for political and diplomatic reasons 41 jdp 110 ap i or not and so governed by comm on article 3 ap ii and applicable human rights and national laws if the hostilities do not amount to armed conflict then the position is govern ed by applicable national laws b what relationship exists between the captured or detained person and the parties to any armed conflic t are they national of party to the conflict c the geographical boundaries of the c onflict and the phase of operations may also be significant the gcs w ill not apply to conduct which occurs before the onset or after the end of armed conflict unless belligerent occupation takes place commanders can expect higher authority guidance on whether state of armed conf lict exists or has ceased to exist the gcs will not apply to conduct which occurs in the rritory of state which is not party to the armed conflict 404 commanders are entitled to expect clear direction about whether their forces are being committed to an armed conflict or specific types of hos tilities should such direction be unclear guidance should ways be sought through the chain of command section ii combatants and noncombatants5 405 there is distinction to be made be tween combatants and noncombatants each has specific rights and obligations in time of armed conflict and single individual can be simultaneously combatant and noncombatant during international armed conflict capture d combatants are to be treated as pw during noninternational armed conflict nd other operations captured combatants will only be treated as pw where the parties to the conflict have agreed between themselves to do so otherwise captured combatants should be treated as civilians 406 captured combatants during international armed conflict captured combatants are to be treated as pw in accordance with jdp 1101 prisoners of war the term combatant embraces those pers ons who have the righ t under international law to participate directly in hostilities duri ng armed conflict combatants include all members of the regularly organised armed fo rces of party to the conflict except medical personnel and chapla ins who are noncombatants but are entitled to be treated as pw upon capture6 combatant also includes irregular forces under responsible 5 see jsp 383 joint service manual of the law of armed conflict paragraph 156 6 see paragraph 110c retained persons 42 jdp 110 command and subject to internal military di scipline who carry their arms openly conduct their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war and who otherwise distinguish themselv from the civilian population7 the regulations for the handling of those entitled to pw status ar relatively straightforward because their status treatment transfer period and terms of detention are dictated by the terms of single treaty gc iii combatan ts will usually be entitled to pw status only if engaged in an international armed conflict du ring other types of hostilities combatant prisoners will not be entitled to pw status unl ess the parties to the conflict have agreed otherwise where such agreement ex ists combatant prisoners engaged in non international armed conflict are to be treated as civilians subject to the domestic law of the country concerned any internationa l human rights treaties binding on the uk in time of armed conflict and th basic principles of human ity mentioned in chapter 2 noncombatants are those who take direct part in hostilities they may include civilians and some types of military personnel 407 captured noncombatants 8 the term noncombatant is primarily applied to those individuals who do not form part of the armed forces and who otherwise refrain from the commission or direct support of hostile acts in this context non combatants and the civilian population are generally synonymous however the term noncombatant may also embrace cert ain categories of person who although members of or accompanying the armed forces enjoy special protected status such as medical officers chaplains and civilian wa r correspondents by contrast to civilian noncombatants medical personne l chaplains etc can be re tained in custody if they are needed to minister to pw9 408 noncombatants who are civilians ar protected and must be released from custody as soon as possible unless there is some other legal basis for detaining them or handing them over to local authorities wher such legal basis exists civilian non combatants not otherwise entitled to pw status10 are to be treated as protected persons under the gcs and in acco rdance with jdp 1102 internees and jdp 1103 detainees 7 7 an organised guerrilla group that meets these requirements is as much part of the armed forces as regular unit for example the viet cong who fo ught alongside the north vietnamese army ag ainst the us during the vietnam war increasingly the distinction between co mbatant and noncombatant has become bl urred as the spectrum of conflict has broadened to include insurgencies and counterinsurgencies the situation can be complicated by the failure of some factions to distinguish themselves from the population for ex ample insurgents in iraq or elements of the taleban in afghanistan 8 civilians with the nationality of the opposing belligeren t state are entitled to be treated as protected persons 9 see paragraph 110c 10 civilian noncombatants are entitled to pw status if they have received authorisa tion from the armed forces which they accompany in the form of gc identity card specific examples include cont ractors war correspondents civilian members of military aircraft crews merchant marine an d civil aviation crews depende nts accompanying the force and those engaged in levee masse see paragraph 110 43 jdp 110 409 the standards of treatment applicable to both combatant and noncombatant prisoners are laid out in chapter 2 section iii the procedure for determining pw status during international armed conflict 410 article 5 of gc iii states should ny doubt arise as to whether persons having committed belligerent act and having fallen into the hands of the enemy belong to any of the categories in art 4 for pw such persons shall enjoy the protection of the present convention until such time as their status has been determined by competent tribunal 411 gc iii does not indicate how an article 5 tribunal should be constituted nor in whose mind the doubt must arise in order to co mpel the institution of such tribunal prior to the 1949 gcs summary decisions were often made by soldiers of relatively low rank on the battlefield leading to inst ances where captive could be presumed unlawful and executed on the spot without any investigation to follow under gc iii combatants are presumed to be entitled to pw status unless formally declared otherwise and even if so d eclared are entitled to proper trial of any allegations made against them 412 any individual who claims pw status is entitled to an adjudication of that status status will normally be determined by uk military tribunal11 constituted under the prisoner of war determinatio n of status regulations 1958 it will be for the jtfcs legal adviser and j1 staff to convene any such tribunal taking legal advice from pjhq in order to ensure that th tribunal

including details of those who captured him and those who were captured with him are to be recorded and handed over with the pr isoner those found not to be entitled to pw status are to be handed over to the appropriate civil authorities british nationals captured abroad 413 in all cases where british national falls into the hands of uk armed forces operating abroad legal and policy advice should be sought through the chain of command at the earliest possible oppor tunity commensurate with mission accomplishment and the safety of the force close liaison with the mod and other government departments is required in rela tion to the handling of any british national captured by british forces overseas 11 usually in the form of board of inquiry 44 jdp 110 annex 4a the internment serial

deal with captured or detained persons 501 the level of scrutiny and degree of sens itivity associated with the treatment of any type of captured or detained person means that the joint task force commander jtfc can expect or should request clear gui dance in the early stages of the planning process chief of the defence staffs c ds directive which will include guidance on legal issues and rules of engagement roe should also mention arrangements for dealing with captured or detained pers ons the chief of joint operations cjo will in turn use cds directive to give operational direction in the

if they are not he ma need to request additional guidance in conducting his own operational estimate the jtfc should consider whether he has been allocated sufficient resources to establish viable prisoner handling organisation pho on scale consiste nt with wider planning assumptions 502 the jtfc must then consider his own plan for dealing with captured or detained persons within the joint operations area joa the jtfc mu st see to it that all personnel involved in this activity are tr ained equipped and otherwise logistically supported there is variety of pertinent operational and logistical considerations the number of personnel required to conduct such operations materiel support construction or adapting of facilities logistical support plan arrangements to categorise and record captured or detained pe rsons their subsequent detention transfer and release and so on the key point is that this sort of planning and training must be considered at as early stage as possible commande rs should establish planning mechanisms that ensure ef fective consideration of potential prisoner handling ph issues and the development of plans and pro cedures to respond to them in timely manner because such issues have been shown to impact upon operations intelligence logistics engineer medical gal religious and information aspects of the mission the planning process needs to include all relevant staff disciplines 503 particular consideration must be gi ven to the uks ability to mount an investigation into deaths occurring in custody or any allegations of torture procedures will need to be put in place for securing the scene of the incident it may be crime collecting and preserving evidence and the taking of statements from both uk personnel and local witnesses arrangements to keep family members informed of the progress of investigations and for handling the media aspects of such investigations will also have to be made early advice should be s ought from service police

requirements increase the demands upon units and commanders in the joa the types of predictive analytical tools favoured by j3 and operati onal analysts which suggest likely numbers or types of prisoners can be useful in givi ng an appreciation of the anticipated scale of such operations however they cannot be definitive and jtfc s should balance the likely demands against available resources when formulating plan while recognising that gross underestimate of required resour ces may have adverse consequences the prisoner handling factor should be c onsidered in the estimate process3 and depending on the circumstances may merit an estimate process of its own jtfcs should call for extra resources as the need for them is recognised in advanc of operations taking place

prisoner handling factor in influencing the commanders plan will vary according to the type of operation undertaken and the effects that he wishes to realise in ge neral offensive operati ons will result in more captured or detained persons than defensive operations peace support operations pso will normally result in the holding of cap tured or detained persons where local law enforcement authorities are inadequate or absent the effect of such activities on operations can be quantified as follows the obligation to protect andor gua rd prisoners reduces the number of troops available for other tasking b the logistic requirements place an additional burden on force logistics c the requirement to move captured or detained persons places an additional burden on the transport system d dealing with captured or detained persons can adversely affect the tempo of operations the presence of captured or detained persons in the joint operations area joa may inhibit the co mmanders operational flexibility f the administration of captured or tained persons creates additional pressures on formation staff g the capture of prisoners of war pw and others may result in improved intelligence and situational awareness 5a2 the commanders consideration of th prisoner handling factor in the estimate process will take place in number of steps step 1 the intelligence staff assess wh ether the operation is likely to result in the capture or detention of pers ons in making this assessment they will take into account number of factors 1 the likely outcome of the operation 2 the size of the enemy force 3 the enemys likely courses of action coas 4 the enemys cultural and religious background 5a1 jdp 110 5 the state of the enemys morale 6 the overall progress of the campaign b step 2 if the intelligence received in response to step 1 indicates the likelihood of the operation resulting in the taking of prisoners this is considered under the estimate heading of other relevant factors c step 3 having considered the imp act of prisoners on the plan provision is included in the summary of possible tasks and troops allocated to the task this will normally include the requirement for interp reters to support the intelligence gathering effort ndor to process the prisoners d step 4 once the commander has select ed his coa details of the prisoner handling plan are to be include d in the execution paragraph of his orders depending on the potential impact on the operation the need to make specific plan may be reflected in th concept of operations conops prisoner handling must always be include d in the coordinating instructions for the execution of the plan 5a3 prisoner handling and its effect on an operation will always be one of the planning imponderables rarely will the commande r be able to make plan secure in the knowledge that its success will be guara nteed such planni ng should assume worstcase scenario given the diffuse na ture of contemporary operations prisoners of whatever status may be captured by ny number of different units and across all environments in operations the unexpected almost always happens1 and the unplanned arrival of large numbers of pris oners into the joa can throw plans into chaos 1 during the 1991 gulf war us helicopter squadrons were faced with having to deal with hundreds of iraqi pw who had surrendered when

principles for the transport and escorting of prisoners of war pw internees and detainees it deals primarily with the transport and escorting of the ablebodied escort nd transport arrangement s for the wounded and sick are to be made and carried out in accordance with medical advice1 the transport of prisoners of war internees and detainees 5e2 the evacuation or movement of prison ers from their point of capture or apprehension to the facility where they will re main in captivity may be as simple as move from the collecting point directly to th camp alternatively it may be series of moves through number of staging points over long distances to final destination principles 5e3 whether the move is short or long stag ed or direct number of principles govern the evacuation process for captured individuals2 they should be protected from unn ecessary danger throughout the evacuation where available they are to be issued if necessary with items such as helmets body armour and chemical biological radiological and nuclear cbrn equipment b the evacuation of captured persons is to be conducted humanely they are to be provided with sufficient food of standard similar to that made available to uk troops but account is to be taken of their dietary habits adequate provision for wa ter additional clothing and protection against the elements should be made c evacuation should ideally be direct from collecting point or unit holding area to the pw internment camp or detention facility but where this is not possible there should be as few intermediate holding areas as possible d wounded and sick prisoners are to be evacuated under escort through the same casualty evacuation system as uk troops ambulances are not to be used to transport fit prisoners 1 see annex 5d 2 gc iii 19 and gc iii 20 5e1 jdp 110 prisoners are not to be evacuated out side the theatre unless the move is authorised by mod legal and policy dvice will be called for whenever such extraterritorial evacuations are envisaged3 f once prisoners have arrived at th collecting point their evacuation becomes the responsibility of the prisoner handling organisation commander who will provide the escorting troops for the move to their next destination methods of evacuation movement 5e4 it is unlikely that there will be dedi cated transport for the evacuation of captured persons their movement will ofte n be based on the return journeys of vehicles and aircraft delivering combat supplies forward to the general area from which prisoners are to be moved trans port arrangements will be coordinated by the j1 and j4 staffs at the formation headquart ers concerned the m ovement of prisoners on foot will only be carried out where ther is transport available and immediate evacuation is essential for operational reasons evacuation on foot whilst foot movement may be acceptable for small groups over short distances it is an unsatisfactory method of moving larger numbers over longer distances except as last resort where there is other way of evacuating prisoners from combat zone where there is alternative to the movement of capture d persons on foot the normal support to marching bodies such as straggler tran sport medical support and victualling must be provided for their own prot ection escorts may be mounted in open vehicles but not on motor cycles b evacuation by road movement by vehicle is the most likely method of evacuation vehicles are to be cove red with side and rear flaps secured to reduce the possibility of escape and to sh ield prisoners from media attention whenever possible an evacuation convoy should include recovery and support vehicles escorts should not travel in th rear of vehicles with prisoners and should deploy to cover the whole convoy c evacuation by rail captured persons move d by rail will normally be moved in passenger coaches where this is the case doors are to be locked where possible and escorts should be di spersed along the length of the train in compartments or areas separate from prisoners if passenger coaches are not available and the operational situation re quires the evacuation of individuals in freight vans the doors are to be secured an d escorts are either to travel on their own in every third van with doors open or in mesh enclosures in the vans 3 see paragraph 129 such guidance should be sought through the chain of command 5e2 jdp 110 when the train stops escorts should di smount and deploy to cover the entire length of the train d evacuation by air when being evacuated by air captured persons are to be further searched immediately before entering the aircraft in the aircraft escorts are to be positioned to prevent prisoners gaining access to the flight deck or controls escorts on aircraft ar to be armed with pistols rather than rifles evacuation by ship wherever possible cap tured persons are to be held below decks in secure accommod ation where the nature of the accommodation is unduly restrictive indi viduals are to be allowed on deck in small groups at the discretion of the escort commander they are to be instructed in emergency drills and suffi cient lifesaving equipment is to be provided for those embarked the escort 5e5 role of the escort the role of the escort is both to protect and prevent able bodied pw internees or detainees from escapi ng or being liberated the responsibility of an escort for those in its charge begins at the despatching facility and ends when they are handed over to the staff of the destination facility 5e6 the size of escorts the escort is to consist of formed body of troops each situation will be different and local f actors will determine the number of escorts required sufficient to ter escape attempts planning the move 5e7 in order to plan the move the fo llowing details must be ascertained the number of prisoners to be escorted this is key factor in determining the size of the escort b the condition and morale of the prisoners tired and cooperative captives do not need as many escorts as those who are fresher and better motivated c the method of movement movement on foot offers more opportunities for escape than vehicle mo vement certain types of movement such as movement by truck train and air require specific precautions to be taken by the escort 5e3 jdp 110 d the terrain the terrain across which the prisoners are to be moved will influence the numbers in the esco rt and the method of movement for example movement across close or diffi cult terrain will usually call for more escorts than movement across desert enemy activity any likelihood of enemy interference with the move will require an escort capable of taki ng offensive action to protect itself and keep prisoners under escort f the location of other units on the route before departure the escort should familiarise itself with the location of units on its planned route in order to be able to seek assistance or make rest stops in the course of the journey g the communications plan the escort is to be in communication at all times with the headquarters of the formation through whose area of operations it is moving 5e4 jdp 110
