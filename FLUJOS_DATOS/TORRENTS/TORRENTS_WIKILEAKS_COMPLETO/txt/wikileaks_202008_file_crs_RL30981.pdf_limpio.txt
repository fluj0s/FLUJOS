discussions to determine if there was mutual interest in the united states maintaining military presence in panama beyond the end of 1999 those talks never materialized but instead there were series of bilateral talks regarding us contribution to multinational c ounternarcotics center mcc president pérez balladares had announced in july 1996 that pa nama would be willing to allow the united states to use howard air force base at cost as an international drug interdiction center he stated that panama would provide the facility free of charge as part of our contribution to the drug war talks on potential mcc began in late november 1996 and ultimately led to tentative agreement announced december 24 1997 on the establishment of mcc with the united states contributing troops for the center despite the tentative accord progress on final agreement wa s stymied during 1998 and on september 25 1998 both countries announced that they were ending the mcc talks without final accord httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30981crs27 as described in the press the m cc would have invol ved about 2000 us troops operating at howard air force base rodman naval station and fort kobbe on the pacific

states would have been expected to pay for such facilities as housing the m cc reportedly would have been established for 12year period renewable for additi onal fiveyear periods with the potential participation of other latin american nations reporte dly the mcc would have had directors council made up of the foreign ministers of participating countries and presided over by panamas foreign minister if the united states and panama had agreed on the mcc the next step woul d have been for panamas legislative assembly to approve the agreement which then would have been subject to national referendum in panama as early as april 1998 the clinton admin istration had expr essed concern that negotiations would have to be concluded soon or the ited states would be forced to locate the us antidrug operations else where although the text of the draft mcc accord was not made public press reports indicated that one problem in the negotiations was provision that would permit us soldiers to engage in other missions beyond counternarcotics pana ma and several latin american nations expected to join the mcc expressed reserva tions about this aspect of the accord with concerns centered on the potential for us military intervention in the region us officials however maintained that u s military activities be yond antinarcotics work would consist of such benign activities as search and rescue and disaster relief another reported problem in th negotiations was the us rejection of panamas call to allow change in the agreement whereby the center could be dissolved after three years if the drug trafficking problem diminished some participants including former ambassador thomas mcnamara the lead negotiator in the talks with panama believe that the main reason that an agreement was not reached was panamas internal politics while pana manian opinion polls overwhelmingly favored continued us military presence the president appeared concerned about vocal opposition even from within his own party to the proposed center moreover president pérez balladares was actively seeking constitutional change for second term of office and th is appeared to have influenced the mcc negotiations in early december 1998 us officials announced that they had begun talks with several latin american countries to find ne w bases of operation in central and south america for the antidrug missions former ly undertaken in pa nama shortterm interim agreements were concluded in april 1999 to have forward operating locations fols in ecuador aruba and curaçao for u s aerial counternarcotics missions

panama to consider whether the two nations should allow the pe rmanent stationing of us forces in panama past 1999 twelve years earlier congress had approved the pa nama canal act of 1979 pl 9670 section 1111 which st ates that it is the sense of the congress that the best interests of the united states require that the president enter into negotiations with panama for the purpose of arranging

not expressed interest in regaining us military presence in the country and believed that it could jeopardize talk s underway with panama for visiting forces agreement the state department ex pressed opposition to the bill for several reasons it maintained that th ere was lack of credible support in panama for any agreement to reestablish us military presence there that the quid pro quo nature of the offer to pana ma would give the appearance of the united states paying rent for the right to establish military presence and us policy was not to pay rent for foreign bases or base righ ts and

with concern to incursions of colombian narcotraffickers into the darien jungle region of panama despite the polls panamanian opponents to the mcc were vocal and staged protests at various times in
