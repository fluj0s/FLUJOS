the supreme court has expressed an intere st that congress be able to legislate against background of clear interpretive rule s so that it may know the effect of the language it adopts this re port identifies and scribes some of the more important rules and conventions of inte rpretation that the court app lies although this report focuses primarily on the courts methodolog in construing statutory text the courts approach to reliance on legisla tive history are also briefly described in analyzing statutes text the court is guided by the basic principle that statute should be read as harmonious whole with its separate parts being interpreted within their broader statutory c ontext in manner that furthers statutory purpose the various canons of interpretation and presumptions as to substantive results are usually subordinated to interpretations that further clearly expressed congressional purpose the court frequently relies on canons of construction to draw inferences about the meaning of statutory language for example in considering the meaning of particular words and phrases the cour t distinguishes between terms of art that may have specialized meanings and other wo rds that are ordinarily given dictionary definition other canons direct that all word s of statute be given effect if possible that term used more than once in st atute should ordinarily be given the same meaning throughout and that specific statutory language ordinarily trumps conflicting general language ordinarily is necessary caveat since any of these canons gives way if context reveal s an evident contrary meaning not infrequently the court stacks the deck and subordina tes the general linguistic canons of statutory construction as well as othe r interpretive principles to overriding presumptions that favor particular s ubstantive results the court usually requires clear statement of congressi onal intent to nega one of these presumptions commonly invoked presum ption is that congress does not intend to change judgemade law other presump tions disfavor preemption of state law and abrogation of state immunity from suit in federal court congress must also be very clear if retroactive application of statute or repeal of an existing law is intended the court tries to avoid an interpretation that would raise serious doubts about statutes constitutionality other presumptions that are overridden only by clear statement of congressi onal intent are also id entified and describedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97589contents s t t u t r t x t2 i n g n r l s t t u t r c n

general principles and recent trends this report sets forth brief overvie w of the supreme courts approach to statutory interpretation1 the bulk of the report descri bes some of the courts more important methods of construi ng statutory text and the remainder briefly describes the courts restraint in relying on legislative history the court has expressed an interest that congress be ab to legislate against b ackground of clear interpretive rules so that it may know the ffect of the language it adopts2 in reading statutes the supreme court applies various rules nd conventions of in terpretation and also sometimes superimposes various presumptions favoring particular substantive results other conventions ssist the court in determinin g whether or not to consider legislative history although there is so overlap and incons istency among these rules and conventions and lthough the courts pathway th rough the mix is often not clearly foreseeable an understanding of interpretational possib ilities may nonetheless lessen the burdens of statut ory drafting and aid congre ss in choosing among various drafting options executive order 12988 which provides gu idance to executive agencies on preparing legislation contains useful ch ecklist of considerations to keep in mind when drafting legislation3 many items on the checklist are topics addressed in this report and many of the c ourt decisions cited under thos topics have resulted from the absence of clear statutory guidance consideration of the checklist may facilitate clarification of congressional intent and may thereby lessen the need for litigation as means to resolve ambiguity in legislationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97589crs2 4 it is because congress is free to change this courts interpretation of its legislation that the court adheres more strictly to the doctrine of stare decisis in the area of statutory construction than in the area of constitutional interpretation where amendment is much more difficult neal v united states 516 us 284 295 1996 quoting illinois brick co v illinois 431 us 720 736 1977 shepard v united states 544 us 13 23 2005 stare decisis is usually the wise policy for

under legislative history infra p 39 7 united savings assn v timbers of in wood forest associates 484 us 365 371 1988 citations omittedof course congress can always amend statute to require result different from that reached by the court in interpreting statutes the court recognizes that legislative power resides in congress and that congress can legislate away interpretations with which it disagrees4 congress has revisited statutory issues fairly frequently in order to override or counter the courts interpretations5 corrective amendment can be lengthy and timeconsuming process however and congress in most instances will probably wish to st ate its intent clearly the first time around statutory text in general statutory context and purpose the starting point in statutory constructi on is the language of the statute itself the supreme court often recites the plain m eaning rule that if the language of the statute is clear there is n eed to look outside the statute to its legislative history in order to ascertain the statutes meaning6 it was once axiomatic that this rule was honored more in the breach than in the obs ervance however the court has begun to place more emphasis on statutory text and less emphasis on legislative history and other sources extrinsic to that text more often than before statutory text is the ending point as well as the st arting point for interpretation cardinal rule of construc tion is that statute shoul d be read as harmonious whole with its various parts being interpre ted within their broader statutory context in manner that furthers statutory purposes justice scalia who has been in the vanguard of efforts to redi rect statutory construction to ward statutory text and away from legislative history has aptly characterized this general approach statutory construction is holis tic endeavor provision that may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remai nder of the statutory scheme because the same terminology is used elsewhere in context that makes its meaning clear or because only one of the permissible meanin gs produces substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law7 this was not novel approach in 1850 chief justice taney described the same process in expounding statute we must not be guided by single sentence or member of sentence but look to the provisions

statutory meaning the court moreover presumes that congress legislates with knowledge of ou r basic rules of st atutory construction10 this report sets forth number of such rule s conventions and presumptions that the court has relied on it is well to keep in mind however that the overriding objective of statutory construction is to effectuate statutory purpo as justice jackson put it more than 50 years ago however well these rules may serve at times to decipher legislative intent they long have been s ubordinated to the doctr ine that courts will construe the details of an act in confor mity with its dominating general purpose will read text in the light of context and will interpret the text so far as the meaning of the words fairly permits so as to carry out in particular

courts determine the meaning of legislation and in interpreting statute court should always turn first to one cardinal canon before all others courts must presume that legislature says in statute what it means and means in statute what it says there when the words of statute are mbiguous then this first canon is also the last judicial inquiry is complete12 the court takes much the same approach when it chooses congressional intent rather than statutory text as its touchstone canon of construction should not be followed when application would be tantamount to formalistic disregard of congressional intent13 canons of construction are ba sically contextdependent rules of thumb that is to say canons are general principles many of them of the commonsense variety for drawing inferences about the meaning of language since language derives much of its meaning from context canons should not be treated as rules of law but rather as axioms of experience that do not preclude consideration of persuasive contrary evidence if it exists14 context can provide that contrary evidence many of the difficulties that have been identif ied with reliance on ca nons of construction can be avoided if their importance is not overemphasized if they are considered tools rather than rules there are so many canons that there is apparent conflict am ong some of them 1950 article by professor karl llewellyn attempted to demonstrate that many canons can be countered by equally correct but opposing canons15 the case was somewhat strained since in some instances llewellyn relied on statements in court opinions that were not so generally accepte d as to constitute canons nonetheless the clear implication was that canons are us eless because judges may pick and choose among them to achieve whatever result is desired the supreme court had to deal with such conflict in ruling on the retroac tive effect of the civil rights act of 1991 there were seemingly contradictory statements in earlier decisions declaring general principles that on the one hand cour t is to apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision and on the othe r hand that retroactivity is not favored in

it may have had an accepted and specialized meaning at common law22 in each of these situations the accepted meaning governs23 and the word or phrase is considered technical term or term of art justice jackson explained why this reliance is appropriate24 where congress borrows terms of art in which are accumulated the legal tradition and meaning of centuries of pr actice it presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word in the body of learning from which it was taken and the meaning its use will convey to the judicial mind unless otherwis instructed in such case absence of contrary direction may be taken as satisfaction with widely accepted definitions not as departure from them ordinary meaning and di ctionary definitions words that are not terms of art and that are not statutorily defined are customarily given their ordinary meanin gs often derived from the dictionary25 thus the court has relied on regular dictionary definitions to interpret the word marketing as used in the plant variety protection act26 and the word principal as used to modify taxpayers place of business for purposes of an income tax deduction27 and relied on blacks law dictionary for the more specialized meaning of the word cognizable as used in the federal tort claims act to identify certain causes of action28 of course application of dictionary

that skilled drafters can be expected to apply good grammar53 the court has also found plain meaning resulting from verb tense54 the court remains reluctant however to place primary importance on punctuation statutes plain meaning must be enforced and the meaning of statute will typically heed the commands of its punctuation55 so said the court not however in applying plain meanin g consistent with punctuation but instead while justifying departure from that meaning the court went on to explain that purported plain meaning analysis ba sed only on punctuation is necessarily incomplete and runs the risk of distorting statutes true meaning56 overwhelming evidence from the structure language and subject matter of the lawled the court to conclude that in this unusual case the punctuation at issue was the result of simple scriveners error 57 while the court has relied on comma placement to find that plain meaning was mandated by the grammatical structure of the statute the court in that cas also found other support for its reading58 perhaps more typical was the courts refusal to apply the rule that modifying clause modifies the last antecedent even t hough it could easily have

ordinarily the court does not require reference to specific pplications of general authority but in this instance hardly an ordinary case the cour t majority attached importance to the fdas

it safe to assume that congress can or will address directly and explicitly all issues that may arise as one court has aptly put it not every silence is pregnant in some cases congress intends silence to rule out particular statutory application while in others congress sile nce signifies merely an expectation that nothing more need be said in order to ffectuate the relevant legislative objective in still other instances silence may reflect the fact that congress has not considered an issue at all an inference drawn from congressional silen ce certainly cannot be credited when it is contrary to all other textual and contextual evidence of congressional intent80 occasionally however the court identifies pregnant statutory silence as for example when that silence contrasts with consistent pattern in federal statutes under which departures from general rule had been expressly authorized81 while congress cannot be expect ed to anticipate and address all issues that may arise the court does sometimes assume that congress will address major issues at least in the context of amendment c ongress does not alter the fundamental details of regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary

rative interpretation when court reviews an agencys formal interpretation of statute that the agency administers and when the statute has not removed agency discretion by compelling particular disposition of the matter at issue courts defer to any reasonable agency interpretation this is the chevron rule announced in 1984117 in two decisions one in 2000118 and one in 2001119 the court clarified and narrowed chevrons application ruling that chevron deference applies only if an agencys interpretation is the product of formal agency process such as adjudication or noticeandcomment rulemaking through wh ich congress has authorized the agency to speak with the force of law120 other agency interpretations that are made without the protections of formal and public process are reviewed under pre chevron principles set forth in skidmore v swift co 121 if chevron applies the first question is w hether congress s directly spoken to the precise question at issue122 if the court employing the traditional tools of statutory construction determines that congress s addressed the precise issue then that is the end of the matter because the law must be given effect123 but if the statute does not directly address the i ssue the court does not simply impose its own construction of the statute but rather determines whether the agencys answer is based on permissible c onstruction of the statute124 on its face the chevron rule is quite deferentia l and was perceived as significant break from the multifactored approach that preceded it one would expect that courts conclusion as to wh ether congress has dir ectly spoken to the issue would be decisive in most cases that most of the myriad of issues that can arise in the administrative setting would not be directly addressed by statute and that consequently courts would most often defer to what are found to be reasonable agency interpretations125 surprisingly however chevron did not usher in an era of increased deference by

definitions of the food drug and cosmetic actproceed to the second more ferential step of the inquiry126 the court has also found that even though congress has left the matter for agency resolution the agencys interpretation is unreasonable127 how the court determines whether congre ss has directly addr essed an issue takes on critical importance chevron is not strong clear statement rule since the court has considered legislative history as well as text in assessing the controlling weight of statute128 and even when relying solely on text the court has not adhered strictly to the original chevron stepone formulation sometimes instead employing broad textualist approach that emphasizes plain meaning and abandons inquiry into whether congress s addressed the precise question at issue129 this plain meaning alternative has the effect of expanding the circumstances under which the court can resolve case on statutory grounds rather than proceeding to stage two and deferring to an agencys interpretation the court has recognized that there are some circumstances in which it is less likely that congress intended to leave re solution of statutory ambiguity to the administering agency130 thus in holding that the fda lacked authority to regulate tobacco products the court concluded th at congress could not have intended to delegate decision of such economic and political significance to an agency in so cryptic fashion131 rather than finding chevron analysis inapplicable however the court ruled that congress had directly spoken to the regulatory issue not through the fdca itself but rather thr ough subsequently enacted tobaccospecific legislation and through rejec tion of legislative proposals to confer jurisdiction on the fda132 in another case the court deemed deference to

resort the weight of such judgment in particular case willagency interpretation invokes the outer limits of congress power and there is clear indication that c ongress intended that result133 logical consequence of applying chevron is to render irrelevant whether an agency interpretation was contemporaneous with statutes enactment or whether an agencys position has been consistent over the years neither antiquity nor contemporaneity with the stat ute is condition of validity134 the fact that an agency has changed its position over the years is not fatal because the whole point of chevron is to leave the discretion provided by the ambiguities of statute with the implementing agency135 the supreme court has also ruled in national cable telecommunications assn v brand x internet services brand x that federal court must defer to reasonable agency interpretation of an ambi guous statute even if prior to the agency interpretation the circuit has adopted differing interpretation in an opinion136 the only time prior judicial interpretation of statute trumps an agency interpretation is when the federal court s interpretation flows from an unambiguous reading of the statute137 agency interpretations that take place in the many less formal contexts where chevron deference is inapplicable eg opinion letters policy statements agency manuals and enforcement guidelines all of which lack the force of law138 can still be entitled to respect under the skidmore decision139 but only to the extent that they have the power to persuade140 to make this dete rmination courts look

through strained reading the court concluded that doing so would thwart the maximum age laws sense and purpose the stewart court relied on legislative history to find clear congressional intent to empl oy maximum entry ages as means towards securing young and vigorous work force of law enforcement officers and concluded that furtherance of this policy required cons ideration of factors not ordinarily accounted for under adea procedures 147 watt v alaska supra n146 at 266such factors as whether an interpretation dealt with technical and complex matters that fell within an area of agency expertise141 whether an agencys decision was well reasoned142 whether the agencys interpretation was contemporaneous with the statutes enactment143 and whether the agencys inte rpretation was longstanding or consistent144 repeals by implication if congress intends one statute to repeal an earlier statute or section of statute in toto it usually says so directly in the repealing act there are other occasions when congress intends one statute to supersede an earlier statute to the extent of conflict but intends the earlier statute to remain in effect for other purposes this too is often spelled out usually in s ection captioned effect on existing law construction with other laws or the like it can be strongly presumed that congress will specifically ddress language on the statute books that it wishes to change145 not infrequently however conflicts arise between the operation of two federal statutes that are silent as to their relationship in such case courts will try to

statute has been identified than the rule of lenity which counsels resolution of ambiguities in penal statutes in favor of defendants171 absence of this principle from the current courts lexic on

statement that it is the sense of congress that something should be done is merely precatory and creates legal rights191 in the appropriate context sen of congress language can have the same effect as statements of congressional purpose that of resolving ambiguities in more specific language of operative sections of law but if that is the intent the more straightforward approach is to declare purpose rather than sense192 savings clauses savings or saving clauses are design ed to preserve remedies under existing law the purpose of savings clause is merely to nix an inference that the statute in which it appears is intended to be the exclusive remedy for harms caused by the violation of the statute193 corollary is that savings clause typically does not create cause of action194httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97589crs34 195 even if there is conflict courts may construe savings clause narrowly see eg city of rancho palos verdes v abrams 544 us 113 125 2005 relief is not

regulatory program that elim inated previously available federal common law remedies savings language in the citizen suit section providing that nothing in this section shall restrict any right which any pe rson may have under common law was irrelevant since it was the acts standardssetting and permitting provisions not the citizen suit section that ousted federal common law 199 see eg geier v

that the federal boat safety acts savings clause providing that compliance with federal standards does not relieve person from liability at common law buttresses the conclusion that the acts preemption language does not encompass common law claimsinclusion of savings clause however does not make all preexisting remedies compatible with the newly enacted law if there is conflict the savings clause gives way195 courts will attempt to give the savings language some effect but may have to narrow that effect to avoid eviscerating the new law reference to specific remedies to be preserved can ease interpretation196 in some cases the legislative history of the savings provi sion can reveal its purpose197 in other cases courts must reason from the scope and purpose of the ne w statute for example when the carmack amendment to the interstate commerce act imposed comprehensive federal regulation governing the liability of interstate carriers the court held that savings language preserving any remedy or right of action under existing law applied only to federal not state remedies to allow resort to state law remedies that were inconsistent with the federal regulation would negate the amendments effect the act cannot be said to stroy itself the court concluded198 even very clear savings language will not be allowed to thwart what the court views as the objective of the federal enactment199httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97589crs35 200 in this sense the statutory phrase is anal ogous to parent telling child dont under any circumstances leave the house until i return th

provision of law congress sometimes underscores statutory directives by requiring that they be undertaken notwithstanding any other provi sion of law this phrase seldom aids interpretation it is the stat utory equivalent of parent telling child im serious or i really mean it despite the adm onition courts and administrators still must determine what the underlying directive m eans and ordinarily there will still be other provisions of law that apply the trick is to determine which ones200 courts have recognized these difficulties one court for example ruled that directive to proceed with offering and awarding of timb er sale contracts notwithstanding any other provision of law meant only notwithstanding any provision of environmental law and did not relieve the forest service from complying with federal contracting law requirements governing such matters as nondiscr imination small business set asides and export restrictions201 we have repeatedly held that the phrase notwithstanding any other law is not always construed literally and does not require the agency to disregard all otherwise applicable laws202 in the few instances in which the notwithstanding phrase may be marginally helpful to interpretation it still must play second fiddle to clear and unambiguous statement of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97589crs36 203 see eg schneider v united states 27 f3d 1327

final and conclusive does not preclude judicial review but merely cuts off other administrative remedies noting different possible interpretati ons of final final and conclusive and the provisions

the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted the right to recover damages from the party in default is implied207 the court has gradually retreated from that position208 and now is willing to find an implied private right of action only if it c oncludes that congress intended to create one this raises an obvious question if congress intended to create cause

but instead is unclear or ambiguous228 significant differences arise however in the willingness of courts to label particular statutory language as am biguous and thereby legitimize resort to legislative history some judges are more confident than others in their ability to interpret statutory text and some are more convinced than others of the propriety of attempting to do so without resort to the extrinsic aid of legislative history229 correspondingly there are basic differences in approach from narrow focus on the clarity or ambiguity of the particular statutory phrase at issue to recognition that phrases that may seem ambiguous in is olation may be clarified by statutory context230 and inevitably there are real diffe rences in the clarity of statutory language231

little interpretati onal weight should be given to signing statements article i section 7 clause 2 of the us constitution provides that after congress passes bill and presents it to the president if he appr oves he shall sign it but if not he shall return it with his objections to that house in which it shall have originated who shall enter the objections at large on their journal and proceed to reconsider it several observations about this language are possible first the president is required to set forth objections to bill he vetoes but there is parallel requirement that he set forth his reasons for approving bill correspondingly there is procedure fo r congressional consideration of the presidents objections and for reconsideration of the bill following veto but procedure for congressional response following signing of course absence of constitutionally recognized procedure does not require that the presidents views be discounted after all the cons titution is also silent bout committee reports floor debates and other components of legislative history but such absence does suggest that the presidents views should be discounted when they conflict with congressional explanations otherwise entitled to weight rule for resolving conflicts in legislative hi story provides guidance here when the two houses have disagreed on the meaning of identical language in bill that did not go to conference the explanation that was before both houses ie the explanation of the originating house prevails if the court relies on legislative history at all the rationale is that congressional intent shoul d depend upon the actions of both houses by unanimously passing the senate bill without amendment the house denied the entire senate an opportunity to object r concur to its interpretation272 similarly because congress has opportunity to respond to interpretations set forth in signing statements courts should not use thos interpretations to change meaning273 second observation about the constitutiona l text is that the president has choice of approving or disapproving bill in its entirety and may not disapprove some portions while approving others t only does the president lack lineitem veto but congress cant grant the president such authority by statute274 givinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97589crs50 275 signing statements allegedly have been used for this purpose the president had used the signing statement to effectively nullify wide range of statutory provisions even as he signed the legislation that contai ned them into law phillip j cooper george w bush edgar allen poe and the use and abuse of pres idential signing statements 35 presidential studies quarterly 515 2005 276 garber and wimmer supra n269 at 376 277 it may be appropriate for the president when signing legislati on to explain what his and congresss intention was in making the legislation law particularly if the administration has played significant part in moving the legislation through congress 17 op off legal counsel supra at 136 278 though in some circumstances there is r oom for doubt as to the weight to be accorded presidential signing statement in illuminating congressional intent president reagans views are significant here because the execu tive branch participated in the negotiation of the compromise legislation united stat v story 891 f 2d 988 994 2d cir 1989 279 supra p 23 280 if congress has directed that the president rather than an agency implement statute then by analogy it can be argued that c ongress has implicitly delegated to the president whatever policymaking authority is necessary to fill in gaps and implement the statutory rule but here again the signing statement would not usually constitute an act of implementation 281 the constitutions vesting in the presiden t of the executive power and of the duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed implies authority to inte rpret the law in ordereffect to signing statement that would negate statutory provision275 can be considered analogous to line item veto276 the presidents signing statement explanations of bill language may be entitled to more weight if the president or his administration worked closely with congress in developing the legislation and if the pproved version incorporated the presidents recommendations277 this principle can be applied not only to bills introduced at the administrations behest but also to bills the final content of which resulted from compromise negotiations between the administration and congress278 i n s u c h circumstances of course signing statements are used to explain rather than negate congressional action and are most valuab as lending suppor t to congressional explanations even if presidential signing statements s hould not be treated as significant part of legislative history they may still affect interpretation as directives to administering agencies as explained above under deference to administrative interpretations279 courts are highly deferential to interpretations of agencies charged with implementingstatutes such deference however is pr emised on the conclusion that congress has authorized the agency to speak with the force of law through rulemaking or other formal process congress has not authorized the president to speak with the force of law through signing statements so lthough signing statements may influence or even control agency implementation of stat utes it is the implementation and not the signing statement itself that would be measured against the statutes requirements 280 at most signing statements might be considered analogous to informal agencyactions entitled to respect only to the extent that they have the power to persuade
