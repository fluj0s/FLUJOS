from jonathan overpeck jtouarizonaedu to ricardo villalba ricardolabcricyteduar subject re wg1ar4ch06 fw section on modes of variability date thu 16 dec 2004 173703 0700 cc kbriffaueaacuk peltieratmospphysicsutorontoca eystein jansen eysteinjansengeouibno hi ricardo good to hear from you thanks too for the interesting figure i have some comments on this section 654 and also for the others youre helping to lead regarding 654 i hope dick and keith will have jump in to help you lead and i can too i think the hardest yet most important part is to boil the section down to 05 pages in looking over your good outline sent back on oct 17 my delay is due to fatherdom just after this time you cover alot the trick may be to decide on the main message and use that to guid whats included and what is left out for the ipcc we need to know what is relevant and useful for assessing recent and future climate change moreover we have to have solid data not inconclusive information my take enso coral records sensitive to enso eg urban et and cobb et attached suggest enso has changed in response to past forcing change cobb et updated interp by mann et see recent email attachment and recent climate change urban et ditto for indian ocean not sure if can connect to dipole i could ask julie cole nao lots of papers and whats the consensus im not sure but i think it is that we cant say for sure what has happend to the nao or ao for sure keith might more recent ed cook paper might be the key im not an expert here same thing for pdo not an expert but arent their recons that dont agree see cole et for one attached in both these cases the recons dont always agree or do they say the nao variability has stayed pretty constant tropical atlantic black et 1999 attached to prev email also says 12year mode consensus if diapole is the correct name for what chang first described see ref in black attached has been constant for 800 years annual modes does paleo have anything definitive to say yet im coauthor on soon to be submitted ao recon paper but im not sure reviewers will go for it nor does it match darrigos recent ao recon paper cant find so the trick is for you to lead us dick keith maybe julie enso expert to produce 05 pages of highly focused and relevant stuff can you take another crack at your outline and then tell us what you need thanks regarding 659 can you help dan ramesh and others to make quick headway on this one its totally missing thanks regarding 6321 keith will need help doubt particularly with good s hemisphere perspective he can override on this but since im contacting you thanks what do we have for the southern hem southern s america new zealand tasmania ice core regarding 6322 whats your opinion of where this section stands thanks hope you are enjoying summer although tucson never gets that cold best peck original message from 1ricardo villalba to sent thursday december 16 2004 255 pm subject fw section on modes of variability dear ipcc colleagues please find attached preliminary draft of the proposed figure for the section modes of variability the caption follows best regards modes of variability figure caption coherent modes of climate variability across the pacific ocean during the past four centuries the upper part of this figure compare temperaturesensitive treering records red triangles from highlatitude western north and south america with geochemical coral record yellow triangle from raratonga tropical south pacific the series shown from top to bottom are springsummer gulf of alaska temperature reconstruction 16001994 wiles et 1998 srca coral record from rarotonga 17261996 linsley et 2004 and annual northern patagonia temperature reconstruction 16411989 villalba et 2003 correlation coefficients between records are indicated to facilitate the comparison the srca coral record is shown reversed interdecadal to centennial variability in each time series was isolated by using singular spectrum analysis ssa lower part of the figure for each record all ssa reconstructed components with mean frequencies longer than 20 years where summed correlation coefficients between these longterm modes of variability are also shown thin and thick arrows indicate coincidences in oscillations between the raratonga and one or two highlatitude records respectively linsley b g wellington d schrag l ren m
