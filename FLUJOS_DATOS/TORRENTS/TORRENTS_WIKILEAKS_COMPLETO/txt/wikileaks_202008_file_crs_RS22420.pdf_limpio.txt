as an incentive to encourage conservation of the endangered species in the wild this policy has generated controversy some contend that the take of endangered species in foreign countries cannot be controlled and may lead to the reduction of many endangered species further some contend that the proposed policy is vague in describing how funds generated from the harvesting of endangered species will be transferred to conservation programs the fish and wildlife service and some supporters of the policy contend that limited harvesting of endangered species will create an overall beneﬁt to the

appendix ii are not necessar ily threatened with ex tinction but trade must be controlled to avoid exploitation that would th reaten their survival and species in appendix iii are protected in at least one c ountry which has asked others for assistance in controlling trade 6 proposed policy 7 ibid 8 see pl 93205 10a1abackground nearly 40 of all species listed under the endangered species act have natural habitat ranges outside the united states although foreign and domestic species are treated equally in the listing process under the ie use the same biological criteria for listing most of the conser vation provisions listed under the are not applied to foreign species some examples include habitat and rec overy planning state grant programs and those prohibitionof take3 provisions that are limited to actions taken within the united states territorial seas of the united states or high seas ie actions committed by persons under the jurisdiction of the united states the specifically addresses foreign species unde r 8 and 8a of pl 93205 as amended these sections authorize the united states to provide fina ncial assistance suppor t foreign conservation programs including participation in multilateral or bilateral agreements and send technical assistance to he lp other countries with species listed under the esa4 the also implements the convention on the international trade of endangered and threatened species of wild flora and fauna cites cites parallels the by dividing its listed species into groups according to the estimated risk of extinction but uses three major categories rather than two5 in contrast to the cites focuses exclusively on trade and does not consider or attempt to control habitat loss proposed policy according to the fish and wildlife service fws the incentives the united states can use to encourage conservation of fore ign species are limited under existing laws and treaties6 one venue for conserving species according to the fws proposed policy is through permits that would allow imports of foreign listed species or their parts or products7 these permits would allow imports of endangered species into the united states for scientific research and for the enhancement of survival of the species in their range country ie country where the popula tion of the species in question exists8 enhancement of survival implies that the import of endangered animals or their parts or products will provide incentives for increasing the survival of the species in its nativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22420crs3 9 proposed policy 10

ibidhabitat for example if trophy hunter s are allowed to harvest limited number of animals and if funds generate d by their activities eg thr ough permits or taxes are transferred to conservation program that supports populati on of the same species then some contend the limited take of individuals through hunting could enhance the species by providing an incentive for conservation ccording to the fws the authority to issue these types of permits already exists however in the past the guidelines allowing these permits to be issued have been interpreted narrowly which has resulted in few permits being issued9 the proposed policy is expected to provide new way of looking at the basis of findings under existing regulations that allow for enhancementofsurvival permits10 the specific guidelines to apply for an enhancementofsurvival permit are found at 50 cfr 1722 and 1732 the proposed policy is expected to provide guidance for considering the issuance of enhancementofsurvival permits under 10a1a of the the permits would allow imports of foreignlisted species or thei r parts or products under limited circumstances when substantive conservation program fo r the species exists and the import or export of the species meets all relevant requirements and re solutions of cites11 protected species are organized under cites in to three appendices species in appendix i are threatened with extinction and trade in these species is prohibited for commercial purposes appendix ii contains species not necessarily threatened with extinction but which require controlled trade to prevent popul ation declines for species protected in appendix iii at least one c ountry has requested other countri to assist in regulating trade originating in that country under th proposed policy if species is listed under appendix i of cites it must meet the cites re quirements for trade to be considered for permit under this proposed policy the cons ervation program must be established and shown to offset the limited take of individual animals through the conservation of the species in the range country the applica tion process would follow guidelines listed in the current federal regulations and notice of each application would be published in the federal register the applicant must provide information that would allow the fws to conclude that the species in question woul d obtain net benefit from its conservation program if imports of the species or its pa rts or products are allowed into the united states further substantial contribution to the conservation of the species in the wild through direct or indirect means must result12 it is unclear what the parameters and form of this contribution must be decisions on permits would be made on casebycase basis for each species several species that could serve as examples of the potential application of the proposed policy are listed in the policy these species include morelets crocodile

countries othe rs appreciate the concept of the policy but would like to have solid evidence that trade would actually benefit animals in the wild13 some environmental groups have responded to this proposed policy with skepticism on its possible effects on endanger ed species and contend that the policy is too vague and may spur an increase in smuggling14 further some groups contend that the policy places too much responsibility on the range country for operating and maintaining conservation programs the department of the interior contends that permits will only be given if substa ntive conservation program is in place and is enhancing the survival of the species the doi further states that the preced ents for these permits already exist for some of the species that are listed as th reatened under the and some species that are listed under cites15
