6209c20 shspec192 geriatrics gerontology never solved geriatrics but we have you should understand that one of mans longest searches has been search for longevity geriatrics is the study of living longer lrhs research at oak knoll naval hospital suggested that the mind could change the body more than the body and physical substances could change the mind you can always get function or thought to monitor structure but you cant always get structure to monitor thought medicos got this messed up because it is usually so obvious when structure monitors thought if you cut guys leg off you generally but not always see his thought change but if you dont get rid of the psychic traumas you wont change someones structure or function change the psychic condition and the structure can change these conclusions are very valuable in the field of geriatrics metchnikoff studied geriatrics as he felt the years creep up he found that theoretically sour milk could extend life indefinitely but he died before age seventy it is odd that there is all this interest in geriatrics given that thetan is indestructible this is actually interest in preserving the body which as it ages irritates the thetan by restricting his activity pc doing well generally looks younger one that is doing poorly looks older in the process of doing dynamic assessment on goals see previous tape you will see rapid change when you get the dynamic and the item and the goal as pc gets listed on the goal he or she looks younger if things go sour the pc looks older we dont know the theoretical age limit for body so we dont know how long clear should live it should be longer than normal anyway if you clear somebody around age thirty you will probably add thirty to forty years to his life if he goes clear at seventy or eighty you might add only five or six years probably the older they are the less you could add to the lifespan the field of geriatrics has the problem of researchers dying out without leaving records and dying out before the length of time it takes to produce results so the researchers are always getting challenged age is normally determinable by the condition of certain body parts functions and cellular structures if you were to examine someone physiologically then clear him then reexamine him you would find that the person was physiologically younger this predetermines that they will live longer people get interested in scientology when you tell them about its geriatric aspects you would think that insurance companies would be interested in the idea of changing someones lifeexpectancy but they are not they are only interested in figures which are based on expectancy of claim payments all figured out by averages etc since the risk is spread out amongst many individuals they dont care about making individuals live longer they could even be against it since it could cost them money so you can get reverse philosophy on this point socialist states and insurance companies realize that if we werent kicking off regularly things would be in terrible state but most people would be far more interested in living longer than they would be interested even in being healthy since being healthy would cost them service facsimile people wish they could live longer even if they dont believe it is possible just doing problems intensive would increase persons life expectancy most people are fighting living longer even if they say they want to lrhs experiments with horticulture using tomato plants produced some tomatoes that were kept in constant temperature and humidity and which were not injured in any way they grew to sixteen feet grew enormous numbers of tomatoes and lived longer lrh found that the life span and resistance to blight of tomato plant is directly related to the amount of punishment the amount of clipping handling topping pruning etc people thought he was interested in horticulture but he wasnt he was interested in geriatrics and longevity plant that is abused will become ill and will die sooner abuse determines 1 longevity 2 susceptibility to illness if you can delete abuse eg by running engrams you pick up the characteristics of not having been abused in the first place ie health and longevity this would apply equally well to human bodies dianetics also pointed to this conclusion see science of survival book ii p 23 in humans if you delete audit out abuse or the consideration that one has been abused you effect the same change in longevity as not having been abused would have made so in disseminating scientology you can talk about longevity and preventing illness on planet that is very fixated on bodies these are good avenues of approach dianetics corresponds to deleting abuse from persons life which is equivalent to avoiding abuse in the tomato plants depression gives rise to symptoms just like an illness you can as dissemination approach use maybe you are not sick maybe you are just depressed you use that instead of suppressed the person will get very interested then give him problems intensive his sickness will frequently disappear you dont tell the person that you will cure anything you are only interested in removing the suppressions of life we have to have bridge from raw meat to clearing and the bridge has to have reality in it the person must be brought to reality on the mind and life say you are running clinic giving problems intensives using repetitive prepchecking people will come out at the other end looking and feeling younger and longer sick this is an area that we have just neglected with our emphasis on clearing in book iii of dmsmh it says that if you can parallel what the mind is doing you can reach the mind and do something for it this is trick to parallel what raw meats mind is doing he is thinking how sick or well am i how young or old am i so how are you means how sick are you today common hidden standard is do i look feel or appear younger if most people are fixated on the body and they are you can use this fact to get in comm with them in effect you are getting guy in session according to the definition of in session before you officially get him in session age is normally hooked onto the body by the thetan himself using engrams and secondaries the limitation on what thought can do for structure is only the thetans consideration the reason you have trouble defining scientology to people is that there is datum of comparable magnitude in this universe so they always put up datum of incomparable magnitude and hang you right away in suppression and disagreement oh its like christian science you say right there you are hung with suppression of him it puts you into disagreement never let him choose the datum of comparable magnitude to scientology give him one his ruin himself what he owns his family his sick mother or wife his health etc this is what is really of comparable magnitude to scientology for him
