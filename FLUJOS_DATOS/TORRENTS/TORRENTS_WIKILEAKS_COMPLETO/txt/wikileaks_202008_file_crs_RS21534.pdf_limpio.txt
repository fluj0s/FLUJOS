became sultan in july 1970 when with british support he forced his father to abdicate he is considered highly popular but his brief marriage in the 1970s produced children and therefore clear

its arsenal is being modernized with purchases from the united states but is not large qaboos early on relied on seconded british officers to command omani military services and much of its arsenal is

550000 foreigners remains monarchy in which decisionmaking still is largely concentrated with sultan qaboos believing that omanis would ultimately demand political reform in the 1980s qaboos embarked on gradual political liberalization in november 1991 he appointed 59seat consultative council expanded to its current size of 84 seats in 1993 replacing tenyear old advisory council in move toward popular selection process in 1994 and 1997 notables in each of omans districts chose up to three nominees with qaboos making final selection the first direct elections to the consultative council were held in september 2000 three year term but the electorate was limited 25 of all citizens over 21 years old in november 2002 qaboos extended voting rights to all citizens male and female over 21 years of age and the october 4 2003 council electionsin which 195000 omanis voted 74 turnoutresulted in council similar to that elected in 2000 including the election of the same two women as in the previous election out of 15 women candidates as in the other gulf states formal political parties are not allowed unlike bahrain or kuwait there are evident groupings or factions within the consultative council and qaboos has constrained the councils authority to mostly public works and social benefits issues it does not draft legislation lacks binding legislative powers and some omanis say the councils influence over policy has diminished over timeto the point where many experts now say oman lags the other gulf states on political reform qaboos appoints the council president he appointed new president in september 2007 replacing sixteen year incumbent although the council chooses two vice presidents in the october 27 2007 election qaboos allowed for the first time public campaigning turnout among 388000 registered voters was 63 including enthusiastic participation by women but none of the 21 female candidates out of 631 candidates won in 1996 basic law qaboos made the legislature bicameral by appointing state council to serve in part as check and balance on the elected consultative council together the two bodies constitute the oman council the state council now has 70 seats up from the original 53 seats the state council appointed following the 2007 election has fourteen women up from nine previously qaboos has given major speeches on the equality of women and their importance in national development and they now constitute about 30 of the work force in march 2003 he named woman to the rank of minister giving that rank to woman in charge of the national authority for industrial craftsmanship in 2004 he added three female ministersof higher education of tourism and of social developmentand these ministries remain headed by women in april 2004 qaboos made five women among the 29 appointees to the public prosecutors office however allegations of spousal abuse and domestic violence are fairly common with women finding protection primarily through their families omani women also continue to face social discrimination often as result of the interpretation of islamic law 4 information in this section is from several state department reports the

not in december 2004 the government arrested 31 ibadhi muslims on suspicion of conspiring to establish religious state but qaboos pardoned them in june 2005 private ownership of radio and television

province during 1964 1975 oman as do the other gcc states publicly opposes any us attack on iran on iraq and generally in line with other gcc states omani officials say that the omani government and population are dismayed at the shiite islamist domination of postsaddam iraq and its proiranian tilt and at the inability of the united states to prevent substantial civilian deaths yet despite moves by other gcc states to open relations with iraq oman has not remitted 3 million it pledged in 2004 for iraq reconstruction nor has it appointed an ambassador in baghdad on the arabisraeli dispute oman was the one of the few arab countries not to break relations with egypt after the signing of the egyptianisraeli peace treaty in 1979 all the gcc states participated in the multilateral peace talks established by the ussponsored madrid peace process but only oman bahrain and qatar hosted working group sessions of the multilaterals oman hosted an april 1994 session of the working group on water and as result of those talks middle east desalination research center was established in oman in september 1994 oman and the other gcc states renounced the secondary and tertiary arab boycott of israel in december 1994 it became the first gulf state to officially host visit by an israeli prime minister yitzhak rabin and it hosted then prime minister shimon peres in april 1996 in october 1995 oman exchanged trade offices with israel essentially renouncing the primary boycott of israel however the trade offices have been closed since the september 2000 palestinian uprising in an april 2008
