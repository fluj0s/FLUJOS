financial crisis it reportedly examined the experience of japan as it grappled with its banking crisis in the 1990s1 this report reviews the major acti ons by the japanese government in dealing with its crisis and highlights some of the lessons learned from their experience like the current us financial crisis japa ns began with stock ma rket and real estate bubbles during the latter half of the 1980s japans monetary authorities flooded the market with liquidity money in order to enable businesses to cope with the rising value of the yen businesses did invest in new capital equipment to become more competitive in international markets but the excess li quidity also found its way into speculation in japans stock market in real estate ventures and in foreign investments at that time the market value of both land and equities was rising so fast that investors and speculators could hardly miss investors nded to ignore risks the larger mistake for them was not to borrow and invest and cons equently not be positioned to reap the returns from risinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22960crs2 2 bank of japan financial and economic statistics monthly various issues 3 japan financial

loans with real estate as collateral as being unquestionably secure then the bubbles burst japans nikkei stock market average peaked in 1989 at 40000 and dropped by 50 in one year and more than twothirds to about 12000 by august 2001 japans banks are allowed to hold equities as part of their capital base the value of the unrealized capital gains on such stock holdings dropped from 355 billion in 1989 to 42 billion in 2001 this drastically reduced key capital reserves for many banks also by 2000 commercial land values in the six major metropolitan areas had fallen by 80 from their peak level in 1991 residential and i ndustrial land values also had fallen by nearly 202 the bursting of this economic bubble caused the value of collateral underlying many bank loans to drop below the value of their loan principal also commercial real estate ventures especially office bu ildings became unprofitable as rents fell as the economy slowed companies also faced excess capacity excess inventories and lower profits also as more and more loans turned sour more nd more of the underlying real estate had to be sold at bargain pr ices in 1995 japans banks reported 280 billion in non performing loans3 but this figure turned out to be vastly understated4 japanese financial institutions at this time however genera lly did bundle and repackage these loans as collateralized debt obligations or rely ex tensively on derivatives or other financial instruments mortgage defaults tended to be on commercial property not on private residences at first the japanese governments st rategy was forbearance strengthening of deposit protection provision of emergency liquidity and some assistance to encourage mergers of failed institutions the crisis worsened in 19951996 following the bankruptcy of several specializ ed housing loan companies jusen in 1996 the government made its first injection of capital to purchase assets from ailing housing lenders this bailout prove d to be quite unpopular politica lly and may have contributed to tentativeness later on the part of government as the downward spiral quickened by 1997 japans banking sector was in full systemic crisis the government responded by making 250 billion 30 tr illion available of which 108 billion 13 trillion went to banks and 142 billion 17 trillion to the deposit insurance corporation of japan in 1998 the

trillion yen or 12 of gross domestic product for th financial support of banks6 for much of the 1990s however the hope of the government was that if it could keep banks operating their profits from opera tions and capital gains from equity holdings could fund the writeoffs of bad loans the ba nk of japan kept its in terest rate for banks low so that they could increase prof its from new lending

lessons and obser vations that observers have gleaned from the japanese experience authorities underes timated the nature and riousness of the banking problem at first most thought the financial problems would resolve themselves through economic grow th and by keeping central bank interest rates low in order to increase bank margins and profitability there was slow recognition of the extent of nonperforming loans and the carrying of zombie firms that technically were bankrupt but were kept alive by banks this layed resolution of the problem transparency and an updating of finitions and reporting requirements with respect to nonperforming loans was important in realizing the true extent of the problems many of the rescues of ailing financial firms by healthier financial institution required government injection of capital in some form there appeared to be lack of domestic or external constraints and ofpolitical leadership that would have urged authorities to take more decisive action earlier 12 the government began by creating new institutions to handle emergencyfinancial assistance but later transferred such activities to the deposit insurance corporation of japan dicj an

united states new england economic review 2001 3 p 3 16 ibidworking with troubled financial ins titutions the dicj also was given permanent authority to assist ailing financial institutions when so ordered by the prime minister the japanese government injected capital into financial institutions inseveral ways depending on the situation in most cases the dicj could use its discretion in determining the nature of the assistance troubled assets were bought at steep discount from their face value from sound financial institutions to inject capital and disposed of without unduly disturbing markets usually within three years the two banks that were nationalized were later sold to private investors capital injections also took the form of subscriptions to stock grants and subordinated loans even with the 495 billion financial bailout packages between 1998 and2003 japans banks wrote off so 318 billion in nonperforming loans the burden was shared government holdings of corporate shares have generated dividend income and capital gains for the dicj since there are fewer banks in japan the authorities could focus recoveryefforts on several large banks and fewer than 200 smaller financial institutions there are about 8500 ba nks in the united states which facilitated information gathering and coordination when japan announced an early financial bailout package it placedstringent conditions on the assistance that banks were unwilling to accept the net result was that the banks ignored the package and tried to bolster their balance sheets by not lending this was seen as worsening the economic conditions for the country 13 most of the assistance to failing institutions how ever carried conditions that were enforced by the dicj new technologies globa lization and the blurring of boundaries between types of financial pr oducts and institutions made risk management increasingly difficult for financial regulators14 the bursting of the real estate bubbl in japan caused more difficulty for banks than the bursting of the bubble in stocks because the decline in real estate values affected the value of collateral on much bank lending15 japan is considered to have acted too slowly with respect to monetary policy fiscal policy and the resoluti on of problems in the banking sector once the economy began to recover fiscal policy is thought to have tightened too soon16
