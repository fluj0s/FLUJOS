veterans affairs va for fy2002 according to congressional estimates the administration requested 507 billion for va programs for fy2002 in passing hr 2620 the house approved 514 billion for va programs for fy2002 the senate version of the bill contained 511 billion the difference was primarily in fund the house bill proposed that would have provided 300 million to upgrade va medical facilities for safety and for corrections of earthquake damages the concurrent resolution on the budget for fy2002 hconres 83 assumed that the ultimate amount appropriated would be 515 billion after improvements to the montgomery gi bill and veterans burial benefits were adopted conferees on the resolution rejected recommendations approved by each house that would have provided for additional va

education payments the entitlement programs are estimated to cost 273 billion during fy2002 veterans housing benefits historically the opportunity for veterans to have home loans guaranteed by the federal government contributed significantly to the national goal of increasing the number of families who owned their own homes because of the guarantees lenders are protected against losses up to the amount of the guarantee thereby permitting veterans to obtain mortgages with little or down payment and with competitive interest rates these guarantees and certain direct loans to specific categories of veterans are obligations of the federal government that constitute mandatory spending administrative expenses are discretionary appropriations transferred from the home loan programs to the general operating expenses account medical care conferees settled on 22022 billion including an estimated 691 million in recycled receipts from cost recoveries as the amount that would be available for va medical care during fy2002 the administration had requested 21671 billion in spending authority for va medical care for fy2002 an increase of 750 million over the 20921 billion

in recovered spending authorit hrept 107159 treats hsif receipts as an offset against mandatory spending in hr 2620 but not specifically as an offset to mandatory spending totals by va srept 10743 estimates 691 million in mccf receipts for fy2002 and is silent on the hsif conferees accepted the senate approach and estimates increasing patient load and expanding access for several years va has been expanding access to medical services by transferring medical personnel slots from inpatient settings to more efficient outpatient care venues as result the unique patient count is projected to continue increasing rising above 4 million annually by the end of fy2001 the longterm decline in inpatient admissions reversed with admissions increasing from an average of 78345 daily inpatients in fy2000 to an estimated 80540 in fy2001 outpatient care is climbing at faster rate and the increase in total patients combined with additional resources for va medical care probably accounts for the increase in inpatient care as more patients examined means more cases identified that might benefit from the intensive services provided on an inpatient basis in spite of the growing caseload va estimates that it will reduce the number of personnel engaged in direct patient care by 1290 staff slots during fy2002 and total employment in va health care will decline by 2200 slots according to va estimates va has enrolled all veterans who applied to its health care plans which are administered by va through 22 regional veterans integrated service networks visns va considered limiting enrollments during fy2002 but va secretary principi announced on novembe r 29 2001 that enrollments of all veterans who sought enrollment would continue for at least another year receipts to the medical care account from recovered costs in addition to funds directly appropri ated to va for medical care the congressional budget office estimates that 639 million more in medical care funding was provided in fy2001 from the medical care cost collections fund mccf the mccf collects payments from insurance companies with joint coverage of veterans receiving care in va facilities and from veterans obligated to share in the cost of their va medical care proceeds of the fund are returned to va medical care programs primarily to the facilities responsible for their collection the millennium health care act pl 106117 also made available to the medical care program proceeds from improved use of va capital assets including rental of space contracting for services and sale of surplus facilities pl 106117 authorized va to increase prescription drug copayments 2 monthly per prescription for veterans ineligible for free prescriptions while establishing maximum annual and monthly copayment for veterans with multiple prescriptions the new law also authorized va to modify the outpatient copayment for higher income veterans funds collected through the new authorizations are to be deposited in the health services improvement fund hsif which the act authorized va to establish to receive these additional copayments as well as reimbursements from the department of defense dod for certain military retirees served by va and funds collected under arrangements in which the leasing of va facilities and services yields income to va facilities as with the funds of the mccf the hsif proceeds can be used to furnish additional medical services thereby expanding the number of veterans served by thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31004crs8 va medical care system in addition pl 106117 authorized the creation of third fund called the extended care revolving fund ecrf for the receipt of per diem and copayments from certain higher income veterans receiving extended care services from va one of the purposes of the millennium health care act is to expand the availability of extended care and the act expects to offset some of the additional costs of such expansion by increasing the charges for extended services for veterans who are assumed to have greater ability to pay for their care hrept 107159 estimates that the combined amount of the mccf and the health services improvement fund hsif will total 812 million for fy2002 srept 10743 does not estimate funds for the hsif and accepts the administrations estimate of recoveries of 691 million to the mccf conferees did not accept the house approach to estimating resources nor its proposed hsif and accepted the administrations estimate as endorsed by the senate the conferees were concerned about the inability of va to collect all of the funds due the mccf and instructed the department to install in one of the 22 visns but with applicability to all visns using private contractor and at least 3 million 2year project that demonstrates total patient financial services system the conferees emphasized that an essential element of this demonstration is the effective use of private sector business services in concert with va employees atypical antipsychotic medications over the last few years some veterans organizations have become concerned that the shift to more outpatient care has left seriously mental ill patients without adequate or appropriate treatment some suggest that vas push to greater efficiency has led its physicians to prescribe anti psychotic medications according to costsaving or other nonmedical determinations rather than choosing the best medication for each particular case some suggest that the emphasis on outpatient care has encouraged management approach to treatment in which the primary objective is to keep patients manageable in an outpatient modality in this view the treatment plan is not designed with the primary purpose of improving the patients mental health but to lessen the burden the patient places on the broader society within which the patient lives by this view medications are primarily used to gain or retain stabilization so that outpatient treatment can continue in the event that outpatient treatment is not successful then the medications are thought to be intended to keep inpatient mental illness cases manageable with fewer staff required the conferees acknowledged that there is an abundance of conflicting information and lack of uniformity across vas health system in regard to atypical antipsychotic medications in addressing the concerns of critics of perceived or potential va irregularities in the treatment of mental illness the conferees stress that prescribing practices of these drugs must not be used as performance indicators when evaluating physicians work nor should price market share and corporate interest factor into choosing the best drug to treat mental illnessand va must communicate clearly to each doctor facility director and pharmacy manager that atypical antipsychotic pharmaceutical prescribing practices are not to be used as measure of job performancephysicians are to use their best clinical judgement httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31004crs9 while the conferees want va to make its physicians aware that there is wide price disparity among these drugs and va should feel free to also communicate relative cost data for all atypical antipsychotic drugs to its physicians the conferees also direct va to keep an open policy with regard to formulating new schizophrenia and serious mental illness treatment protocols as new treatments become available but those protocols should be based on scientific and clinical studies showing improvements in treatment efficacy or decrease in sideeffects with cost savings as subordinate goal response to hepatitis c hcv some evidence suggests that veterans have substantially higher infection rate for this dangerous communicable disease va survey in 1999 found that the veterans it surveyed had prevalence rate of 66 compared to an estimated 18 in the general population leading veterans groups and some health care professionals have advocated an aggressive response by va to combat the threat and the administra tions budget estimates that funding within the va medical care budget for the diagnosis and treatment of infected veterans will rise to 172 million in fy2002 up from 152 million in fy2001 and 100 million in fy2000 in documents published in previous years va estimated expenditures on hcv using different accounting methods and the amounts spent on hcv appear to be larger than shown here for fy2000fy2002 the apparent differences do not indicate policy changes medical research the house bill approved 371 million for va medical research projects for fy2002 the senate bill contained 390 million the conference settled on the house level of 371 million with respect to intellectual property rights the conferees directed va to report to the committees on appropriations by february 1 2002 on how va plans to reconcile the interests of its university research partners as reflected by vas sharing agreements with research institutions and the federal requirements that are placed on similar agreements utilized by other agencies the administration requested 360 million for fy2002 up from the 351 million congress appropriated for va medical research in fy2001 congress appropriated 321 million for medical and prosthetic research in fy2000 va const ruction the conference agreed with the house level of 183 million for major construction projects for fy2002 and approved 211 million for minor construction projects the minor construction level in the final version of the bill is 32 million more than requested or approved by either house the house had approved the administrations request for 183 million for major construction projects the senate version of the bill approved 155 million the administration requested 179 million for minor construction projects with an estimated cost under 4 million both versions of the bill approved that amount fy2001 appropriations were 66 million for major construction and 171 million for minor construction congress appropriated 65 million for major construction and 160 million for minor construction for fy2000 capital asset realignment va has developed comprehensive planning approach to constructing altering extending or otherwise improving facilities inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31004crs10 part this new planning approach called capital asset realignment for enhanced services cares is the departments reaction to the criticism it has received from areas of the country in which hospital resources have been cut back in order to redirect those resources to outpatient care usually in other geographical areas while va has been successful in expanding the number of patients it serves conflict continues between advocates of more efficient use of resources who advocate reducing hospital space and closing or selling superfluous inpatient facilities and veterans groups who see any reduction in inpatient care as threat to the medical care needs of the veteran population the cares effort is an attempt to make the planning process by which the capital assets are developed used modified or relinquished open to veterans groups often the fears about reductions in health care to veterans are based on an inadequate understanding of the improvements in care for more veterans that such realignment of resources makes possible and the cares approach may lessen those misunderstandings some veterans have expressed the belief that over time moving resources from an inpatient facility in one area to outpatient access in another yields an unacceptable rate of deterioration in the former facility as the commitment to maintain the building is diminished as the department moves toward its eventual abandonment the house bill establishes fund for the rehabilitation of existing facilities for which safety or seismic concerns exist and would appropriate 300 million to be used in conjunction with the cares process the purpose of the rehabilitation fund is to assure that patient safety is not compromised in unsafe facilities while the realignment of resources is underway conferees did not adopt the house recommendation but expressed strong support of the cares review process and specified that 60 million in the major construction budget is to be used to support cares initiatives program administration the house approved

the housing problems faced by households with verylow incomes or other special housing needs programs of rental assistance for the poor elderly or handicapped housing assistance for persons with aids varying types of shelter for those who are homeless all deal with the issue of the availability of affordable rental housing the two large hud block grant programs also help communities finance various efforts to address these housing issues summary appropriations for hud programs conferees provided hud with 3015 billion for fy2002 167 billion 6 increase above the fy2001 level of 2848

reserve funds to renew all section 8 expiring contracts add an additional 25900 vouchers and pay for contract administration and various tenant protection assistance conferees approved nearly 35 billion for the public housing operating fund an increase of 253 million over last years level but required that drug elimination grants be paid from the fund in fy2001 drug elimination grants were funded separately at 310 million the public housing capital fund received 284 billion decrease of 157 million from last year conferees agreed to 574 million for the hope vi program housing for people with aids was funded at 277 million up by 19 million from last years appropriation housing programs for the elderly and disabled were given 1024 billion of that amount 241 million was specified for housing for the disabled an increase of 24 million for those housing assistance programs conferees agreed to 112 billion for homeless assistance grants 98 million above last years appropriation however that level includes the funding for the shelter plus care renewal program which was funded during fy2001 by separate appropriation of 100 million community development block grants received 5 billion about 58 million less than last year the home program received 185 billion 46 million more than the fy2001 funding level empowerment zones received 45 million compared to 75 million last year and the administrations request for 150 million improving hud management hud secretary martinez has said he intends to focus on internal hud management issues and wait for the recommendations of the millennial housing commission due early in 2002 before starting new initiatives or programs although recent gao study found improvements in hud operations hud management progress made on management reforms but challenges remain gao found that serious problems remain secretary martinez said he would consider consolidating some of the more than 300 hud programs as well as speeding up the decisionmaking process by giving hud field offices more authority to act without having to get approval from headquarters the secretary also said he intended to evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of hud staff now at about 10000 down from high of 17000 and whether the work performed by them is appropriate to huds mission the gao report questioned whether hud hadhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31004crs12 adequately prepared for replacing retiring employees with knowledgeable successors given that 40 of huds employees are eligible to retire within 5 years management of unspent funds in recent years problems in obtaining accurate and timely information about the nature amount and availability of unspent balances has made it difficult for congress to determine the policy effect of any specific funding level for number of hud programs the problem has been particularly concentrated in the two main rental housing assistance programs the housing certificate fund and the public housing programs which together account for nearly 75 of the 30 billion appropriated to hud for fy2002 much of the problem arises from the need for hud to disburse its funding assistance to semiautonomous local entities known as public housing authorities phas phas evaluate specific eligible familys housing needs generally addressing these needs by providing housing vouchers ideally the supply of suitable units available in the local community would be adequate for families to make use of their vouchers but evidence abounds that this ideal is rarely matched by experience phas also manage over 12 million public housing units while phas are usually in the best position to manage the problems arising from particular cases and localized housing issues the downward flow of hud funds reflects national priorities determined by congress and administered by hud inevitably incomplete and delayed procedures make tracking the funds somewhat difficult and often imprecise as the flexibility necessary to achieve policy purposes can conflict with accounting cycles in testimony before the senates banking subcommittee on housing and transportation gao noted that hud had recaptured or taken back from phas about 3 billion each year between fiscal year 1998 and 2000 and that congress has rescinded cancelled almost 2 billion from housing certificate fund hcf balances in each of the past 2 years using the funds for other purposes in its fy2001 appropriation congress provided the hcf with 42 billion in advanced appropriations that will be available for spending in fy2002 and gao asked how much additional funding is actually needed for the fund for fy2002 given the combination of recaptures rescissions and advance appropriations the 42 billion was not designated for any program activity in fy2002 and the gao concluded that while hud may need to carry over some unobligated funds from one fiscal year to the next hud has not provided rationale supporting 42 billion as the amount of unobligated balances it needs the fy2002 hud budget passed by congress on november 8 2001 also contains 42 billion advance appropriation for which full spending authority will be delayed until fy2003 thus the amounts appropriated in recent years for particular programs have become less of an indicator of what was spent the previous year during that year or during the following year hud reports that there was total unexpended balance of over 36 billion in various hud program accounts during fy2001 the matter of unspent funds prompted debate over huds proposal to cut 707 million from the public housing capital fund for fy2001 earlier in the year hud estimated that phas had over 6 billion in unspent funds for public housing which was more than adequate to fund 2 years at the current spending rate and concludedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31004crs13 that putting more funds into the pipeline was not necessary phas countered that hud had been slow in getting the funds out to them claim acknowledged by hud conferees addressed the issue of unspent funds in number of ways of the 284 billion approved for the public housing capital funds 550 million is to be allocated only to those phas that are in compliance with timeliness requirements under the quality housing and work responsi bility act of 1998 pl 10773 includes language that requires the recapture of funds from phas that are not in compliance with the 1998 acts timeliness requirements the conferees also request hud to provide quarterly reports on pha utilization of capital funds with the first report due by february 1 2002 debates over the use of excess mortgage insurance premiums to fund hud rental production programs some analysts have identified what they believe is surplus of reserves in the basic fha mortgage insurance program in their view funds collected as mortgage insurance premiums that exceed the rate at which payments must be made to cover insured events plus reasonable contingency reserve should be put to public policy purpose rather than allowed to languish in federal account with particular advantage accruing to anyone as result of the growing balance several national affordable housing trust fund bills in the 107th congress for example hr 2349 and s 1248 reflect this view another view suggests that instead of using growing balance in the fund for an unrelated purpose the premiums should be lowered to more closely approximate the actual experience of mortgage insurance liabilities for example s 607 during the past decade mortgage insurance premiums the main income of the fha singlefamily program have greatly exceeded the losses from mortgage foreclosures the 5 billion of reserves frequently cited over the past few years as potential source of income for rental housing production program was the excess of premiums over expenditures and reserves during fy1998fy1999 the congressional budget office cbo and the office of management and budget omb recently reclassified these excess reserves above the required capital ratio longer treating the entire amount of the growing fund balance as unobligated manda tory spending authority but treating the amount determined as excess as unobligated discretionary spending authority the effect of this scoring change meant that at least in part the fy2001 estimate of vahud appropr iations was revised downward from 307 billion to 285 billion as approximately 225 billion of fha negative subsidies were moved from an accounting category of unobligated mandatory spending to the discretionary side of the ledger which shows them as unspent discretionary funds the conference report for the fy2002 hud budget hrept 107272 shows 232 billion of negative subsidies as result of the accounting change these negative subsidies reduce the apparent total of appropriations to hud for discretionary programs and are subtracted from that fiscal years discretionary appropriation because these excess reserves were already within the federal budget and until recently at least contributing to the budget surplus they are not excess funds from the perspective of the federal budget or to federal taxpayers premiums paid to the insurance account are federal revenues payments from the account are federalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31004crs14 expenditures any excess of revenues over expenditures contributes to the federal surplus or would offset federal deficit if one exists the excess in the insurance account can be drawn down for other hud programs but such proposal must go through the normal appropriation process it would be spending authority that is ultimately drawn from federal revenues and counted within the federal budget accordingly thus any projected fund excess that is reclassified as discretionary cannot be treated as new money that previously had not been counted within federal budget totals an undated written cbo response to the house financial services housing subcommit tee explains that after extensive discussion cbo and omb agreed to reclassify the fhas mutual mortgage insurance and cooperative housing mortgage insurance mmichmi fund excess as discretionary rather than mandatory clearing the way for the excess to be offset against other discretionary spending in the upcoming vahud appropria tions bill as well as in the totals for hud appropriations over the last several years the cbo memorandum says that the change in the scoring method should have effect on the amount of budgetary resources available to hud or any congressional committee february 2001 gao report mortgage financing fhas fund has grown but optio ns for drawing on the fund have uncertain outcomes gao01460 concluded that the fha may actually have taken on more highrisk borrowers in recent years and as result may need more reserves than immediate past experience suggests is necessary in order to weather serious economic downturn with increasing unemployment and an fha loan delinquency rate over 10 the fha reserve fund could begin to decrease in any event using the insurance fund to build more affordable rental housing would have to go through the normal appropriation process regardless of the amount of existing fha insurance reserves the reserve is simply an account balance within the budget not source of unspent funds available for reprogramming

needs in 1999 new opportunity amid continuing challenges executive summary january 2001 us department of housing and urban development office of policy development and researchthe major housing policy issue affordable rental housing the slower economy of the last several quarters could limit rent increases in some areas of the country but it is unlikely to bring significant relief to lowerincome households looking for affordable rental housing the strong economy of the previous half dozen years created large number of new jobs and increased incomes putting substantial pressures on housing markets increased demands lowered vacancy rates and pushed rents higher as more people entered the rental market with sufficient incomes to avoid sharing apartments and houses while this increased demand encouraged more units to be built rents for these new dwellings are almost always out of the range of lower income families restrictive zoning building codes and local opposition have made it difficult to construct basic rental housing affordable to lowerincome families the tight rental market has not escaped the attention of landlords participating in federallyassisted rental programs for lowerincome families thereby contributing to the difficulty tenants have in finding affordable apartments with more profitable alternatives available some rental property owners have decided not to renew their federal contracts older apartment buildings with lower rent units continue to be torn down or renovated for an upscale market as the tight rental market pressures generate more profitable alternatives for investors in rental housing fewer apartment owners in the suburbs of metropolitan areas are willing to rent to subsidized tenants either because the owners want to avoid bureaucratic program red tape or because the value of the voucher is not sufficient for subsidized tenants to afford the units early in 2001 hud reported that american housing survey data from the us census bureau showed drop from 1997 to 1999 in the number of worst case renters those who pay more than half their income for housing or live in substandard housing and have incomes below 50 of the local median but who receive assistan ce1 their numbers fell for the first time in 10 years from 54 million households in 1997 to 49 million in 1999 this decline was likely the result of increases in income among verylow income renters rather than an expansion in the number of rental housing units affordable to them the median incomes of this group rose 14 while rents rose 6 the national housing conference nhc has also examined 1997 and 1999 american housing survey data looking at households with critical housing needs those paying more than 50 of their income for housing but focused on those with moderate to lower middleincomes these are households with incomes from 80 to 120 of the local median income in february 2001 the nhc reported that the number of such households with critical housing needs had increased 74 these households are much less likely to receive rental assistance than those with incomes below 50 of the local median thus the nhc concluded that affordable housing problems had moved up the income ladder media attention has focused on the trouble public safety officers teachers fire fighters and other municipal employees who generally fall into this

administration proposed an additional 34000 for fy2002 however the committees on appropriations have become concerned about the difficulty that some phas have in putting these vouchers to use hrept 107159 reports that the average utilization of vouchers has fallen from 967 in fy1999 to an estimated 924 in fy2001 the conference agreement hrept 107272 specifies that 144 million will be given to fund 25900 additional vouchers for fy2002 in an effort to get phas to be more proactive and creative in making use of all of their vouchers conferees made 104 million of the 144 million available on fair share basis only to those phas that have less than 97 utilization rate of their existing vouchers in 39 tight rental markets hud now permits the allowable rent level fair market rents or fmrs for rental units eligible for subsidization to be based on the 50th percentile for the local rental housing market rather than the previous 40th percentile to increase the chances of families being able to use their vouchers last years appropriations bill allowed public housing authorities to increase under certain circumstances their payments for assisted rents under section 8 to maximum of 150 of the fmr other expected improvements to make vouchers more effective include help by phas in paying security deposits giving counseling to phas on how to be more aggressive in reaching out to landlords and giving landlords more incentives to participate in the rental program finally hud has promised to improve its acknowledged tardiness in getting funds to phas in timely manner the voucher utilization issue has led to discussions about the need for hud rental housing production program along with renewed determination to preserve the existing stock of affordable rental housing the senate committee on appropriatio ns expressed its concern that families with vouchers often have little choice in their rental decisions leaving them often in lowincome and very low income neighborhoods and living in substandard housing while small number of new apartments have been built for the elderly in recent years hud has largely been out of the business of subsidizing new construction since the 1970s however congress enacted pl 106554 in 2000 which increases the low income housing tax credit by 40 in an effort to stimulate additional affordable rental housing

anticrime efforts by phas the report points out that only 1000 of the 3400 phas receive funding under the drug elimination formula grants program with four phas receiving 25 of the total funding available the house recommended that 20 million of the 35 billion be made available for programs determined by the attorney general which assist in the prosecution and prevention of violent crimes and drug offenses in public and federallyassisted lowincome housing the 20 million would be administered by the department of justice the senate recommended 339 billion in fy2002 to run public housing following the administrations request it also provided 300 million for drug elimination grants continuing the program pl 10773 provides 349 billion to the public housing operating fund for fy2002 the same as the house recommended an increase of 253 million above the fy2001 appropriation the funds will remain available until september 30 2003 the conference agreement explains that the increase over last years funding reflects the merger of funds previously provided in the drug elimination grants program that will be ended the conferees note that phas have the authority to use their operating and capital funds for anticrime and antidrug activities and that only one third of phas received supplemental funding under the drug elimination grants program to the extent that additional assistance might be required by some phas to combat crime and drugs there will be 10 million for programs determined and administered by the attorney general to assist in the investigation prosecution and

of rehabilitation and modernization needs the rehabilitation of existing public housing developments is important to help ensure that they do not become so obsolete that they must be demolis hed the administrations proposed fy2002 budget would have provided 2293 billion for the public housing capital fund reduction of 707 million compared to fy2001 because hud estimates that additional capital needs are accruing at an annual rate of 21 billion and that phas have more than 6 billion of unspent capital funds from prior years hud believes that this amount would be sufficient to meet all new modernization requirements reducing new appropriations for capital funds reduces previously appropriated funds that have not been expended by phas while hud recognizes that these funds are primarily for capital improvement projects it nevertheless expects phas to obligate these funds within 24 months and expend them in 48 months hud has concluded that while not all phas are falling behind in scheduled modernization thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31004crs22 buildup of unobligated and unexpended funds by some phas suggests that modernization funds may not be reaching the phas with the greatest

the hud secretary has reassured phas that are utilizing their allocations that they will not be penalized by efforts to reduce unspent funds in the pipeline and that instead funds will be reallocated to phas with demonstrable success in meeting their program objectives the house agreed to 256 billion for the capital fund the committee noted in its report that as of june 1 2001 733 million in fy1998 and fy1999 funds remained unobligated by phas with 25 phas accounting for 73 of these unspent funds thus the house bill specified that 262 million would be allocated among public housing agencies that have obligated all of their assistance within the 24month statutory requirement the hud secretary would be required to recapture fy1999 and prior year funds that have not been obligated within the required period under the law and redistribute those funds to phas that are in compliance the senate approved 294 billion for the capital fund 650 million above the presidents request pl

local decision making on the use of drug elimination grants and directed hud to identify in the fy2002 budget justification the goals of the program and the actual performance of the grantees in meeting the goals in one of the more controversial parts of huds proposed fy2002 budget the administration would eliminate the program contending that there have been abuses and that the program is

partnerships with local police departments in addition the department would continue to work closely with other federal agencies such as justice health and human services and the office of national drug control policy to administer proven prevention and interventi on programs and with faithbased organizations that also provide treatment and counseling the house followed the administrations request and would provide funding for the drug elimination program for fy2002 the senate approved 300 millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31004crs24 for drug elimination grants in fy2002 conferees

administrations fy2002 budget proposed 48 billion for the cdf to provide 4399 billion in formulabased funds to cdbg entitlement communities and states the administrations budget request would have

millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31004crs26 much of the proposed 310 million reduction would have been achieved by eliminating funding for the economic development initiative the house recommended an

complement an existing program administered by the department of education and huds neighborhood network initiative the ctc initiative is intended to expand access to computers and to promote the use

past years the economic development initiative edi has routinely been used to fund specific projects of interest to individual members entitlement communities states and previous administrations have objected to this type of congressionallydirected funding on the grounds that it is noncompetitive and reduces the amount of funds available under the core cdbg program for distribution to entitlement communities and states for fy2001 357 million in edi assistance was directed to more than 300 specific projects identified in the conference report accompanying the fy2001 appropriations act for vahud

setasides for specific edi projects the conference agreement allocates the earmarked edi funds to over 800 projects with the average grant amount equal to 360000 many of the edi funds would be

hud is to issue notice of funding availability nofa for up to three grants for the conversion of unused or underutilized commercial properties into assisted living facilities for the elderly from

the fha mutual mortgage insurance and cooperative housing mortgage insurance mmichmi fund the same level ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31004crs32 authorized for fy2001 21 billion insurance commitment limitation is appropriated for the general insurance and special risk insurance gisri fund in technical budgetary change based on the federal credit reform act of 1990 the office of management and budget omb and the congressional budget office cbo have determined that fha receipts under the mmi account should be classified within the discretionary rather than the mandatory part of huds budget this has effect on actual program levels according to cbo the reclassification has effect on the amount of budgetary resources available to hud and the mmi program will continue operating as it did prior to the reclassification mandatory spending must comply with the payasyougo rules of the budget enforcement act bea while discretionar spending must comply with the beas discretionary spending caps spending for the mmi program will be determined by the annual appropriations acts as requested the conference agreement provides direct loan limitation of 250 million for the mmichhi fund and direct loan limitation of 50 million for the gisri fund these are the same limits as in fy2001 the direct loans are used to facilitate the sale to municipalities and nonprofit corporations of single family and multifamily properties that have been acquired by the insurance funds through defaults and foreclosures by borrowers the administratio n requested 857 million for administrative expenses of the fha program accounts 497 million of the mmichmi accounts and 360 million in the gisri accounts the house bill requested 331 million for the mmichmi accounts and 212 million for the gisri accounts the senate bill requested 330 million for the mmichmi accounts and 211 million for the gisri accounts the conference agreement appropriates for administration expenses 337 million for the mmichmi accounts and 216 million for the gisri accounts the agreement appropriates 15 million for credit subsidies to support loan guarantees under the gisri programs this is significantly less than the 101 million appropriated for this purpose in fy2001 the credit subsidy is based on the net cost to the government exclusive of administrative expenses of direct loan or loan guarantee over its full term discounted to the present value at the treasurys borrowing cost the reduced need for credit subsidy is based on recent changes in regulatio n regarding mortgage insurance premiums paid by borrowers in the hud multifamily programs though hud has always had statutory authority to set the insurance premiums between 025 and 1 of the outstanding loan balance the regulations have always set the premium at specific figure an interim rule was published in the federal register on july 2 2001 to amend the regulation to state that borrowers will pay an insurance premium of not less than 025 and not more than 1 of the loan amount and that the specific premium to be charged will be set forth in federal register notice notice was published in the federal register on july 2 2001 which set the insurance premium for most of the fha multifamily housing programs at 08 of the outstanding loan balance the premiums had been set at 05 of the loan balance the interim rule and the notice had an effective date of august 1 2001 the assumption is that this change coupled with changes in the subsidy rates for otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31004crs33 programs in the gisri fund and changes that the administration intends to make in the underwriting criteria for several of the programs will enable the fund to provide up to 21 billion in loan commitments with lower amount of credit subsidies than have been needed in past years as in prior years however if these assumptions prove wrong the funding of loans under the program may be temporarily suspended until supplemental appropriations of credit subsidy are provided the senate report language noted concern that hud has failed to adequately calculate the amount of credit subsidy needed to support its multifamily housing programs and noted its expectation that hud will devise computer program to accurately identify the default and financial risks to the insurance funds hud would have been directed to establish task force to study the issue and report its finding by july 15 2002 in lieu of the senate report language conferees note that they expect hud to work with the housing industry to review the technical assumptions that omb provides to hud regarding the risk model used to estimate the subsidy costs for the multifamily housing programs the conferees also expect hud to update its information technology systems for the program accounts of fha to understand its financial exposure and the extent of risk for loss at the end of each business day hud is expected to examine the extent of financial risk and exposure under each fha mortgage insurance program as requested by the administration the conference agreement permits the fha to offer hybrid adjustable rate mortgages arms to lowincome families under these mortgages the interest rate would be fixed for the first few years of the loan then the interest may adjust annually according to changes in market interest rates the interest rate would be fixed for at least the first 3 years of the loan hud estimates that the introduction of hybrid adjustable rate mortgages would allow fha to provide mortgages to an additional 40000 families in fy2002 hud estimates that it also would yield additional income of 99 million for the fha and 13 million for the government national mortgage association ginnie mae data indicate higher default rate for fha adjustable rate mortgages than the rate under its fixed rate mortgages so any increase in income during the early years of the loans may be partly offset in later years by higher losses current law limits arms in given fiscal year to more than 30 of the number of mortgages insured by fha in the previous fiscal year the administration did not propose change in law regarding the limits on arm loans the loan limits for the fha multifamily housing programs had not been adjusted since 1992 and it is often argued that it is longer possible to use the fha multifamily programs in certain parts of the country administrative provisions in the conference agreement raise the loan limits of the multifamily housing programs by 25 under current law cost adjustments of up to 240 may be allowed for certain high cost areas it is assumed that the 25 increase in the loan limits when combined with the existing ability to multiply loan limits by up to 240 would enable the fha multifamily insurance program to be usable in virtually all parts of the countryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31004crs34 more than 800000 assisted rental units in approximately 8500 section 8 projectbased rental complexes have
