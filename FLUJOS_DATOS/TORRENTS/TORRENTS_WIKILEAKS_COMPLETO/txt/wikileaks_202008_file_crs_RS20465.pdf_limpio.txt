amend measures instead committee votes on which amendments if any it wishes to recommend to the house how panel conducts markup for the most part reflects procedures used in the houses committee of the whole parliamentary device to consider amendments as possibly modified by an individual committees rules there is also widespread feeling that the level of formality in markup often reflects the level of contention over the measure being marked uphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20465crs4 6 for further information see crs report 98267 house committee markup reporting and crs report 98169 house committee reports required contents both by judy schneidera markup begins with chair calling up particular measure for consideration by the committee the next action depends on th nature of the markup vehicle ie the text that chair intends for the committee to amend and report which may be different from the measure laid before the panel for c onsideration vehicle can come before committee in several different forms each of which has its own procedural and political consequences chair may lay before committee either bill that has been previously introduced and referred or the text of draft measure th at has not been formally introduced such as subcommitteereported version or chairmans mark in each case the text laid before the committee is itself the markup vehicle but in the second case at the end of the markup process the text must be incorporat ed or converted into measure for reporting to the house alternatively the markup vehicle may be placed before the committee as an amendment in the nature of substitute for the bill or text initially called up reporting legislation6 at the end of markup chair normally entertains motion to report measure favorably to the house by house rule majority of the committee must be physically present the committee can report the m easure as introduced with series of amendments with single amendment in the nature of substitute or as socalled clean bill clean bill would be introduced in the house and referred back to the committee such measure would also have numbe r different from that of the measure as introduced once agreed to measure is ordered reported it is actually reported when the committee report is filed in the house committee report is the committees work product that accompanies measure that is repor ted when committee orders bill reported it is incumbent upon the chair pursu ant to house rule to report it promptly and take all other steps nece ssary to secure its consideration by the full house house rules and statutes tail several substantive requirements of items to be included in reports accompanying measures reported from committees for example most reports explain meas ures purpose and the need for the legislation its cost committee votes on amendments and the measure itself the position of the executive branch and the specific changes the bill would make in existing law as well all committee members may file within two cal endar days supplemental minority or additional views which are then included in the committee report oversight and investigations committees periodically
