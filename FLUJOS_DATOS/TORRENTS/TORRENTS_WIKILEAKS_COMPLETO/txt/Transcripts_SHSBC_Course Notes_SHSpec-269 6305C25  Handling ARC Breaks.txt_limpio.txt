6305c25 shspec269 handling arc breaks some of the data in this tape is contained in hcob 27may63 cause of arc breaks lrh has discovered the common denominator to all arc breaks bypassed charge an arc break is defined as the pcs transfer of attention from the bank to the auditor and dramatization of the bank directed at the auditor charge that has been restimulated in session may provide background booster for session upset when you drag the pcs attention to the auditor the charge that has been deliberately restimulated in the session doesnt get asised and the pc arc breaks thus something that outside the session could not cause an arc break may and will cause an arc break if it happens in session the arc break is not caused by social faux pas it is caused by the sudden shift of attention the unleashing of charge that was held back by the fact that the pcs attention was on it as long as the pc has his attention on the bank he is cause over its charge the moment his attention is flicked off of it he is the effect of that charge and the pc then dramatizes it any tone level or knowtomystery scale level that is higher than the chronic tone of the pc being higher than the pc is cause over the pc and is therefore dramatized it should be noted that apathy is high tone for pc the tone level contained in the incident is what the pc unintentionally dramatizes he could dramatize anything eg boredom effort eg breaking chair or manic and the auditor is good target the pc himself is helpless to restrain himself from dramatizing he will be surprised at himself amazed to react that way etc an arc break comes about whenever charge is bypassed that then puts the pc at its effect point the pc dramatizes the charge that has been bypassed this charge is unknown to him and can therefore affect him adversely the remedy is to locate and indicate the exact bypassed charge at which point the arc break ceases that is the mechanics of it you dont have to go into do and run the arc break and run all engrams connected with it etc you only have to indicate bypassed charge the remedy is not continuous auditing you know now how to turn off someones anger by saying that someone missed his withholds that often works but when it doesnt it is because you indicated the wrong bypassed charge you could assess number of possibilities eg missed gpm missed goal missed ri he will stop being arc broken when you get the right one in session only few charges can be missed goals ris engrams refutation of reality rejection of affinity more basic incident failure to acknowledge that pretty well covers it these things occur in life also rage is an automaticity in such delicate balance that almost anything can make it slip neurosis is actually hard to maintain that explains the simple effectiveness of correctly locating and indicating bypassed charge the psychiatrists failure comes about from two sources 1 lack of technology 2 an interest in insanitys being very hard to solve arc breaks are not hard to handle if you know the cause and handling of them dont back off or fear them just develop the skill to find and indicate the right bpc or you will get loses in auditing and eventually give up temporary or permanent conditions of misemotional stress are something that you have to face up to as an auditor 0r just get out of the auditing chair so i want you to get confidence that you can find the bpc and then by indicating it to the pc realize the tool that is in your power that pc arc breaks is guarantee that the pc is in poor case shape or difficult to get gains on just indicating the correct bpc turns off the arc break you may find that the charge was bypassed two sessions ago or the arc break doesnt get handled because you cant find what it was until somewhat later then when you indicate it the pc calms down but you shouldnt let an arc break last more than two or three minutes because arc breaks multiply on steep curve governments these days are run by riot because they are so scared of arc breaks englands matteroffact handling of the ban the bomb movement is an exception to this rule like an auditor who doesnt get thrown by or governed by arc breaks governments have also been run by fear of assassination this is just dramatization of the helatrobus implants you as an auditor could be governed by arc breaks if you cant handle them you are never governed by that which you can handle with ease so learn to handle arc breaks until arc breaks become just another phenomenon like runny nose your attitude on arc breaks must never be one whereby you are driven by the arc break because you will be driven then into not getting the items clean into taking the pcs orders which are the direct result of dramatizations the orders are the significance contained in what you just put him at the effect of the bpc dont for instance as registrar get reasonable in the face of dramatization hunt and peck around for bypassed charge the rage is an automaticity psychosis is very tenuous and easy to break number of arc breaks is not correlated with the success of auditing arc breaks multiply as the square of time the greater the facility with which you handle arc breaks the less you are governed by them pcs who are continually arc broken in session can be run on the threeway arc break process this process however is not for use every time the pc arc breaks for instance for an auditor messed up with arc breaky pcs you could run the following _ what attitude has been refused in auditing what reality has been rejected what communication has not been acknowledged this works better than midruds it is the successor to arc break straightwire which in 1958 could go into engrams and even implants it works because what it does is directly to locate and indicate bpc if you let the arc broken pc control you you will be taking his orders because he is dramatizing not only the emotion but also the significance contained in the bpc this is dangerous to the pc so you should 1 learn to handle arc breaks 2 be good enough as an auditor never to bypass charge you can bypass charge by not finding any you press on with the session in the teeth of pc who is dramatizing apathy then the pc gives you wrong goal and you take it thereby bypassing more charge the harder you are driven by arc breaks into doing bad job the more charge you bypass it wont run well bypassed charge is always prior to the charge on what you are doing so the arc break is blessing in disguise since it tells you that there is more charge which you have bypassed it is more accurate than the meter in this case arc breaks are cumulative in their effects you do still have to peel enough charge from later incidents to get to the earlier ones but the pc wont arc break if you indicate to the pc as an rfactor what you are doing if you tell the pc that there is basic on the chain he wont arc break even if you dont run the basic because you have indicated the earlier charge indicating that there is earlier charge also makes it possible for the pc to run the later stuff the pc can arc break in the rudiments because he has outruds in the incident that is just bpc and you can indicate it so when you chicken out of cleaning an rl because the pc is protesty and arc broken you have set yourself up for more arc breaks on subsequent items dont buy an ri that doesnt rocket read full dial if it wont there is bpc to clean up bypass the charge keep it secret you will get an arc break dont bypass charge
