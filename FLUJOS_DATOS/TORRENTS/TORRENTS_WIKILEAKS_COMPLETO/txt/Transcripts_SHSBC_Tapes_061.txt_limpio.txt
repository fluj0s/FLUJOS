shsbc 61 smoothness of auditing lecture given on 21 september 1961 thank you well this is 21 september 1961 and you i trust are little closer to clear i trust this is not grading great probability about it because after all something thats been going on for the last i dont know when were you clear last about two hundred trillion years ago something like that well its been going on for this long i suppose you can suffer with it while longer i suppose but unfortunately you wont have to and if your auditing would just improve why you would find that it would be of mutual assistance for your auditing to get better so this is not demand you understand but just pathetic little plea for your auditing to get better i see bob here is taking that bad your auditing isnt perfect either yeah nor is mine once in blue moon you find yourself taking your finger off your number but i will say this i will say this i take my finger off my number less often than you do and there are some of you going in the direction of perfection to such degree however that you find it difficult to achieve mediocrity now those are bitter words but if you keep going in the direction of perfection absolute never errored perfection youre going to miss that interstate known as mediocrity or even passable do you get what im driving at the fellow who keeps hammering in there about perfection all the time you know theyve got to have the auditor who sits there saying well im now ive got to get this acknowledgment across well what am i going to do well lets see now i had better get this order across to him now lets see was that too tone 40 i guess that wasnt too tone 40 figurefigure see he isnt auditing the pc see and i would rather you did personalized job on the pc first and technical perfection second you got the idea and then all of sudden youll get some horrendous win or other youll find out you can do it and then youll find out that its very easy the wrong way to you can go at this you know you can say you have got to be perfect before you can do anything for the pc and you sit there giving session being too perfect and then nothing happens with the pc but of course you arent auditing the pc youre auditing your own auditing you see how that can work audit the pc the pc comes first and all you want is majority of rightness thats all just be right more often than youre wrong and youll get there its as simple as that its the percentages auditing the percentages are rather cruelly high you have to be about 92 percent right life you only have to be 51 but what i tell you is true that the pc forgives anything but noauditing pc doesnt forgive noauditing and if he has problem that is bugging him or bothering him or hes worried about something or other and the auditor is mainly worried about the ritual youve got the source of the bulk of arc breaks the auditor is so worried about the ritual worried about lets see is it the sensitivity knob thats supposed to move or lets see i guess you take the reading at the sens you know the sensitivity knob on my meter hasnt fallen ever since i started the security check and the auditor is so so so concerned about what he is doing that the pc never has an opportunity to impart the fact that hes worried as hell the pc never forgives it see because the pc is sort of talking to bundle of technology not person and with the pc finds himself talking to bundle of technology he goes out of session so auditing comes first you see and technology comes second and thats all very well for you to say because it will be used here and there as an excuse to do very horrible auditing you see you get both ways i mean i cant be right along all these lines but the point is that the pc sits this kind of situation is quite common in an auditing session pc comes in hes bubbling over with the fact that hes just been shot by howitzer and the auditor sets up the emeter and adjusts the cans and adjusts the needle and tells him to sit there and then starts in and asks him if its all right to begin session and so on and all it looks to the pc like hes being denied auditing thats all it looks to him matter what the auditors doing pc meets you in the hall and says ive just been shot with howitzer well dont say what do you know and then go through the technology of starting session the pc is already by imparting this horrendous piece of information to you has already announced the fact that he is already insession its obvious because hes considering you the auditor and thats all youre trying to achieve with your ritual is to get him to recognize you as the auditor well if hes already done so what the hell man what the hell so he meets you in the hall and says ive just been shot by howitzer and you say well where and how was that and so on and steering him gently by the shoulders steer him into the chair and where was this howitzer where did it hit you oh yeah well have howitzers ever been problem to you before you may have habit of being hit by howitzers in some fashion all right well what do you know about that and this howitzer how big was this howitzer oh 55 millimeter oh well thats pretty big howitzer all right how do you feel about that now oh i dont know i feel little better about it well all right now lets recall the first time you were ever hit by one of these howitzers well all right and so forth all right recall another time okay now how does it seem to you well its better all right now you think we can get on with the session all right now yeah i think we can all right what goals would you like to set now your rudiment was reversed end to wasnt it rudiments should have been in one place but the pc was insession its delicate line between q and and that sort of thing but youre liable to go right on through to the end of the session and he never discovers that youve never started one you obviously start one the moment that you steered him toward the auditing chair and the technical question comes up when does the session start well the session starts when the pc recognizes that he has an auditor thats when session starts pc recognizes that he has an auditor and goes into session that is it see hes obviously willing to talk to you as the auditor so he obviously is insession hes obviously interested in his own case so he obviously is insession now were going to make difficulties see now were going to adjust the emeter cans and tighten up the leads and see whether or not the sensitivity knob is moving properly and read the makers name plate have him get down on his knees the way theyll be doing it hundred years from now unless you disseminate properly get down on his knees along side of the chair and say prayer to the of the auditors code before he begins the session unless i get some of your terminals run out thats whatll happen im being mean today you know but anyway just look it over look it over whats session your point of view as moment ago why your point of view of session might have been two people sitting in chairs and the auditor going through routine and ritual called model session see well you just alter that point of view and you will be right some pcs practically dont get out of session so the main problem is trying to get them out of session overnight see they are just insession bang you see well the difficulty is ending the session now the difficulty in starting session always comes because the auditor doesnt recognize the start of session it always is in that category something wrong here now theres two ways this can happen the pc is leery of going into session because he too often has been denied session all right thats good we start one anyway and just run out his auditing arc break thats all something like that and youve got him started and youve got him insession but insessionness is technical condition it has nothing to do with placement of bodies or ritual its whether or not the pc has recognized his auditor and is willing to talk to the auditor of course thats part of recognizing the auditor and is interested in his own case and thats what session is and if you recognize that as session the suddenness with which pc will start talking to you in streetcar or on bus or something is amazing now you have certain rights as an auditor and that is not to run session while travelling on the upper deck of twodecker bus you see in areas where one cant be heard or where youre going to get off at the next stop you see you have certain rights about that sort of thing but nevertheless confidence has been imposed on you in you as an auditor and therefore you should make an appointment for the session thats the least thing you should do people start telling their troubles and i havent got time at that moment to listen to them i never say well i cant listen to your troubles now thatd be silly thing to do wouldnt it im sorry im too busy to hear all this tale of woe that youre giving week later we try to put the person insession well it has to start with an arc break you got it so its always good thing to have card handy like an hgc card or private practice card or something like that and somebody starts telling you their troubles say well now its very interesting but youre going to get off at the next stop and you say right now ive got to go and im very sorry but ive got to go see this friend and so forth now here is my card and you make sure that you come and see at two oclock next tuesday well thats fine youre still interested arent you thats the proper acknowledgment youve acknowledged the person you put him on wait yes and so forth he hadnt even realized that hes insession but the mechanics of this will work youll find the mechanics of it will work and then if you do start auditing that person as pc you havent got to start it with an arc break the main problem is preventing sessions from happening in the wrong places if you only knew it and if you were very smooth as an auditor this would be your main difficulty is preventing sessions from occurring in the wrong places where you cant audit like the second deck of doubledecker bus so you should give little more thought to how youre going to get out of situation like that rather than worrying all the time about how to get pc insession my difficulties is how do you get pcs out of session not how do you get them into session now thats how far look you can have on the subject of the technical practice of auditing i mean it can be totally the reverse to what youve been worried about not that you have sympathetic face or anything but somebody says oh my and you say you knucklehead you say whats wrong thats it youve had it he goes into session youre an auditor youre pro youve said the right thing and there he is insession now how are you going to get him out of session without him running something see its very natural thing for you to do well go ahead and do it but also have the panacea for correcting it which is to say at least point of continuance of the session or hand him to substitute send him to the d of p or something like that you say what is wrong youve started session how easy is it to start session well its much easier to start session than you think but if you were working hard to start session you almost never start one you see how this would be now if you just work real hard and you fumble with the leads and you get it all set and you adjust his chair and you get it all set up and so on and the scenery is all okay and then so on you hang sign on the door and you clatter around one way or the other and you come back and you sit down and you heave long sigh and you say to him all right is it all right with you if i begin this session now all right thats fine now thats perfectly all right providing the pc is not insession and then of course that is totally wrong there isnt single thing you have done that is right not single action youve undertaken is right from the pcs point of view because you didnt handle the session as having started you probably didnt end your last session with this pc something like that is it whats in error pc still had present time problem pc still interested in case pc still back on the track and so forth hes been awake half the night thinking up the answers hes going to give you to the auditing question tomorrow he sees you his instant response is to give you twentyfive answers to the auditing question in rapidfire order well attribute that to your prowess as an auditor it isnt something to be neglected pcs do this sort of thing youre good thats all either youre bad at ending sessions or youre good at being an auditor one way or the other you have inspired confidence well dont abuse the confidence once youve inspired it how do you handle situation like that well you hear the pc out not all the way out now theres vast difference in auditing and letting pc talk and auditing pc and some of you have never differentiated between these two things and you will waste lot of auditing time letting pc talk has nothing to do with auditing pc and if you sit there and you find out in thinking back over sessions that pcs have been very verbose they sure do talk they run on and on and on and if you have had that kind of experience chalk it up as slight miss on your part because you havent audited him youve let him talk ill tell you liability about letting pc talk they talk their havingness down you can get pc to tell you your troubles his troubles and go on with an improper acknowledgment and just letting him run on and on and on and youll see him go down from antagonism to anger to fear to grief to apathy and youll see him go right on down the tone scale thats because youre not auditing him youre acting as camouflaged hole now auditing consists in directing the attention of the pc and when pc is just sitting there talking gab gab gab gab and its so on so on and i did this and i did that and so forth and its so on well then something is in error with your questions do you realize that by the inteijection of questions into what he is saying you can direct his attention and throw him right back into session and you must be in some kind of mental paralysis where you dont think of question to turn all this off youre not trying to turn it off youre trying to direct it and if you just sit there and let pc gab gab gab gab gab talk talk talk talk talk and tell you all of his troubles and so on youre just asking him to run his havingness out the bottom the way to handle that situation is always interrogation if the pc talks too much interrogate how do you interrogate well your knowledge of the human mind should be adequate now to the address of the situation you can be far too abrupt with your knowledge of the human mind he is saying and my instructor did this and that and the other thing and i was feeling so bad and by george he came right in and dropped the bulletin right on my head and so on and so on you say abruptly what did you do to the instructor that shuts it off effectively creates nice arc break too but in essence youve got to ask him what he did to the instructor but how smoothly can you do this and then that has to do with how smooth an auditor you are how smoothly can you ask him whatd you do to this instructor that caused all this see there are various gradients by which you approach this when was the first time you noticed there was some difficulty with this instructor hes only been able to tell you by this time about two motivators one motivator two motivators you see but you can see by all the signs that hes going to go on for the rest of the auditing session telling you all the motivators well thats not going to help him any so by the time you wrap around this and figure out just about what he is talking about you should be thinking of directing his attention and when pc is talking too much direct his attention now every once in while pc goes off in high spate of interest of some kind or another and starts telling you about gimmegahoojit or the interplanetary customs of the z people well very often also youre interested i had some auditor here the other day said and he was telling about this spaceship and the auditor is report doing the reporting and he was telling about this spaceship and how it really operates and you know if id had money right at that moment i would have bought one now theres pc doing high degree of salesmanship the auditor quite interested were not talking about that kind of situation you see thats perfectly permissible if you shut that off youve had it were talking about different kind of yap yap yap yap yap see were talking about pc whos complaining and going on and on and on the auditor that sits there and lets pc go on and on and on and on and on just isnt auditing its the auditor who isnt insession the pcs willing to talk to the auditor but the auditors not willing to direct the attention of the pc and the most obvious type of question that could occur to you is just when did that trouble start hes saying and they shot and they hanged and then they dragged across the field and then they brought all the cows over and made them stare at and hes going on and on and on in this direction whammitywham and if somewhere along this line about the time they shot him you havent asked when is the first time you had any trouble of this character youre remiss and your pcs going to run his havingness down see you should be in there directing the attention of the pc all right now lets go back to this first situation i announced the pc meets you in the hall and the pcs going gab gab gab walla walla walla telling you all about it see now youve got the problem of getting him into the auditing room getting him into the chair getting the emeter set up and getting it all fixed up and so forth what are you going to do there is pat solution except one and that is direct the pcs attention how do you direct the pcs attention if you direct it too savagely you have operated as sudden shift of attention have surprised the pc what are you going to say to the pc well youre going to say to him something that directs his attention not necessarily onto the mechanics of the session probably certainly not onto the mechanics of the session one of the tricks i use is put him in comm lag and set him down ask him question he cant answer right away that gives you time see theres all kinds of things you can do and theyre all quite real and theyre all quite convincing and theyre all quite effective he meets you in the hall and he says gab gab gab walla walla walla and i thought up 365 answers to the auditing question which you were asking last night and as matter of fact ive got them all ready to give you and so forth and were all set and well what the hell youre not even in the auditing room now what are you going to do well youre going to do something to direct his attention thats what youre going to do now how are you going to direct his attention reprovingly surprisingly oh nothing like this youre going to say to him something on this order uhm by the way did you have present time problem when we ended session yesterday and hes going to say and im going to get the emeter set up and going to give him the cans sit him down in the chair put sign on the door and so forth hes sitting there looking at it yeah he says yes it was how to answer that auditing command and i say well all right was that much of problem well as matter of fact i sure struggled with it until about last night about nine oclock or something like that i happened to think that you were asking you were asking about man and you know i didnt realize before that you were asking about man well what did you think i was asking how did you define that and he will say well i defined it actually as an island you say you did well now how would you get those things to compare finish it all up and so forth say all right now what goals would you like to set for this session thats good all right now is it all right with you if i begin this process now thank you very much now heres the auditing question bang but lets define it lets define it now what do we mean by blah blah and man we actually have done tiny shift of attention without distracting him too much now weve asked him the pertinent question youve always got to ask him the right question you got the idea you ask him the right question obviously he had present time problem about the auditing or he wouldnt have been answering the auditing command all night obviously you didnt end session obviously there was some unconfidence involved in the thing because he obviously too must have gone on selfauditing to some degree so the session couldnt have been ended in other words youve got to size up the situation thats not pat situation the only thing pat about it is is youve got to direct the pcs attention you dont let pc go on talking forever it is dirty trick the pc will feel silly after while he will feel very out of session direct his attention and not crudely suddenly or accusatively you get the point now when is pc insession pc is insession when he is able to talk to the auditor change that over from willing to able and is interested in his own case those are the only real requisites to being insession given those things youve got it now if pc is talking to the auditor he obviously is able to talk to the auditor if hes talking about his own case he obviously is interested in his own case so obviously there is session and youve got to handle it as session because hes suddenly apparently elected you as the auditor and maybe hes being audited by somebody else all right this pc says to you know in that session yesterday i was having session yesterday and all of sudden we ran into society where all they did was cook and i got to thinking about cooking and i got more and more worried about cooking and so forth and i just realized in this lifetime ive never been able to cook and about this time i suddenly realize that i have been elected the auditor dont you see he is not just talking about his case conversationally but is actually talking session see so i say well what did your auditor do about that in other words i give him right back to his auditor just mention his auditor and ive shifted his attention well obviously his attention is stuck there now when you get very very expert and when you seem very smooth to pcs it will be because by interrogation you can shift the pcs attention and when you can shift pcs attention smoothly why he will get an idea that you have terrific altitude and its all in the expertness with which you can shift the pcs attention you use that with questions now every once in while in giving security check you ask instructors how do you give security check well thats fine you give security check by reading the question finding out if theres drop on the meter all right theres drop on the meter thats where you fall down if youre going to fall down on security question theres where you fall down right there at that point youve asked the question which is on the printed form youve gotten fall on the meter and right there large percentage of auditors lay an egg they do not direct the pcs attention they read the question again they do some version of questionreading they dont direct the pcs attention with question now just look at this little tiny microscopic trick here you say have you ever pushed over any tall buildings and you get fall on the emeter now instead of directing the pcs attention you say well have you ever you know substituting emphasis for brains have you ever pushed over any tall buildings and you get another fall on the emeter and then you say well it requires different emphasis so you say have you ever pushed over any tall buildings now you see that hasnt anything whatsoever to do with shifting the pcs attention you see what why its wrong now even banal shift of the auditing thing tends to shift the pcs attention have you ever pushed over any tall buildings you get fall you could say well what was that well now if you point too emphatically to the meter youll get an outofsessionness on the part of the pc because his attention is being pulled out of the session out of his bank onto the meter i as often as not will assume that the pc is not interested in the meter but at this moment is very interested in having had an odd phenomenon of some kind or another if you get fall its usually accompanied by some electronic shift of some kind you know the fellows going tall buildings i never thought of that before you know its kind of maybe its lurch in his stomach or he gets twitch in the end of his nose or his hands feel kind of sweaty suddenly well i dont refer to this i refer to that im just as likely as not to say what happened just then well i had this lurch all right does that have anything to do with tall buildings oh i cant stand tall buildings well have you ever pushed over any tall buildings you get the shift you put his attention more on him more on the bank and then reiterate the question that we want to know and he says well it just seems like it might have happened it seems it seems possible its it just seems like its something i woulld do well now why do you think you would do that well i have this fear of every time i see tall building that itll fall over oh recall time when that was that way yes yes definitely all right now have you ever pushed over any tall buildings augh its an awful question youre asking he gets the idea that his attention actually by this time is being actually ground right straight down on the bank hell get sensation that hes really being shoved into it but you have not changed your intonation you havent changed the starkness of the question you havent lightened it up you havent made it more accusative anything else but the pc gets the sensation of you have just taken his attention and you have said stop looking at stop looking at the emeter stop looking at this beautiful bright day around here and look at that bank damn you now did you or didnt you hell actually get this kind of pressure sensation what have you actually done youve restimulated the channel youve restimulated the whole chain youve got the whole chain of tall buildings now in total restim both by your security question by asking if there was some sensation that went along with it by asking him if he ever has any difficulties with tall buildings is there anything hes ever noticed recalling time when he noticed that and so forth and now the security question again have you ever pushed over any tall buildings and boy hell feel by this time as though he has been run into by mack truck and hes going to give well all right if you put it that way i pushed over the empire state building thats why its in ruins thats why new yorks never been the same since if he ever did hed give it to you right now ohh you get why because your ability to fix attention has been horsepowered up to his inability to fix attention and you have made him able to fix his attention on the thing which his attention is dispersing off of and he gets the idea just as though youve backed up caterpillar tractor back of him and shoved get in there and pitch lets you and him fight this is what the thing sort of adds up to all right ill go over another instance of this now have you ever whistled at girl you get reaction on the emeter dont say ah i have reaction on the emeter here urn lets see is there any other way i can pull your attention out of session do you have any present time problems are you worried about your wife or anything like that dont you realize youve been far away from home your children might be trapped in burning building dont go on this particular course of action that is the wrong course of action that is the escapist approach letting the pc escape you dont do that at all you do it quite in reverse you say have you ever whistled at girl did you have any sensations just then yeah as matter of fact i had this sensation right across my head oh well what do you suppose that might have been well i dont know i dont know well what would it have to do with whistling or pretty girls or something like that well i dont know why how could it poss ah there it is again well now did you have picture just as you did that oh yeah well well all right well have you ever whistled at any pretty girls well not ow not that i know of so forth i dont recall uh well do you remember any pretty girl oh yes oh yes yes remember pretty girl did you ever whistle at her i get there it is again well whats going on here what are you looking at there what are you looking at there well well if you must know i whistled at this pretty girl down on ouch i went down on ouch down on main street ouch one day and it was somebodys wife and he he he socked oh all right you did whistle at pretty girl then yes i i did all right ever whistle at any other pretty girls ouch uh well did you ever whistle at any other pretty girls well if you must know i have never done anything else it is just something that i just cant keep from doing i try and i try and i try and i keep standing there on drugstore corners whistling i whistle and i whistle what are you going to do about it hey you know its funny thing i never remembered that before i never noticed that about myself before all this type of phenomena falls out of the barrel by just the direction of his attention and you eventually will put it right onto the chain of withholds and overts you see but its all in handling the attention and as i give you again ill give you the wrong way to now if you have you ever whistled at any girls did you object to my lighting the cigarette now while i was auditing you oh you didnt all right thats fine good enough are those leads far enough apart okay now lets see what were we getting at what was i just asking you uh oh mmhm well there couldnt have been much reaction on that i didnt notice it lets go to the next question now that would not be good sound auditing approach why because its demonstrating notknowingness on the part of the auditor the reverse of which is allseeingness all right lets get to the next point person who security checks as though hes in the dark will always be in the dark with security check person who pretends knowingness to too great degree when he is doing security check is also violating the rfactor the rfactor is simply this you want to know and youre going to get him to find out and that is all the rfactor there is and if youre in that state of mind you will direct his attention neatly every time not you want to give perfect security check not you want to follow the perfect technology not you want to always do your emeter right see those are not rfactors youre interested and you want him to find out if those are the only rfactors present boy can you security check youll find out that security check that ordinarily would take you thirtysix hours to get rid of and some of them do take that long to get rid of you could cut it right on down to about fouror fivehour security check and youd get the lot its just that difference you notice fall on your meter you know at once the pc is interiorized into some kind of withhold hes on chain its live right now well you take full advantage of that fact you call his attention to the subject matter of the security check you ask him to define the subject matter of the security check you ask him whats been going on in this particular department if hes ever had any trouble in this particular area all why your questions are totally prompted not by textbook question that i give you but by the fact that you are interested and you are damn well going to find out and if that is the only rfactors with which youre dealing when you do security check youll find out they really whiz heres an interesting question you know it says have you ever raped anyone have you ever raped anyone when you ever been worried about rape you ever thought about raping you ever been raped what just happened just then what did you feel just then are you looking at picture get this kind of an approach you see its all in in in and you get his attention all the way in hell pick it up and hell suddenly say oh i forgot all about her it was betsy ann i was two and you say all right lets see if she is clean now you ever raped anyone you got the difference of approach youve got to handle the pcs attention now the reason why you very often fail to do this is because you do not perhaps have sufficient reality on the weakness of pcs ability to handle his attention on the subject of the buttons which make him aberrated those things which have aberrated the pc have overwhelmed him its always case of overwhelm overwhelm what is that push in too tight you could say overwhelm pushed in too tight all right well naturally his attention must at one time have been restraining factor on keeping things from coming in on him thats thetans primary weapon so hes restraining things from coming in on him now what do you think that were going to have here when he gets on this subject again were going to have somebody whose attention cannot be controlled on that particular subject because his attention has been overwhelmed on that subject so therefore if the auditor does not steer the pcs attention on the subjects in which the pc is having difficulty or on which hes having difficulty the pcs attention does not get directed and thereby just wanders or just disperses the pc is not capable of directing his attention on the subject of his aberrations that is why he stays aberrated that is why it remains unknown to him thats the simple mechanic of the thing hes man of iron in all such places except as appertains to his terminal line and there its solid custard and the custard runs to the right and his attention runs to the right and it runs up and his attention runs up and it runs down and it just doesnt matter what the custard does thats what his attention is going to do and unless theres somebody around the auditing session who will direct the pcs attention it isnt going to be directed by anybody but the valence now isnt that fascinating this person let us say has terminal ill have to pick one now that nobody here has has terminal called streetcar conductor all right streetcar conductors are always directing things one way or the other so we dont have the auditor directing any attention and we have pc of course who is in the middle of the valence called streetcar conductor so the pc cant direct his attention so we have left the session in the hands of streetcar conductor well isnt that right you can see it very graphically thats correct thats whos running the session now if this session runs overboard of course you say well it wasnt my fault i was just sitting there going through the rituals swinging the incense in the right directions making orbital star patterns with the incense pot and the pc he was sitting there in the chair and we had him on the emeter so it couldnt have gone wrong and theres mysterious third party present called streetcar conductor and he has said end of line everybody out and the pc says well thats the end of that and you say yes all right heres the next auditing question you get the idea theres nobody directing any attention around there but the valence the mysterious third party and when its streetcar conductor everybody gets in and everybody gets out and they get to the end of the line and they go back to the beginning of the line and when you run an engram with the streetcar conductor running it look what itd look like you get to the middle of the engram and lose lot of passengers personnel of the engram would disappear at the beginning or the end or someplace and then all of sudden thered be tremendous number of people present that hadnt been present before trolley would come off the wire and stop for while and then you ask the question why is it taking so long to clear this person well thats because streetcar conductors arent trained auditors you see now maybe theres lot of bitterness and sarcasm mixed up in this but theres little truth to be found there if you scrape at it unless the auditor directs the pcs attention we have valence that will do god knows what with it and we have the pc who cant so out of the three people present in clearing session weve only got one person who could direct the pcs attention correctly to get auditing done and when that person doesnt do it auditing occurs except by accident and the grace of ron now i will admit that things are put together well enough that some auditing is always occurring but just minute this is special person who is running special terminal every pc is special case every one of them all right now you get pc who has terminal of lion tamer and if you the auditor dont closely direct the pcs attention as youre running the terminal lion trainer youre going to be trained as lion now dont come around and tell that the session keeps going off the rails because i will always tell you that obviously you arent directing the pcs attention that would be the pat answer which any instructor could give any auditing session that started going haywire now the auditor at time should leave session on automatic you leave session on automatic and youre just asking for it but what are you asking for youre asking for the session to be taken over one hundred percent by the valence that you are running out of the pc so now dont keep complaining that the pc is difficult pc or that the pc arc breaks easily or that the pc wont go into session because pc be damned there is pc practically when you when newton and watt and some of the other and i think an italian named erg got themselves all fixed up in measuring energies they didnt get small enough unit to measure the actual energyattention output of pc who is stuck in the middle of valence it is too slightly microscopic to even be measurable so if youre blaming this one onemillionth of grasshopperpower of person that is left you see after youve given full play to the terminal and then youre blaming this tiny tiny amount of residual remaining energy for everything thats going wrong itd be something like saying this roaring torrent of raindrop went down the side of cleopatras obelisk and split it in half and that just doesnt make sense you see it isnt possible now this pc may be very forceful person this pc may be able to do lots of things this pc is not totally slave to his valence nobody ever is but remember youve got him in situation where all the mechanics of auditing have made him again total slave to this valence and now youre going to blame him for what goes wrong well there isnt any blame connected with it unless the pcs attention the onemillionth of grasshopperpower left of it is very closely directed by the auditor of course what is left there its the entire investment of the pcs energy via the valence and you will see that valence all of sudden materializing and going all over the place and doing all sorts of wild things with the session and so forth you see what youve asked for you can almost predict how pc will operate in session once you have his valence if you know his terminal if youre doing poor job or if the pc is out of session or if your pcs confidence in you as an auditor is low the session is going to be run by his terminal so therefore if youre going to run bad session on him we know at once how the pc will operate he will operate just like that terminal so when this sort of thing shows up dont say well the pc is difficult pc that is thats nonsense pcs are difficult pcs but some valences are bitch kitties all right now lets take somebody who has terminal surgeon now wouldnt this be very interesting to audit if you didnt run session if you werent running tight session and you didnt have the pc insession something around there is going to get sawed up thats for sure because the terminal knows how to run session the terminal knows very well how to run session you get the anaesthetic mask and you lay it out and you get the sutures laid out and you get the oxygen put out properly and you lay out the saws and knock some bits of rust off of them see and it would all depend on what part of the track what condition of operation would take place in the session so some would be rougher sessions than others and of course surgeon is liable to do all sorts of weird things like hold the patient down but whos the patient around here well its liable to be the auditor its liable to be almost anybody so if youre running surgeon some time as terminal on pc and you find yourself lying on the floor with both of your shoulder blades pinned to the floor and him fishing around for pen knife to cut your throat you will at least have the satisfaction of remembering that you once heard lecture in which it was stated that this could happen and you will at least know what you did wrong you didnt direct the pcs attention thats the whole lot i mean you cant really say much more of it than that when you cease to direct the pcs attention theres only one party left in the session and of coarse the session will go exactly in that direction i shudder to think what would happen up on the second floor if we had chariot driver you can see there that we have point though maybe put that way maybe some of these incomprehensibles will cease to be incomprehensible theres an old rule an old law thats found in the original thesis there are three laws in there but it just amounts to the fact that the auditor plus the pc is greater than the engram bank and the auditor minus the pc may or may not be greater than the engram bank but certainly minus the pc minus the auditor and youve got nothing left but an engram bank you get the idea so it takes both the auditor and the pc in there pitching to hold terminal down and run it out and thats about all it amounts to takes them both and the way you get them both is to direct the pcs attention how many ways are there of doing this not to labor the point particularly but how many ways could you direct the pcs attention now you just think of some of the ways you have misdirected the pcs attention can you think of having misdirected the pcs attention sometimes you can be quite inadvertent drop the ashtray you certainly have directed his attention but to the wrong place he doesnt have any bank in the vicinity of the ashtray thats the wrong place for his attention to go to so of course then the tension built up by the session explodes the pc drops out of the session you feeling guilty for having dropped the ashtray drop out of the session and what do we have left we have lion tamer surgeon something like this everybody quit the session but the valence and thats the trouble with valences is theyre educated never to quit you see youve come very close to the basic dynamic principle of existence of dianetics when you come to the valence what is trying to survive as soon as we realize that you dont have to try to survive as soon as you realize that survival itself the effort to survive is complete idiocy in being who cant do anything else the most native natural skill thetan has is survival so now hes got survival on via hes got survival all built into beingness he doesnt have any survival left and he has become so concerned and worried about survival that its all built into the beingness well of course these beingnesses on via have tremendous amount of survival mixed up in them and they can be very resistive but they are only very resistive when you get two willful missings in session the auditor and the pc and then of course you have survival rampant and of course the survival of such being is interesting in the fact that none of its actions ever add up to survival that is what is peculiar once you get survival on big via of some character or another it winds up as nonsurvival it winds up as succumb so if any valence was left to ramp and roar across the boards of life totally undeterred by persons native good sense well naturally it would wind up to the most destructive activity imaginable in the first place valences actions and packages are usually out of time in other words this person is all adjusted for the french terror all geared up all the nowimsupposedto to get one through certain period of existence there it is only we arent in the french terror do you see now road highwayman of yesteryear he knows how to survive you go out and you stick up coaches see and you go back and spend it on the babes thats how you survive we dont know why he probably had lot of fun at that time but that was all very good business to be in perhaps when we had nothing but cavalry for police but now the odds have mounted up and things have changed and you just try and disassemble 45 automatic with the same fieldstripping procedure as flintlock pistol and youll fumble in other words the skills are all outofdate all out of time and so on so the actual activities of this fixed valence add up to nothing but succumb the fellows out of money so he goes out and he buys horse and he puts on plumed hat and he rides out to ashdown forest waiting for the coach to come through and its wet night and he gets pneumonia and thats it see its all as idiotic as that and i do mean as idiotic as that if not more so now you take some fellow hes liable to believe that being good well lets say he was designer clothes designer and in this lifetime hes been trying to be clothes designer but his valence is clothes designer and hes tried to be clothes designer in this lifetime and he just somehow or another cant be clothes designer in this lifetime thats one of the most remarkable points about valences is those people who have tried to be their valences in this lifetime have laid the most gorgeous eggs its fantastic i mean how far off these things can be why because they are valences rigged up to live in another age and time and they are incapable of change now why is valence so incapable of change thats because its rigged for survival so all of its facets and aspects are fixed it wont change now lets say at some time or another youve had serving girl and youve tried to teach her to set the table day after day week after week you try to teach her to set the table and somehow or another she is never able to set the table she just cannot do it she either breaks the dishes or spills them on the floor or trips over the edge of the tablecloth and she keeps putting the roast pans on the table and the platters back in the oven and she keeps spilling the soup and it just is mess and you say now look with little good training with little good training now well be able to make this grade and two years later youre still trying well past civilizations have handled it this way they have broken the valence with punishment and in past time the way that servant girl would have been trained is after she broke her first dish she would have been whipped for half an hour and then sent back again to set the table and you know the funny part of it is that didnt work either they take criminals and whether they use the whip or the jail or the stock or anything else they just keep going back stealing cabbages the guy keeps on stealing cabbages thats what he does and they put him in the stock you put him in jail you fine him in more modern times why you deny him his social security or do something rigorous like this and he still goes and steals cabbages why because youre working against the survival pattern of valence and theres nothing can break it now when you finally do break the person down the person now is nothing because all you have is broken valence you dont even have person anymore see see its possibly even better to have good operating valence you know than to be nobody at all but its much better to be yourself than an operating valence in handling criminals im very prone to be very careless with people and so forth because i myself am seldom in any grave and terrible danger from their actions but i have had as ive mentioned before ive had whole shipload of criminals and i never tried to make them into honest men it was not necessary in the first place they were doing criminal thing like fighting war anyhow and just the simple matter of saying all right it doesnt matter what you do on this ship nothing is ever going to go into your record were never going to make another mark in your records that was enough if theres any punishments you have to be satisfied with the punishments i hand out and thats all right and of course the punishments i handed out were as freak and unique as any jail kangaroo court you know very freak you know like well youll have to paint that gun all over all by yourself and so forth and when you get that gun totally painted and so on why well inspect it and if we find one single fleck of rust on it anywhere that hasnt been adequately handled and covered up why then youve got to paint the whole gun again this was very satisfactory to that type of mentality very satisfactory well what was the net result you had broken valences i suppose they stole each other ragged but they couldnt object and that was the way it went and it was the most pleasant calm vista you had ever heard of why there were ships full of honest men all over the place that were appetite over tin cup at each others throats day and night but not this ship there was pressure exerted interesting isnt it so youd say that an operating valence is better than broken valence but person is better than valence and you get your gradient scale of course i say better than valence thats an understatement of magnitude theres tremendous difference between person and an operating valence once in while you ask what is ge well ge is just valence ge is some kind of superpackaged valence that has been set up one way or the other that can continue to be regenerated now the particular form that man has adopted is longer very useful to him various things happen to this particular form which shouldnt be happening to it this form is perfectly all right in meateater society you can go out and eat and be eaten and slug animals over the head and be overwhumped and your main difficulty is with bodies well you get human body trying to duplicate machine ah well that requires different type of body thats right thetan is not very happy running machine in meat body he just isnt hes much happier in robot doll body type of setup why because its made out of metal and is animated and the machine is made out of metal and its animated so he does perfectly nice duplication he never gets sick running machines get the idea and of course you get society now that has high velocity if youre in car out here going thirty miles an hour and you hit tree the body youve got will have had it itll at least get bruised now in high velocity society that runs something on the order of fifty sixty miles an hour on the highway and so forth you dont want bodies that go streaming all over the road why they bleed and all kinds of things and furthermore theyre not good survival for machines machines cant eat bodies theyre not good fuel theyre not good anything you have to go bury them someplace because they start putrefying and so forth its total waste you take doll body doll body crash at sixty miles an hour in doll body would be something like mosquito bite so you of course can perfectly afford to run sixty mile an hour vehicle while youre in doll body you got the idea all right so you have man protesting very ineffectually about machinery oh well theres its almost died out everybodys sort of overwhelmed by the machine but its big lot of trouble you have man organized into safety councils and all sorts of things in order to restrain traffic and so forth well hes unhappy because hes in fixedvalence state now at time am i advocating anything like pastoral return to nature or that we all pick up doll bodies and carry on because it isnt necessarily true that meat body humanoidtype body it isnt necessarily true that its bad body form it is not bad body form as matter of fact you should be able to take meat body and throw it up against brick wall that practically flattens it till it looks like pancake pick it up shake it out put it back on again and its perfectly all right there isnt even bruise you have the evidence of this what holds broken leg broken have you ever healed anybodys broken leg have you ever speeded up healing or an injury of any kind whatsoever well what was holding it if you could help it without doing anything with it all you had to do was run out the engram or something of this sort if youve helped somebody get well then it must have been that the thetan himself was slowing down the process of healing ah but lets take that just little bit further and say then the thetan must himself have been perpetuating the process of destruction so it takes an entirely different type of orientation to run meat body in scientific machine highspeed society theres liability in doing so but there is one where the body is oriented to fight lions and there arent any lions you look every place and you look under the sofas and in back of the hedges and you can find lions but there are lot of things out there running up and down the highway that make lion look tame ill tell you pat from tenton truck is much more serious so fixed condition of valence which is so fixed and unalterable that nothing can change it not even punishment and which is outofdate will of course make an unhappy person inevitable that it will make an unhappy person now that these things have survival potential nobody will dispute they have tremendous survival potential in that the entire history of healing has never been able to do anything with valence is something on the order of an attestation theyve never been able to do anything with them either theyve had all sorts of campaigns like be nice to the insane you know doesnt work theres nothing theres been way of handling readjustment of beings now you have method that does handle the situation all right well dont be surprised that while youre applying this the valence objects it will you let valence run on auto be totally neglected and youre in for trouble now ill tell you that i have learned great deal this summer i have learned great deal this summer i have learned not by treating people experimentally but by doing what we have always been doing the best that we could do at that time i have learned that not even the basic processes of scientology will do more than patchup when it comes to clearing not even the basic processes of scientology applied to preclear whose valence has not been located they wont do anything very much its not permanent proposition oh yes you could cave it in oh yes you could change it around oh yes you can make some shifts but you cant clear them you can make an alteration of case but you cant make regain of case you have to apply the route of find his goal and that permits you to find the valence chain and then audit the valence now you can get someplace now you can whiz because you are right there where you should be you have pc who is unaware of being somebody he is being they dont know theyre being this person so what use is being this person to them its joy to them totally unknown situation and this sort of thing is something is getting in their road and making them succumb on certain projects and is tripping up their lives and is messing them up in general and they dont even know what it is well theres just an addiction to another period and zone of life another time of history another skill package fortunately not all mens skill packages hang up as valences you shouldnt say that everything man can do or every package of skills man gets is the result of valence it is not it is not thetan is totally capable of doing these various things for instance i dont think i ever got into i probably never had valence of when knighthood was in flower that type of valence those periods come and go on every planet you get everybody tired of doing anything and youll get period of when knighthood was in flower you know and it goes through the same pattern lines and all that sort of thing all right thats fine you arrive in society of that character now if you can excel in any way in society of that character then it must be that you cant be operating with valence how can you excel if youre operating as valence because the operation of valence is nonsentient operation it is operation in the absence of knowingness well you try to take one single run down the lists without knowing consciously how to do it just try it and youre going to wind up in the middle of the damnedest scramble of tinware you ever were in there are never any two runs just alike there are never any two jousts alike so you cant even form good valence to do that but when thetan is totally overwhelmed and when he has totally given up and when he decides to totally become this thing which will thereafter be him forevermore hes now had it he will never be able to do it again isnt that interesting he will never be able to be good priest if his valence is priest why well the basic underlying impulse is what how did he get to be the priest thats interesting how did he get into this valence it must have been by resisting and trying to knock off priests and he must have worked awfully hard at it and he must have scuppered an awful lot of priests man the landscape must have been littered with them and the basic impulse of the preclear toward the valence is destruction of the valence so therefore every time you dont let the pc get at it why you get valence takeover because the pc has lost what is the first thing he thinks he loses to he must be losing to the valence although he might be blaming the auditor he thinks the auditor has now ganged up with the valence you see its the valence which has overcome him again so his basic impulse toward valence is destruction so you ever think youre going to get anything but destructive action from something which is being operated now by thetan which has its primary impulse of destruction its primarily destructive impulse so you have people who are living in valences toward which they have nothing but the most violent feelings if they have any feelings left at all way down on the lower realm they have the most violent destructive feelings toward that valence now this valence is going to succeed is it the dickens it is so if we had valence of jousting knight and the person were totally in the valence of jousting knight we would put him out on the lists and we could put him on the horse and we could pretty him up and we could polish his armor and we could give him the most dizzledazzle of devices for his shield and we could give him the very best ash spears and we could have the prettiest girls tying their most suggestive underthings around his neck and hed wind up in pile of tinware because every time the thetan wakes up even slightly to call for decision he makes destructive decision with regard to the action which he is doing halfway down the lists the thetan says let see where am i oh this crash see it just requires the slightest rekindling of the actual intelligence and personality of the being to cause destruction to take place now it doesnt have to be in anything as romantic or as bombastic as jousting knight this fellows machinist thats the valence hes been totally overwhumped by machinists so this life hes moving through coventry see and theres jobs anyplace but that of machinist and he finds himself there and he sort of trains as machinist and at first it looks like he has little facility of it but he doesnt but he does but he doesnt but he does and then one day hes standing up at the machine and suddenly the thetan wakes up slightly and says where am i oh machinist crush you see and into the machinery he goes thats it get the idea and he finds out he cant push him into the machinery because the machinist gets well and is back at his platform again now he could make him sick see he could make him feel bad he could make him lazy he could make him inactive and you might say the primary battle of the universe is the battle between the thetan and the valence and the impulse of the thetan is total destruction of the valence which ought to make your job as an auditor awfully damned easy because youre auditing somebody whose first wish is to get rid of this thing and as soon as he has hes won hell come back to being himself and hell be able to walk with his head in the sky again but until that time hes defeated hes defeated from the moment that he was overwhelmed way back hundred trillion years ago right up till now hes been defeated the whole ruddy lot so that ought to make your job very very easy and if you look at it like that youll see youll also be able to understand the activities of men youll understand why this fellow is dramatizing being bank president and always going bankrupt now theres another fellow who is bank president and he isnt going bankrupt but he has trouble with boat you see its all kind of unexplained and all hit or miss well its just that very solid fact of what valence is he in because that for sure he will commit suicide with hell commit suicide with it because his primary foe is that valence and thats all there is to that that is the thing he is trying to kill and when you find that the valence will ebb and flow and he will go through all the propitiative attitudes toward the valence and it will look for while as though he really wants to keep this valence and so on and all kinds of misemotional reactions toward this valence and itll get on up the lot and when he finally comes out in the clear he is not any longer overwhelmed so that is what youre trying to do basically so that is the attention you are trying to direct you are trying to direct the pcs attention toward eradication of all of the points which made him slave to valence and if you fail to direct his attention of course there is nothing else there to be directed there is nothing else present except this valence and if you overwhelm the pc in some fashion he will dramatize the valence so dont blame anybody but yourself if you have rough session and you can always predict how the pc will operate if you had somebody who was trancer lets say he had valence called trancer you know its person who went into trances youd know whenever the pc was out of session because the pc would trance pc isnt any longer present the valence is present you see that as an immediate detection all right get the rudiments in the rudiments must be out because the valence took over see its as simple as that the more you know about the valence the easier it is to audit the pc and the more you know about the valence why the easier it is to predict what the pc will do and what youve got to do now you could sit down and have yourself nice thought about that if you know the valence of the pc youre operating just have nice thought about it say i wonder what this pc would do and just mentally forecast what would be this pc out of session what would be this pc as the total valence what would this pc do as the total valence because thats what the pc is doing as total valence when the pc is out of session so anytime the pc does that you know you should get your rudiments in see how tricky that is this information can be used all right so the first signal that you have failed to direct the pcs attention and that you have complimented the overwhelmingness of the valence is breakdown of the rudiments well now you should be clever enough auditor not to let it go that far you shouldnt let rudiments break down you should be able to catch them before they fall now some people have fast reaction time and when an egg falls off the table they are very able to catch it before it hits the floor and other people when the egg falls off the table they have to go get mop and the auditor who has to go get mop all the time which is to say put the valence in rudiments in just isnt reacting very fast see hes got slow reaction now what you want when youre adding all this up what you want in the final analysis is ways and means of observation of observing pc to know what is going wrong and why it is going wrong to know when the pc is insession when the pc is not insession now ive just given you ways and means by which you can do that and itd make you appear pretty clever if it well you know what the pcs valence is pcs valence is robot dont think youre really getting down to it when he starts to clank the valences rudiments are out when he clanks the pc doesnt clank you can have pc sailing all around and he doesnt clank but robot clanks and you must have brought that into total replay must be valence out i mean rudiment out for the valence to be in see that the pc who dramatizes his valence has rudiment out simple there are many ways of looking at this sort of thing and of course one of the ways of handling this wrong would be as follows pcs terminal is robot so youve got it all figured out how the pc would operate if he suddenly went out of valence hes going to go whirclank all right so the pc is running through some terrifically heavy stretch of engram or something of the sort and he starts going rrrrrrrrrrrr you say rudiments out all right well thats the last command of that particular process now lets get these rudiments in i dont think thatd be the way to handle that as matter of fact i think that would have let the valence totally overwhelm the pc dont you see the way to do that is just be little more positive little more direct and direct the pcs attention you forgot the pc someplace along the line thats for sure and you start directing the pcs attention and that whir will turn right off you caught the egg before it went splash these are all the nice little niceties of auditing these are little tiny thingamubumps that makes the difference between clearing in ten thousand hours and clearing in couple hundred see it isnt enough to say to you challengingly well now if you just had sufficient powers of observation and if you would just learn to look why you would be good auditor there now ive said it and thats it and anything you did wrong why then just say to you challengingly well you just dont know what youre looking at and so forth you see and so on that would be germanic method of teaching i went to heidelberg once they specialized in it when they could get you into class but fortunately at heidelberg there was compulsion of attending class but the favored method of handling student was just to show him continuously that he was wrong give him some wide generality of observation you see something that could be interpreted in fifteen dozen different directions and then give it with complete german didacticness usually an involved paragraph you see where everything modified everything and then all the clauses modified the lot and then just with the most contemptuous lordly tone of voice call the students attention to that as though that solved all the problems of the universe you see its quite method of teaching well we dont pursue this method of teaching and i would feel i was doing it to you little bit if i didnt tell you what you should be looking for and what you should be looking at and if you as an auditor have an idea that youre looking for anything else than compliance of the pc for the auditing command direction of the pcs attention to his case keeping the pc insession if you think youre doing something else you ought to shed it as excess baggage you ought to drop it over in the canal because the canals long distance from here and because its just so much excess baggage anything that doesnt contribute to this exact situation of getting the pc into session directing the pcs attention getting the valence plowed out and bringing the thetan back up to where he can breathe light and air again is not auditing anything that detracts from it you can jettison at any time if you do those things man can you get case to run and case can really run you would be amazed how thoroughly and how solidly and how much of sprint of gain can be done in one session with the pc totally insession and the auditor in there pitching the whole session all the way through wow i mean tremendous changes can occur just by never letting the pcs attention wander you say the auditing command and he says whir whir whir whir whir whir whir whir whir whir whir whir whir whir whir whir whir whir whir well from about the second whir on you are wasting time he hasnt got your auditing command thats whats wrong the least you could say is did you get that oh uh wha hmm well heres the auditing command or howd you do that what were you looking at okay thats good good heres the next auditing command bang what are you looking at now did anything happen then all right whats going on for while hell say nyyrrr nyyrrr and hell act like robot or lion tamer or whatever he is and all of sudden hell say you know theres somebody in here looking over my shoulder maybe id better start working on this do you suppose i ever could do you suppose in some slight do you suppose that theres some tiny tiny tiny faint little chance that at some time at some undetermined future i might possibly get up parallel with this lion tamer do you suppose i dont know sounds pretty pretty something or oth ah yeah its not true couldnt possibly be and then the auditors back in there again saying all right you can lick that lion tamer you know kind of thing you can direct your attention around and so forth you dont have to do what the lion tamer does now what i want you to do is soandso and soandso the next thing you know his confidence starts coming up and his confidence gets bigger you know and theres less and less lion tamer and theres more and more pc but it can ride for very long time if you just let th matters take their course and remember to do everything technically perfect and think to yourself now lets see let make sure that i get the acknowledgment across to the pc i wonder if he got that acknowledgment i think the next time now ill give more forceful auditing command this time now lets see is the emeter all tuned in properly and so forth and so on you go on worrying about how youre running the session you wont run one because youre worried about directing your attention you couldnt possibly be worried about directing your attention and worried about directing the pcs attention at the same time because now weve got two pcs and two pcs dont make session and the only thing which is in your favor and the only reason auditing can be done is you very seldom have the same terminals but wouldnt that be ball you know auditors will sometimes deny pc their own terminal or become upset because the pc has terminal similar to theirs all kinds of wildball things can happen but fortunately theres an infinite number and the chances of matchup are very slight so you fall amongst you fall in the sunlight that lies amongst the shadows and you can do your job very easily thank you
