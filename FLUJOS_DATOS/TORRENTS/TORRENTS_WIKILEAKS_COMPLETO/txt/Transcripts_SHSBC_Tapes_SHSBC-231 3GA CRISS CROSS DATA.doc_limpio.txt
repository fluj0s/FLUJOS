3ga criss cross data lecture given on 25 october 1962 thank you it has become damp the english weather has turned into unusual california weather used to have secretary while i was working down in hollywood for films studio would send her over every morning route out shed come in shed open up the blinds shed look outside shed say my what unusual weather see this kept up for about two months so one day she came in and she opened up the blinds and she looked outand before she could speak i said my what unusual weather she applied for transfer to some other writer i can tell you that as story suzie isnt here yet anyway this is the what of what audience 25 october twentyfive25 oct ad 12 this is the month with the thermonuclear in it well this first lecture here is an experimental approach to 3ga criss cross and accumulated data on 3ga criss cross and i have awfully awfully awfully good news for you i have made breakthrough i think which you will find very very interesting and if this works out uniformly which i have reason to believe that it will not it will be simple method of an assessment on couple of lists and youll have your first item with crash on the pc thats interesting isnt it audience yeah i dont know why you should be so lucky as to have around but there it is now the rock slam was called rock slam because it was obvious that the first item on the pcs track was an item with which the pc had very large confusion it was the first thing that he used to help with or to get help with or something of this sort and it was called the rock and its actually original definition i believe was that it was the first mass that he attributed large significances to now we were clearing people by merely clearing out of the road the rock now that was done exclusively with help processes on about 5way bracket and we did make some clearspeople that went free needle and proper point on the tone arm and felt wonderful and so forth just by this process of assessment for the rock now i noticed in doing the research work on this that the road to the rock was accompanied with very peculiar agitation of the needle and other word or name had been given this agitation of the needlewhich went left and right and back and forth and so forth and i gave it the term rock slam because its certainly slamming needle its going to the left and to the right and back and forth in high degree of agitation now that phenomenon is an extremely basic phenomenon in clearing and as you can realize the number of stable clears that were made in earlier years must therefore be very close to zero weve made temporary clears lots of times wevepeople have hung on quite awhile and all that sort of thing but stable clears you see and that is our target somebody who will simply get that wayand stay that way along the line well now obviously person who was rock clearthat is you could get down to their rock and blow their rockstill wouldnt have knocked off all of the gpm because underlying that rock was goal and between that first that acc in which that was taughtwas that the twentieth audience yeah the 20th acc and sometime just before iit was about the time of the south african congress i integrated goal as the underlying thing below the rock now this broadened out clearing considerably you see now you have whole channel of pertinent terminals of various kindsthings that the pc has beenand then this goes down to the earliest beennesswhich is the rock see but underlying the rock we find the goal you get what the anatomy is you can draw yourself little channel here very very easily and you would see exactly what we are looking at here and these data are very hard to come by by the way here is yourhere is the way it might be said to be theres the rock at the bottom here and then heres the goal now you see that see theres some sort of channel of livingness which comes down this long line and gets to the rock and theres the goal all right now the goal then lies earlier than the rock but the rock is the first big mass that occurs after this fact and of course up this channel of livingness we have all sorts of small valences you see or repeating valences and what i didnt know at that time and which i found out about the middle of last year is you actually have two valences like thisone whose force is that direction and one whose force is against it in that direction looks like dumbbell every once in while pcs run into these things and they say ron how did you know well i looked and anyway thethis thing is the basic unit anatomy of the gpm you have mass versus mass b and they are impinged on each other and one is terminal and one is an oppterm referring you to last tuesday nights lectures therefore the rock must have another rock get the idea the rocks got another rock now you have to ask this question about the gpm see how come it stays in place how come it stays in place how come it stays suspended in space in time how come it stays with you well it must be very carefully balanced against an opposing force and hence we get this word goals problem mass heard relatively few months ago last autumn i think why goals problem mass well it is that mass which results in the problem of the terminal versus the opptermas result of the pc having postulated goal now this interesting proposition could be offered and we could say that thats how it hangs up so delicately in space i worked this out synthetically you know just on asking this one question of how the devil does it stay there you know and it has to be opposing forces which are in balance with it for the thing to stay in place so we have these two dumbbells one against the otherrepeated many times in the bank but each one of them held in very very critical balance the one thing that is missing in newtons laws in the field of physics that physics professorand i think there must be hundreds of thousands of them lecturing on physics throughout the worldhas ever seemed to have noticed theres the law of comparable magnitude and they violate this they know themthe data is incomparable all the time and they give you such an idiocy that when you stamp on the earth the earth moves back to the degree that you move down you know relative mass yes well you know ive gotten out there and taken look you know and it doesnt now we have the comparable magnitude of the overt you consider it overt to swat fly yet flies swat you through disease and other vias once in blue moonbut you dont consider that return of the overt i dont think thats much of terminaloppterm situation you swatting fly you see the law of comparable magnitudes is violated now newtons three laws are only valid in the zone of comparable magnitude for every action there is an equal and contrary reaction well that isnt necessarily violated because it does say equal but that in itself is the assumption of an absolute which makes the law hehheha little bit questionable but theres the law of acceleration theres the law of inertiathe tendency of body to remain at state of rest or remain in state of motion dont you see all these things are true unless you get forces which are too differenttoo far apart you get the idea inertia the tendency of body to remain in the state of rest well i think actually when cannonball hits palm tree splinter i dont think the palm tree splinter has any law of inertia get the idea i mean it has tendency at all to remain at state of rest see itd be utterly unmeasurable and it becomes idiotic see drop the empire state building on fly you see and then say the fly had tendency to remain in state of rest these things become ridiculous dont you see now the size of the basic rockopprock is pretty darn big and these things versus one another contain rather interestingly strong forces very strong forces and theyre studded and pushed in against and everything is smashed up together of smaller pairs of these dumbbells and theres smaller pairs of dumbbells and smaller pairs of dumbbells and the further the thetan progresses in timefrom the moment of the assumption of the rock then the less force or mass he has to have to consider it force or mass his consideration of what is force and what is mass deteriorates so you get smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller dumbbells see they go fromwell youve seen somebody around and youve swatted him on the back you know in friendly gestureyouve patted him on the back you knowjust about hardly anyhardly even that you know and he says oooww god ive broken my ribs you know well slice of carrot versus slice of cabbage would appear to him to be insurmountably great and powerful you get the idea of the size of the dumbbell its declined his conception of his own force his ability to handle force and so forth and mass has deteriorated and its deteriorated down to point where the dumbbell at the top of thisif we consider that nowis almost microscopically smallone versus the other and then as we progress down from the top toward this rock we get bigger and bigger dumbbells versus bs you see till we get down to the rock versus the opprock and weve got it see and thats big now that tells you at once why when you say to somebody all right thats your goalwell why dont you just change your mind see thats approaching clearing on nogradient and he cant do it why cant he do it because his concept of force in the vicinity of the time he postulated this goal envisioned something being pretty forceful before he would call it force and now he lets out gentle sigh and thinks he is blowing furnace blast you see so he cant face that much force see he cant face this much force at once as is contained in the rockopprock area which is much earlier in time do you follow that so you say to him all right blow the gpm thank you well i guess you failed huh hehhehheh why cant he blow the gpm just like that well its decline of force is the story as the eons have marched onhis concept of what is force has degenerated in other words he doesnt consider that that forceful he doesnt consider once upon time he considered motion with an exclamation point you see well thatd be something on the order of meteorite hitting spaceship hed say hey pretty good you know and now he dents the left fender of his car slightly you see and oh my god you know thats too much force you see so the reason he doesnt blow his goal instantly and at once is very simple reason the goal lies before and earlier than higher idea of force and he gets into that zone and he cant tolerate that much force in that much area so he cannot confront it he just cant confront that much force its too much for he says now you might be able to get the forces of this lifetime and audit them very easily but as soon as you start chipping back about five or six lifetimes you start running into this phenomena you know i remember my idea of good way to warm up was to take horse like percheron you know and take ninetyeight or hundred and ten pounds worth of armor and take about fifteen foot long ash spear and go out in the lists someplace you know and get this horse up to about thirty miles an hour you know and let him run headon into another guy coming down the course in the other direction at thirty miles an hour you know that was nice quiet way to warm up now the reason why it was spectacular is the people in the grandstand considered that too much force for them and the reason one was successful at it is it did not exceed his idea of what was forceful because that didnt look like all that much impact to him why do you stop such thing well after few centuries of monkeying around this way you pick yourself up off the ground and pick the hardware off of yourself you see and your head is ringing you know and you say you know im just not the man i was once i think ill take up judging these things you see see you said thats too much force for you see once upon time this was almost gag see that much footpounds of impactwell that was just good way to warm upyou know yeah make you feel kind of alive and you deteriorate in your concept of that same thing of good god how can they stand up to it similarly racing on thisat this time on this planet you have many of these ideas in restimulation and so forth youve got racing its always coming as surprise to somebody that he cant stand up to as much force as he thought he could ear hits brick wall or something like this and he gets his wind knocked out and the fenders get dented and so forth he hasnt conceived there was that much force well how does his idea that that isnt very fatal permit him to go into race where that could be very fatal well its his misconceptions of the thing hes measuring track by an earliertrack idea follow this now in the marcab confederacy racing car was turbinedriven job and they went on for thousands of years i think there was ten or twelve thousand years they always had the same race ears same races everything they didnt believe in progress and they went about two hundred and seventyfive miles an hour according to our present standards they went at high whine and they used to have casualties those things would go into brick wall or one of the concrete ramparts or something like that and theyd have casualty theyd have to take the pilot out and take him to the hospital tent see take the driver out of that and take him to the hospital tent to patch him up now that is within the last forty thousand years you get how rapidly ones concept of mass can deteriorate becausei mention that because some of you have got marcab on your tracks lot of you people run into bits and pieces of the racetracks of marcab well take look at itat how much force you see two hundred and seventyfive miles an hour in turbine driven car hitting concrete wall and having to go to the hospital tent hundred and ten miles an hourcaroming off of brick wall or fence and getting buried thats different ideas see its deterioration of the idea of force now that doesnt say that the thetan sometimes miraculously suddenly cant regain his older ideas of how much force he can tolerate but it does say that on the average theres general deterioration so when you ask thetan to go on the earliest track find his goal be right there at the point of his goal all right now you see that now just change your mind thank you and it blows the whole bankyou see now why that doesnt work see youve asked him to go and climb in to five hundred mile an hour racing car hit concrete wall and live thats the way it looks to him he says what haha hoho you silly you must think im stupid well at the time he made up this thing itd been something on the order of if he went at the speed of meteor and you hit an asteroidwell that was good way to acquire mass see about the time he was making this goal up that was his idea of mass you see impact forceway up there well you want to know what youre up against in clearing somebody youre up against concept of mass and forcerelative to their experiences and bad experiences and there isnt even any name for this we have randomity its plus or minus motion can be tolerated by the individual and it comes under the heading of randomity but it would also be an extension of this thing called randomity itd be plus or minus force the individual could tolerate and plus or minus mass how much mass is mass and early on the track he said oh well thats pretty goodsized mass there and he points to big planet yeah thats nice piece of mest you know thats nice just about my size and we find this same thetan late on the track and she can handle bonbon very well say whatswhatswhats your idea of mass and person says ah thatthat bonbon thats very nice very nice piece of mass there or diamond ringvery nice mass now if you dont think peoples ideas of mass deteriorate rather rapidly you should look at the disappearance of solid coinery in the bigger denominationsgold pieces that sort of thing that isnt all it isnt just the scarcity of goldsomebody could have dreamed up something to solve thisim sure but its another thing its another thing do you know that they used to make silver pieces in very outrageously large sizes i saw one time i stepped off the plane to get breather i think in salisbury and somebody at the lunch counter was fooling around i think with fiveshilling coin it was an interesting looking coin it was monstrous coin it was very thick and it was very soft and it was solid silver and it was way back from the old days when they used to dig it out of vein down there and throw it in the mold and hope it was legal tender you know but that was at one time nicewell it was money it was valuable it could buy something well obviously its too much mass now thats obviously too much coin because that coinalthough five shillings doesnt buy now anything it would have bought thenwhy the people take two much smaller coins to make up that five shilling by preference dont you see you get the deterioration of the monetary idea well you can see this almost anyplace around theres some signs of this thing now whats this add up to it adds up to why you cant immediately rapidly and right now clear somebody and why some cases clear easily and some cases clear hard and this is the answer to that i can guarantee this to you nowthat is the answer it isnt anything else this case has verystill got very massy idea of mass you know you know he says well yeah nice piece of mass you know mountain well he clears pretty easily see but this next case says well nice piece of masstake that dirty coin out of here hes inverted on the idea of mass cant look at it doesnt want to have anything to do with it also it might surprise you if you havent thought of itthat the idea of pain as an undesirable commoditypain as an undesirable commodity is late idea pain is not uniformly an undesirable commodity on the whole track it is simply another sensation now pain tends to increase as an unwanted feared and undesirable thing as ones concept of mass and force deteriorates theres direct relationship between these two things well let melet state this properly mathematically its an inverse relation so the more person fears pain and shudders away from pain why the less mass and force he can tolerate in other words this idea of pain pain is basically sensation of impact thats basically what it is you seldom have pain without having some separation of impact or collision of impact or something like that pain is most normally in this line although pain is heatcoldelectrical sensation it is that with which force begins to be greeted as the individuals idea of force deteriorates well lets take in one lifetime at the age of sixteen fast enough is ninety miles an hour he considers thats pretty good ninety miles an hourthats fine with him at the age of twentyfivefiftyfive sixty that is fast enoughand thats fine with him thirtyfive onforty thats pretty fastthats fast enough and about the age of seventyyou get the character who causes all the accidents by going down the middle of the road at fifteen now people may think they want bigger mass but they tend to compensate for it with slower speed so there is also speedmass ratio of tolerance you can have big mass if it goes awful slow therefore you see the fellow in his cadillac going twenty miles an hour on the turnpike you know you see this quite bit you know massive carvery tiny speeds so on the car would be totally undesirable to him you see the speedmass ratio would be too have too high figure if he drove that ear at proper speed thirtyfive forty fiftysomething like this haha thats too much for him man also you get the popularity of small ears and the popularity of scooters motorbikesbut not motorbikes that go fast but scooters that go slow and you find those things are gettingthey have popularity well they may or may not have practicalitythey do furnish transportation at very very low petrol and gas cost but remember something youre actually increasing the liability of an impact see theres something going astray here because the percentage of accidents that occur on scootersim not condemning anybodys scooter id just as soon ride scooters id preferably prefer tt model 650s howeverbut the deterioration of his idea of what mass is good mass actually puts him in danger see so it isnt reasonable sense and logic have nothing to do with this it is simply the concept of how much mass is mass and how much and so onand they will do stupid things and you want to know how stupid they can get about 400 ad the roman legionsbecause the armor was too heavyhad ceased to practice with practice armor which was always heavier and they have ceased to use practice armor of any kind it was always heavier than battle armor dont you see nobody could get them to practice with it anymore and fifty seventyfive years laterwe find these same legions going into battle having thrown away their armor theyre nuts see they longer can strike an accurate blow and here they dont even defend themselves dont you see so frankly what happens istheir concept of the stronger higher forces diminishes and disappears see it fades out they longer have any concept of these forces these forces are beyond their concept well similarly with pain an individual readily forgets how much pain pain can hurt you know how much pain can pain be you find accident victims very often are surprised as hell at how hard it hurts see well similarly theyre just surprised as the devil when that much mass occurs thats too much mass see they get the idea in other words not only does the ability to experience it deterioratebut the ability to conceive it deteriorates so eventually they start doing stupid things see theyre trying to avoid pain so they get hurt all the time thats your accidentprone theyre longer able to conceive the mass theyre longer able to conceive the force and theyre always being surprised at the pain and it doesnt last in their minds any time duration at all so they get hurt again and they get and that sometimes these people will explain to you the chain of circumstances by which they were hurt and man it hasnt anything to do with what happened you stand there with your jaw dropped youve already made leg up on this before you came to saint hill actually because all the time youve been in processing your tolerance of mass and force has been increasing and because you can wipe out pain in yourself with an assist and youve had experiences of this particular kindyour respect for it and your awe of it is diminishing well youre just climbing back up the scale so im actually talking about somethinga route you have been on for some time now itd be just little bit difficult for you to immediately and directly then catch up with what the quote man in the street unquote has as concept of pain force and mass see what does he think these things are what is he willing to handle what does he conceive of as actual force actual mass see and so you see him going on doing silly stupid things and one of your biggest protests against the world around you is people are doing such stupid silly things theyre doing very silly things they do very silly things with forcethey do very silly things with mass youve got an instance right this moment although i told ron i wasnt going to say anything about the world situation youve got this very moment and have had for dozen years or more oh more than that twenty years force which is totally beyond the concept of the worlds greatest leaders you have to say that reverently but they dont know what theyve got their paws on see this you read with amazement how they compare nuclear fission to hundredthousandton bomb of tnt or somethingor sixtytwo tnt bombs or groping around you see within something that they can call textbook you see response of world war ii well that hasnt anything to do with it because that force and mass is delivered in split second and because it is delivered in such small moment of timeit has enormous impact valuewhich is upwards through millions of times the impact value of tnt but you know not even in their textbooks have i seen them sort that fact out they dont adequately sort it out you see actually the force increases as the time decreases because force is always measured in units of time so if you have milliseconds of time in which force is delivered you seeyou cant use force without reference to timejust thatby definition thats what force is so the shorter the time period of the force delivery why the greater the impact you see the greater the actual force im using very clumsy words because force does contain time dont you see see you cant say that the smaller amount of time in which that force is delivered youd have to say the footpounds are delivered see you deliver thousand footpounds you deliver thousand footpounds in an hour and all you are doing is driving uptown in your car see something like that and you deliver it in five minutes and youre probably pushing over brick wall or something and you deliver it something on the order of half secondyoure getting up around naval gunfire see thatswell thats thousthats the same thousand footpounds dont you see so this distributed out over period of time becomes confrontable but as it is reduced in its period of time becomes unconfrontable and nuclear fission has done just that there is such thing as comparing it to thousand tnt bombs exploded at what frequency how often in what mass because they dont even go off as fast as nuclear fission this is very interesting because theyve just totally avoided this whole idea so they dont know what to do with this they havent any idea of what to do with all this force heres head of state and he has these tremendous forces and these tremendous striking powers and all that sort of thingand he says well go shoot some gnats see do something like that with it he doesnt know hes groping dont you see the distribution of this forcewhat would happen to it youd find all sorts of arguments they take greatgreat pat on the back they pat themselves on the back as realists they say well it wouldnt crack earths crust lf we exploded thousand of these things over russiait wouldnt do anything much we hope we guess well i frankly believe that any time they start using this stuff at any great range or action and so forthi firmly believe that itd be just exactly like firing shotgun with the breech halfclosed the guy firing it is going to get just about as much as anything being shot at you know theyre up there to force that they cant live with having released so thats why you have these brothers around conference tables discussing and arguing and theyre trying to play chess with this stuff you know you watch this you know well it isnt that these are great men that know what theyre doingand guiding destinies all properlyits just that they dont know what game theyre in see this is going to surprise them theyre going to get very great surprise war usually surprises such people youre wondering whether i think there will be nuclear war in the next five minutes well im not going on vacation on the second of november i just looked at the old crystal ball and it looks sort of explosive up there around the twelfth or thirteenth so i thought well ill go later oh i dont think theyll do anything very desperate im just giving you an idea these birdsthe forces involved are actually sufficient and adequateif they had any concept of what theyre doingto bring them at once to conference table to arrange to disband the lot you get the idea lets take it all down lets put it in hole someplaceand make fuel out of it or somethingand theyd just be pals you see about this whole thing you know and theyre playing games with it you know im shoot you if you shoot you know god thats crazy you know because leader fires at leader b the same shot is going to take leader xs head off yeah i often wonder if they dont think of themselves as the whole world in flames and the government building untouched this is marvelous to behold dont you see but theyre just dealing with greater force than they have any concept of see and theyre actually still want to play politics well only mad men would do something like that i had good title few years ago i was going to write book the madmen in charge never got around to it but still may do it sounds like it might be an interesting book washington by the way its evacuation plans change every month or so but apparently everybody in the navy department is supposed to go get their ear in the parking lot and then drive past the entrance to the navy department and then the people in the entrance to the navy department are supposed to come out of the entrance and theyre supposed to get in these ears and then theyre supposed to go to an area nearby and then theyre supposed to set up something there im not quite surei think the plan fades out before they get to this new area were going to have queue of two thousand cars or five thousand cars or fifteen thousand earsstrung out in front of the single entrance aw theyd just never make it thats all this deteriorated these civil defense plans deteriorated to something very amusing i think not too long ago somebody from civil defense headquarters in washington from writing books as to what we were supposed to doi saw their last set of plans this is very interesting they move things from one section of town to another section of town compared to which section of town was damaged by the bombs yeah and theirthe hospital where theyre going to bring all the casualties to is in the middle of town this is just insane raving dont you see i was very much amused at all this but the denouement of thishaving been issued many copies of this from time to time and changing plans and so forthwhy the last one i heard from fcdc is the civil defense officials had come around and calledi think it was on the org see and had asked him if we had any civil defense plans did we have any plans he didnt want them for the townapparently the policy now is for every organization to have its own plans for civil defense you get the deterioration into the total individuation of it all see now everybodys supposed to have separate set of plans and man thatll really look good you get around washington you know some of the kids around washington they really laugh about this because they go out along the highwayi think theyve taken most of these signs down i didnt see them when i was over there last month i didnt see one but i wasnt looking very hard either but they used to have signs and you drive outside the district of columbia in any direction and it said in time of national emergency or something like this this highway will be closed to civilian traffic only it was on all highways and on all roadson all sides of the district marvelous in other words they cannot plan in the face of that much force do you see they become totally illogical in the face of that much force there is planning involved beyond their concept or ability telephone call this afternoon from the states somebody remarked that people are tearing around madly in all directions buying supplies of food and digging holes in the ground and theyre having ball theyre having ball think probably the safest place in the world is probably washington dc probably very safebecause you see if their level of confront is that poor its very doubtful if anybody will confront washington or moscow because thesed be the two places you would have to confront to solve the situation but i dont think the war will ever come up to confronting either place i think were in more danger i think they will probably find out that it was england and south africa that started the whole cuban invasion theyll get something figured out therefore you are baffled very often at somebodys approach to his quote problems in life what he will do as solution to his problemsand how this sounds logical to this person you dont dig see you listen to him you hear wordsbut it doesnt make any sense now lets see if he just sends his wife whos forty to the university and if he himself will take up skindiving why somehow his overdraft at the bank will all work out and man youll hear some wild ones now whats the matter with this guy well his problems contain force and he cannot confront either using or receiving that much force so he simply neglects it now its this factor alone on which the governments of the world are constructed todaythat people cannot conceive force you realize if you break the law flagrantly in any large countryyou realize that the entirety of the army the navy the air force and the whole police the entire judiciary and through newspapers and so forth public opinion meaning the rest of the populationcan be totally turned against single individual you realize its rigged that way well how could it possibly get rigged that way its because nobody conceives that its rigged that way they say well i have the power of vote and i am free citizen and you go on hearing these yap yap yaps see and then all of sudden this individual says i wont pay any taxes well man they make short work out of that well what if this individual got themselves machine gun emplacement and sat down and spoke back in kind what do you think would happen and then supposing he got two or three other means of defense and got defense in depth and so forth how much troops do you think would eventually be piled up against this individual before he finally surrendered it would be the whole force of the country wouldnt it well every citizen in country is versus the force of that country this is not democracythis is just blindness who ever got around to figuring out form of government like that it has freedom involved its just an overwhelma total overwhelm ireland didnt quite buy this ireland had an interesting thing andin its government you can sue personally any individual in the government who does anything you dont like now of course that rather returns it to democratic process cop gives you parking ticket honest hes just in trouble if he doesnt have witnesses because he cant enforce the collection or the fining of that ticket if you contest it because you could sue him for the full value of the fine if you won your case you dont get very militant police force this way theyre more angry than otherwise but all right in washington this might theoretically apply but in washington you should realize that about seventyfive warrants week are requested of the federal district courts against government officials for nonconstitutional and illegal acts in the performance of their duty just about seventyfive week are requested by the public in that one area of washington and to date the district court has never issued one they simply refuse to issue it just stops right there they just blanketly refuse to issue those warrants that means if government official came in pulled out gun killed everybody dead in the housethis is the ne plus ultra on the thingand some relative wanted him indicted for murder it wouldnt happen that is the government of russia today so you see how governments deteriorate thats not the government of the us or england todaybut its the government of another country today they do walk in and kill everybody in the house every now and then and drag somebody off to prison nobody ever hears of them again and theres recourse nobody can say word you have to in england and the united states we generally keep propaganda fan going of some kind or another its just propaganda its just talk against the official we back him down we back him down we always got to keep him more or less convinced that he hasnt got any rights see youve got to keep snarling you got to make him trouble see youve got to do this you got to do that the english have got this down to fine art thats how you keep government from finally caving in and falling all over you you see and dragging you off in the middle of the night see but the truth of the matter is theres absolutely nothing that restrains them from doing it except tradition rather thin stuff tradition isnt it yes when im faced with machine guns and cannon and troops with fixed bayonetstheres nothing like having only tradition to hold my position i always say its so thickso protective every once in while though you hear of somebody getting very satisfactorya very satisfactory bang out of dying like hero for his country on the gallows or for the people or something like that well i want to point something out to youhe died on the gallows cost him body to make that remark and at one body per remark it gets expensive well there ive pointed out to you on upper dynamics the decline of force till force becomes invisible to the person he doesnt recognize that the force is there well as an individual goes on from the time of the goal through the rock area and the opposing masses and hes terminals and hes faced with opptermsand all this gets crushed in and the counter forces and that sort of thingthe whole thing eventually vanishes he cant see any part of it anymore he doesnt even know its there see it doesnt exist and you tell him to try to confront it and he flinches well its interesting that he flinches from nothing the modern psychologist can give you very good example of this he says theres such thing as mental image picture occasionally youll run across in his text some mention of it i ran across mention of it one time and he said children and morons sometimes have them yeah thats fascinating the man is below observing them hes never observed them professionally until its walked into his science see as fact that they dont exist i preserved carefully the last copy off the publishing companys line it was the textbook on psychology for the university of chicago i think and it moved off of the assembly bookbinding lineas the first copy of dianetics the modern science of mental health moved off that line see the last copy of that run was followed by the first copy of dianetics modern science of mental health i picked the book off and said to the publisherthe binding was not well pressed or anything and i picked this psychology textbook off actually it was right on the assembly lines on the belt you knowand i picked it off and i said to the publisher look let have this will you i said because after this theyre going to be writing this book into their newer texts and i want to know what exactly psychology was and he said oh yeah well you can have copy of it ron so i kept it and ive still got it its rather fascinating because in the last twelve years they have taken different looks at thingsand they have discovered all sorts of thingsprenatal influences and that sort of thing and they will discover more and more as time goes on but what does it depend on that series of discoveries an improvement of their own ability to look so you get them to confront little bit more and little bit moreand they cant confront what you can confrontbut they can confront little bit more dont you see well their gradient scale of confront is what you are up against in handling any pc toward clearing and isnt enough to just tell him confront it and confront it and confront it and confront it and confront itbecause every now and then you tell him to confront it and something knocks his silly head offand he knows better next time because youve pushed him into an area of too much force too much mass too much force its getting too real to him and he backs out so the study of clearingnow that one knows the mechanics of clearing and what the bank apparently contains and looks likebrings us to the realizationnot to the startling new data but it brings us to the realization that gradient scale of confronting is the only way we ever clear anybody the improvement of the ability of the pc to confront then becomes very pertinent point in clearing and that too cannot be done directly because you have to find out what he can confront and fortunately if youif you just asked him to confront and confront something more and confront something more why he theoretically you see would come up with his goal in the end and he would be clear and so forth but let point out to you this has never happened and its never likely to happen because theres already too much there for him to confront see hes already above the confront level so this meter or any variety of meter gives youthis is what this meter does oddly enough that doesits unsuspected by you unless at least you take look at itit gives you the highest toughest confront that the pc is capable of at that given moment and its measurement of confronting so if it took you ten thousand hours on gradient scale of confronting to clear somebodyyou wouldnt but lets say that you didjust ran some confront process for ten thousand hours maybe youd get clear who knows this to make clearing factual and fast within reasonso that you get it done now and then and once in whileyouve got to be able to pick up the highest level of confront that the individual is capable of repetitively in other words youve got to give him everything he can confront right now and then everything he can confront right now and then everything he can now confront right now got the idea and his confronting has got to be beefed up and improved to that degree and meter selects out for you the auditor to find something the pc can confront and oddly enoughthis is just luck on our partwe have an instrument which leads us straight down this channel without any divergences by giving us the mostest he can confront now now the most he can confront now now the most he can confront now see and by these great big bites of increased confront he gets over the idea that he cant confront he actually would confront more than you can find reading on the meter hell confront more than you can find on meter if you cant find it on the meter there are only two reasons why you cant find it on the meterand the first reason is he cant confront it and the second reason could be that you just havent found it in other words you didnt get anything on the meter so of course he cant confront anything on the meter every once in while youll be busily clearing somebody and suddenly youll see that thing go slam slam slam slam slam youre running lines see and youll see it go slam slam slam slam slam slam slam slam and you sit there and utter the command one of two things happen either the slam dwindles or it vanishes now if it dwindles all right if it just vanishes you ask the pc whatd you do he says well heh hah hehhehhah was little bit too hot for oh im sorry i backed out of that see they didnt know what they were getting into and it made them nervy and they backed out now that doesnt mean that they wont go back there or wont mean that your commands and so forth just ordinary process of doing lines wont bring them back into the channel again but what is this slam slam slam slam slam you see on the meter actually it is force hitting motionlessness theres motionlessness in the bank that is being impinged upon by forces and the direction of flow back and forth and motion of particles in the vicinity of that motionlessness apparently is what gives you the phenomenon of rock slam in other words its something thats changing polarities at such great speedfrom plus to minus and back and forth and so forththat it causes direction of potential changes and so forth so the meter doesnt know what its measuring and its measuring highlowmediumhighlowmediumhighlowmedium see and itll go badada badadadadadadadadadadada see you could say that youre coming down the exact meeting points of the terminal and oppterm youre measuring their exact collision points so thats where youd have maximal force with minimal motion of the obstacles so these things start flying apart when you start disturbing this balance of potential between the two of them and you eventually get down blow the rock andyou hear the rock go kind of itll goi dont mean that actually the pc says something went you know once in while couple of pieces of something goes and you get fooled one dumbbell goes well that wasnt the rock see therell be another one blow and therell be these other things happen but he gets on down below and he finally hits his goal and bang it goes clear and it goes kind of pop and there it was and that was why i made up my mind and geewhiz give him bit of prepcheck get rid of the fragments and thats that hes clear you never do it without following them down the line on meter and youd never do it without the maximal speed of improving his ability to confront that has to be steep as i say if you just took it at slow poke you might be ten thousand hours in the process before you made it but you hit it on the high line you come right straight down the rock slam channel it goes right on down to the rock the rock and opprock and youve all of sudden have got it the whole way youre down to basic that blows the rest of it tends to fly apart and that is that you understand now why this is important and what youre doing actually in clearing of course this isi give you this mainly as allegory and so forth but actually thats pretty accurate graphing of the way it is under that will lie another package and another gpm somebody said to why dont you run the assertion that goes just before the goal he didnt realize he was saying why dont you run the second goal youre going to find on the pc before you run the first goal you find on the pc why doesnt the second goal register haha it cant how can it the guys confront isnt up to seeing the first goal well the second goal is just that much stronger and that much bigger so you have to run the goals off by gradient of confrontand you run down to these rocks by gradient of confront you understand then so you got whole series of these things one after the other of these whole maps of gpm see and eventually when you get to that youll just raise the level of confront all out of proportion thats why your pc gets to feeling better why your pc looks better so forth the pc is much more capable of confronting force much more capable of withstanding pain and much more capable of observing and conceiving mass okay audience mmhm thank you
