coalfired electric power plants power plants account for 42 of total us mercury emissions according to epa in announcing the regulations however ep stated that most mercury in the atmosphere comes from nonus global sources even if regulations could reduce power plant mercury emissions to zero the agency concluded there would be little change in the mercury health effects it has identified this point is contested many argue that power plants make significant contributions to mercury emissions in local hot spots and that reducing power plant missions would significantly reduce risks instead of stringent plantspecific requirements epa promulgated capand trade standards that rely heavily on cobenefits from sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide controls installed under separate agency rule the clean air interstate rule cair this approach minimizes cost s for electric utilities by 2015 less than 1 of coalfired power plants will have installed equipment specifically designed to control mercury under the hg rule accordin g to epa by 2020 only 4 of plants will have such equipment sixteen states have filed suit to overturn the agencys action arguing that epa is required by th clean air act to impose more stringent maximum achievable control technolog standards at each individual plant beginning in 2010 the capandtrade ru limits total power plant mercury emissions to 38 tons annually 21 reduction vs 1999 levels second phase caps annual emissions at 15 tons starting in 2018 according to the agency trading and banking of emission allowances will result in lower than required emissions in the early years but will delay achieveme nt of the 15ton cap to at least 2025 epa has sent contradictory signals regarding the importance of controlling mercury emissions its january 2004 analysis estimated that the indirect benefits of proposed regulations would be 15 billion annually outweighing compliance costs by factor of at least 16 to 1 direct benefits although unquantif iable were said to be large enough to justify s ubstantial investment in hg c ontrol the analysis of the final rule by contrast conc ludes that quantifiable direct and indirect benefits of mercury control are just 43 million per ear epas calculations did not include consideration of an academic study that it had funded factor contributing to the calculation of smaller benefits this decision was one of

neurotoxin that can cause adverse health effects at very low concentrations concerns about public ex posure to mercury have grown in recent years as research has indicated its presen ce at significant levels in numerous species of fish and as analyses of dietary inta ke and resulting blood vels have pointed to potential health risks from mercury ingesti on particularly for women of childbearing age and developing fetuses according to the environmental protection agency epa as of december 2004 44 states had issued fish consumption advisories due to mercury twentyone states primarily in the midwest and north east have issued statewide advisories for mercury in all their freshwater lakes andor rivers in all these advisories cover more than 13 million acres of lake s and roughly 765000 river miles1 twelve states in the southeast and new england have statewide advisories for mercury in their coastal waters and hawaii has statewide advi sory for mercury in marine fish mercury reaches water bodies from natura lly occurring sources from past uses many of which such as fungicide app lication to crops are now banned from disposal of mercurycont aining products and from cu rrent activities principally combustion of fuels containing mercury in trace amounts mercury released to the atmosphere can circulate for up to year before being deposited on land or in water thus it is widely disperse d and often is transported thousands of miles from the emissions source2 according to epa us sour ces contributed only 3 of the 5500 tons of mercury emitted to the tmosphere on global

for all sources of mercury emissions since the mid 1990s mercury emissions have been reduced substantially from the three waste combustorincinerator categories and margina lly from electric utilities in its regulatory impact analysis for the proposed electric utility rule epa used 1999 data showing utility emissions of 48 tons as the baseline against which to compare reductions this percentage is estimated to be even higher in certain regions eg northeast us5 because mercury emissions are concen trated in specific areas and because of variations in precipitation patterns the highest deposition rates according to epa occur in the southern great lakes the ohio valley the northeast and scattered areas in the southeast6 of particular concern for aquatic organisms and human health is mercury in the form of methyl mercury nearly all of the mercury that accumulates in fish tissue is methyl mercury an organic compound form ed by microbial process often in wetland environments once formed meth yl mercury tends to bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms increasing concentrations at each level of the food chain as result top predators in food chain such as largemouth bass or walleye may have concentrations of bioaccumulative cont aminants in their tissues million times higher than the concentrati ons found in the waterbodies7 children born to women with fetal cord blood concentrations of mercury above 58 parts per billion ppb are at some incr eased risk of adverse health effects8 according to epa these health effects include delayed development neurological defects and lower iq recent data reported by the centers for disease control and prevention indicate that about 6 of wo men of childbearing age had bloodmercury levels above the 58 ppb threshold in 199920029 because mercury levels in fetal cord blood are likely to be higher than vels in maternal bl ood the per centage of babies that might be at risk is likely to be greater sources of emissionss tatus of regulations as shown in table 1 us air emissions of merc ury come from eight principal sources of these the largest source is coalfired utility boilers ie coalfired electric power plants these accounted for an

emissions of mercury and mercury compounds in 2003 latest available year as of january 2006 the tri database somewhat overstates the utility share of the total because it excludes waste incine ration and all sources that emit less than 10 pounds of mercuryregulation of nonutility sources as of march 2005 epa had made regulatory promulgations for all major s ources of mercury emissions the authority for most of these regulations is secti on 112 of the clean air act 42 usc 7412 which requires national emis sion standards for hazardous air pollutants in amending section 112 in 1990 congress included list of 188 hazardous air pollutants to be regulated mercury among them epa was directed to identify sources of these pollutants and impose maximum achievable control technology mact section 112 defines mact for ne w facilities as an emission standard less stringent than what is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source ie the best demonstrated technology for existing facilities it allows somewhat less stringent standard setting the average emissions of the best performing 12 of units in the category as minimum in most cases but giving epa discretion to set more stringent standard sources of mercury emissions including coalfired commercial and industrial boilers chloral kali plants and portland cement plants are subject to regulations prom ulgated under this authority separately section 129 of the clean ai r act requires emission standards for solid waste incinerator units including m unicipal and medical waste incinerators these standards which were promulga ted in the mid1990s limit 11 categories of pollutants including mercury under th standards municipal and medical waste incinerators which together accounted fo r 29 of total us mercury emissions before regulation have ach ieved emission reductions of 95 and together emitted only 22 tons of mercury in 2000 according to epa11 as result coalfired utilities the last major source to be regulate d now account for at least 42 of us mercury emissions12 electric utilities and mercury statutory requirements electric utilities were singled out for special consideration by the 1990 clean air act amendments under section 112n epa was required to undertake two studies of rcury emissions and other hazardous air pollutants from electric utility steam generating units and to report to congress before deciding whether to impose mact standards one study was to characterize emissions from utilities municipal waste incinerators and other sources determine their health and

which may warrant regulation under this sec tion after considering the results of this study the administrator shall regulate electric utility steam generating units under this section section 112 if the administrator finds such regulation is appropriate and necessary having submitted the required reports to congress under this section in 1997 and 199813 epa administrator carol browner did find such regulation appropriate and necessary and issued formal fi nding to that effect in december 200014 the finding set in motion the development of mact standards th standards were to be proposed by december 15 2003 and fina l mact rule was to be signed by march 15 2005 mact standards require compliance for existing facilities three years after promulgation with the possibility of oneyear extensions15 epas utility regulations in the march 15 2005 fi nal mercury rules epa did not promulgate mact standard instead it revisited the december 2000 analysis and reversed its regulatory finding in its revised analysis regulating mercury from utilities under s ection 112 is neither appr opriate nor necessary it is not appropriate the agency conclude d because the health effects of mercury from utilities remaining after imposition of other controls do not result in hazards to public health16 it is not necessary in the agencys reasoning because mercury could be regulated under ot her sections of the act specifically section 11117 thus the agency proposed new source performance standard nsps for mercury from utilities under section 111b nd capandtrade system to control emissions from existing and new utility s ources under section 111d of the two section 111 rules attenti on has focused primarily on the capand trade system under section 111d rather than the nsps very few new coalfired units have been built in recent years and only handful of such facilities arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32868crs6 18 see energy information administration us doe annual energy outlook 2005

states alabama kansas nebraska north dakota south dakota and wyoming have intervened on epas side for discussion of the legal issues see crs report rl32203 legal analysis and background on the epas proposed rules for regulating mercury emissions from electric utilities by michael john garcia interesti ngly neither section 111 nor section 112 actually mention capandtrade programs section 111 requires standards of performance defined as standard that reflects the degr ee of emission limitation achievable through the application of the best system of emission reduction emphasis added which the administrator determines has been adequately monstrated epa states that this language allows capandtrade system section 112d also uses broad language referring to measures processes methods systems or tec hniques but in elaborating on this definition for nearly page the statute provides numerous examples and specifics without mentioning capandtrade systems currently moving through the permitting process while some think the rise in natural gas prices will spark construction of new wave of coalfired plants the department of energy projects essentially change in coalfired electric generation between now and 201518 thus it is expected that the nsps will affect far fewer units than the capandtrade rules furt hermore under the promulgated capandtrade system new units are not given any emi ssion allowances for each ounce of mercury that they emit they would need to purchase an allowance from an existing unit that has controlled emissions more or sooner than required thus in the overall scheme of things new units would not increase total emissions of mercury above the nationwide cap matter how weak or strong the nsps might be the capandtrade system on the other nd has received significant attention much of it highly critical some of the criticism concerns the choice of section 111d as the legislative authority for rcury regulation sec tion 111d has rarely been used until now and has never been us ed to regulate hazardous air pollutant listed under section 112 epa staff say that it has previously been used to regulate sulfur emissions from pulp and paper mills and fluoride emissions from aluminum smelters neither of which are controlled elsewhere in the act19 epas march 29 2005 federal register notice contains long discussion of the legality of the use of section 111 as opposed to the mact author ity in section 112 the legality of this approach was immediately challenged in suit filed by new jersey and 15 other states20

regulatory impacts runs to the year 2030 and assumes that all allowances will be used by the end date discussions continuedthe specifics of the capandtrade system its timing and its level of stringency are also controversial21 the system will cap nationwide emissions of mercury from coalfired elect ric generating units at 38 tons beginning in 2010 and at 15 tons beginning in 2018 if achieve d the caps would provide 21 reduction from the 1999 level of emissions in ph ase 1 and 70 reduction in phase 2 table 2 mercury caps and projected emissions under the mercury capandtrade rule

that used in the acid rain program through which utilities can either control the pollutant directly or purchase excess allowances fro m other plants that have controlled more stringently or sooner than required early reductions can be banked for later use if they are not sold the agency says the banking provision will provide incentives for early reductions as shown in table 2 it projects emissions of 313 tons in 2010 nearly 7 tons less than the cap22 if this happens it will allow utilities to delay full compliance with the 70 reduction until well beyond 2018 as they use up banked allowances rather than install further cont rols the agencys analysis projects actual emissions to be 243 tons as late as 2020 less than 50 reduction compared to baseline 1999 emissions23 it appears that full compliance with the 70 reduction might be delayed until 203024httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32868crs8 24 continued we held with epa staff indicate that some th ink the allowances will be used more quickly perhaps as early as 2025 while others think use of allowances will be stretched into the 2030s the level at which the phase 1 cap is set is key determinant of when the rule reaches its ultimate stringency the final ru 38ton phase 1 cap generates 705 tons of early reduction allowances by 2018 in epas an alysis cap that matched epas estimate of actual emissions in 2010 would generate only about 17 tons of allowances by 2018 if the timing of industry compliance was unchanged in general the larger the number of allowances generated by early reductions the later full compliance will be achieved 25 potential benefits that were not estimated included cardiovascular effects ecosystem effects genotoxic immunotoxic reproductive renal and hematological effects while studies have suggested associations between exposure to methylmercury and each of these effects epa found the evidence either inconclusi ve or insufficient to evaluate the impacts see us epa standards of

than continuedcosts and benefits of the final rule while acknowledging that it is unable to estimate or express in dollars at least seven categories of potential benefits epas estimate of the direct benefits of th final capandtrade rule is close to zero25 the one direct benefit for which the agency made an estimate was the benefit from avoided iq decrements in children prenatally exposed to lower levels of methylmercury the value of whic h was estimated at 400 000 to 30 million annually in calculating this amount the ag ency looked only at exposures due to the mothers ingestion of fish from fresh water recreational fishing26 in addition the agency found that the cont rols installed to reduce mercury would slightly reduce emissions of fine particulate matter pm25 saving up to 7 lives annually these cobenefits were timated at 14 million to 40 million per year27 the costs of the mercury rule were estimated to range from 157 m illion annually to 896 million depending on whether 3 or 7 discount rate was used28httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32868crs9 28 continued the imposition of additional controls 29 epa estimates these costs elsewhere in its analysis at less than 76 million annually

according to the rules preamble epa modeling assumes improvements in the cost or effectiveness of hg mer cury control technology over time in the next sentence the agency notes in reality by 2020 costs of hg control are expected to have declined30 the costs used in the modeling runs were estimated in mid 2003 according to epa since that time rcury control costs have declined as much as 75 according to the institute of clean air companies icac the trade association that represents manufact urers of pollution control equipment31 if that is the case mercury control costs could be overestimated by as much as factor of 4 the discrepancy between icacs est imate and epas may be larger than fourfold however at january 2005 cong ressional briefing ic ac and one of the technology providers estimated current mercury control costs as low as 2000 per pound32 epas modeling runs estimated th marginal cost to be 39000 per pound in 202033 second while the estimated costs of the rule 157 million to 896 million annually in 2020 appear s ubstantial in epas costbenefit analysis there is little additional detail provide d as to what these costs represent the analysis concludes that almost pollution control equipment w ould be installed specifically to control mercury as shown in table 3 in 2010 only 2 gigawatts less than 1 of coalfired capacity is projected to have installe d activated carbon injection aci under the rule34 an additional 1 gigawatt gw is projected to add selective catalytic reduction scr to control mercury total coalfired electric capacity is currently 305

the co benefit of reducing mercury2020 mercury controls would include 13 giga watts of aci about 4 of coalfired units 3 gw of scr and 1 gw of scrubbers35 the reason that so few units would install aci in epas analysis is that the agency designed the rule to complement its simultaneous promulgation of the clean air interstate rule cair capandtrade program for utility emissions of sulfur dioxide so2 and nitrogen oxides nox controlling so2 nox and mercury simultaneously reduces costs by allowing utilities to maximize cobenefits of emission controls controls such as scr ubbers and fabric filte rs both of which are widely used today to control so2 and particulates have the side effect or cobenefit of reducing mercury emissions to some extent nox control technology known as selective catalytic reduction or scr tends to oxidize emental mercury making it easier for scrubbers and par ticulate controls to remove under epas capandtrade regulations both the 2010 and 2018 mercury mission standards are set to maximize use of these cobenefits thus few controls would be required to specifically address mercury emissions under the rule and the co sts specific to controlling mercury would be low

spot centrations is this high is disputed by utility sources particularly for mercury emitted by power plants utility spokespersons maintain that much of the mercury mitted by u tilities is in the elemental form is nonwater soluble and is released from taller stacks the result they say is that it is less available to fish and disperses over wider area with much of it entering global mercury cycle51 epa has adopted this point of view in supporting materials that accompanied the release of the final mercury rule the agency noted that only 1 of global mercury emissions comes from us power plants52 epa modeling in support of the fina l rule concluded that even if power plant emissions were reduced to zero there would be little impact on methylmercury concentrations in us lakes and rivers and little consequent reduction in the concentrations of mercury in fisheating women of childbearing age53 the concern over hot spots and the impet us to address them were reinforced in late 2003 by study of rcury contamination in the everglades the study found that concentrations of rcury in fish and wading birds in the area dropped around 75 after florida imposed stringent contro ls on incinerators and other local sources of mercury emissions in the 1990s54 backers of strong controls on utility emissions have cited these results in arguing against capandtrade approach capandtrade programs are not in principle well designed to address hot spots they argue the capandtrade approach allows facilities to purchase allowances and avoid any emission controls if that is the compliance approach that makes the most sense to plants owners and operators opponents of the rule mainta in that if plants near hot spots purchase allowances rather than install controls the capandtrade system may not have an impact on mercury concentrations at the most contaminated sites by contrast mact standard or very stri ngent cap would require reductions at all plants and would therefore be expect ed to improve conditions at hot spots epas analysis of the capandtrade rule has addressed this issue55 in the preamble to the proposed rule it noted that all states would remain free to establish more

america to epa docket id oar20020056 april 30 2004 p 1mercury capandtrade program requirements but it went on to state that the agency does not anticipate hot spots for two reas ons first epas modeling suggests that larger coalfired units which have the high est local deposition footprints are likely to control emissions more than required and sell excess allowances achieved through overcompliance to smaller its second mercury emissions come in several forms the most difficult to control is elemental mercury according to the agency and it is the most likely to be transported long di stances from the generating units thus if plants focus on the more easily controlled forms of mercury they will control mercury that would more likely be deposited locally finally the agency raised the possibility that it could adjust the trading program to favor controls at units in sensitive areas56 effects on eastern and western coal whether imposition of controls on mercury will affect the to tal amount andor the types of coal consumed at the nations power plants has been an importa nt issue in the debate over power plant mercury controls the united mine workers of america for example were critical of epas proposed mact on the grounds that the standards could be met by majority of western subbituminous coals w ithout the need for any emission control technologies whereas eastern bituminous coals representing roughly onehalf of domestic coal production would have needed to meet an average emission removal rate of 7557 the proposed mact rules cost s and reductions in emissions

regulations under which state implementation plans in 22 eastern states and the district of columbia must be revised to control nox emissions in order to improve ozone air quality in downwind states 68 an exception is representative sweeneys hr 227 under which the clean air acts existing provisions for mercury are essentially restated with epa to promulgate regulations for utility mercury emissions by march 15 2005 legislation in the 109th congress66 although epa has now finalized standards for electric utility mercury emissions under section 111 the administration has so proposed that congress amend the clean air act by passing multipollutant legislation for utilities the clear skies bill version of clear skies introduced by senator inhofe s 131 would establish nationwide capandtrade programs for so2 nox and mercury similar to those established by the cair and mercury ru in addition it would eliminate or suspend more than half dozen specific regulatory programs for electric power plants including new source review prevention of significant deteri oration new source performance standards the nox sip call67 nonattainment area requirements best available retrofit technolog and any mercury mact the administration states that many of these rules would prove redundant under multipollutant capandtrade regime and that eliminating or suspending them would create more efficient regulatory structure for discussion of the ways in which clear skies would change the clean air act see crs report rl32782 clear skies and the clean air act whats the difference by larry parker and james mccarthy other multipollutant or rcury bills also have b een introduced most other legislation would reduce mercury emissions more and faster than clear skies68 senator jeffords s 150 for example w ould reduce utility mercury emissions to total of 5 tons ie about 90 by 2010 representative waxmans hr 1451 would set comparable requirements re duction of at least 90 from 1999 levels by 2010 senator leahys s 730 also envisi ons 90 reduction under the jeffords waxman and leahy bills there would be allowance trading or banking programs for mercury two other bills remain under discussi on senator carpers s 843 from the 108th congress and its 109th congress house counterpa rt representative basss hr 1873 present middle ground between clear skies and the jeffords waxman and leahy bills like clear skies the carperbass bill would establish tradeable allowance program to ease compliance but it would also establish caps at individual units and would mandate sh arper reductions sooner than clear skies an 80 reduction in mercur emissions by 2013 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32868crs20 conclusion high concentrations of mercury in aquatic environments and the resulting advisories to limit consumption of fish in order to protect human health have focused attention on the role of mercur emissions from variety of industrial sources among these coalfired power plants are the largest accounting for 42 of total us emissions and they are the last major category of emission sources for which epa has considered regulations under consent agreement epa agreed to propose regulations controlling mercury missions from this category by december 15 2003 with promulgation by march 15 2005 in meeting this commitment epa promulgated capandtrade regulations rather than the maximum achievable control technology regulations it had previously found to be appropriate and necessary in doing s it revised its earlier finding step that 16 states ve sued epa to overturn the switch from mact to capandtrade means that the control technologies installed will be pr imarily scrubbers nd selective catalytic reduction controls designed to reduce emissions of so2 and nox to meet caps on those emissions under simultaneously promulgated rule the cair rule mercury will be reduced as co benefit of this other rule during the next decade epa estimates that only 1 of electric generating units would be likely to install pollution control equipment specifically designed to capture mercury under these regulations the mercury capandtrade regulations are highly controversial read literally they offer reduction of 70 in merc ury emissions by 2018 but the agencys accompanying analysis indicates that due to emissions banking and trading the full 70 reduction might not be achieved until 2030 the agency projects actual mercury reductions of 35 by 2010 and about 50 by 2020 many observers contend that epas estimates of the benefits of mercury control are understated in its final analysis th agency did not include two peerreviewed studies one of which it funded that c oncluded that annual be nefits of mercury control were as high as 13 billion or 52 billion at least on paper in order to select the capandtrade mercury contro l option epa passed over mact option that offered higher benefits for essentially the same cost in large part because of rapidly impr oving technology the agencys supporting documentation relies on estimates of mercury control costs that are 4 to 20 times higher than current projections by pollu tion control industry sources the agency disputes information suggesting that speci fic control technology is available now arguing that it will not be available until after 2010 epa states that the mercury to which americans are exposed primarily in fish consumption comes overwhelmingly from nonus sources from its perspective more flexible capandtrade approach has economic advantages allowing utilities to maximize the cobenefits of controlling several pollutants simultaneously in the rule it proposed year earlier however the agency found that more stringent more quickly applied limits using maximum achievable controlhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32868crs21 69 section 129 which addresses solid waste co mbustion controls specifically does mention using section 111 and 111d to control incine rator emissions this would appear to give the agency firmer statutory basis to provid flexibility to waste combustors in meeting mercury reduction targets yet the agency imposed mactlike standards on incinerators and achieved greater than 90 reductions in mercury emissions within three years of promulgationtechnology would also deliver cobenef its which would outweigh the costs of compliance by an order of magnitude as promulgated the utility mercury ru may raise equity concerns other combustion sources municipal waste combus tors and medical waste incinerators have been required to reduce mercury missions more than 90 under existing clean air act authority with considerably shorter deadlines than those in the capandtrade regulation for utilities sinc similar technologies could be applied to coalfired power plants critics argue that different standards are being applied to different sources of the same pollutant the agen cy has offered explanation for its less stringent approach to the regulation of mercury from utility sources other than its general desire to limit costs and provide flexibility69 with the 1990 clean air act amendments congress determined that electric utilities would be treated differently from ot her sources of hazardous air pollutants before regulation the amendments requi red that epa report to congress before determining whether regulating utility emissions of these pollutants was appropriate and necessary this special treatment for electric power producers was motivated by number of factors including desire to preserve the use of coal as an energy option for both economic and energy secu rity reasons whether these concerns justify the agencys approach to the utility sectors mercury emissions and the balancing of those concerns against compe ting health and equity considerations are at the core of the continui ng debate over mercury issues
