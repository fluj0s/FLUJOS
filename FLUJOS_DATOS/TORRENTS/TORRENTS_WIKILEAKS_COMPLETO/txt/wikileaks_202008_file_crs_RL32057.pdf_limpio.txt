of environmental protection issues summary balancing public needs for surface transportation infrastructure with protecting the environment has been longstanding issue among states and local communities these two objectives can often conflict due to the rise in pollution that typically results when new highways or roadways are constructed or highway is expanded to provide greater traffic capacity expanding highway capacity can be especially challenging for states if the resulting rise in pollution would be great enough to make compliance with federal air quality standards more difficu lt in order to receive federal highway funds the clean air act re quires states with air quality problems to demonstrate that their transportation pl ans conform to their plans to control emissions referred to as transportation conformity to help reduce potential conflicts between highway capacity needs and environmental requirements congress has authorized th use of federal highway funds to alleviate some of the polluti on resulting from highway construction and travel the most recent multiyear fundi ng authorization for these activities was provided in the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 pl 105 178 which expired at the end of fy 2003 how to meet state needs for highway infrastructure while ensuring compliance with environmental requirements is among the key issues for reauthorization tea21 authorized total of 218 billi on for federal highway and transit programs from fy1998 to fy2003 it set aside 9 billion for air quality projects including 8 billion for the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program cmaq to offset some of the emissions from highway travel as means to assist states in complying with federal air quality standards the other 1 billion was authorized for the purchase of clean fuel transit buses tea21 also expanded funding eligibility to allow states to us federal highway funds for mitigating water pollution from highway runoff the law also authorized funding for environmental research and the development of advan ced vehicle technologies and it included several other provisi ons related to envi ronmental protection the use of federal highway funds to ddress environmental needs has focused mostly on air quality projects due primarily to requirements for states to demonstrate conformity as condition for receiving fede ral highway funds most of this funding has been provided under the cmaq program while the program s effectiveness has been questioned there is broad support for increasing its funding in response to an upcoming rise in air quality needs among th states other air quality issues involve the use of transit funding for the purchase of clean fuel buses offering tax benefits for cleanerburning alcoholb ased fuels and exempting certain lowemission vehicles from high occupancy vehicle hov lane re quirements the extent to which water pollution mitigation projects and

capacity needs while protecting the environment is challenging task for many states in orde r to receive federal hi ghway funding several environmental requirements must be met the clean air act requires states with poor air quality to demonstrate that plans to expand highway capacity would conform with their plans to control emissions referred to as transportation conformity state may be denied access to federa l highway funds if conformity is not demonstrated or if air quality plans are determined to be inadequate as required by the national environmental policy act of 1969 nepa th potential environmental impacts of all highway and transit projects are also subject to review prior to the approval of federal highway funds for final project design property acquisition or construction while air quality impacts are prominent considera tion in the approval of many projects other common environm ental impacts include water pollution from contaminated runoff and the ss of wetlands or other natu ral habitat that may occur from clearing the land for construction ch impacts would need to be mitigated as condition of approval for fe deral highway funds envir onmental permits or other documentation may also be required before certain aspects of project may proceed to address potential conflicts between surface transportation needs and environmental quality congress has established numerous programs and authorities intended to help mitigate pollution resulting from highway construction and travel the most recent multiyear funding author ization for these activities was provided in the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 pl 105178 which expired on september 30 2003 this law authorized total of 218 billion for federal highway and transit programs from fy1998 through fy2003 it set aside approximately 9 billion of this amount fo r air quality projects authorized tax benefits for cleanerburning alcoholbased fuels and permitted states to exempt certain lowemission vehicles from high occupancy vehicle hov lane requirements tea21 also made funding available fo r mitigating water pollution from highway runoff and authorized fundi ng for environmental research and the development of advanced vehicle technologies the most controversial issues for the reauthorization of federal highway and transit programs have been the amount of funding to provide for surface transportation infrastructure needs and how to allocate this funding among the states demonstration of conformity with air quality requirements and the performance of environmental reviews are pertinent to thes overall funding issues as they play major role in the approval of federa l highway funds for individual projectshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32057crs2 transportation stakeholders including numer ous state department s of transportation and transportation advocacy organizations argue that extending the time frame for conformity would provide more time to control emissions and that streamlining the environmental review proce ss would be more efficient thereby speeding project delivery on the other hand some envi ronmental organizations have expressed concern that such changes may compromise environmental protection there also has been significant interest in the adequacy of funding for air quality projects under the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program cmaq states and environmental organizations advocate significantly increasing the funding for this program in light of emissions reductions that states may soon need to make in order to attain stricter federal air quality standards for ozone and fine particulates stakeholders have expressed differing leve ls of interest in other environmental issues regarding the adequ acy of funding for the mitigation of water pollution from highway runoff research on how surface transportation impacts the environment and the development of adva ncedvehicle technologies whether to extend tax benefits for rene wable alcoholbased fuels and whether to expand the exemption for lowemission vehicles from hov lane

highway nd transit programs including numerous environmental activities however the fiscal climate of the current authorization cycle is more restrictive due to smaller balance in the trust fund as

regulated in amendments to the clean air act under the motor vehicle air pollution c ontrol act of 1965 pl 89272 congress subsequently amended the clean air act in 1967 1970 1977 and 1990 to tighten controls on vehicle emissions and establish other requi rements epa promulgated the most recent vehicle emission standards in february 2000 65 fr 6698 which will be phased in between model years 2004 and 2009 for history of the clean air act refer to crs report rl30853 clean air act summary of th act and its major requirements 3 during the same period that vehicle emission standards have become more stringent the department of transportation reports that the number of highway miles traveled has tripled from nearly 890 billion in 1965 to near ly 28 trillion in 2001 as indicated in national transportation statistics table 132 available online at httpwwwbtsgovpublications national_transportation_statistics2002 4 according to emissions data compiled by epa onroad vehicles account for 62 of carbon monoxide co emissions in the unite d states 37 of nitrogen oxides nox and 27 of volatile organic compound vocs nox and vocs contribute to groundlevel ozone pollution commonly referred to as

support is insured tea21 established new budget category of discreti onary spending guarantees that function as firewall to ensure minimum level of funding for the majority of highway and transit

other purpose and as such is not subject to reduction in the annual appropria tions process1 in addition to guaranteed funding tea 21 authorized trad itional discretionary funding for certain programs which is tirely subject to th annual appropriations process in appropriations subsequent to tea21 congress did not fully support the authorized levels for some of the traditi onal discretionary fundi ng for environmental programs such as those for clean fuel buses environmental re search and advanced vehicle technologies consequently an issue for the reauthorization of environmental programs is the extent to which funding for them should be firewalled to guarantee support for their implementation air quality issues motor vehicles have become cleaner in operation with the gradual tightening of federal emission standards since 19652 however the rise in the number of vehicle miles traveled has offset some of the reductions in air pollution achieved by more advanced emission controls3 as

matter and sulfur dioxide localities that have ex ceeded the naaqs for one or more pollutants are classified as nonattain ment areas once attainment is achieved locality is reclassified as maintenance area states must develop plans to reduce emissions and comply with the standards in nonattainment areas and to control emissions and sustain air quality in maintenance areas epa reports that 107 areas with combined population of nearly 98 million are in violati on of the naaqs for one or more pollutants of which 85 million people reside in ozone nonattainment areas 6 42 usc 7506 air quality in numerous metr opolitan areas making it difficult for some states to comply with emissions limits in their state implementation plans sips to attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standards naaqs5 how to meet public needs for greater highway capacity while controlling emissions is major issue for states with areas that are in nonattainment with the naaqs and areas that must maintain them as the availability of federal highway funding in these areas is dependent on the state demonstrating that its transportation plan conforms to the emissions budget for motor vehicles in its air quality plan in order to reduce conflicts between highway capacity needs and air quality requirements congress has authorized the use of federal highway funds for various projects that would reduce vehicular emissions the majority of the air quality funding authorized in tea21 was allocated to the cmaq program federal transit funding has also been made available to local transit agencies for the purchase of clean fuel buses congress has also aut horized tax benefits to encourage the production and sale of renewa ble alcoholbased fuels that reduce vehicular emissions and petroleum consumption in addition stat have had the flexibility to allow the singleoccupant use of certa in lowemission vehicles in high occupancy vehicle hov lanes in order to encourage the purchase of cleaner vehicles further background information on transportati on conformity and specific air quality programs and authorities and key issues for congress are discussed below transportation conformity the clean air act requires states and metropolitan planning organizations to demonstrate that their transportation plans conform to their air quality plans the purpose of this requirement is to ensure that the change in emission levels resulting from new transportation projects would not interfere with the states efforts to attain or maintain federal air quality standards many states have experienced greater challenges in demonstrating conformity as air quality requirements have become more stringent background section 176 of the clean air act prohibits federal agencies from funding projects in nonattainment or maintenance areas unless those projects conform to states sip6 because new highways generally lead to an increase in emissions both the statute and regulations currently require that metropolitan planning organizations transportation improvement program tip demonstratehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32057crs5 7 42 usc 7509conformity less frequently than every two years highway and transit projects cannot receive federal funds unl ess they are part of conforming tip states also must demonstrate that their longterm transportation plans conform to their air quality plans over 20year time frame in addition to conformity requirements section 179 of the clean air act authorizes federal highway f unds to be withheld from state if an adequate sip is not prepared or implemented properly7 f or additional discussion of conformity re quirements refer to crs report rl32106 transportation conformity under the cl ean air act in need of reform key policy issues there has been increasing support for allowing states more time to demons trate conformity due to the likelihood that the impact of conformity requirements on states will grow in the next several years numerous factors have made it more challenging for st ates to control emissions and demonstrate conformity such as 1 the growth of emissions from sport utility vehicles suvs and other light trucks whose emissions ar not regulated as strictly as passenger vehicles 2 greater than ex pected increases in vehicle miles traveled 3 recent court decisions that tightened conformity rules and 4 the implementation of more stringent federal air quality standards for ozone and fine particulates scheduled for 2004 which will result in more areas being subject to conformity demonstrations numerous metropolitan areas may face cu toff of highway and transit funds in the future unless they impose sharp re ductions in emissions to demonstrate conformity during lapse in conformity state may receive federal highway funds only for limited set of exempted projects mostly safetyrelate d or replacement and repair of existing transit facilities th rules do not even allow funding of new projects that might reduce emissions such as new transit lines how conformity requirements may affect states acce ss to federal highwa funds has raised significant concerns for the reauthorization of federal surface transportation programs while conformity requirements could be modified to provide greater compliance flexibility for states proposals to do so have been controversial because conformity is the only current mechanism to ensure that states consider how their transportation planning decisions might affect air quality congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program congress established the cmaq pr ogram under the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of 1991 i stea pl 102240 this program is based on the fundamental concept that lowering the number of miles traveled by motor vehicles and reducing congestion to make vehicles operate more efficiently can reduce emissions and improve overall air quality the program has been widely popular among local areas struggling to redu ce air pollution as it is the largest single source of federal funding for air quality proj ects while questions have been raised about the programs effectiv eness there appears to be broad support for increasing its funding levels in response to concer n that greater emission reductions will be needed in many states when new nonattainment areas are designatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32057crs6 8 42 usc 7408f 9 the national academy of sciences transportation research board the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement pr ogram assessing 10

05 of the total annual cmaq apportionmen t and have the flexibility to use this amount for transportation projects that are eligible under cmaq or the surface transportation program tea21 also allowed each stat to transfer portion of its cmaq funds to other highway programs that the state determines to have higher priority if certain conditions are met most transportation control measures id entified in section 108 of the clean air act are eligible for funding8 cmaq projects generally fall into one of the following eight categories 1 mass transit 2 traffic flow improvements 3 rideshare programs 4 traffic dema nd management programs 5 bicycle and pedestrian projects 6 public educati on 7 vehicle inspection nd maintenance programs or 8 alternative fuel conversions accord ing to the federal highway administration more funding has been obligated for conve ntional mass transit projects than for any other activity approxima tely 44 of total cmaq funds since fy1992 key policy issues after more than decad of implementation questions have been raised as to whether the cmaq program has reduced emissions significantly enough to help states co mply with th naaqs whethe r to modify various elements of the program to improve its effectiveness or possibly to shift its focus is an issue for reauthorization congress included provision in tea21 that required the national academy of sciences nas to study whether the emission reductions from cmaq projects have been rge enough to help states comply with the naaqs the nas released its report in the spring of 20029 the study indicated that the air quality benefits of cmaq project s were difficult to assess because of the lack of quantitative data for all projects for those with quantitative data the nas concluded that the emission reductions were relatively small and that these projects were less costeffective than other pollu tion control measures however the nas also concluded that when these emissi on reductions are assessed collectively the overall air quality benefits that they provide may be great enough to help states attain and maintain the naaqs in areas that are on the margin of compliance consequently the nas recommended that the program be continued and suggested various modifications to improve its effectiveness the findings of the nas have raised numer ous issues for reauthorization since the impact of the program on air quality was difficult to quantify some argue that thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32057crs7 focus should be shifted to re ducing traffic congestion in ge neral rather than linking eligibility to air quality benefits that are questionable there also are arguments that the statutory formul should at least be amended to provide higher amount of minimum funding to states that do not have any air quality problems but that would still benefit from reduction in traffic congestion risi ng traffic congestion and progressively lengthier co mmuting times in some metropo litan areas have motivated support for such options among so transportation stakeholders on the other hand proponents of the prog ram argue that areas on the verge of attainment may benefit from the continued use of cmaq funds for air quality projects even if the emission reductions are relatively small they also argue that more areas will be in need of emission reductions in order to comply with stricter federal standards for ozone nd fine particulates schedul ed to become effective in 2004 and that air quality benefits from cm aq projects matter how small would be helpful however the current fundi ng formula does not include factor to account for new areas that will be in nonattainment with these stricter standards consequently the formula would need to be changed during reauthorization in order to allow affected states to receive greater funding clean fuel buses in general transit projects provide air quality benefits by reducing the number of motor vehicles on the road and the emissions that are generated from their operation however transit vehicles m ainly buses produce missions themselves in many local areas with air quality problems transit agencies have purchased buses that operate on cleanerburning fuels as means to control emissions in enacting tea21 congress set aside funding for pr ogram to assist transit agencies in purchasing clean fuel buses but subsequently redirected this funding to more general fund for bus purchases not restricted to fuel type while this program has not been implemented many transit agencies have still chosen to purchase clean fuel buses with federal funds at their discretion the upcoming designation of new nonattainment areas has sparke d further interest in the use of clean fuel buses and some have dvocated that dedicat ed source of funding should be established for acquiring them this proposal has been controversial to those who argue that local tr ansit agencies should be llowed to decide what kinds of buses best meet their capacity needs rath er than having portion of federal transit funds restricted to certain type s of buses based on fuel type background tea21 authorized the secretary of transportation to establish clean fuels formula grant program to assist transit agencies in acquiring low emission alternativefueled buses impr oving facilities to accommodate them and rebuilding pre1993 engines with clean fuel technology under this authority the secretary of transportation may award competitive grants to transit agencies based on formula that factors in the number of vehicles in transit systems

million annually from fy1999 through fy2003 for total authoriza tion of 1 billion over five years of the 200 million annual authorization 100 milli on was authorized as guaranteed firewalled funds and th remaining 100 million was au thorized as traditional discretionary funds subject to the annual appropriations process in appropriations bills subsequent to tea21 congress s not appropriated any of the 100 million in traditional discretionary f unds that were annually authorized for the program and has redirected the 100 million in guaranteed annual funding to traditional capital bus improvement projects the federal transit administration reports that data are not available to determine the extent to which transit agencies have purchased alternativefueled buses w ith the redirected funding even though there is dedicated sour ce of funding for the purchase of clean fuel buses they do receive preferentia l treatment under fede ral matching funds requirements to help local areas attain or maintain federal air quality standards generally federal transit programs pr ovide up to 80 of the cost of new bus purchases and local transit ag encies are responsible for securing funding from state or local sources to pay the remaining 20 however the federal contribution can be increased to 90 to purchase buses that use clean or alternative fuels for the purpose of complying with clean air act requirements10 the major capital assistance programs administered by the federal transit administration that have funded the purchase of alternativefueled buses include the capital investment grants and loans pr ogram urbanized area formula program nonurbanized area formula program elderly persons and persons with disabilities program and th job accessreverse commute program some funding is also available under the new starts pr ogram of these programs the urbanized area formula program has been the largest source of funding for buses that operate on alternative fuels alternativefueled buses have accounted for significant share of federal transit administration funding obligations in recent years the agency began compiling data on new bus purchases by fuel type in fy2000 as indicated by the data in the table below an average of 34 of the federal funding obligated for the purchase of new transit buses from fy2000 to fy2002 has been devoted to those that operate on alternative fuels air quality concerns are frequently among the most prominent factors in transit agencys decision to purchase clean fuel buses despite their typically higher costs for example transit agencies located in metropolitan areas that need emissions reductions to comply with fede ral air quality standards under the clean air act are more likely to choose cleaner buses that operate on altern ative fuels other factors may include the extent to which the purchase of cleaner buses would improve the publics perception of transit and incr ease ridership and whether there are any state or local mandates or incentives for the use of alternative fuelshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32057crs9 apart from air quality concerns an ec onomic factor that transit agencies typically consider in their planning pro cess is the extent to which the purchase of alternativefueled buses would help to maximize the benefits of past investments in the refueling infrastructure necessary for such vehicles consequently transit agencies that have invested in alternative fueled buses in the past are more likely to purchase additional ones in the future convers ely transit agencies that have not yet invested in them are less likely to do so as they would need to invest additional resources in new refueling infrastructure federal funding obligated by the federal transit administration for the purchase of buses by type of

statistical summaries for fy2000 fy2001 and fy2002 dollar amounts in the table reflect the amount of federal fund ing obligated to assist transit agencies in purchasing buses dollar amounts do not include funds provided by transit agen cies to meet matching funds requirements and therefore do not reflect the total cost of bus purchases b alternative fuels include compressed natural gas liquified natural gas liquified petroleum gas methanol ethanol electric biodiesel dual fuel operation fuel cell and hybrid electric key policy issues as indicated by the above data funding obligations for alternativefueled buses ve significantly exceeded the original 200 million annual authorization for the clean fuels formula grant program this trend has caused some to argue that setting aside funding ex clusively for the purchase of alternative fueled buses is not necessary to encourage their use and that the favorable 10 matching funds requirement is sufficient couragement some also point out that stricter standards for heavyduty diesel engines and fuels which are scheduled to be phased in beginning in 2007 nd 2006 respectively will allow diesel buses to achieve level of emissions performance that is equivalent to alternative fuels such as cng such critics say that the cleaner performance of new diesel buses that are on the way will negate the need for reserving porti on of transit funds for alternativefueled buses in order to reduce emissions on the other hand some environmental organizations have expressed skepticism that diesel buses equipped with cleaner engines will generate as few emissions in actual operation as those that operate on alternative fuels they argue that dedicated funding should be set aside in reauthorization for alternativefueled buses to ensure that transit agencies continue to purchase them as means to improve air quality federal tax benefits and revenues for renewable alcoholbased fuels the federal government currently pr ovides an excise tax reduction and an income tax credit to promote the producti on sale and use of renewable alcoholhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32057crs10 11 the statutory authority for the income tax credit is codified at 26 usc 40 and the statutory authority for the excise tax reduction is codified at 26 usc 4081 12 26 usc 40d1 for the income tax credit and 26 usc 4081b3 for the excise tax reductionbased fuels including ethanol and methanol11 vehicles operated on these fuels typically produce fewer tailpipe emissions particularly carbon monoxide than those operated on conventiona l gasoline or diesel reduction in tailpipe emissions can help to reduce the impact of highway trav on air quality however alcoholbased fuels can be more volatile than conventiona l gasoline or diesel and the use of these alternative fuels can result in higher evaporative emissions during refueling which could offset tailpipe emission reductions in some cases while alcoholbased fuels have the potential to improve air quality the preferential treatment of these fuels in the us tax code s been controversial background the current authority for the ta x benefits that apply to alcohol based fuels expires at the end of 2007 thes benefits are availa ble for alcoholbased fuels if they are derived from renewabl sources those produced from petroleum natural gas or coal are specifically excluded from eligibility under the us tax code12 ethanol is produced primarily from the distillation of corn and is therefore renewable while methanol can also be derived from renewable biomass or municipal waste it usually is produced fro m natural gas which is not renewable consequently the tax benefits for alcoholbased fuel s apply mostly to the sale of ethanol among alternative fuels ethanol is the most commonly used the majority of the ethanol sold is not used in its pure form rather it is blended with gasoline to produce gasohol which can be used in an conventional vehicle as substitute for ordinary gasoline ethanol is also used as an additive for various purposes it is commonly added to reformulated gasoline rfg to increase the oxygen content of the fuel rfg must be made available in certain areas to meet clean air act requirements to reduce vehicular emissi ons of precursors to groundlevel ozone commonly referred to as smog during th winter months rfg also must be used in certain areas to reduce emissions of carbon monoxide in addition to meeting oxygenate requirements for rfg ethanol is added to gasoline in some areas to increase octane levels f or additional information on ethanol refer to crs report rl30369 fuel ethanol background and public policy issues the excise tax reduction for ethanol is most commonly taken at the blended state by either fuel producers or distri butors the amount of the tax reduction depends on the percentage of the blend that is composed of ethanol the current tax reduction is 52 cents per gallon for gasohol consisting of at least 10 ethanol 40 cents per gallon for blends of at leas t 77 ethanol and 30 cents per gallon for blends of at least 57 ethanol these amounts reduce the excise tax levied on the sale of gasohol below the current tax rate of 184 cents per gallon for ordinary gasoline while nearly all of the excise taxes on gasoline are deposited into the federal highway trust fund 25 cents of th per gallon tax for gasohol are deposited into general treasury funds and are therefor not dedicated to the support of federal surface transportation programs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32057crs11 key policy issues since the wholesale cost of ethanol is relatively high tax benefits for the sale of ethanol are needed to make it competitive with other fuel additives and with conventional fuels ho wever there has been disagreement as to whether these benefits are appropriate proponents argue that ensuring the commercial viability and resulting availability of ethanol improves air quality due to reduced vehicle emissions lowers us dependence on foreig n oil and provides an additional market for corn farmers who grow the biomass needed to produce ethanol on the other hand opponents argue th at gasohol tax bene fits are essentially subsidy for the ethanol industry whic h reduces overall revenues for the federal highway trust fund some also argue that the emissions and energy benefits of ethanol can be offset by the energy needed to produce the fuel and the resulting emissions from generating that energy key issues for reauthorization include 1 whether to extend the tax benefits beyond this time frame 2 whether to increase or decrease the amount of the excise tax reduc tion and the income tax credit and 3 whether to continue the current policy of devoting portion of alcohol fuel tax revenues to genera l treasury funds use of high occupancy vehicle hov lanes many states have cons tructed hov lanes as means to reduce traffic congestion through reducing congestion thes types of lanes also can provide air quality benefits because vehi cles typically generate fe wer emissions when operating more efficiently at steady speeds in tea21 congress appr oved novel approach to using hov lanes for air quality purposes by allowing states to permit vehicles with extremely low emissions to operate in an hov lane with only one occupant the premise was to offer benefit that would possibly encourage the purchase of cleaner vehicles thereby helping to improve air quality this authority expired on october 1 2003 some have advocated that it s hould be renewed and expanded to include other lowemission vehicles that were not clean enough to qualify under the previous authority however others have expresse d concern that expanding this benefit to include greater number of ve hicles could cause traffic congestion to rise impairing the primary function of hov lanes background tea21 provided the authority for states to permit vehicle with only one occupant to operate in an hov lane if the vehicle is certified under federal regulations as an inherently lowemission vehicle ilev the law authorized states to implement this policy through september 30 2003 and granted each state the right

use of wetlands mitigation banks see h ttpwwwfhwa dotgovenvironmentwetlandtea21bnkhtmkey policy issues there has been growing interest among motorists the vehicle industry and some states in re newing the hov lane benefit and expanding it to hybrid vehicles which are more wide ly available proponents argue that hybrid vehicles are almost as clean as ilevs and that expanding this benefit to include them would encourage additi onal sales of cleaner vehicles that would help to improve overall air quality over the shortterm allowing hybrid vehicles to use hov lanes with only one occ upant may not cause hov lanes to become noticeably more congested in areas where there is excess hov lane capacity to accommodate them because they currently represent fairly small percentage of the vehicle fleet however hov lanes could become more c ongested in some areas over the long term if the popularity and corre sponding sales of these vehi cles were to rise making them larger share of the onroad fleet water quality issues in addition to contributing to air po llution highway travel and construction activities can impair water quality runoff from highways can deposit variety of petrochemicals and other poten tially hazardous substances into adjacent waterways and wetlands which can migrate over time throughout watershed and result in violations of water quality standards highway runoff is basically nonpoint source that is more difficult to quantify and control than conventional point source such as water discharge pipe from stationary facility in seeking federal funds for new highway construction states must consider the potential impacts of highway runoff on water quality and wetlands during the environmental review process required by nepa depending on the extent of these impacts mitigati on such as storm water manageme nt systems may be required to prevent or minimize the potential for pollution if wetlands would be lost as result of new highway construction other meas ures such as mitigation banks may be required in order to make up for these sses tea21 established preference for the use of these banks to address th impact of new highway construction on wetlands13 the costs of water pollution mitig ation and the replacement of wetlands is typically absorbed as part of the tota l costs for new highway construction project however many highways were construc ted prior to more recent requirements for the installation of storm water management systems or other water pollution mitigation measures consequently many waterways adjacent to highways have been contaminated from years of runoff and are in need of envi ronmental restoration in response to these needs congress has pr ovided authority for states to use federal highway funds for environmen tal restoration or mitigation projects to address water pollution from existing highways eligibility for these projects is provided under the surface transportation program in ge neral and under the transportation enhancements setaside within this prog ram the conditions of eligibility under each authority and key issues for congress are discussed belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32057crs13 14 23 usc 133b14surface transpor tation program most federal highway programs are devoted to meeting specific needs such interstate maintenance bridge repair or highway safety and states are generally not permitted to use funds allocated to these programs for other purposes the surface transportation program is different in that it gives states broad flexibility to use federal highway funds to meet multiple rface transportation needs in enacting tea21 congress amended the eligib ility requirements of the surface transportation program to include proj ects that would address the impacts of highway travel on water quality backgr ound under the surface transportation program the federal highway administration is authorized to make funds available to the states for environmental restoration and pollution abatement projects that address water contamination or environmen tal degradation attributed to runoff from an existing highway14 for clarification purposes the cons truction or retrofit of storm water treatment systems is highlighted as an eligible activity surface transportation program funds may be spen t on environmental restora tion and pollution abatement activities only when an existing high way is undergoing reconstruction rehabilitation resurfacing or restoration the portion of program funds that can be spent on environmental restoration and pollution abatement activities for these types of highway projects is limited to 20 of the total project cost the law does not provide the authority for states to expe nd program funds to mitigate water pollution from past runoff if improvements are not being made to the highway at the time while environmental restoration and pollution abatement activities are eligible for funding the law does not require stat to expend their surface transportation program funds on these activitie s rather state may use program funds for these activities at its discretion determining how many states have done so and in what amount is not possible because states are not required to comprehensively track this information however states may voluntarily supply this information to the federal highway administration based on the data that have been provided the states report that they have spent total of 19 million in surface transportation program funds on environmental re storation and pollution abatement projects from fy1998 through midfy2003 however the actual ex penditure may be significantly greater than this amount due to the absence of co mplete data from all states states also must spend portion of thei r federal funds for new high way construction to satisfy water pollution mitigation requirements due to the scope of most new construction and the extent of its impacts these amount s mostly likely have exceeded the funding that has been spent to mitigate pollution from older highways however data on the specific amount of funding are not availabl because states do not typically separate mitigation costs out from the total costs of new highway construction key policy issues some of the relevant issues for the reauthorization of the surface transportation program are 1 whether to increase the limitation on the portion of the total project cost that can be spent on environmental restoration and pollution abatement activities in or der to accommodate cases in which

ovements are underway at the time transportation enhancement setaside although states have the flexibility to fund wide variety of projects under the surface transportation program they must set aside 10 of their annual apportionment of funds under this progra m for transportation enhancements that would improve the multimodal environmental cultural or aesthetic aspects of the nations surface transportation system in enacting tea21 congress modified the definition of enhancements to include the mitigation of water pollution from highway runoff as an eligible activity while the use of enhancements funding to address water quality needs has not been controversial some criticisms have been raised about the use of federal highway funds for some enhancements that are not directly related to surface transportation infrastructure needs background states may choose to spe nd their enhancements funds on numerous categories of eligible activities the categories that have received the most funding include bicycle paths and pedest rian walkways preservation of historic transportation facilities and landscaping and scenic beautification15 of the eligible categories mitigation of water pollution from highway runoff has r eceived relatively small percentage of overall enhancements fundi ng tea21 authorized total of 33 billion for transportation enhancements from fy1998 through fy2003 of this amount the national transporta tion enhancements clearinghouse reports that states had expended 66 million or nearly 2 on water pollution mitigation projects through midfy200316 while this amount represents small fraction of enhancements funding it is more than three times the amount that states had reportedly spent on these types of projects with general surface transportation program funds the federal contribution to the cost of projects funded under the surface transportation program including pollu tion mitigation is gene rally limited to 80httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32057crs15 17 23 usc 133e5cas is the case with most other federal high way programs however states have the flexibility to calculate the nonfederal share of the total cost of transportation enhancements based on individual projects multiple projects or on programmatic level states also can use funds from fede ral agencies other than the department of transportation to count toward the nonfeder share of the cost of enhancements17 consequently the federal share of the cost of an individual project can be as high as 100 if the federal share for others is w enough to offset that amount and yield federal share of more than 80 for an entire group of projects key policy issues while numerous states local communities historic preservation interests and environmental organizations have expressed support for the diversity of activities that are supporte d with enhancements funding some argue that certain enhancements are an ine ffective use of federal highway funds opponents believe that fede ral highway funds should onl be spent on improvements to surface transportation infrastructure rather than on projects that may provide some related benefit but that do not meet highwa capacity needs help to relieve traffic congestion or meet an environmental re quirement necessary for project approval limitations on federal highway funds as result of recent decline in trust fund revenues have sparked some support for ch arguments if the funding for transportation enhancements were reduced or eliminated states would still be able to use general surface transportation progra m funds at their discretion for pollution mitigation projects assuming that current authority were not repealed environmental research and development issues the majority of research and devel opment activities that are supported with federal highway funds focus on how to impr ove the overall function and safety of the nations surface transportation system in order to meet travel needs relatively small fraction of federal highway funds has been devoted to researching the environmental impacts of highway travel or developing envir onmentally beneficial technologies some argue that more highway resources should be devoted to environmental research and development in light of th impacts of vehicular travel on air and water quality othe rs counter that highway capacity and safety needs should remain the focus of research funde d with motor fuels tax revenues and that other federal agencies such as epa or the department of energy already conduct variety of activities to research pollution from motor vehicles and develop advanced vehicle technologies while tea21 authorized the secretary of transportation to establish an environm ental research program it was never implemented due to lack of funding tea 21 also authorized program to develop advanced vehicle technologies but its implementation has been limited due to insufficient

development of low and zero emission technologies such as hybrid ll electric and fuel cell power trains18 streamlining the environmental review process many stakeholders at the state and cal level have expr essed longstanding concerns that the environmental review process for highway construction projects can be overly timeconsuming and can imp ose additional costs some state transportation department s and transportation advocacy organizations support revisions to certain elements of the process that could speed project delivery however environmental orga nizations have expressed c oncern that changes to the process might weaken environmental protec tions they also argue that lengthy environmental reviews ar sometimes warranted due to the scope of proposed alterations to the natural landscape and the potential effects of increased traffic capacity on air and water qualityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32057crs17 19 federal highway administration regulati ons implementing the

http wwwfhwadotgovstewa rdshipeoindexhtmkey policy issues to reduce the approval time for highway projects and speed the delivery of federal highway funds to states and cal areas congress included provisions in section 1309 of tea21 which require the s ecretary of transportation to streamline the environmental review process nvironmental streamlining can generally be described as cooperatively tablishing realistic proj ect development time frames among transportation and nvironmental agencies and then working together to adhere to those time frames the department of transportation has taken numerous administrative actions in response to this requirement but has not issued final regulations to put streamlining into practice on national scale while the clinton administration did submit streamlining regulatory proposal in may 2000 it was widely criticized on num erous grounds by congress the states highway interest groups and environmental organizations the principal criticisms were that it did not fully address the re quirements of tea21 nd that it would have added new elements to the planning and velopment process that may have resulted in further project delays due to the these concerns the bush administration withdrew the proposal in september 2002 and indicated that new proposal would not be forthcoming until it is clear how congress may address the issue during surface transportation reauthorization in the interim presiden t bush has issued an executive order which directs federal agencies to expedite environmental reviews for highpriority transportation projects and has established specific goals to reduce the time frames for review20 hearings were held during the 107th congress to examine the streamlining issue and streamlining has been discussed in hearings on surface transportation reauthorization during the 108th congress in the conference report on tea21 hrept 105550 congress stated its expectation that the secretary of transportation would implement the st reamlining requirements through the regulatory process some members have expressed their disappointment that five years after the enactment of the law streamlining regulations have yet to be finalized the lack of final regulations has increased interest in further legislative action to speed project delivery and meet public mands for transportation infrastructure
