june 23 2008 the internal revenue service irs announced an increase in the optional standard mileage rates for the second half of 2008 for the two rates it has the authority to set the irs raised the standard mileage rate for business use of personal passenger automobile from 505 cents to 585 cents per mile and the standard rate for medical or moving purposes from 19 cents to 27 cents per mile effective july 1 2008 through december 31 2008 in contrast the standard mileage rate for charitable activities is set by statute and has remained at 14 cents per mile since 1998 the charitable standard mileage rate is used to determine the size of the itemized deduction that taxpayer may claim for unreimbursed automobile expenses incurred in conjunction with charitable volunteer work the optional standard mileage rate is simplified alternative to keeping track of actual deductible automobile expenses the charitable standard rate also determines the amount of mileage reimbursement that volunteer may receive taxfree from charity in evaluating whether the charitable standard mileage rate should now be higher than 14 cents mile there are three basic questions to consider first should the charitable standard mileage rate continue to be set by statute or should authority to set the charitable rate be returned to the irs second where should the charitable rate be set relative to the other two standard mileage rates and why should the charitable rate be equal to or higher than the medicalmoving rate if higher specifically what additional costs should be included should the charitable rate be as high as the business rate if so on what reasoning is this based third should reimbursed mileage be treated more favorably than unreimbursed driving expenses sixteen bills introduced in the 110 th congress would raise the charitable mileage rate to different levels second group of bills would permit volunteers to exclude from taxable income mileage reimbursements up to the business standard mileage rate third group of bills would increase the tax benefits only for charitable driving related to federally declared disasters with taxfree reimbursement up to the business rate and deductions at 70 of the business rate the heartland disaster tax relief act of 2008 enacted on october 3 2008 in conjunction with the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 the financial rescue bill as part of pl 110343 hr 1424 grants these enhanced tax benefits to the federally declared midwestern disaster areas from the date of the disaster through december 31 2008 calculations presented in the report show that under current tax law volunteers who are reimbursed for their driving expenses receive more favorable treatment than those who deduct their unreimbursed mileage even though the provisions are valued at the same number of cents per mile setting the taxfree reimbursement amount higher than the deductible amount would widen the existing disparity in aftertax benefits the proposals do not explain or justify increasing the preferential tax treatment of char itable mileage reimbursement relative to the charitable mileage deduction this report will be updated for the 111 th congress as events warrant httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34681g5g145g138g155g146g157g138g139g149g142g561g21g157g138g151g141g138g155g141g561 g15g146g149g142g138g144g142g561

reimbursed for expenses that would be deductible to not include reimbursements up to certain dollar amount in their taxable income this is intended to simplify the entries and calculations required on the tax return in that vein volunteers who receive reimbursement from charitable organization for their driving expenses need not report reimbursements up to the charitable standard mileage rate as taxable income prior to 1985 the charitable standard mileage rate was set by the irs usually at the same level as the medical and moving standard mileage rate the rate reflected only the variable costs of driving an automobile these are the costs that ar expected to vary in proportion to the number of miles driven variable costs include expenditures for gasoline oil tires and maintenance this rate was substantially lower than the business standard mileage rate which along with variable costs also incorporates fixed costs associat ed with owning and maintaining an automobile including depreciation license plate and car registration fees and insurance the deficit reduction act of 1984 pl 98369 dded section 170i to the internal revenue code irc which set the charitable mileage rate at 12 cents per mile at the time the medicalmoving rate was 9 cents per mile and the business rate was 21 cents per mile for the first 15000 miles and 11 cents per mile for additional miles thirteen years later the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 10534 raised the charitable rate to 14 cents per mile effective in 1998 for comparison in 1997 the medicalmoving rate was 10 cents per mile and the business rate was 315 cents per mile the charitable standard mileage rate remains at 14 cents today 10 years later table a1 at the end of this report presents the three standard mileage rates from 1980 through 2008 the katrina emergency tax relief act of 2005 ketra pl 10973 temporarily raised the charitable rate to 70 of the standard business mileage rate for driving specifically related to hurricane katrina relief efforts alternatively katrina volunteers could exclude from their taxable income mileage reimbursements up to the standard business mileage rate the heartland disaster relief act of 2008 enacted october 3 2008 2 made these same enhanced tax benefits available through december 31 2008 for charitable driving related to the midwestern disasters of the spring of 2008 numerous items in the tax code are indexed for inflation that is their numeric value is automatically adjusted over time based on general inflation index 3 but an automatic adjustment based on general inflation index would not be appropriate in the case of the standard mileage rates which are linked to the cost of gasoline per mile driven the price of gasoline has history of moving independently from the general inflation rate also changes in the fuel efficiency of automobile engines over time affect the average cost of gasoline per mile instead the irs is responsible for monitoring and adjusting the standard mileage rates for business purposes and for medical or moving purposes the irs determines the rates based on an annual study conducted by private company currently runsheimer international of the fixed and variable costs of operating car 4 the irs typically announces in november the rates to take 2 the heartland disaster relief act of 2008 is title vii of pl 110343hr 424

adjusted midyear in response to large changes in the price of gasoline as they were in july 2008 in 2005 the business mileage rate was 405 cents through august in response to higher gasoline prices following hurricane katrina on august 29 and hurricane rita on september 24 the business rate was set at 485 cents for the last four months of 2005 it was then lowered halfway back to 445 cents for all of 2006 refer back to table 1 the legislative history of irc sec 170i5 suggests that congress felt that the charitable standard mileage rate should be slightly higher than the medicalmoving rate but not as high as the business rate however formal criteria or guidelines were provided to help maintain the difference in rates in the futurein either the law setting the charitable rate official explanations of the legislation or regulations related to the law based on previous practices it is likely that if authority to set the charitable rate were return ed to the irs absent such instructions from congress the irs would again set the charitable rate equal to the medicalmoving rate hence if congress wants the charitable rate to be set higher than the medicalmoving rate it may need to state the basis for the difference in rates in evaluating the prospect of changing the charitable mileage rate from the existing 14 cents per mile there are three basic sets of questions to consider should the charitable standard mileage rate continue to be set by statute or should the authority to set the charitable rate be returned to the irs at what level should the charitable rate be set relative to the other two standard mileage rates should the charitable rate be equal to or higher than the medicalmoving rate if higher specifically what additional costs should be included should the charitable rate be as high as the business rate if so what reasoning would justify that should volunteers who receive mileage reimbursements from their charitable organizations receive more generous tax treatment than volunteers who deduct their unreimbursed automobile expenses if not what changes can be made to the tax treatment of mileage reimbursements andor mileage deductions the irs could help congress address these questions by sharing more information about the individual cost items that it includes as deductible automobile costs and the monetary value it assigns to each of these cost components in setting the medicalmoving and the business standard mileage rates sixteen bills introduced in the 110 th congress would have raised the charitable standard mileage rate each

mile from charitable mileage deduction at each of the six marginal tax rates under the individual income tax at the current rate of 14 cents per mile and at alternative charitable mileage rates proposed in the bills introduced it also compares the value of mileage reimbursements after tax under different scenarios to the tax savings from mileage deductions the calculations reveal large differences in the tax saved per mile deducted depending upon the value of the standard mileage rate this highlights the importance of having congress or the internal revenue service justify the differences among the standard mileage rates for different purposes the tax saving from given deduction amount per mile is higher the higher the taxpayers marginal tax rate this raises the question of whether the tax subsidy should be given in the form of tax credit per mile which would have equal value to all taxpayers rather than deduction whose value increases with the taxpayers marginal tax rate httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34681g5g145g138g155g146g157g138g139g149g142g561g21g157g138g151g141g138g155g141g561 g15g146g149g142g138g144g142g561

charitable standard mileage rate falls the higher the taxpayers marginal tax rate this also reflects the system of graduated income tax rates but in reverse nevertheless at every marginal tax rate taxpayers receive greater monetary benefit from reimbursement even if it is taxed than from deduction of an equal amount per mile these calculations show that under current tax law volunteers who are reimbursed for their driving expenses receive more favorable treatment than those who deduct their unreimbursed mileage nonetheless group of bills introduced in the 110th congress the second group would raise the level of taxfree reimbursement for volunteers up to the business standard mileage rate without increasing the standard mileage rate for deducting the unreimbursed car expenses of volunteers the group of bills that would increase the tax benefits only for charitable driving linked to federally declared disaster the third group would permit taxfree reimbursement up to the full business standard mileage rate but only permit mileage deductions at 70 of the business mileage rate the calculations show that taxfree reimburse ment is worth more than deduction even if they are valued at the same dollar amount per mile setting the taxfree reimbursement amount higher than the deductible amount would widen th existing disparity in aftertax benefits the proposals do not explain or justify increasing the preferential tax treatment of charitable mileage reimbursement relative to the charitable mileage deduction

deductible travel costs are 14 cents per mile under current law the taxpayer does not need to report as income mileage reimbursements from charitable organization up to the charitable standard mileage rate of 14 cents but volunteer should report as gross income reimbursement in excess of 14 cents per mile12 section 6041 of the internal revenue code requires anyone engaged in trade or business who makes payments to another person of 600 or more in taxable year to file an information return reporting the name and address of the recipient and the total amount of payments during the year with the irs and with the person who re ceived the payment these are known as 1099 forms thus charitable organization that reimburses an individual volunteer for mileage by an aggregate amount of 600 or more in single tax ear must file these information returns with the irs and the volunteer charitable organizations have complained about the paperwork burden of these reporting requirements

mileage rates for charitable and for medicalmoving purposes have traditionally been set much lower than the rate for business pu rposes that is because they reflect only the variable costs of using an automobile as shown in table 2 in the case of the medical and moving rates variable costs include gasoline and the federal state and local taxes thereon oil maintenance and tires and tire repairs these are costs that are expected to vary in proportion to the number of miles driven in addition to these vari able costs the business standard mileage rate also incorporates certain fixed costs of ow ning an automobile specifically depreciation13 license and registration fees and insurance14 this difference is based on the general reasoning that it is unlikely that an individual would purchase car primarily for the purpose of doing volunteer work getting to medical appointments or moving his or her residence to locate near new job in contrast needing car to do ones job15 may be the primary reason for owning vehicle 12 for volunteer using actual costs if the volunteers actual deductible automobile expenses exceed the am ount of reimbursement received the volunteer may claim the excess unreimbursed expenses as an itemized charitable deduction 13 this is measure of tax not economic depreciation 14 in addition interest relating to the purchase of an automobile as well as state and

driving expenses are deductible and not deductible suggests that the charitable standard mileage rate should be lower than the medicalmoving rate18 at issue is whether or not maintenance and tire expenses are deductible for charitable purposes in table 2 they are classified as variable costs reflected in the medicalmoving rate in contrast table 3 shows that the only car expenses the irs lists

medical or moving expense are all variable expenses including gasoline and oil elsewhere in rev proc 200770 sec 404 and sec 8023 both list tires and routine maintenance and repairs as variable costs20 as indicated in table 2 the value assigned by the irs to the individual cost components of the standard mileage rates other than depreciation is not publicly available for proprietary and confidentiality reasons consequently we do not know what portion of the current 27 cent medicalmoving standard mileage rate set by the irs reflects the cost of gasoline and oil and what portion reflects maintenance and tires therefore we do not know how the value assigned to gasoline and oil alone compares to the current statutory charitable standard mileage rate of 14 cents per mile more detailed information about the values assigned to the individual components of fixed costs could help address the question of what additional costs might be included if congress decides that the charitable standard mileage rate should be higher than the medicalmoving rate but not as high as the business rate as shown in the bottom part of table 2 crs calculated the subtotal for fixed costs as 315 cents per mile of that the irs attributed 21 cents per mile to depreciation that leaves 105 cents per mile covering the combined categories of license plate and car registration fees and car insurance these numbers can be used to suggest the following two examples of guidelines for setting middleground charitable standard mileage rate if congress instructed the irs to include fixed costs other than depreciation in addition to variable costs the charitable standard mileage rate would currently be 375 cents per mile equal to the 27cent medicalmoving rate plus the 105 cents for fixed costs other than depreciation if congress instructed the irs to include depreciation in addition to variable costs the charitable rate would currently be 48 cents per mile equal to the 27cent medicalmoving rate plus the 21cent depreciation allowance other combinations of the cost components listed in table 2 or even other automobile costs could be used to define the charitable standard

expenses the proposals do not explain the reason for this preferential treatment data are available on the number of charitable miles that are reimbursed but the number is likely to be small percentage of total charitable miles driven if so many more volunteers are likely to be affected by the tax treatment of charitable mileage deductions than charitable mileage reimbursements under current tax law volunteer does not need to report as income reimbursement by charitable organization for outofpocket automobile expenses up to the charitable standard mileage rate of 14 cents per mile however reimbursement in excess of the charitable standard mileage rate is considered taxable income several bills would raise the taxfree reimbursement rate to the standard business mileage rate which is currently 585 cents per mile table 7 first considers the tax treatment of volunteer being reimbursed at 585 cents per mile under current law column 2 of table 7 shows the reimbursement per mile that remains after federal income tax23 column 3 at each marginal tax rate column 1 if volunteer is reimbursed at the current business standard mileage rate the calculations assume that the volunteer is reimbursed at 0585 per mile and taxed on 0445 per mile which equals the reimbursement in excess of the charitable standard mileage rate of 014 per mile column 3 repeats the information from column 4 of table 5 to show the tax savings from deduction of 14 cents per mile at each marginal tax rate column 4 of table 7 shows the ratio of the value of the reimbursement column 2 relative to the value of the deduction column 3 both after tax it shows that the value of 585cent reimbursement even after tax is 88 times the value of the 14cent deduction for taxpayer in the top 35 tax rate bracket for taxpayer in the 10 bracket the aftertax reimbursement would be worth 386 times the value of the charitable standard mileage deduction next table 7 considers the case where unreimbursed charitable mileage expenses could be deducted at the current business standard mileage rate of 585 cents per mile instead of 14 cents per mile but reimbursements would still be taxed as they are under current law that is reimbursement in excess of 14 cents per mile would still be taxed column 5 shows the tax savings per mile at each tax rate from deduction at the current standard business rate of 585 cents per mile looking down column 2 as the marginal tax rate increases at higher income levels the value of the 585 cent reimbursement after tax declines from 541 cents in the 10 tax bracket down to 429 cents in the 35 bracket in contrast the tax saving from deduction of 585 cents column 5 rises from 59 cents per mile in the 10 bracket to 205 cents in the 35 bracket column 6 of table 7 shows the ratio of the aftertax value of reimbursement of 585 cents under current tax rules from column 2 relative to the tax saving from deduction at the same permile rate of 585 cents from column 5 even with this unfavorable tax treatment of mileage reimbursements relative to mileage deductions the aftertax value of the 585 cent reimbursement under current law would still be worth twice as much as the tax saving from deduction of 585 cents for taxpayers in the 35 rate bracket for taxpayers in the 10 rate bracket the aftertax reimbursement would be worth nine times as much as the tax savings
