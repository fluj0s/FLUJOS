in 1939 and made applicable to most executive branch employees in the lawcommonly called the hatch act 3 state and local government employees whose official jobs are connected with activitie s that are federally funded have since 1940 also come within the purview of part of the federal hatch act law regardingpartisan political activities 4 the hatch act and civil service restrictions were seen

outside activities in politics as means to protect employees was seen as less necessary and as more restrictive of the rights of private expression of millions of citizens than was needed to accomplish the goals of the hatch act9 the 1993 hatch act amendments thus removed many of the most restrictive limitations in federal law on employees personal offdutyvoluntary activity speech and

currently exist any express exception to the fundraising prohibition for employees in the executive office of the president nor is there an exception to the fundraising prohibition for heads of

initiated except in aggravated circumstances such political activity in federal building in federal workspace or while an employee is on duty would for most employees covered by the hatchact

election itself must be nonpartisan that is none of the candidates is to be nominated or elected as representing such political parties49 the statute would therefore continue to bar even an independent candidacy by fede ral employee in an otherwise partisan election in addition to the general exception for candidacies in nonpartisan election the hatch act provides that regulations issued by the office of personnelmanagement may establish that employees in certain communities near thewashington dc metropolitan area or in other communities where the majority of voters residing there are federal employees may participate in certain local politicalactivities which might otherwise be prohibited such as the acceptance of politicalcontributions and independent candidacies in partisan

such races an employee coul d receive or accept political contributions in connection with that election but would still be prohibited from soliciting contributions from the general public52 holding public office while the hatch act provisions gene rally prohibit employees from running for partisan elective office the language of the act does not prohibit an employee from holding public office even an elective public office an employee under the hatch act is thus not necessarily prohibited from being appointed to publicoffice or from holding public office when he or she enters federal

fact that private entity is merely regulated by ones agency or may be affected by rules promulgated by the agencyor be subject to future audit or investig ation would be enough in itself to come within this restriction on solicitation of participation rather the law appears to require specific matter to be pending or an audit investigation or enforcement action to be ongoing 56 under regulations and examples provided by the office of personnel management an employee may address large diverse group topromote candidacy even if it may incident ally contain persons in the audience with matters before the agency as long as the group has not been specifically targeted as having matters before the employing office 57 but an employee should not address an industry group on campaign matter if th event is sponsored by for example lobby group for the industry when the empl oyee knows that companies with matters before the employees agency will be in attendance58 politics on duty or

political management or in political campaigns see former 5 usc 7324a2 1988 code ed 60see for example political activity and the federal employee office of special counsel at 7 1984 which noted that

contributions in federal buildingswearing government uniform or while using government vehicle federal personnel in the executive branch are genera lly prohibited from engaging in partisan political activity59 interpretations of the former hatch act indicate that behind thescenes activity and assistance eg prep aration of political material research or analysis intended for the benefit or use of partisan candidate or political party ina campaign or an election or assisting in organizing political campaign events even though not overt electioneering soliciting or canvassing for candidate wasnevertheless the type of activity that traditionally constituted partisan politicalactivity 60 there are certain employees in the ex ecutive branch of government whose duties and responsibilities continue outside normal duty hours and while away from the normal duty post such employees when they are paid from appropriations for the executive office of the president or are officers appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate who determine policy with regard to foreign relations or the nationwide administration of federal laws are under different rules concerning campaign activity while on duty stat us or in federal office space these employees or officers are generally permitte d to engage in political activity while on duty status or while in federal office sp ace or while using federal vehicles under most circumstances61 it should be noted that this exemption applies only to the specific prohibition on campaigning while on dut status or while in federal office space where official work is carried out and is not broad exemption of generalnature from all of the other specific rest rictions of the hatch act such as for example the restrictions on using ones official position to influence an election soliciting or discouraging political activity from those with matters pending orongoing before ones agency or the pr ohibitions on political fundraising thus for example although an agency head may participate in political meeting during official hours within his or her government office without violating this part of the hatch act such agency head may still not be involved in soliciting or receiving campaign contributions 62 if such an exempt employee does engage in campaign activity during duty time or in federal offices however additiona l costs which are associated with such activity and paid for by moneys derived from the united states treasury must behttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98885crs13 63see 5 cfr 734503 64costs which would normally have been incurred by the government regardless of whether an activity is political do not have to be reimbursed such as for example the cost of the official compensation of the officer or employee the cost of official office space or of required security see 5 cfr 734503b 655 cfr 734502d 66see 3 op olc 31 1979 and note 42 supra 67within the parameters of the first and fifth amendments congress may authorize and has expressly authorized the use of federa l funds for partisan political purposes one example is the federal monies provided to qua lifying candidates for president of the united states for their partisan political campaign use during primary campaign and for thegeneral election campaign for pr esident under the provisions of the presidential election campaign fund act see pl 92178 as amended note 26 usc 9001 et seq and the continuedreimbursed within reasonable period of time and according to formula expressed in the regulations63 this is required because as general rule federal funds will not have been appropriated by congress to par ticular agency department or office for political campaign uses and may therefore not be spent for purposes other thanthose for which they were appropriated em ployees paid from appropriations for the executive office of the president therefore if they fit within this exemption may participate in political activities even during on duty time and while in officialfederal office space as long as any additional cost to the government from suchpolitical activity is reimbursed from nonfederal monies to the treasury 64 employees who do not fall within the exempted class are permitted when not on duty to be involved in campaign or po litical events which take place in rooms or portions of the white house which are pa rt of the private residence area of the white house and not used solely for the discharge of official duties65 s u c h regulation by the office of personnel management concerning treatment of thewhite house premises for hatch act purposes appears to comport withinterpretations of the justice department which have found as discussed aboveconcerning campaign fund raising such areas to be outside of the prohibition oncampaign fundraising activities in room or building occupied in the discharge of official duties 66 use of federal funds facilities generally as discussed above the hatch act provi des that employees generally may not engage in partisan politics while on duty in official government work space or with government vehicle even those who are exempt from the on duty limitationson campaign activities are expected to reimburse the united states treasury for thefederal resources used in campaign activities as to the use of federal funds andor facilities for partisan political activities generally it should be noted that although th ere is overall express restriction in federal statutory law on the use of ppropriated funds for partisan political purposes 67 general

space and funds generally for partisan political use or advantage of candidates or parties general appropriations principle codified in federal law at 31 usc 1301a provides that moneys appropriated by congress may only be spent for the purposes for which they wereappropriated 68 this provision in practice woul d bar the misapplication or misuse of federal funds by federal agency pers onnel as explained by the general accounting office this statute was originally enacted in 1809 2 stat 535 and is one of the cornerstones of congressional control over the federal purse since money cannot be paid from the treasury except under an appropriation usconst art i 9 cl 7 and since an appropriation must be derived from an act of congress it is for congre ss to determine the purpose for which an appropriation may be used simply stated 31 usc 1301a saysthat public funds may be used only for the purpose or purposes for whichthey were appropriated 69 as to the use of appropriated funds for political purposes and the possible limitation on such use by 31 usc 1301a gao explains generally speaking funds appropriated to carry out particular program would not be available for political purposes ie for propaganda effort designed to aid political party or candidate see b147578 november8 1962 if for other reason such an expenditure would be improper ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98885crs15

cabinet officer or other agency head or assistant that certain activities are in c onnection with official duties and there is reasonable basis for such determination we do not feel that we would be warranted in questioning the expenses incurred in connection with such activities 75see 14 op olc 157 1990 6 op olc 214 1982 use of funds for other than thei r intended purpose in violation of 31 usc 1301a70 federal agencies and departments have discretion to expend federal funds to promote and to further the legitimate offi cial governmental objectives of the federal agency or department and the programs and policies within their jurisdiction71 federal monies may not be expended merely because some agency official feels its good idea rather the expenditure of ch funds must be in conformance with their intended purpose that is th at the expenditure will contribute to accomplishing the purpose of the appropriation the agency wishes to charge72 the comptroller general has thus looked to activities to determine if they can be said to be so completely devoid of any connection with official functions or sopolitical in nature that the expenditures are not in furtherance of purposes for whichgovernment funds were appropriated 73 where however there has been determination made by the president cabinet officer agency head or assistant thatcertain activities are in connection with official duties the comptroller generalwould look merely to see if there is reasonable basis for such determination 74 there are not necessarily any clearcut guidelines or hardandfast rules about categorizing an activity as official as opposed to political other than thoseembodied in the discussion above that is that the activity has some reasonableconnection with official functions it ma be noted that the issue of whether an activity is official or political has arisen from time to time with respect to travel by the president and vice president including the travel of federal officers andemployees accompanying or in advance of the president and vice presidentguidance concerning such travel and the xpenditure of funds for travel including the reimbursement of the government from

aut horized by department or agency employees are expressly instructed by ethi cs and conduct provisions to protect and conserve federal property and not use it for other than authorized activities78 administrative rulings have upheld disciplinary actions against federal employeeswho have misused such government resources as the telephone copier or computerfor certain personal business ventures as opposed to use for official governmentalactivities 79 in more severe factual circumst ances the use of government property or resources for personal nonofficial purpos to such an extent that the property is deemed to have been wrongfully converted to ones private use or to have beenstolen would implicate criminal statutory violations 80 state and local governmental employees in addition to
