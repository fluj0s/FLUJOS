applicants must have been eligible for regular uc benefits and have exhausted their rights to regular uc compensation with respect to benefit year that expired during or after the week of may 6 20075 for most states this would apply to indi viduals who had filed uc claims with an effective date of may 7 2006 or later for the state of new york this would apply to original claims filed with an effective date of may 1 2006 or later6 g7g161g145g138g158g156g157g142g141g561g20g142g144g158g149g138g155g561g23g5g561g4g142g151g142g143g146g157g561 the right to regular uc benefits must be exhaus ted to be eligible for euc08 benefits although federal laws and regulations provide broad guidelines on regular uc benefit coverage and eligibility determination the specifics of regular uc benefits are determined by each state this results in 53 different programs7 in particular states determine uc benefit eligibility amount and duration through state laws and program regulations 4 august 30 2009 for new york 5 arkansas has unique approach to calculating benefit year in arkansas the benefit year begins the first day of the quarter in which an individual files valid uc claim thus it is unlikely that many individuals in arkansas who filed uc claims before july 2006 would be eligible to r eceive euc08 benefits 6 note the effective date is not necessarily the actual date when an individual filed for uc claim filed on may 10 2006 may have had an earlier effective date if state allows retroactive claims 7 the 50 states the district of columbia puerto rico and the virgin islands provide uc

and employment in covered work over 12month period called base period conditional on earnings amounts and number of quarters worked in the base period an individual may qualify for as little as one week of uc benefits in some states and as many as 26 weeks in other states individuals with higher earnings and multiple quarters of work history will generally receive higher uc benefits for longer

in addition to all state requirements for regula r uc eligibility the euc08 program requires claimants to have at least 20 weeks of fulltime insured employment or the equivalent in insured wages in their base period states use one two or three different methods for determining an equivalent to 20 weeks of fulltime insured employment these methods are described in both law section 202a5 of the extended unemployment compensation act of 1970 and regulation 20 cfr 6154b in practice states that apply any of these three requirements for receipt of regular uc benefits and do not allow for exceptions to those requirements do not need to establish that workers meet the 20 weeks of fulltime insured employment requir ement for the purposes of euc the three methods are as follows earnings in the base period equal to at least 15 times the highquarter wages or earnings in the base period of at least 40 times the most recent weekly benefit amount and if this alternative is adopted it shall use the weekly benefit amount including dependents allowances payable for week of total unemployment before any reduction because of earnings pensions or other requirements that applied to the most recent week of regular benefits or earnings in the base period equal to at least 20 weeks of fulltime insured employment and if this alternative is adopted the term fulltime shall have the meaning provided by the state law the base period may be the regular base period or if applicable in the state the period may be the alternative base period or the extended base period if that determined the regular uc benefit 8 individuals in the massachusetts and montana uc programs may have regular uc durations that exceed 26 weeks individuals who qualify for more than 26 weeks of regular uc benefits would be eligible for more than 13 weeks of euc08 benefits httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22915g22g142g150g153g152g155g138g155g162g561g7g161g157g142g151g156g146g152g151g561
