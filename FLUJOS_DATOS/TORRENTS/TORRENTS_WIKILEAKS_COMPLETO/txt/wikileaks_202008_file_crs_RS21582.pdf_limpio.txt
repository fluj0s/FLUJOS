report will be updated if major changes occur background geography and military balance the korean peninsula lies at nexus of military economic nd political concerns with global implications from north kor eas perspective it is surrounded by world powers to the west and north are china and ru ssia to the east is japan and to the south is south korea and military forces of the united states since the korean war began in 1950 the north korean dictatorship has presented continuous military and economic challenges to its neighbors recent cha llenges have included specter of economic collapse and threat to develop nuclear arsenal north korea with population of 22 milli on maintains large military force of over 1 million active soldiers nd 47 million reservists its force structure includes some 20 army corps with armor mechanized infantry and infantry units notable enhancements include 88000 special purpose forces and rang of artillery rocket and missile forces some reportedly

aircraft and some 300 u tility helicopters detracting fro m the potency of this large force are the age and obsolescence of many combat systems and low training hours afforded to their crews many draftees may reflect weakness stemming from ten years of malnutrition directly facing the north korean threat is south korea with some 48 million people it has 686000 personnel on active military duty and can muster 45 million reservists the south korean army is organized into so 10 corps with equipment generally better than that found to the north for example lf of its tanks are comparable to the us abrams tank its fleet of over 350 helic opters includes us ah1 cobras ch47 chinooks and uh60 blackhawks the navy deploys 26 submarines 39 principal surface combatants 84 patrol and coastal combatants and 2division force of 28000 marines the air force flies over 530 combat aircraft including the f16cd the south korean level of training is considered generally higher than that of north korea integral to the defense of south korea is the direct presence of some 37000 us military personnel major units are two brigad of the 2d infantry division combat and support units of the eighth army including pa triot missile batteries and us air force units deploying 90 combat aircraft dedicat ed reinforcement and supporting forces are considerable including new stryker brigade2 and corps headquarters in fort lewis washington and the 25th infantry division in hawaii powerful air force marine corps and navy forces totaling 48000 personnel ar nearby in japan including the seventh fleet availability of additional army forces in the near term however would be limited by ongoing commitments in iraq afghan istan the balkans and other places3 unique strength of the defense of south korea resides in the command arrangements both joint and combined us officer general leon j laporte as commander of the combined forces co mmand would command ll allied forces in south korea during wartime as well as all us forces south korean general would be the ground component comma nder and have operational c ontrol of us ground forces assigned to him by general laporte high er headquarters

torrential rains and flooding much of the north korean force is prot ected by system of underground caves and tunnels about twothirds of the north ko rean force is forward deployed along the demilitarized zone dmz the northern bounda ry of south korea complicating military defensive planning is the location of seoul the capital of south korea seoul metropolis of some 10 million people sits as tride the major trafficable corridor between north and south korea as close as 25 miles to the dmz in surprise attack the north could inflict artillery nd missile devastation upon seoul referred to by the north as sea of fire5 and possibly reach the city with coordinated ground and special operations attack us military alternatives should resort to force be deemed necessa ry there are several military actions that the united states could contemplate to achie ve policy objectives on the korean peninsula north korea unfortunately has history of unpredictable nd often violent reactions to even slight provocations therefore even the most modest us military action risks escalation to higher levels of conflict and most analysts agree that military option should be chosen without full recognition of ch danger also combination of options could be chosen or even anticipated to ensue us allies and other nations in northeast asia are aware of these dangers and the ited states would likely undertake some form of consultation with them their active or passive cooperation c ould be needed some suggest that in light of potentially larg casualties proceeding without south korean agreement would be immoral as well as illadvised6 status quo current us policy involves main taining stable military situation while diplomacy proceeds to solve the north korean nuclear crisis south korea and the united states maintain strong defenses along the dmz periodic military exercises elicit complaints from north korean officials but over time they generally seem accustomed to and respect the existing military situation7 some have suggested withdrawal or drawdown of us forces but other analysts believe this could in time of tensions send unintended messages to north korea or even to one or more of its powerful neighbors ongoing studies and negotiations propose to relocate us ground forces and headquarters primarily by moving the us 2d infantry division from the north to the south of seoul8 such move would give us forces greater flexibility to maneuver andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21582crs4 8 continued korean public 9 sanghun choe redeployment from dmz would

military situation more or less stable could be argued either way9 but the overall effect should not unduly change the military status quo on the korean peninsula improve defensive posture recognizing that the current situation is unusually tense the united states and south korea c ould adopt policy of temporarily increasing military preparedness to deter north korean military strike10 improve allied odds to defeat such strike or rein force diplomatic firmness the least provocative action might be to add more robust intellig ence and warning activities both those based in south korea and those using space assets and adjoining air and sea access other options include upgrading and testing alternate command h eadquarters including those underground as well as information and communi cations networks adding mo re air and missile defense assets to protect additional key government and military facilities in south korea and japan and strengthening unit reception plans nd facilities for reinforcements in so far as the north korean crisis is recognized as priority military challenge to the united states the measures above are in some cases underway according to recent press reports11 although possible it is unlikely that north korea would attack solely in response to such gradual defensive measures it might however feel greater pressure to either reach diplomatic solution or expend more resources on its own military establishment calling up south korean reservists or moving additional us combat forces into the peninsula might also be considered unle ss done in re sponse to overtly hostile north korean actions or intentions such actions would most likely be construed as serious provocation or possibly prelude to an allied attack north korean sensitivity is illustrated by statements of concern even wh temporary us buildups and exercises are held in okinawa12 military enforcement of sanctions should north korea attempt to export weapons of mass destruction long er range missiles or the materials to create such things interception on the high seas or in the air by military forces might be considered13 us and international policy objec tives would be to enfor ce nonproliferation goals and perhaps secondarily to restrict hard curre ncy gains from such transactions such blockade quarantine or containment to be effective would require

the cooperation of other nations and interna tional organizations not least being commitment from china and russia to actively seal their land sea and air borders from penetration by north korean c onveyances and those of their customers risks for such an operation are that innocent trade and other activities of many nations could be inconvenienced north ko rea might circumvent even sophisticated intelligence and interception opera tions and since blockade is considered an act of war north korea might respond with military action14 preemptive strike on nuclear facilities the administrations national security strategy reserves the option for the president to order preemptive strike to forestall weapons of mass destruction ttack against the united states its military forces or its allies15 in this case the possession of nuclear weapons nd ballistic missiles could threaten now or in the short term us forces and llied populations in south korea and japan in the longer term few obser vers are concerned that north korea could threaten more distant targets to include parts of the us homeland16 there is also the possibility that north korean nuclear materi als and weapons could be exported to third parties terrorist groups or rogue states th at might wish to harm the united states in any event policy option would be to stroy identified weapons and materials and associated production fac ilities in north korea it would be complicated by the north koreans ability to hide or protect ch targets often deeply underground the united states has the ability to deliv er both conventional and nuclear weapons against some underground targets and is st udying robust nuclear earth penetrators17 some targets could presumably also be neutra lized with special forces operations risk with preemptive strike option is that all identified targets if they do exist might not be accurately located and that some may be deeply or effectively protected against us weapons18 surviving capabilities might be used in retaliatory strikes possibly creating calamities that us policy wa s trying to prevent us strikes would undoubtedly be considered acts of war and north korea c ould attempt to launch selective or massive conventional attacks agains t south korea in response19 it is therefore unlikely that south korea would support preemptive st rike option under most circumstanceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21582crs6 20 ohanlon op cit note in extremis both sides retain the option to resort to nuclear warfare 21 general robert kingston us army retired oral hi story us army war college carlisle barracks pa 1995 in context it must be noted that chinese soldiers were also tough opponentspreemptive war initiating general war with north korea is an unlikely option for the united states as south korea would be unwilling to sustain the resultant huge costs on its population without extreme provo cation in theory however two policy objectives might be met first should reg ime change in north korea become priority policy objective military march to pyongyang might be the only sure means available second should major north korean att ack south appear imminent the policy of preemptive attack might offer advantages the initial allied targeting and assaults could reduce north korean capabilities to destroy seoul wmd could be destroyed or captured and allied commanders would be able to execu their plan with nonattritted forces particular advantage if the united states followed doctrine of rapid joint and coordinated attacks throughout the depth of north korea in considering war option certain assumptions and risks would need to be assessed first intern ational support for the war would be desirable given us reliance on global communications and transport china s reaction would be key at the minimum it would have to be neutral next it would be difficult to mask attack preparations by us and south korean forces north kor ea could launch its own preemptive attack possibly creating some of the dverse consequences us polic was trying to circumvent also timing is problem due to heavy co mmitments in iraq and many other places the us army is currently stretched very thi n and would find it difficult to contribute the major ground forces needed20 to sustain such an operation it is likely that many army national guard and army rese rve units not already on active duty would have to be mobilized as well as considerable numbers of individual reservists to fill out units and replace casualties it is likely that much of any postwar occupation of north korea required could be accomplished by south korea finally american public acceptance of more difficult and protracted war than it might expect based on recent quick us military victories in southwest asia and the balkans may be requisite in addition to geographic problems highlighted above and larger enemy force that has possibly lear ned through observation how the united states fights the north korean soldier may not surrender easily the korean war of 19501953 is cautionary example one us veteran of that conflict said id rather fight the chinese any day than the north koreans w ho were more tenacious more fanatical and more disciplined21 others would point out that todays north korean soldier is physically weaker may resent state oppressi on is severely outcla ssed in weaponry and experience with modern warfare and the current limits of his tenacity are not known should military option be deemed necessa ry the executive would be expected to consult with appropria congressional bodies
