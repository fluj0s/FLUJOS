september 26 2002 useu trade tensions causes consequences and possible cures raymond j ahearn specialist in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division summary the united states and the european union eu share large and mutually beneficial trade and investment relationship given huge volume of commercialinteractions trade tensions and disputes are not unexpected in the past periodicepisodes of rising trade tensions and even threats of trade war have been followed bysuccessful efforts at dispute settlement this ebb and flow of trade tensions hasoccurred again this year with highly publici zed disputes involving steel and tax breaks for us exporters both disputes have been characterized by mutual feelings that theother side has taken actions that are unreasona ble and inconsistent with the rules of the world trade organization wto moreover both washington and brussels haveplayed hardball in crafting retaliation lists aimed at influencing each others domestic political process while fears of an allout trade war usually are exaggerated the tradedisputes may impede useu cooperation in other areas number of ways have been suggested to diffuse current trade tensi ons including greater reliance on compensation as opposed to retaliation and greater emphasis on diplomatic as opposed to legalisticsolutions to disputes while potentially helpfu l the fact that some of these highprofile disputes have been unresolved for decades suggests the difficulty of finding permanent solutions congress has strong interest in these disputes and plays significantlegislative role particularly on the export subsidy issue this report will be updated asevents warrant introduction the united states and european union eu are parties to the largest twoway trade and investment relationship in the world annual twoway flows of goods services and investments now exceed 1 trillion while only tiny fraction of these interactions lead to disputes the dominant role that both economic powers play in the world economy makes settlement of the disputes particularly important1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21223crs2 2 for background see crs report rl31107 steel industry and trade issues by stephen cooneyuseu trade tensions have ebbed and fl owed in recent years during the summer of 2000 the two sides bickered over the eus discriminatory policies affecting imports of bananas and beef treated with hormones the united states imposed 100 tariffs on about 300 million of mainly luxury items such as danish ham truffles roquefortcheese and italian handbags the eu countered by successfully challenging in the wtoa us tax benefit for export sales known as the foreign sales corporation fsc now known as the extraterritorial income exclusion or eti with the onset of the bush administra tion in 2001 cooperation began to supercede confrontation pascal lamy the eu commissi oner for trade and robert zoellick the us trade representative reached agreemen t on the banana dispute and us retaliatory tariffs associated with bananas were lifted in april the two sides agreed to disagree on the hormone dispute and the eu consented to provide the united states more time tobring its tax law in conformity with its wto obligations moreover lamy and zoellick collaborated to launch new round of wto ne gotiations last november in doha qatar last years lull in trade threats was broken on march 5 2002 when president bush announced his decision under section 201 of the trade act of 1974 to impose fairly steep albeit temporary tariffs of up to 30 on approximately 8 billion in steel imports canada mexico israel and jordan countries that have free trade agreement with the us were exempted from all tariffs 2 the presidents decision to rely on trad remedy and to impose the tariffs in selective fashion raised cries of indignation and protectionism from european leaders andprompted quick response on march 27 2002 citing threat of diversion of foreign steel from the us market to europe th eu announced provisional tariffs of 15 to 26 on 15 different steel products the eu also immediately moved to challenge theus action under the general wto dispute settlement rules and more provocativelyunder never tested provision of the wto safeguards agreement under the latterprovision the eu claimed that it may impose retaliatory sanctions on the usimmediately rather than wait up to three ears for wto dispute settlement ruling if the us does not agree to compensation to date brussels has delayed implementing its threat of early retaliation because the bush administration has moved to exempt much of european steel shipments to the us but if the eu decides on swift retaliation rather than waiting for the wto to rule onwhether the us steel tariffs ar violation of world trade ru us trade officials will be under great pressure to retaliate against the retaliation this situation is furthercomplicated by the august 30 2002 wto ruling that the eu is entitled to retaliateagainst 4 billion in us exports in the eti tax break case while the eu is preparing retaliation list for us exports that could be subject to punitive duties eu officials have stated they are still willing to give the united states more time to change the tax laws that are at the heart of the disputehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21223crs3 causes escalation of useu trade tensions in the first half of 2002 was spurred by three interrelated factors first each side viewed actions the other had taken as unreasonable and motivated by narrow political considerations second each side saw the otherskirting wto rules and shirking wto obligations third each side believed that theother was playing political hardball in crafting retaliation lists that clearly attempted toinfluence internal political deliberations narrow political actions balancing divergent domestic and foreign goals strong domestic economy responsiveness to domestic political interests promotion ofan open world trading system and fostering st rong relationships with key allies is part of trade policy decisionmaking when decisions are skewed toward achieving one ofthese objectives controversy often ensues in this context the bush administrationssteel decision was viewed as unreasonable by many europeans who saw it as drivenprimarily by narrow domestic political calculations not broader domestic economic orforeign policy interests whether valid or not many europeans believed that the decision was motivated by electoral considerations moreover many europeans were incensed by the discriminatory manner in which the tariffs were implemented targeting the euhardest and excluding countries that have free trade agreement with the united states on the contrary washington was irked by eu actions that appeared to have narrow political motivations of another kind the eus decision to challenge provision of the fsceti export tax benefit is case in point while the fsc was enacted in 1984 the eu did not challenge the provision until n ovember 1997 many on the us side suspect that the challenge had much to do with an attempt by the european commission to gainnegotiating leverage over the united states as well as with getting even for uspressures over beef and bananas the f act that few european companies were complaining about the tax break as disadva ntaging them commercially further suggests calculated political motive for launching the case skirting wto rules the aggressive eu reaction on steel was related in part to its belief that the us action violates numerous wto rules an essential element of the eus complaint is that its steel exports to the united states declined by 33 percent between 1998 and 2001 and that the wto agreement on safeguards permits temporaryrestrictions on imports only when imports ar increasing eu officials also questioned whether the us decision adequately links th remedy to the actual level of injury caused by imports as opposed to other causes in addition they were skeptical that the usdecision to exclude its free trade partners from the tariffs was permitted under the most favored nation principle of the wto us officials argued that eu concerns about whether its steel action complies with its wto obligations should be determined by formal wto dispute settlement panel process that normally takes up to three years but the eu maintained that the wto safeguards agreement allows it to adopt c ountermeasures immediately because the united states did not show an absolute incr ease in imports over the most recent three year period accordingly the eu argued that it is entitled to retaliate on about 320 million worth of us exports us trade officials responded that any immediate unilateralretaliation against the united states would be unprecedented in the history of the wto and would strike at the heart of the multilateral trading system httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21223crs4 3 for background see crs report rs21185 trade policymaking in the european union by raymond j ahearnretaliation and domestic politics the wto permits retaliation imposition of very high tariffs on trading partners exports when recalcitrant governments fail tocomply with dispute panel rulings against them while used sparingly both the united states and eu have imposed or threatened retaliation in ways that have sparked rawnerve on both sides of the atlantic when the clinton administration levied retaliatory tariffs on european exports over the banana and beef hormone disputes in 2000 the hope was that the danish germanitalian and french exporters affected by higher prices would lobby their respectivegovernments to change the eu policies that we re in violation of wto rules while some of the targeted producers did lobby to ch ange the policies the retaliation may have stiffened the resolve of other europeans not to give in to us pressures this is because many europeans view retaliation as frontal ssault on european unity an effort to set one member state off against another in an attempt to influence eu decisionmaking 3 despite its condemnation of retaliation as trade weapon the eu in the aftermath of the bush steel decision emulated previous us efforts and devised retaliation lists one to be used under the safeguards provision and one to be used under the disputesettlement provision with domestic political c onsiderations in mind the eu lists include products from regions such as citrus from fl orida steel from the midwest and textiles from north carolina that are considered politically important to president bush leavingno mistake about intent when he released the list eu trade commissioner pascal lamyexpressed hope that the threatened countermeasures would help persuade the usadministration to lower its steel barriers consequences on the one hand the good news is that us eu trade disputes are unlikely to get out of hand some disputes may even facilitate greater trade liberalization competitiveness and industrial restructuring over time on the other hand the bad newsis that the current tensions and mutual r ecriminations may make useu cooperation in other areas more difficult and they clearly threaten the viability of the wto trading system good news an allout trade war between the two sides appears remote due to domestic political opposition and the high level of economic integration that now exists as retaliation hurts consumers retailers and companies dependent on targeted productsfor inputs into their production processes these groups lobby brussels and washington intensively to keep specific products off any retaliation list that may be drawn upmoreover given the huge stake each side has in the others market through directinvestments and merger and acquisition activity both european and americanmultinational companies mncs serve as power ful lobbies that caution restraint any imposition of acrosstheboard and high trad barriers could create massive disruptions in the worldwide production arrangement of mncs and also deflate economic activity on both sides of the atlantic an estimated 60 of us eu trade is accounted for by intra corporate transactions these factors in tur n limit the scope and flexibility that us andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21223crs5 eu trade officials have in devising politi cally acceptable retaliation list or in imposing acrosstheboard and high trade barriers selective trade disputes may have conseque nces that some view as positive for example president bushs decision to raise steel tariffs reportedly was motivated in partto enlist the support of legislators from st eel producing states for passage of trade promotion authority tpa legislation ustr zoellick argued that the presidentswillingness to raise tariffs was short term n ecessary step for obtaining the leverage tpa may provide for negotiating new sweeping trade liberalization agreements later on inaddition the bush administration argued that higher us tariffs would help spurinternational negotiations to facilitate the re structuring of the steel industry worldwide regarding the export subsidy case the wto challenge may serve as prod forconsideration by the administration and congre ss of fundamental restructuring of the corporate tax structure bad news escalating trade tensions however are not costfree polls indicate that trade disputes likely have some effect on public attitudes contributing to perceptionof each other as inwardlooking egotistical nd hypocritical free traders trade tensions and mutual recriminations may also make c ooperation in other areas more difficult this includes efforts to settle other trade disputes if media and public pressures intensify for linking disputes most assuredly it also includes efforts to make quick progress in therecently launched doha round of multilateral trade negotiations transatlantic trade tensions over agriculture for example st alled progress on the uruguay round of trade negotiations for several years in the early 1990s what impact trade tensions may have on cooperation on broader foreign policy issues such as the war on terrorism remain s uncertain but high profile trade disputes are likely to raise sharper and more critical questions concerning the benefits of such cooperation if trade tensions work to undermine the notion that the united states andeurope share common values or lead to view that weaker america or weaker europe is in the others interest then the consequences could be more significant the most serious consequence of escalating trade tensions may be the strain placed on the wto system itself as the eu and us are the wtos two biggest parties andmost important leaders their relationship and example are critical to the smoothfunctioning of the multilateral trading system when either party does not comply with wto obligations acts unilaterally or uses the dispute resolution system to score politicalpoints the wtocentered world trading system arguably suffers possible cures several cures or recommendations to ameliora current trade tensions have been put forth these include greater reliance on compensation as opposed to retaliation andgreater emphasis on diplomatic as opposed to legal solutions to disputes while helpful the fact that some of these highprofile tr ade disputes have been ongoing in one form or another for several decades suggests how difficult dispute resolution can be compensation instead of retaliation when country refuses to comply with final dispute resolution ruling the primary enforcement mechanism is wto authorizedretaliation many observers maintain that the system should place more stress on tradehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21223crs6 compensation in order to limit the negative consequences of retaliation trade compensation would require the defendi ng country to open other markets in compensation for the markets it restricts instead of restricting trade compensation would bias dispute resolution towards lowering trade barriers the essential goal of thewto the hurdles to greater reliance on compen sation are both political and legal in the steel safeguards case for example if the united states were to reduce tariffs on textileimports as compensation for raising tariffs on steel one industry would be asked to pay for another industrys protection moreover payment of compensation before the wto rules whether the us steel safeguard action was imposed consistent with wto rulescould be viewed as admission of wrongdoing greater emphasis on diplomatic solutions the us and eu are the heaviest users of the wto dispute resolution system some of the disputes between the two sides have been submitted to wto pa nel for resolution without strenuous efforts at resolving the dispute beforehand some disputes arguably have been initiated out of desire to score political points by winning cas that show the other side in technical violation of wto provisions once the dispute panel is formed neither side is inclined to seek negotiated solution out of fear of compromising important principles andobtaining ruling on who is right or wrong in the process numerous disputes have become acrimonious and have hurt the credibility of the wto as an institution to deal with problems accompanying c onfrontational approach many observers have emphasized the desirability of greater reliance on diplomatic approach that stressesconciliation and problemsolving over legal precision in sense this is the route ustrade policymakers may be taking in the st eel dispute by offering selective eu member states favorable consideration of their exporters requests that specific products beexempted from us steel tariffs as of midaugust 2002 the bush administration had exempted around 600 million out of 23 billion of steel from european producersaffected by the tariffs exemption from us tariffs in turn has helped shore upopposition in member states such as germa ny sweden and great britain to precipitous eu retaliation while the eu in july 2002 agreed to postpone until september 30 2002 decision on the threatened retaliation most observers feel that the high level ofexemptions granted european producers to da undercuts the support for early retaliation considerably another form of diplomacy may be helping resolve the export tax subsidy dispute dispute where the eu has repeatedly emphasized that it does not want to retaliateagainst the united states but rather wants the united states to comply with the wto panel ruling to show good faith that it is moving in that direction chairman william thomas of the house ways and means committee on july 11 introduced hr 5095 bill that reportedly would bring us tax bene fits for exports into conformity with wto rules while the legislation has been opposed by some of the largest beneficiaries of the tax benefit the wto ruling authorizing re taliation will strengthen the pressures for finding consensus approach yet because number of senate leaders are calling forthe formation of study group to reach consensus legislated tax reform fix isunlikely to pass congress this year in the process eu patience may be tested althoughthe threat of retaliation may limit us trade pressures on other disputes
