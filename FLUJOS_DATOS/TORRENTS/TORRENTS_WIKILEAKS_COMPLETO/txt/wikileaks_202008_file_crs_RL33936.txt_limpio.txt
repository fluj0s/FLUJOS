division andorra bruno specialist in immigration policy domestic social policy division iraqi refugees and internally displaced persons deepening humanitarian crisis summary some aspects of the humanitarian crisis many feared would take place in march 2003 as result of the war in iraq continue to unfold as result of postwar insurgency and sectarian violence it is estimated that in total including those displaced prior to the war there may be as many as 2 million iraqi refugees who have fled to jordan syria and other neighboring states and approximately 27 million iraqis who have been displaced within iraq itself some experts think that the iraq situation now outpaces other refugee crises worldwide during 20042007 the violence and insecurity resulting from the ongoing sectarian strife terrorism and insurgency in iraq produced substantial civilian displacement in different parts of the country many of iraqs neighbors fear that they are being overwhelmed by refugees who have fled over iraqs borders there are heightened concerns about the absorptive capacity of neighboring countries whether they can provide adequately for the populations that have moved across borders and the impact of refugee flows on stability in general while there is clear evidence of limited improvement in iraq decreasing violence reduced levels of displacement and handful of returns in few governorates the situation in general remains precarious and requires sustained attention unhcr estimates that the number of iraqis displaced within iraq who need food and shelter exceeds 1 million people this report provides an analysis of the current crisis including the conditions for those displaced in iraq and the refugee situations in syria jordan and elsewhere it also provides information on the us and international response and examines refugee resettlement options in the united states aspects of this crisis that may be of particular interest to the 110th congress include focus on an immediate response providing humanitarian relief funding examining resettlement policies and developing strategy to manage the displaced particularly within iraq this report will be updated as events

the key to halting sectarian warfare and the displacement of iraqis from their homes while some experts agree that iraqs major communities remain sharply divided over their relative positions in the power structure the bush administration reportedly sees signs of movement on political reconciliation partially attributed to the impact of the 2007 troop surge in reducing the level of violence the reduced violence has at the very least ensured that the displacement problem has not worsened any further in 2008 if movement toward political reconciliation takes hold this could create conditions for decreasing the current rates of displacement and could increase the desire of the international community to address the refugee and displaced persons issue most experts believe that reconciliation would also enhance capacity in iraqs ministries responsible for security basic services and providing assistance to those displaced iraqis the insecurity resulting from ongoing violence in iraq continues to have marked impact on civilian displacement in various parts of the country this was particularly the case during the past two years when sectarian violence accelerated an already developing pattern of population displacement and emigration the numbers of displaced iraqis are very fluid and vary by source for example the iraqi red crescent society estimates of refugees and internally displaced persons idps exceed those published in january 2008 report by the migration policy institute which states that there were close to 45 million displaced iraqis 22 refugees and 23 idps the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr1 now estimates close to 47 million iraqis are currently displaced from their homes 1 unhcr is the agency dedicated to the protection of refugees and other populations displaced by conflict famine and natural disasters it provides legal protections implements longterm solutions and coordinates emergency humanitarian relief for refugees and other displaced persons in iraq unhcr is the lead on protection and shelter refugee as defined under the 1951 united nations convention relating to the status of refugees is person who is outside his or her country and who is unable or unwilling to return because of persecution or wellfounded fear of persecution on account of race religion nationality membership in particular social group or political opinion returnee is refugee who returns to his or her home country and idp is person who has not crossed an international border but remains displaced inside his or her own country unhcr considers all categories part of populations of concern crs2 including roughly 27 million inside iraq and 2 million refugees who have fled iraq mostly to neighboring jordan and syria2 when the displacement crisis accelerated in 2006unhcr observed that the humanitarian crisis many feared would take place in march 2003 as result of the war had begun to occur the massive displacement has emerged quietly and without fanfare but the numbers affected are in excess of what many agencies had predicted in 20033 then as now there were also concerns about the absorptive capacity of neighboring countries whether they could provide adequately for the populations moving across borders and the potential impact of refugee flows on stability in the region the iraq situation has begun to outpace other population displacement crises worldwide as the figures grow higher food and fuel prices and decreasing subsidies are limiting the ability of aid agencies to provide assistance it is estimated that 12 million iraqis were displaced before 2006 15 million iraqis were displaced between 2006 and 2007 and less than 1 have been displaced in 2008 while there are some reports of limited improvements decreasing violence reduced levels of displacement and handful of returns in few governorates the situation in general remains very serious and requires sustained attention4 unhcr estimates that the number of iraqi idps who need food and shelter exceeds 1 million people5 the figures on population displacement illustrate the challenges ahead as the 110th congress considers various policy options toward iraq the impact of this level of displacement which is the largest in the middle east since 1948 cannot be overestimated in terms of its impact on regional stability and the potential for humanitarian suffering experts suggest that what is badly needed and quickly is the development of robust response on the part of the international community that provides and funds humanitarian relief conducts close examination of resettlement policies and options in third countries develops strategy to manage the 2 idp working group internally displaced persons in iraq update

increased funding to host countries and aid agencies outside iraq6 displacement within iraq displacement within iraq has usually been the result of sectarian conflict and general armed violence local criminal activity coalition military operations and fighting among militias and insurgents direct personal threats abductions assassinations and death threats remain commonplace although less so than in 2007 religious belief political or tribal affiliation and association with us forces or iraqi authorities can also make someone target for violence all of these activities continue to create an atmosphere of generalized fear for many ordinary iraqis within iraq the current conditions clearly bear the mark of sectarian polarization and cleansing in neighborhoods formerly of mixed religious orientation that took place during 2006 and 2007 in recent studies the international organization for migration iom found that idps tended to be from mixed neighborhoods and displaced to homogenous ones the movement occurred predominantly in and between urban areas with more than 70 fleeing baghdad7 at least 10 of the 18 iraqi provinces have now tried to place entry restrictions on their internal borders to iraqis displaced from elsewhere in the country overall living standards within iraq have declined sharply since 2003 human development indicators access to health care social services education employment have fractured under the current circumstances and affected wider social networks in iraqi society limited assistance activities and access by the international community have made implementation of tangible longterm policy objectives difficult within many areas in iraq conditions are deteriorating and for those already displaced are becoming more permanent problems many who cannot secure protection or assistance could soon find themselves in the same situation according to some estimates iraqs population is 268 million this means that nearly 13 of the population or one in eight iraqis may be displaced there are many patterns of displacement some that have their origins decades ago but have now evolved into new phase for example the approximately 300000 refugees who were in iran before the 2003 war then returned to iraq and now are believed to have been displaced again this time within iraq others were refugees from other countries in the region who fled to iraq and are now on the move again within its borders saddam husseins brutal regime left legacy of displacement as his regime forcibly displaced iraqi shiites and kurds in order to control territory terrorize the population and fight insurrection some experts estimate as many as 15 million may have been displaced over the three decades of his regime 6 see also elizabeth ferris security

september 2007 7 international organization for migration iraq displacement 2007 year in review january 2008 crs4 profile of displacement there have been reliable census data on iraqs ethnic and sectarian makeup for decades iraqs population represents number of ethnic groups and religions in general throughout iraq patterns have shown that shiites have moved from the center to the south sunnis from the south to the upper center christians fled to ninevah province and kurds ended up within diyala or tamimkirkuk provinces8 palestinians in iraq who numbered close to 34000 before the war and are mostly sunni have been particularly vulnerable to reprisal attacks by shiites as they received preferential treatment from saddam hussein the united nations estimates that possibly only 1000015000 palestinians remain in iraq many have been killed and others have been displaced again there are two refugee camps on the syrian border to which palestinians have fled from iraq and reportedly the living conditions urgently need to be addressed some progress has been made on resettling some of the palestinians in canada brazil chile and sudan9 those iraqis who have worked with the us government the new iraqi government or international organizations have been particularly targeted10 in addition there are vulnerable groups within these categories of displaced including the elderly sick pregnant women and children see us refugee program and iraqi refugees section later in this report most of those displaced are moving in with family and friends who live in areas where one sect overwhelmingly predominates when this is not possible they go to public facilities such as schools and factories some people are squatting in damaged or abandoned property such as mosques and in much smaller numbers to camps set up by the iraqi red crescent society or ministry of displacement and migration modm repeatdisplacement which means moving second time or repeatedly most commonly applies to those displaced by military operations11 daily behavior by those who are displaced or living in fear for their lives may also vary to avoid establishing any predictable pattern micro and nighttime displacement means that person is living in his or her home but sleeping elsewhere daylight displacement involves shifting routines routes and activities and fake 8 ibid in addition another account of displacement is provided by alkhalidid and tanner who define several categories of those displaced including sunni arabs from shia areas shia from sunni areas arabs both shia and sunni and other minorities from kurdish areas and minority groups from both sunni and shia areas these include iraqi christians sabeanmandeans shia turkmen the roma baghdad and basra kurds and third country nationals including palestinians and iranian kurds see ashraf alkhalidid and victor tanner sectarian violence radical groups drive internal displacement in iraq october 2006 9 unhcr unhcr concerned

and migration information department is preparing report on basic statistics of postfebruary 2006 internally displaced persons in cooperation with the iom iraq mission in amman crs5 displacement are those who pretend to be displaced and build homes on government land or the land of locals12 immediate consequences of displacement there are many consequences to displacement in the short term the iom reports examine the deterioration of basic humanitarian needs and services not only from displacement itself but due to lack of employment and huge economic decline throughout the country needs expressed by displaced iraqis include food water and sanitation fuel and electricity shelter health care and education this level of displacement has increased competition for limited resources and continues to place huge burdens on host communities which in turn has had an impact as communities reach their saturation point13 table 1 inside iraq profile of estimated populations of concern

the allocation of food rations the ministry of interior which provides documentation for services such as registration for food rations and the ministry of education which is in charge of registering school children many of whom have been displaced and need to be enrolled in local schools support of the displaced in the provinces is usually handled by committee and is considered more effective there are also informal committees set up in local communities and in mosques as 12 alkhalidid and tanner 13 international organization for migration iraq displacement 2006 year in review january 2007

assists the displaced throughout the country through its 18 branches there have been concerns by iraqs neighbors the united states and other donor countries that the iraqi government is not doing enough to assist with its displaced citizens at conference in sweden in late may 2008 the maliki government apparently made pledge of 195 million to assist the displaced14 the international compact with iraq annual report states that in addition to 25 million transferred to syria lebanon and jordan to support iraqi refugees the government of iraq has allocated 195 million to support voluntary returnees details have not been made available confirming the timetable and how the funding will be distributed although this report says the funding is for emergency costs and housing rehabilitation15 the united states unhcr and other international partners are working with the government of iraq to assess what policies and programs are in place to accommodate returns and what will be required once conditions permit voluntary returns to begin in the meantime some experts believe that the sectarian groups have tried not only to consolidate territory but also to fill the gap as protector and provider in the provision of services the government cannot fulfill for the displaced16 relatively few international humanitarian organizations are working in iraq because of the unstable security situation there are 32 humanitarian international ngos with programs in iraq some operating through implementing partners those that are there keep very low profile since 2003 it is reported that 94 aid workers have been killed 86 kidnaped 245 injured and 24 arrested17 iraqi refugees in neighboring countries18 overview since 2003 iraqs neighbors have willingly or unwillingly absorbed approximately 2 million refugees fleeing violence and instability in their home country jordan and syria have been the primary destination for the displaced and by all accounts both countries have been stretched thin in trying to provide adequate services for largely unwanted refugee populations although the plight of many 14 reuters foundation us says iraq should promote refugees return

specialist in middle eastern affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division crs7 iraqis refugees is difficult but not dire there is much concern that the situation could deteriorate over time if the existing refugee populations remain for prolonged period or if new waves of refugees flood iraqs neighbors beyond the dire humanitarian consequences of scattering nearly 10 of iraqs prewar population into neighboring countries lie the longterm impact of this large scale displacement on the geopolitics of the middle east many iraqis have indicated that they will never return home raising questions over their future status in their new homes will iraqs neighbors move toward integrating refugees into the citizenry at large or will iraqis be treated as secondclass citizens and form permanent underclass similar to the situation of palestinian refugees will iraqis become politically active in their host countries and form diaspora organizations or will they be barred from politics altogether driving the most extreme elements to pursue radical causes will sectarian violence spill over from iraq into neighboring states bringing an added element of instability into an already volatile region profile of the displaced of those who have fled iraq various reports indicate that many refugees were from iraqs now decimated middle class numerous interviews of iraqi refugees conducted outside iraq have revealed that iraqi professionals who fled the country were the least sectarian elements in society and many fled to escape both the general threat of sectarian violence and the specific threat of kidnapping which has become common criminal enterprise conducted by insurgents and organized gangs table 3 iraqi refugees in neighboring countries country refugee estimates

been short of funding staff and resources and therefore unable to process all refugee documentation and adequately monitor borders it is relying on host governments to record refugee inflows unlike other refugee crises in wartorn areas the status of iraqi refugees in neighboring states is more difficult to discern at present there are makeshift tent cities for the homeless and destitute though aid agencies did construct such facilities in 2003 in anticipation of refugee crisis that did not materialize while iraqis refugees are far from being assimilated into their host country they have blended into urban areas settling into cities like amman and damascus many iraqis who fled the crs8 country beforeafter the us invasion had some temporary means of supporting themselves either through their personal savings or remittances from relatives abroad wealthy bath party members and supporters of the saddam hussein regime who fled to jordan in 2003 were dubbed mercedes refugees by the diplomatic community and the press19 nevertheless aid workers assert that the newer waves of iraqis who crossed the border are progressively poorer than their predecessors and prioritizing those most in need of assistance has become more critical aid workers note that because the iraqi refugee population has blended into urban areas they are harder to identify document and assist there are many challenges that face iraqi refugees living abroad aside from the social isolation that accompanies their separation from family and tribe iraqis may face discrimination and disdain from citizens who view them as competition for jobs and access to strained social welfare services unemployment was already high in syria and jordan before the iraqis arrival and both countries bar them from legally working during their stay access to affordable healthcare is difficult for most refugees without significant personal savings forcing many new arrivals to turn to international aid agencies some estimate that hundreds of thousands of iraqi children are not attending public school while in exile according to one aid worker we are finding that lot of participants in the youth programs were running very high number sometimes up to 30 percent per class are illiterate or close to illiterate20 moreover syria jordan and lebanon are not state parties to the 1951 united nations convention relating to the status of refugees andor its 1967 protocol which makes unhcrs role more difficult as the term refugee and the protection mandates recognized under international law are not formally recognized in these countries21 us and international assistance international response assistance mission for iraq unami despite the devastating bombing of its baghdad compound five years ago in august 2003 the united nations has been central actor in helping to address iraqs humanitarian situation and has taken on growing role in political reconciliation and economic reconstruction the

forthcoming particularly towards the emergency and other humanitarian appeals but some consider the response to be inadequate24 at the donors conference the iraqi government pledged 25 million to assist iraqi refugees in neighboring countries25 payment of 15 million was made to syria and 2 million to lebanon jordan did not accept direct payment and instead the money was recently contributed to

with local agencies in part because of the security situation and limited access in iraq ofda is continuing its work with host communities number of which are feeling the strain and finding it hard to cope with the extra burden of the increasing numbers ofdas strategy has been to support the host to help meet their needs and so they in turn can maintain their capacity for helping idps activities

of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 june 3 2008 issues for congress voluntary returns to iraq some argue that the returns mainly by refugees to iraq in late 2007 were due to improved security others contend that it was more about politics and pressure felt by the iraqi government to demonstrate progress and sustain confidence in reduced violence and by the united states to show the critical and positive impact of the troop surge unhcr has stated that it does not consider current conditions in iraq to be conducive for voluntary returns program due primarily to concerns about security and protection for returnees and the lack of capacity on the ground to implement returns program reports indicate up to 70 of those who did return to baghdad could not resettle in their own homes either because someone else was living there or because the ethnic composition of the neighborhood made it unsafe some experts do not believe the iraqi modm has the resources and competency to be effective and that preparation and coordination mechanisms need to be put in place for potential largescale returns forcible returns it is reported that some iraqis have been forced to return to iraq for example iraqis arrested in lebanon were given the option of voluntary deportationand crs18 could choose to either stay in jail or return to iraq46 reportedly countries in europe have sent iraqis back mainly to the kurdishcontrolled north which has been regarded by some as sufficiently stable for returns47 however while unhcr and others in the humanitarian community view iraq as currently inhospitable to returns program the problem highlights the difficult balance countries need to strike in being open to asylum seekers fulfilling their obligations and helping those who want to resettle in third countries with consideration of the particular status of those applying the resources within the countrys communities and the need for burdensharing between states on overall resettlement programs capacity of the iraqi government some of iraqs neighbors have quietly expressed their displeasure over perceived lack of support from the iraqi government for its own citizens who have fled abroad some officials and aid workers have asserted that iraqs 25 million pledge in 2007 and delays in payment of this pledge until mid 2008 to assist iraqi refugees in neighboring states was an indication of the maliki governments unwillingness to seriously assist its own people other experts believe that there may be sectarian dimension to the majority shiite iraqi governments behavior over 60 of iraqis in jordan and syria are sunni muslims48 in the june 2008 fy2008 and fy2009 emergency supplemental congress raised concerns about the level of resources the government of iraq has so far dedicated to assisting iraqi refugees and idps other experts have suggested that the modm lacks capacity on the ground and its ability to respond to the displacement crisis must be addressed increased international funding unhcr and other experts say that more international aid in the form of contributions and program development is required for host countries domestic ngos and for organizations providing assistance such as unhcr it is often difficult for international ngos to register in these countries and greater access needs to be negotiated unhcr is short of funds and cannot provide adequate assistance or protection to iraqi refugees in its findings the iraq study group isg refers specifically to the dramatic increase in population displacement that could cause further destabilization both in iraq and the region and contribute to humanitarian crisis specifically the isg suggests that the united states should take the lead in funding assistance requests from the unhcr and other humanitarian agencies recommendation 6649 some argue that bringing pressure to bear on other donors to participate in these relief efforts either by funding unhcrs current supplemental appeal for iraqi refugees 46 migration policy institute the iraqi refugee crisis the need for action january 2008 47 amnesty international iraq rhetoric and reality the iraqi refugee crisis june 2008 p 2830 48 see iraqis in jordan their numbers and characteristics norwegian research institute fafo in syria unhcr estimates that 67 of registered iraqi refugees are sunni muslims 49 the iraq study group report p 58 crs19 or by providing bilateral funding to host countries with specific allocations to iraqi refugees could make measurable difference in the humanitarian situation developing on the ground us humanitarian response in iraq determining the immediate steps the united states can take with regard to iraqi idps in particular and in more general sense to the iraqi refugees and how other international partners could be involved may prove to be critical in the next phase of the us iraq strategy iraqs internal population displacement appears to have created humanitarian crisis that may be beyond the current capacity on the ground difficult decisions lie ahead including identifying who should be in charge of any comprehensive relief effort bringing together key players and working out coordination strategy whether or not the modm has the resources and competence to be effective remains to be seen in the long term but in the immediate circumstance it is reportedly overwhelmed it is not clear what role the us military might play in the humanitarian response on local level in iraq and whether the provincial reconstruction teams prts may be an immediate resource to consider competing aid and budget priorities amid efforts to tackle rising us budget deficits by among other measures slowing or reducing discretionary spending or finding the resources to sustain us aid pledges may be difficult when disasters require immediate emergency relief the administration may fund pledges by depleting most worldwide disaster contingency accounts in order to respond to future humanitarian crises however these resources would need to be replenished if not replenished us capacity to respond to other emergencies could be curtailed donor fatigue is also an issue with some experts concerned about funding priorities and the ongoing need for resources for other disaster areas in the case of iraq with humanitarian crisis at hand the question of whether sufficient funds have been requested by the administration for potential crisis remains some are also concerned about whether the us government should continue to fund the humanitarian needs of displaced iraqis through supplemental appropriations with likely budgetary gap at hand some believe the united states has greater responsibility to lead the way on committing funds to address the needs of iraqi refugees and idps they argue that if the united states increased its funding and resettlement numbers this would encourage other countries in the region and more broadly in the international community to do the same for broader political reasons finding balance on burdensharing with the international community may be unique in the iraq context links to broader iraq policy with respect to the possible repatriation of iraqi refugees the refugee admissions report to congress states it is hoped that significant numbers of iraqi refugees located throughout the middle east and europe will soon be able to return home although the security situation will remain an important consideration in crs20 repatriation50 while reduced violence is likely to enable more returns it is not clear whether there are policy implications for refugee resettlement at present and whether when viewed as temporary situation the obligation by the united states to resettle iraqi refugees becomes less pressing in addition there is some concern that if among those determined to be most vulnerable and in need proportionally more christian iraqis are resettled in the united states than muslim iraqis this could contribute to the perception of preference granted to groups of one religion over another the question of granting preference to vulnerable iraqis and iraqis who are at risk because they have worked for or been closely associated with the us government including the us military may also have unforseen consequences some have questioned whether it may create resentment among iraqis seeking resettling who do not qualify for preferential treatment others have asked whether iraqis will see collaboration with the united states as means to resettle in the united states and therefore will be eager to take advantage of any opportunity to do so 50 proposed refugee admissions for fiscal year 2007 report to the congress p 40 crs21 appendix iraqs history of
