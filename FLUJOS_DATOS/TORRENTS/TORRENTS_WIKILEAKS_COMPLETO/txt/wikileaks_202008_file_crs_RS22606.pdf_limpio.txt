horizontal merger approval process edward vincent murphy government and finance division february 15 2007 abstract regulatory agencies focus on several economic criteria to evaluate proposed merger first they deﬁne the market according to likely substitution patterns by consumers and calculate the industry concentration merger is less likely to be approved if it would result in signiﬁcant and nontransitory price changes ie market power even if the merger would result in market power the merger may be approved if the market is contestable that is if new ﬁrms could and likely would enter and compete cognizable eﬃciency meaning an eﬃciency that is neither vague nor speculative is another factor that could allow ﬁrms to merge even if market power results if ﬁrm or division would likely fail anyway the agencies may permit the merger in summation the antitrust enforcement agencies balance likely anticompetitive costs of the proposed merger against likely eﬃciency

department of justice doj jointly enforce antitrust laws that cover mergers and acquisitions of large companies initially firms seeking merger notify the agencies of their intent and provide information on their products and industries consumers competitors and other interested part ies may also notify the enforcement agencies of their concerns if the enforcement agencies determine full review is warranted they acquire more detailed information from the merging firms regulatory agencies focus on several economic criteria to evaluate proposed merger first they define the market according to likely substitution patterns by consumers and calculate the industry concentration merger is less likely to be approved if it would result in significant and nontransitory price changes ie market power even if the merger would result in market power the merger may be approved if the market is contestable that is if new firms could and likely would enter and compete cognizable efficiency meaning an efficiency that is neither vague nor speculative is another factor that could allow firms to merge even if market power results if firm or division would likely fail anyway the

mergers in some industries have reached historically high levels for example businessweek reports that merger mania is sweeping through the pharmaceutical industry1 more than 1000 biotech medical device and pharmaceutical companies worth 136 billion were acquired in 2006 the economic effects of mergers and the role that federal agencies play in approving mergers have frequently been the subject of congressional oversight this report examines the economic factors that are applied in the approval process for horizontal mergers the term horizontal refers to firms at the same point in the production process for example parts of goods are often produced separately and then brought to another firm for assembly if two firms that purchased parts and then assembled vacuum cleaners wished to merge they would be considered horizontal firms in the vacuum assembly industry extending this example vertical merger refers to the merger of vacuum cleaner assembly firm and firm that manufactures some of the parts for vacuum cleaners approval of proposed horizontal mergers focuses on five economic criteria 1 market definition 2 competitive effects 3 barriers to entry by new firms 4 cognizable efficiencies 2 and 5 failing firms or divisions the federal trade commission ftc and the department of justice doj jointly enforce the antitrust laws the clayton act prohibits mergers that may substantially lessen competition or create monopoly 3 section 7a of the clayton act often called the hartscottrodino hsr act requires prior notification of large mergers to both the ftc and doj4 the regulatory agencies have joint authority over all subject areas but generally divide cases between them according relative expertise in similar cases g10g152g155g146g163g152g151g157g138g149g561g15g142g155g144g142g155g561g3g153g153g155g152g159g138g149g561g18g155g152g140g142g156g156g561 in general the approval process starts with firms providing the two regulatory agencies premerger notification and relevant information the agencies examine the information and if they have concerns issue second information request this socalled second sweep often requires detailed uptodate data because second sweeps can impose significant costs in both time and money the regulatory agencies encourage parties to discuss potential issues with agency personnel during the preapproval process so that second sweeps can be narrowly tailored to the most relevant information 5 hot documents are another important elemen t in triggering second sweeps hot documents refer to instances in which third parties provide documents that predict mergerrelated anticompetitive effects6 hot documents often claim that the merger will result in higher prices 1 arlene

reasonably claims other anticompetitive effects such as likelihood that the merger could delay adding new productive capacity or reduce innovation

effects of mergers can be found in horizontal merger guidelines issued jointly april 2 1992 the guidelines state the unifying theme of the horizontal merger guidelines is that mergers should not be permitted to create or enhance market power or to facilitate its exercise 7 market power is defined as the ability of firms to raise prices above the competitive level for significant time or lower prices if the merging firms are buyers rather than sellers analysis of market power focuses on market definition competitive effects entry barriers cognizable efficiencies and failing firms g15g138g155g148g142g157g561g6g142g143g146g151g146g157g146g152g151g561 defining the relevant market and determining concentration requires an analysis of the products of the merging parties although use of general market definitions and concentration levels such as the classifications used by the bureau of economic analysis bea may be acceptable for the initial premerger notification second sweep often involves more detailed information on the firms specific products and potential substitutes economists in the regulatory agencies use the information to estimate the likelihood and ability of consumers to respond to small increases in the price of the firms products the market includes available substitutes even if they are not in the same bea classification for example the substitutes for short distance airshuttle service may include bus line rather than national airline the antitrust regulatory agencies consider several factors when calculating market concentration ratios and examining consumer reactions to price changes 8 evidence that buyers have shifted purchases in response to pricequality in the past evidence that sellers conduct their business assuming consumers are flexible evidence of competition in related sectors and industries and evidence of substantial costs to switching products 7 federal trade commission and department of justice horizontal merger

definitions than observers would expect9 to determine the scope of the relevant market analysts use the term ssnip small but significant and nontransitory increases in price ssnip refers to the smallest grouping of products for which hypothetical monopolist could raise price 5 in the case of ice cream the ssnip differentiated super premium ice cream from standard ice cream even though there are many regional ice cream brands the ftc ordered divestiture between dreyers and nestle because it determined that the market for super premium ice cream was concentrated

mergers which can be counterintuitive for example there is some evidence that nonmerging firms in an industry may gain more than merging firms do 10 if market data is available agency analysts may estimate the ownprice elasticity and the crossprice elasticity of demand ownprice elasticity refers to the percentage change in quantity demanded for percentage change in the same products price crossprice elasticity refers to the percentage change in quantity demanded for one product for percentage change in the price of another product the merger approval process includes consideration of competitive effects in the industry as whole not just the two merging firms the ability to raise prices is common focus of evaluating anticompetitive effects for example wave of mergers in the petroleum industry in the late 1990s raised concerns about competition in that industry when exxon corporation and mobil oil proposed merger in 1999 the ftc evaluated the firms in each product market that they competed william baer director of the ftcs bureau of competition at the time testified to the house commerce committee subcommittee on energy and power that the commission examined the effects of every oil and gas merger for 20 years 11 the analysis ultimately resulted in permitting exxon and mobil to merge g4g138g155g155g146g142g155g156g561g157g152g561g7g151g157g155g162g561 if merger is expected to affect market power then the regulatory agencies determine whether the market is contestable contestable market is one without substantial barriers to entry if the market is contestable the agencies will consider how likely it is that new suppliers could compete with the merging firms if they tried to exercise market power if it is unlikely that the merging firms could sustain price increases then the regulatory agencies may approve the merger even if it temporarily concentrates the industry 12 lack of barriers to entry played an important part in deciding an aftermarket care automotive merger in july 1985 the ftc permitted echlin inc to acquire borgwarner corp because the 9 shawn ulrick horizontal merger guidelines before the international industrial

would increase economic efficiency firms often attempt to improve efficiency by rearranging their internal procedures however the regulatory agencies recognize that merger may encourage efficiency by allowing firms to look externally for ways to better allocate their productive resources to facilitate merger approval any resulting efficiencies must be merger specific and cognizable 14 by cognizable the regulatory agencies mean that efficiency claims can not rely on vague or speculative assertions cognizable efficiencies formed the basis for approval of the genzymenovazyme merger15 these firms were the only companies trying to develop treatment for rare disease pompe the merger resulted in the formation of monopoly the ftc approved the merger because it was convinced knowledgesharing between the two scientific re search labs provided better chance of developing cure for the disease the commission weighed the costs of reduced competition against the benefits of shared knowledge g8g138g146g149g146g151g144g561g8g146g155g150g156g561g152g155g561g6g146g159g146g156g146g152g151g156g561 the regulatory agencies may approve merger that might otherwise be prevented if one of the firms is failing or division of firm is failing one argument for allowing this failingfirm defense is that even if the merger is prevented the market would still become more concentrated if other firm acquires the firm or division in asserting the failingfirm defense parties try to demonstrate that the failing firm 1 would not meet its financial obligations in the near future 2 is not viable chapter 11 candidate 3 made good faith effort to secure reasonable offers from other sources and 4 or divisions assets would exit the market if the merger is prevented the failing firm defense has critics on january 24 2007 congress heard testimony on the failing firm defense in the context of airline mergers consumer advocates argued that the failing firm defense should be limited to an industry that is otherwise competitive and exhibits healthy competitive structure 16 the ftc held hearings on competition policy during the clinton administration an antitrust mergers practitioner argued that merger policy should distinguish between acquisitions intending to infuse capital to compete vigorously in the industry and acquisitions designed to passively maintain revenue stream17 13

the process of approving corporate mergers has two stages in the initial stage merging parties notify the ftc and doj of their intentions and attempt to provide enough market information to avoid the costs of second sweep if the agencies decide to investigate further then detailed market information is used to determine likely increases in sustainable market power if any in examining sustainable market power the regulatory agencies focus on market definition competitive effects market contestability cognizable efficiencies and failing firms for an example of the merger application process in
