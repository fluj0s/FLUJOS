legislation notwithstanding the existence of many federal privacy laws and several state initiatives and laws there is perception held by consumers privacy advocates and some legislators and regulators that there is need for federal online privacy law to regulate the collection use and disclosure of onlin personal information the crux of the online privacy debate is whether industry selfregulation of online personal information through imp lementation of privacy policies is effective or whether uniform national law to regulate the privacy of online personal information should exist the federal trade commission has extensively studied this question and issued series of reports to congress14 initially the commission prefe rred selfregulatory approach to online privacy through adoption and adhere nce to privacy policies in its 2000 report to congress however majority of the co mmission 32 concluded that notwithstanding measurable gains selfregula tion alone was unlikely to provi online consumers with an adequate level of protecti on and recommended that cong ress consider online privacy legislation to supplement selfregulatory methods in 2001 the new ftc chairman timothy muris announced new pro privacy agenda including greater ftc regulatory efforts to enforce both online and offline privacy promises in april 2002 chairman muris wrote that enactment of broad genera l legislation governing online privacy issues is premature at this time in light of the ftcs new proprivacy agenda15 online privacy legislation based upon core fair information practice principles attempts to provide solutions to privacy problems posed by online personal information fair information practice principles were first articulated in the united states department of health education and welfares 1973 report entitled records computers and the rights of citizens since then canon of fair info rmation practice principles has been developed16 fair information practice codes include five core principles 1 noticeawareness 2 choiceconsent 3 accessparticipation 4 integritysecurity and 5 enforcementredress the most funda mental principle is that consumers should be given notice of an entitys information practices before any personal information is collected the second widely accepted core principle is consumer choice or consent which means giving consumers options as to how any personal information collected from them may be used access is the third core principle and refers to an individuals ability both to access data about herself and to contest that datas accuracy the fourth principle is that data be accurate and secure the fifth principle is that an effective enforcement andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21221crs6 17 see hearings on s

alternative approaches are industry selfregulation legisl ation that would create privat remedies for consumers or regulatory schemes enforceable th rough civil and criminal sanctions in the 107th congress there are several bills which regulate online personal information differences among the bills re late to the requireme nts established for sensitive vs nonsensitive personal information the type of notice required whether individuals have the opportunity to optin or to optout of disclosures whether optout or optin depends upon whether the disclosure is for financial consider ation whether or not individuals are given right to sue for violations whether the bill applies to online businesses alone offline busine sses or both whether federa l preemption applies and if so whether the bill preempts all state privacy laws or only state st atutes but not state common laws whether enforcement is through the ftc and state attorneys general or through industry selfregulati on and
