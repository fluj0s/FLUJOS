needy families tanf for five years congress has inconclusively deba ted longterm tanf authorizations since 2002 instead adopting shortterm extensions the latest extension pl 10919 funds the program through december 31 2005 thus far in the 109th congress the senate finance committee has reported s 667 srept 10951 bill introduced by house republican leaders hr 240 has received approval from the house ways and means committees subcommittee on human resources s 667 and hr 240 are very similar in terms of how they would continue funding under the tanf program both b ills extend basic tanf funding at current levels 166 billion for the 50 states the di strict of columbia and the territories through fy2010 and extend supplemental gr ants provided to 17 states through fy2009 both bills provide new categorical grants for marriage promotion activities totaling 200 million per year financed thr ough reduction in current tanf bonuses to states the major difference in the tanf funding provisions of the two bills is how they provide extra contingency recessi onrelated funding to the states hr 240 essentially extends the cu rrent law fund that provides matching grants to states experiencing high and increased unemplo yment rates and food stamp caseloads s 667 eliminates the requirement that st ates expend additional money to access contingency funds and instead bases extra funding on the cost of increased caseloads for states that meet revised unemplo yment or food stamp caseload criteria the two bills would substantially revise the tanf work participation standards that states must meet under current law 50 of tanf families with an adult or minor household head must participate t hough the 50 rate is reduced by caseload reductions that have occurred since welfar reform both s 667 and hr 240 would raise this standard to 70 though under both bills the standard could be reduced through credits though the credits differ betw een the two bills both also eliminate separate 90 participation rate requirement for twoparent families both bills would raise the minimum hours required of fa mily members in order to be considered full participants though hr 240 would rais them by more than would s 667 the bills also differ in the activities countable toward the participa tion standards hr 240 narrows the list of activities countable re quiring recipients to spend at least 24 hours in work community service or work experience programs except for short usually threemonth period when states may themselves define what counts as activities s 667 keeps all activities unde r current law as countable and allows states to count wider range of ac tivities for three mont hs more under some circumstances both bills contain nontanf provisions relating to child support enforcement responsible fatherhood programs nd transitional medical assistance not addressed herein this report will be updated as s 667 and hr 240 move through the legislative

current law s 667 and hr 240 tanf provisions introduction the 109th congress is considering legislation to reauthorize the block grant of temporary assistance for needy families tanf for five years the 108th congress and its predecessor the 107th congress both inconclusively debated long term authorization for tanf and relate d programs the program has received 11 shortterm extensions since the original funding authority for tanf expired on september 30 2002 the latest extension pl 10968 funds the program through december 31 2005 the senate finance committee has reporte d an original bill s 667 srept 10951 hr 240 introduced by house re publican leaders and making its way through house committees of jurisdiction is similar to bills that passed the house in 2002 and 2003 that bill was appr oved by the house ways and means committees subcommittee on human res ources on march 15 and awaits full committee action as well as considera tion by other committees that have jurisdictions over parts of the bill1 summary of the similarities and differences between the two bills s 667 and hr 240 have many similar ities with both extending basic tanf funding at current levels through fy 2010 and incorporating president bushs proposal to provide categorical marriage promotion grants both bills also raise tanf work participation standards t hough the two differ in terms of how much more work would be required and what activities count toward the participation standards this report provides compar ison of the tanf provisions of s 667 and hr 240 it does not address nontanf provisions of both bills such as revisions to the child care and development f und child support enforcement abstinence education and transitional medicaid one of the key differences between s 667 and hr 240 is the level of funding for child care s 667 would add 6 billion over fivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32834crs2 years to current levels of mandatory child care funding hr 240 would add 1 billion over five years above current vels of mandatory child care funding tanf funding provisions s 667 and hr 240 have very similar funding provisions although they do differ in some details the major differe nce in the funding provision between the two bills is that s 667 would completely revamp the tanf contingency recession funds while hr 240 would make rela tively minor revisions to the fund basic funding the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 entitled states to basic tanf block grant equal to peak expenditures in the pre1996 welfare programs during the fy1992 to fy1995 period it also established maintenance of effort moe requirement that stat continue to spend at least 75 80 if state failed tanf work participation requirements of what they spent in these programs in fy1994 cash welfare caseloads were at their peak in th mid1990s both the basic tanf grant and the moe are legislatively fixed they did not change when cash welfare caseloads declined in the mid and late1990s nor did they increase when caseloads in some st ates increased during the recent economic slump neither the basic tanf block grant nor the mo have been adjusted for inflation both s 667 and hr 240 would continue both the basic block grant and the moe at their current funding levels w ithout inflation or caseload adjustment through fy2010 supplemental grants during the consideration of legislation that led to the 1996 welfare law fixed funding based on historical expenditures was thought to disadvantage two groups of states 1 those that experi ence relatively high population growth and 2 those that had hi storically low gran t levels relative to poverty in the state therefore additional funding in the form of supplemental grants was provided to states that met criteria of high population growth andor low historic grants per poor person supplemental gran ts have been provided to 17 states alabama alaska arizona arkansas colo rado florida georgia idaho louisiana mississippi montana new xico nevada north carolin tennessee texas and utah currently supplemental grants total 319 million per year both s 667 and hr 240 would continue supplemental grants for the same 17 states at the current funding level through fy2009 unlike ot her grants which expire in fy2010 contingency funds the fixed basic grant under tanf also led to concerns of inadequate funding dur ing economic downturns t anf includes contingency fund which is designed to provi extra matching grants to states that meet criteria of economic need based on unemployment rates and food stamp caseloads and have state expenditures in excess of their fy1994 level the two bills differ substantially in their revisions to the tanf contingency fund hr 240 would continue the fund on existing rules with some relatively minor modifications allowing some dditional state spending to count towardhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32834crs3 meeting the fy1994 funding level threshold nd modifications to increase grants for states that qualify for funds for only part of the year s 667 fully revamps the contingency f und it would eliminate the requirement that states increase expenditures from thei r own funds above the regular tanf moe level and eliminate the matching requirements instead it requires that unspent tanf balances be below certain threshol d to qualify for contingency funds s 667 would base contingency grants on portion of the estimated cost of increased cash assistance caseloads it also would revise the criteria of economic need for state uses of grants and program requirements federal tanf grants and moe funds can be used for wide range of benefits services and activities to assist lowincome families with children and to further tanf goals of reducing outof wedlock births and promoting twoparent families tanf grants can also be transferred to other block gr ant programs up to 30 of the grant can be transferred to the child care and development fund ccdf and to the social services block grant the limit on transfers to ssb g alone is set at 425 though annual appropriations have restored the ssbg tran sfer limit to its original limit of 10 set in the 1996 welfare law within the overall 30 limit federa l tanf funds may also be used as the state match for fede ral reverse commuter grants if the program benefits welfare families both bills would set the ssbg transfer limit permanently at 10 hr 240 would raise the overall transfer limit to 50 s 667 would retain the current 30 transfer limit both bills include provisions to ease so rules regarding use of tanf funds both s 667 and hr 240 would allow states to use carryover tanf funds for any tanf benefit and service current law restricts the use of carryover funds for the provision of assistance narrow the definition of assistance to exclude all child care and transportation aid tanf funds spent on assistance trigger certain program requirements such as work requirements time limits assignment of child support pa yments and data reporting requirements under current regulations child care and transportation aid for nonworking families is counted as assistance and triggers these requirements the bills would eliminate such aid from the definition of assistance freeing from these requirements nonworking families that receive onl child care or transportation aid work requirements both s 667 and hr 240 incorporate the bush administrations universal engagement proposal which requires states to develop selfsuffi ciency plan for all tanf adult recipients to monitor progress toward that plan hr 240 also requireshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32834crs4 states to end benefits full family sanction for families that fail to comply with work participation rules both s 667 and hr 240 would substantia lly revise tanf work participation standards both bills would raise work participation standards that states must meet from the current laws standard of 50 to 70 raise the required hours of working to receive full credit and pr ovide partial credit for par ticipating families that do not meet the full credit standard and revise the list of activities that recipients may participate in for states to receive credit toward tanf standards however the bills differ in how they do these three things participation standards current law requires states to have specified percentage of their families with an adult recipient or minor head of household participating in creditable work activities the current participation standard is 50 states are subject to an additional participation rate standard for twoparent families currently 90 the participation rate standards may be reduced for caseload reductions not attributable to policy changes that occurred before enactment of welfare reform fy1995 this caseload re duction credit has had large effect on participation standards reducing the standard considerably from its statutory rate in fy2003 the standard was reduced to 0 for 20 states both s 667 and hr 240 raise the work participation standa rd for all families to 70 by fy2010 and eliminate the separate standard for twoparent families both bills also change the credits that reduce these standards from their statutory rate ie reduce the 70 standard to lower rate but they do so in different ways hr 240 retains but revises the current law caseload reduction credit so that caseload change is measured from more recent year rath er than the prewelfare reform caseload level of 1995 ultima tely caseload reduction would be measured based on the most recent four years the house bill also includes provision to give an add itional credit to states that achieved caseloa d reduction of 60 or more from fy1995 to fy2001 s 667 retains the current caseload reduction credit for fy2006 and fy2007 but beginning in fy2008 would replace the caseload reduction credit with credit for employed welfare leavers the bill would also cap all credits against the participation standard so that the minimum effective standard would be 10 in fy2006 20 in fy2007 30 in fy2008 40 in fy2009 and 50 in fy2010 there is such minimum effective standard in hr 240 hours standards current law requires that family be considered participating only if it par ticipates for minimum number of hours per week in month under current law 20 hours is requi red for single parents with preschool child under the age of 6 and 30 hours is required for other families higher hours are set for the purposes of the two parent work par ticipation rate both s 667 and hr 240 raise the hours st andards hr 240 incorporates 40 hour workweek standard for full credit but would also provide partial credit for families with at least 24 hours of participation special lowerhour standard would be provided for single parents with preschoolershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32834crs5 s 667 also raises the hours standard for full credit but to lesser extent than proposed in the housepassed bill single parents with preschool child would be given full credit for participation at 24 hours per week and other singleparent families would be given full credit at 34 hours per week par tial credit for single parent families would be pr ovided at 20 hours per week higher hours requirements would apply to twoparent families creditable activities current law lists 12 activ ities that may be counted toward tanf work participa tion standards the bulk of countable pa rticipation is in subset of core activities focuse d on work timelimited job search countable for six weeks in fiscal year 12 weeks if criteria of economic need are met time limited vocational educational training 12 months in lifetime and community service and work experience in meeting the general 30hourperweek standard hours in educational activities are c ountable only for families who are also participating in at least 20 hours per w eek of core activities postsecondary education other than that considered vocational educationa l training does not count toward current law federal t anf work participation standards hr 240 and s 667 differ significantly on the types of activities countable as core activities toward the par ticipation standards hr 240 narrows the list of core activities by eliminating job search and voca tional education instead the bill would give states almost total discretion to fine activities that w ould be countable for three months in 24month period four mont hs to complete training but once those months are exhausted the only activitie s that would count toward the work participation standards are work onthej ob training community service or work experience moreover ce job search and vocational education would be countable as sole or primary activities only during the three or four months that the state would have discretion any w eeks of participation in j ob search reduce the number of weeks that vocational education counts toward th participation standards on the other hand s 667 retains the current law list of core activities it too provides states additional di scretion by permitting states to count an expanded list of activities for three months in 24month period longer for rehabilitative activities however this additional disc retion is provided in addition to rather than instead of six weeks of job search and 12 months of vocational educational training which are retained as core activities both hr 240 and s 667 would give st ates additional discretion in defining activities countable once fa mily has met the core work requirement generally 24 hours per week in core activities hr 240 would allow states to define activities for families with at least 24 hours in core activities s 667 would allow states to count an expanded set of ac tivities for singleparent fa milies with at least 24 hours per week in core activities s 667 includes some additional options for counting particip ation in activities toward tanf work standards it would allow states to have up to 10 of their caseload enrolled in special program of two or fouryear undergraduate education or vocational educational trai ning this program is modeled after the parents as scholars program that s operated in maine using tanf moe funds it also allows for participation in rehabilitative activities for disabled persons includinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32834crs6 treatment of drug and alcohol abuse if they combine rehabilitation with at least 10 hours of core activities and if the stat develops collaborative relationship between agencies and entities providing rehabilitative services and the state tanf agency additionally s 667 allows caring for disabled family member to count as work activity under certain circumstances marriage promotion grants and family formation issues current law allows states to use t anf funds for any activity reasonably calculated to achieve tanf purpose one of the statutory purposes of tanf is to end dependency of needy parents on government benef its and one of the stated means to end such dependency is marriag another of the statutory purposes of tanf is to promote the formation and maintenance of twoparent families promoting marriage is currently allowable use of tanf funds both s 667 and hr 240 would carve out special marriage promotion grants from existing tanf funding both bills include 100 million in competitively awarded matching funds for states territo ries and tribes for marriage promotion activities the bills would allow states to use other federal tanf funds or state funds as the match for these new marriage promotion grants both bills also would provide an additional 100 million for research and demonstrations hr 240 would require th at these funds be used primarily for marriage promotion s 667 would require that 80 of these funds be used for marriage promotion marriage promotion activities listed in both bills are public advertising campaigns on the value of marriage and skills needed to increase marital stability and health education in high schools on the va lue of marriage marriage education and marriage and relationship skills programs for nonmarried parents or expectant parents premarital ducation on marriage for engaged couples marriage enhancement and marriage skills training for married couples divorce education programs and marriage mentor ing programs programs to reduce the disincentives to marriage in needbased programs could be funded from these grants only if offered in conjunction with other marriage activities although the two bills provide simila r funding for marriage promotion activities they differ significantly in the details of their provisions authorizing these grants s 667 has additional language requiring that orga nizations familiar with domestic violence issues be consulted in developing marriage pr omotion projects and language to clarify that marriage promoti on activities are to be voluntary s 667 also prohibits states from sanctioning recipi ents who do not participate in marriage promotion activities other tanf provisions both s 667 and hr 240 would make add itional amendments to tanf provisions regarding state plans data repo rting tribal tanf programs and other provisions of tanf law these provi sions are included in the detailed billhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32834crs7 comparison table shown below among the other tanf provisions addressed in the reauthorization bills hr 240 as amended by the h ouse ways and means subcommittee on human resources would require states to conduct drug tests on applicants and recipients of tanf assistance if the state believes the individual has recently used drugs positive drug tests would lead to required sanction of the familys benefit potentially ending benefits to the family for up to three years s 667 includes authorizations for additional specialpurpose categorical grants other than marriage promotion grants that would be added to the tanf block grant these grants include those to allow states to operate programs to purchase cars transitional jobsbusiness link grants for model employment and training programs for tanf recipients with barriers grants for organizations that create selfsustaining
