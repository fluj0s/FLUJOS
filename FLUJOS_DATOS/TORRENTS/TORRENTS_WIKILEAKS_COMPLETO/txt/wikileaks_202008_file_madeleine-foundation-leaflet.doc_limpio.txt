what really happened to madeleine mccann 10 key reasons which suggest that she was not abducted madeleine mccann was reported missing by her mother dr kate mccann at 10pm on thursday 3rd may 2007 since then madeleine who was then nearly four has become the bestknown missing child in the world the mccanns claimed she was abducted by an abductor who has never been traced they said they were wining and dining in tapas bar 100 yards away from where they had left their three young children in their holiday apartment in praia da luz on the beautiful algarve coast the portuguese police believed the mccanns were involved in the disappearance of madeleine they were made official suspects on 7 september 2007 and remained so until july 2008 then the portuguese attorney general announced that there was insufficient evidence for any person to be charged in connection with madeleines disappearance though he added that there was evidence that madeleine was dead the mccanns spokesman clarence mitchell who used to head the governments 40strong media monitoring unit whose function mr mitchell said was to control what comes out in the media claimed that the mccanns had been cleared in october 2007 the senior detective in charge goncalo amaral was replaced claiming british government interference in his investigation few years earlier he solved another missing child case that of 8year old joana cipriano her mother and uncle were convicted for her murder having initially claimed she was abducted goncalo amaral has since written book the truth about lie showing that madeleine died in praia da luz documentary he made about madeleines death can be seen on youtube here httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvuxghlytnisw this leaflet gives 10 key reasons which suggest madeleine was not abducted it is shortened version of 64page booklet published in britain in december 2008 titled what really happened to madeleine mccann 60 reasons which suggest she was not abducted information on how to obtain this booklet is on the back of our leaflet reason 1 statistics show that the vast majority of young children reported abducted from their homes are already dead time after time when young children die or are killed in their own homes parents claim their child has really been abducted the death may be from an accident negligence neglect or deliberate act we can simply say young children are almost never kidnapped from inside their own homes the portuguese police were bound to be suspicious of the parents claims that madeleine had been abducted but these statistics though very persuasive do not prove anything so let us look at nine other reasons which suggest that she was not abducted reason 2 the worldrenowned british sniffer dogs eddie and keela detected the scent of corpse in 10 places which strongly suggested madeleine died in the mccanns holiday apartment here are the main facts about the findings of the two british springer spaniels eddie and keela they were trained by expert doghandler martin grime and are internationally famed for being able to detect the presence of corpse eddie or blood keela grime said that eddie had never ever given false alert in 200 previous outings eddie alerts only to human cadaverine the scent of human corpse this is usually only produced in corpse when the body has been dead for over 2 hours eddie alerted to the scent of corpse in the following places the living room the mccanns bedroom the veranda and the garden of their holiday apartment on two of dr kate mccanns clothes on tshirt belonging to madeleine or brother sean and on the pink soft toy cuddle cat despite the fact that dr kate mccann had already washed cuddle cat at least once eddie also detected the smell of death in the mccanns hired renault scenic car keela found blood at some of the same locations eddie and keela were taken to many other apartments and cars in praia da luz but did not alert anywhere else checks were made by the portuguese police as to whether anyone else had died in the mccanns apartment or in their car noone had neighbour made witness statement saying that for weeks she saw the mccanns hired car with its boot open all night long the dogs evidence was therefore very clear corpse had been in all those 10 locations and it could only have been the corpse of madeleine mccann reason 3 the strange reactions of the mccanns when they became aware of the sniffer dogs findings the mccanns initially reacted by desperately inventing possible explanations for the dogs findings family members claimed the death smell on dr kate mccanns clothes was due to having attended six corpses at work during the fortnight before her holiday she even claimed that the death smell on cuddle cat was because she took madeleines toy to work then they claimed the smell of death and body fluids found in the car could have come from rotting meat and dirty nappies in the boot finally they fell back on claiming the dogs findings were unreliable and valueless these explanations were offered only to the media not to the police reason 4 the sheer impossibility of the abduction scenario the mccanns have claimed that the abductor entered through an unlocked patio door found madeleine in the dark then decided to open curtains window and shutter of the childrens bedroom and climb through window 3 feet above the ground and barely 2 feet wide he is supposed to have done this without waking any of the three children according to the mccanns and their friends he must have done this within the space of 23 minutes in the dark without being seen or heard nor leaving any forensic traces like fingerprints hair fibres skin fragments shoe prints or glove marks nor any trace of abrasion marks on or around the window and windowsill this scenario is so unlikely that we can simply say this did not happen when the windowframe was examined only dr kate mccanns fingerprints were found on it reason 5 the refusal of the mccanns and their friends to help the police in september 2007 the police asked dr kate mccann 48 questions about madeleines disappearance she only answered this one are you aware that in not answering the questions you are jeopardising the investigation which seeks to discover what happened to your daughter she answered yes if thats what the investigation thinks the mccanns deleted mobile phone records and refused to allow the portuguese police to examine any of their medical or financial records including credit card records the mccanns publicly offered to take lie detector test then changed their minds the mccanns and their tapas 7 friends also refused to attend proposed police reconstruction of the events the night madeleine was reported missing yet they travelled to portugal for channel 4 film which reconstructed their own version of what happened the night madeleine was reported missing portuguese newspaper sol tried to talk to one of the mccanns friends dr david payne about what had happened he refused to talk saying this is our matter we have pact he added that all requests for quotes and interviews must go through dr gerald mccann why would the group need to have what has been called pact of silence about the circumstances surrounding madeleines disappearance reason 6 changes of story by the mccanns and their friends there have been many changes of story by the mccanns and their friends and many contradictions within their versions of events far too many to list here for example initially the mccanns claimed that an abductor forced entry to the apartment by jemmying open the shutters the police and mark warners staff examined the shutters proving this was untrue the mccanns quickly changed their story to say the abductor must have come in via the open patio door and exited through small bedroom window the description of an abductor by mccanns friend jane tanner changed several times until very recently the mccanns website described moustachioed man over 6ft tall as the probable abductor when there was evidence connecting this man seen by tourist days before madeleine was reported missing to the events the night madeleine went missing further he looks nothing like the 5 7 man described by jane tanner reason 7 the mccanns rush to appoint lawyers and pr experts immediately madeleine was reported missing the mccanns appointed many lawyers and public relations experts to help them including extradition lawyers what use would lawyers and pr experts be in finding their daughter maybe the mccanns knew from the outset that they would need lawyers and pr folk to defend them reason 8 the strange reactions of the mccanns and their friends after she claimed to have found madeleine missing what is one to make of these reactions of dr kate mccann on finding madeleine missing and stating she noticed the shutter and window open she searched the apartment for 10 minutes despite on her own evidence the probability that she was not there she left the twins in her apartment whilst she ran to the tapas bar to raise the alarm she failed to check on the twins wellbeing the first thought through most mothers minds would have been whether they could also have been interfered with in addition in the days after madeleine went missing the mccanns were apparently happy to leave the twins in the cr√®che whilst they courted the media if they were genuinely distraught by losing one child would they not stay protectively close to the two they had left the mccanns admit they never physically searched for madeleine despite the claim of jane tanner that she had seen man walking with child in certain direction the mccanns and their friends failed to organise concerted search in along the route he might have taken reason 9 making longterm plans to mark madeleines alleged abduction whilst claiming she was alive and could still be found from the early days the mccanns made plans for events to mark the day madeleine went missing sign they didnt expect to find her just month after she disappeared dr gerald mccann said we want big event to raise awareness that she is still missing it wont be one year anniversary it will be sooner than that then on 28 june 2007 he said i have doubt we will be able to sustain high profile for madeleines disappearance in the longterm the mccanns trademarked the name madeleines fund and highlighted madeleines eye defect the coloboma boasting that her eye defect was valuable marketing ploy this was against the advice of the portuguese police you can view where dr gerald mccann says this at httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvsvdnzigtf50 why make longterm plans if madeleine could be found at any time strangely madeleines eye defect doesnt figure in missing person descriptions of her on the portuguese police or interpol websites in march 2009 before parliamentary committee dr mccann claimed british media made madeleine commodity yet just fortnight after madeleine went missing he and his advisors set up website private company to raise money note not charity and produced goods for sale reason 10 dr kate mccann washing the toy cuddle cat the mccanns claimed madeleine always took her favourite soft toy cuddle cat with her they then said the abductor had handled cuddle cat placing it on high shelf or ledge the abductor could have left valuable forensic traces on the toy so why did dr kate mccann decide to thoroughly wash it something most mothers say they could never do to the soft toy of their missing child later despite dr kate mccann washing cuddle cat cadaver dog eddie detected the smell of death on it the smell of death remains on items long after they have been thoroughly cleaned what you can do now if madeleine mccann was not abducted and died in the mccanns apartment in portugal as the original senior detective in the case has very good reason to believe then those that caused or allowed her death have so far got away with it to read more about what really happened
