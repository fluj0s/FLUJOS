control 711065 1001 purpose and scope this document provides general guidance and specific operating instructions gove rning mmt operations it is not designed to cover every possible contingency and therefore does not relieve personnel from the responsibility to exercise good judgment and common sense regarding those situations not covered 1002 detachments mmt deta chments will be led by designated and certified mmt leader or detachment oic who will be solely responsible for implementation of this sop 1003 operational safety commands operational priority is combat readiness combat readiness is achieved t hrough realistic training and conservation of assets the objective is to accomplish all assigned missions without the loss of life or the serious injury of marine there is abundant opportunity to demonstrate excellence and capability while building high degree of combat readiness without compromising safety deviations from the confines of acceptable operational safety will not be tolerated mmt leaders and detachment commanders are ultimately responsible for the safety of mmt operations everyone has an individual responsibility to ensure safe operations and must carry out his duties in accordance with appropriate guidance and common sense 1004 changes changes to this sop are encouraged as mmt operations continue and new techniques and eq uipment are

mobile team tacsop chapter two general 2000 background 1 currently marine air traffic control is viable and valuable asset in the forward operating base fob concept for exten ded aviation operations ashore however the forward edge of the battle area feba is moving further away from the rear area at an ever increasing rate in the execution of the six functions of marine aviation it may become necessary to establish atc services at not only the main air base air facility and air site but also for forward arming and refueling points farps rapid ground refueling rgrs noncombatant evacuation operations neos and lagger points the mmt is task organized to provide atc support to marine aviation assets in austere andor improved landing environments 2 this concept of support for marine aviation was developed by adopting in part the mission training standards and procedures of the air force special tactics t eams stt the mmt can be dynamic force multiplier ashore that the marine air ground task force magtf commander can depend upon to enhance his offensive combat power 3 mmt training encompasses all aspects of current marine atc training and readin ess standards but focuses primarily on contingency and forward air control operations as well as emphasizing some basic marine infantry tactics mmt training responsibility resides with the detachment commander concentrated training allows for an incre ase in controller technical proficiency tactical proficiency and unit cohesion 4 the mmt provides highly responsive unit well prepared to offer solution to the command control and communications challenge presented by the maneuver element of t he aviation combat element ace and the magtf commander 2001 marine atc mobile team mission 1 the mission of the mmt is to rapidly establish and control tactical landing zones tlzs for fixedwing aircraft and helicopter landing zones hlzs in r emote and otherwise non permissive environments in support of the magtf the mmt must be able to flex from these basic missions and provide whatever services are required 2 the mmt mission includes but is not limited to the following inherent tasks tlzhlz recommendationassistance in site selection b tlzhlz limited surveys c tlzhlz marking d providing atc services at designated tlzhlz provide and operate navaids 21 marine air traffic control mobile team tacsop f coordinat ion with civil and military control agencies g develop terminal instrument procedures h provide limited weather observations i establish ground to air and point to point communications j liaison 2002 marine atc mobile team or ganization mmts are administratively and operationally maintained by the marine atc detachment commander the detachment commander will task the mmt to support unilateral joint or combined force aces for training exercises surveys contingency plans actual operations or other requirements each team consists of marine air traffic controllers navigational aids technicians and field radio operators trained and equipped for mmt operations b standard team consists of one officer and five enlisted personnel the team is of adequate size to allow for losses due to tad leave or combat without severely hampering mission accomplishment the team can be tailored to meet mission requirements by adding controllers to the team or dividing it into smaller elements typical mmt is

leader in ensuring that all areas have been fully considered 2004 opera tionsexercise all mmt operations will be conducted in accordance with applicable atc directives publications and manuals 1 methods of employment mmts may be called upon to support missions that would include variety of insertion techniques as an individual unit or more likely as part of larger force in combined operation airlanding fw rw airlanding fw operations will deliver the mmt by way of fixed wing aircraft during airlanding operations the mmt is employed with the first element into the objective area this ensures that all succeeding elements have air traffic control and navigational guidance available for safe and expeditious flow of air traffic airlanding rw operations are most common and very effect ive mmts are inserted via assault helo assets well prior to the operations so they can set up for the follow on mission 1 teams being inserted by airlanding operations may be employed from one fob to another to support variety of missions concurrently they may be transported in bounding elements as the forward line of troops flot continues to move forward teams may be transported to an area of operations in strategic airlift then reloaded into tactical aircraft for employmen t into the objective area 2 if air movement is to be fully used careful plans must be made to accomplish rapid intransit reloading under certain conditions teams configured for combat may be loaded onto the tactical aircraft that will deliver t hem directly into the objective area 3 some operations may require the mmt to be inserted by an alternate means first and have their vehicles and additional supplies airlanded at first possible chance after establishing the tlz b tactical vehicle tactical vehicle insertions are another viable means of employment each team is equipped with hmmwv and is the primary means of surface insertions when involved in combined operations utilization of other surface vehicles should not be overlooked c overland overland insertion is the least preferred method of insertion it should only be used when the tactical situation absolutely rules out all other possible means of insertion although the least preferred it should not be overlooked as viable means of insertion and should receive considerable attention in training 2 security security is paramount consideration in mmt operations equipment must be light and small enough to permit the team to use any of the methods of employment ordinarily this results in limited communication visual and electronic capability the unit should be large enough to transport all equipment effectively and provide reasonable amount of self security yet small nough to minimize risk of enemy detection 3 mmt scope the mmt provides highly responsive unit well prepared to offer solution 23 marine air traffic control mobile team tacsop to the command control and communications c3 challenge presented by the maneuver element of the ace and the m agtf commander the mmt is generally the first control agency into an aviation objective the mmt is capable of controlling lzs for fixed and rotary wing aircraft under visual meteorological conditions vmc and instrument meteorological conditions imc the mmt should be self sufficient for 72 hours without re supply or augmentation 4 mmt functions for each tactical mission involving the use of tlzhlz the mmt performs the following functions formulates and issues air traffic control clearances instructions and advisories to effect safe orderly and expeditious movement of air traffic in their area of responsibility b conducts survey of the site to determine its suitability by both the number and type of aircraft thi s is usually hasty survey because most mmts are not trained in the use of survey equipment if deliberate survey is required the mwss has personnel trained to do this depending on the location stt at pope air force base has catalog of airfield rveys and possible tlz locations from around the globe the contact information is located in chapter six c marks the tlzhlz as the mission dictates d establishes control point from which to exercise air traffic control establishes control zone around each tlz and controls all air traffic within this area under vfr and ifr conditions which may be extended to non radar approach control services f develops terminal instrument procedures for th tlzhlz g provides and operates navigational aids which support tactical operations that cannot be supported by other agencies h provides limited weather observations and information i assists in the selection of sites for tlzhlz operations j establishes ground toair and point topoint communications k gathers current ground intelligence data in the objective area and coordinates with intelligence representatives to assure the timely exchange of intelligence data l can act as the air boss if an aviator is not available

four mission planning 4000 general rapid response operations inhe rently involved in magtf operations rely on the level of training and readiness of the magtf and its assigned units to execute mission before the enemy can react often there is little time for lengthy deliberate planning or rehearsals and planners must rely on sops and checklists to speed the planning process the decision makers must consider the enemys strength intentions and capabilities the determination of which tactics offer the best chance for mission accomplishment are based on careful ana lysis of mett tsl mission enemy terrain and weather troops and fire support available time space and logistics particular emphasis must be placed on evaluating the nature and composition of the threat and its potential impact on the mission deta iled centralized planning and decentralized execution of the mission tactics is fundamental to mission accomplishment 4001 planning process the mmt leader will be directly involved in the planning process and must adhere to the following steps in acc ordance with mcwp 5 1 for deliberate and effective mission planning 1 mission analysis purpose is to review and analyze orders guidance and other information provided by higher headquarters and to produce unit mission statement 2 course of ac tion development each prospective coa is examined to ensure that it is suitable feasible acceptable distinguishable and complete with respect to the current and anticipated situation mission and commanders intent 3 course of action war game involves detailed assessment of each coa as it pertains to the enemy and the battlespace friendly coas are wargamed against possible enemy threat coas 4 course of action comparison and decision the commander evaluates all friendly coas against blished criteria then evaluates them against each other and selects the best to accomplish the mission 5 orders development orders are developed utilizing the commanders coa decision mission statement intent and guidance these orders serve as th commanders expression of his decision intent and guidance 6 transition this is the hand over of plan or order to those who execute it provides situational awareness and rationale for key decisions in the shift from planning to execution upon mission receipt the planning cell will conduct complete mission analysis analyze the specific mission for implied tasks that must be accomplished in order to execute the mission always concentrating on the commanders intent ensure that you compl etely understand both the friendly and enemy situations and if important information is missing ask for it know the enemy order of battle and his capabilities completely once the mission and commanders intent are understood continue to develop essen tial 41 marine air traffic control mobile team tacsop elements of information and courses of action courses of action should be briefed orally the concept of operations is also general in nature and is refinement of courses of action based on the commanders analysis estimates and decisions plan thoroughly and quickly establish timeline that begins in the objective area and works back to the planning process analyze actions in the objective area in great detail as this is the area of greatest interest and generally where the threat ma be the most lethal plan the withdrawal as thoroughly as the initial assault as this is an area that is often overlooked 4002 planning considerations as guide to effective mission planning in rapid response situations use the planning considera tions checklist for specific mission types provided in the appendices d g 4003 time management driving the planning process is the element of time mmts will be assigned to meusoc which is in contingency posture and is designed to react quickl and decisively often times the meusoc may only have hours rather than months or days to plan and execute time is of the essence and cannot be wasted utilize the mission planning timeline in appendix c to ensure that your planning moves along eff iciently 4004 division of labor in the rapid planning process every team member should be involved the team should be broken down and assigned specific areas of responsibility as specified in the team warning order the rapid planning timeline pro vided in appendix c should be followed the mmt will need to be involved in planning for all aspects of an operation mmt will have direct input in routing lz planning communication and each flying units planning 42 marine air traffic control mobile team tacsop this page

air traffic control mobile team tacsop chapter five mission briefing 5000 general before each operation team warning order will be issued to drive the planning and preparation process the warning order will be followed by team leaders mission brief and any specialized briefings as requir ed the content of these briefings will depend upon the requirements of the specific mission to be accomplished but should follow the formats as outlined in this sop this sop should be used to the maximum extent possible in order to reduce briefing time s and to eliminate confusion there is need to brief sop items under normal circumstances 5001 materials 1 maps place all maps pertinent to the brief in location where everyone involved in the brief can see them 2 terrain model build model of the terrain for the briefing this is particularly important for overland insertion to ensure the team has an accurate concept of the terrain that will be traversed during the operation 3 drawings and aerial photos in situations where terr ain models are unlikely ie on board ship drawings or aerial photos can be an effective substitute for the mission brief these assets are available from the s 2 other units involved with the operation should be consulted for available intelligence 4 briefing guides each team member shall maintain standardized briefing formats in order to follow along copy down all pertinent information and ensure that all items are properly briefed if certain items are overlooked it is the responsibility of the individual team member to inform the team leader that pertinent information has been omitted 5 smart packs pre printed smart packs are being used extensively these can be distributed among team members to ensure they are familiar with the in formation contained in them they normally include call signs frequencies brevity codes signals time lines rules of engagement and escape evasion procedures extreme care must be taken to ensure their accuracy and to protect their security 5002 operational briefs 1 warning order the team warning order will be presented verbally and will be posted in prominent place in which all team members have immediate access the standard format shown in appendix d should be used but if copies re available the following information must be included situation only information personnel need to make mission preparations needs to be included b mission brief and concise statement of what the team has been assigned to do who what where when and why 51 marine air traffic control mobile team tacsop c general instructions 1 team members for the mission 2 chain of command 3 tasks each individual will be assigned 4 unif orm and equipment 5 time schedule briefings weapons test fire rehearsal etc d specific instructions individuals will be assigned the following duties in accordance with the checklist in appendix d 1 s 1 and s 2 preparation 2 s 3 preparation 3 s 4 preparation 4 supply preparation 5 communications preparation 2 team leader mission brief this is an in dept h briefing presented by the team leader covering all aspects pertinent to the assigned mission this briefing should be prefaced by security classification statement roll call time hack instructions to secure the room and instructions to hold all stions until the end additionally any smart pack information will be distributed at this time the format in appendix should be used 3 pilot briefing this briefing is used to inform the aviators of all pertinent information that they will need to safely operate in the assault zone this brief should be issued to the pilot face to face but some missions may preclude this possibility any other means of issuing this brief ie secure phone secure fax message traffic etc should be execut ed if face to face briefs are impossible it is extremely important that the pilots be informed of all information to operate safely and efficiently with the mmt the briefing checklist in appendix d should be used to properly brief pilots when face to f ace briefings are otherwise impossible 5003 debrief all personnel involved with planning or execution of the mission should attend the debrief the debrief should be held as soon as all participants can meet after the mission for combat missions the debrief should be held immediately after debriefing the intelligence officer always set the debrief time in the warning order every participant should be able to contribute to the debrief 52 marine air traffic control mobile team tacsop this page intentionally left blank

supplies and refuel helicopters in addition to wide variety of other missions the tlzs provide the magtf commander with dynamic force multiplier and high degree of flexibility in projecting his power ashore 6001 classification and criteria 1 classification potential tactical landing zone areas fall into three basic categories unprepared prepared and surfaced unprepared surfaces are natural areas such as deserts dry lake beds and flat valley floors prepared surfaces are short airstrips that have been constructed for limited use and may or may not have an aggregate surface surfaced areas include roads highways and other paved surfaces individual ssions will dictate which of these surfaces will be most useful usaf special tactics teams are trained to perform tactical airfield surveys or assessments and have done so worldwide they gather all available data on the airfield and perform sit visits to evaluate approach zone obstruction clearances and weight bearing these surveys can be obtained from the assault zone surveys httpswwwamcscottafmildodosubcf mpagedivision2ehtm follow the dok division link to current surveys airfield suitability and restrictions reports are located httpswwwamcafmildodoadovshtm both of these sources sh ould be consulted when planning once the info is found it can be faxed on demand from dsn 576 2899 or comm 618 2562899 if further information is required call dsn 576 6055 every effort should be made to obtain stt survey before operating on an air field b mmts should be equipped with hand held pocket transits to check approach zone clearances and the heights of obstructions in the nearby vicinity airfield or drop cone penetrometers are used to check weight bearing capability califor nia bearing ratio cbr of unsurfaced landing zones they can be temp loaned from the appropriate mwss or cssd however training is required on the use of the penetrometers c semi permanent runways should be surveyed by engineering units howe ver semi permanent installations such as captured enemy airfields must be assessed for possible aircraft hazards and correct dimensions prior to use for operations this can be accomplished through obtaining surveys map and aerial photo analysis and physical survey of the set up during or prior to the operation 2 criteria short field lzs should be of sufficient size to permit rapid takeoff landing and loading operations terrain may be of soil dirt sand or other suitable surface careful consideration must be given to the slope and elevation of the runway aircraft capability and movement area restrictions 61 marine air traffic control mobile team tacsop surface conditions 1 high strength airfields are permanent improved surface runways most airf ields of this sort maintain runway strength data that may be available however when not available most aircraft can operate satisfactorily from most smooth relatively hard surfaced airfields 2 marginal strength airfields include temporary airfields with minimum surfacing or unsurfaced airfields such as would be encountered at forward area airfields in remote areas of the world the minimum soil strength required for aircraft operation is within the cbr values of 3 to 5 operational feasi bility on unsurfaced airfields depends on the type soil soil moisture content and operational frequency 3 at certain times forward airfield cannot be evaluated with scientific procedures the first time an evaluation is made at some places besides aerial photos and visual appearance is when the first aircraft arrives this situation is not recommended method but the mission may dictate that it occur rapid airfield assessments can be made with the use of 5 ton vehicle to simulate aircraft weights this is not foolproof method environmental conditions to include rain sun and wind can affect the surface extreme care should be taken to ensure the aircraft lands with as similar conditions as possible to the time when the assessment was taken table 61 lists c 130 trafficability for airfields assessed with the use of 5 ton rut depth aircraft loading number of landings tos 000 empty 100 010 empty 10 up to 100 w risk 025

taxiways for single direction c 130 operations will be less than 30 wide but should be made 60 wide to increase ease in turning off the runway 3 parki ng apron hardstands for c 130 aircraft will be less than 150 wide the number of aircraft using the area will determine length of the apron for mass apron of ten c 130s the apron will be 1500 long for one c 130 with the ability to turn around t he apron will be 150 long and for one c 130 requiring it to back into position the apron must be 30 long 4 overruns are the same width as the runway and extend 250 from both the arrival and departure ends 5 rocks must be removed embedded or interlocked with each other so that aircraft tires will traverse the area without causing displacements 6 soil balls or dried dirt clods excluding clay up to six inches in diameter that will burst on tire impact can be allowed hardened clay clods that have similar characteristics as rocks and exceed four inches must be pulverized or removed from the traffic areas 7 tree stumps must be clear of the traffic areas 8 dit ches must be eliminated and packed to the surrounding cbr 9 plowed fields usually contain soft core and normally will not require modification however such dirt patterns should be examined carefully when feasible to determine the need for removal 10 depressions and soil mounds do not have sharp corners and are recognized as oval or circular gradual downward sinks or rises depressions or mounds that exceed fifteen inches across on the top and six in depth or hei ght will be filled or leveled until they meet grade tolerance criteria 11 potholes are circular or oval in shape and distinguished from depressions by their smaller size and sharp corners potholes must be filled if they exceed fifteen inches at their widest point and six inches in depth potholes must be given careful consideration when aircraft with smaller tires such as av 8s are expected to use the tlz c shoulders 1 shoulders parallel the length of the tlz and extend ten feet laterally on both sides of the runway surface 2 tree stumps should be cut flush with the ground 3 rocks that can be ingested by engines and cause damage to the bottom of the aircraft should be removed d clear zones and clear areas 63 marine air traffic control mobile team tacsop 1 clear areas are the length of the tlz and extend 35 feet laterally from the outside edge of the shoulders on both sides of the runway 2 clear zones are 150 feet wide at the approach and departure ends of the runway and extend 500 feet in length to final width of 500 feet 3 tree stumps cut to within two inches of the ground 4 rocks in excess of four inch in diameter should be removed 5 ditches shall not be located within 65 feet of the runway centerline the cbr of these ditch edges can be ten percent less than the cbr of the runway 6 obstacles except vegetation over four inches above ground level will be cleared lateral safety zone 1 lateral safety zone is the length of the runway on

extending higher than 71 ratio from the inside lateral edge of the safety zone shall be reduced or eliminated f appr oach zones 1 the approach zones are 500 feet wide at the outer edge of the clear zone extending out 10500 feet from the outer edge of the clear zone to final width of 2500 feet 2 the approach zones have an elevation ratio of 351 which is measured from the thresholds but does not take effect until the inner edge of the approach zone all obstacles exceeding the limits of this zone shall be reduced or eliminated g depictions and data 1 depictions and data for training and combat airfield criteria are included in appendix 6002 marking equipment tlzs are normally marked with vs 17 marker panels for day operations and acr l 32 portable runway lighting for night operations any omni directio nal overt and visible lighting system is acceptable if all participating units are briefed and concur in its use some units may request the use of specialized covert ir lighting systems 6003 marking patterns specific details will be agreed upon at the planning conferences or briefs concerning the tlz markings conventional or special operation tlz markings consistent with flying safety shall be utilized when landings can be anticipated at both ends of the tlz the first 500 feet of each end wil l be marked as the approach end there are three standard types of airfield marking patterns amp which follow 64 marine air traffic control mobile team tacsop 1 amp 1 normally used to support day or night tactical operations the mobile team leader with the concurrence of the supported sq uadron is authorized to reduce this marking pattern down to the approach end touchdown area and end of the runway on well defined runway during day vmc operations see appendix 2 amp 2 normally used for special operations when minimal set up time is provided basically it is only the approach end and the left side of the runway marked see appendix 3 amp 3 normally used for special operations when minimal personnel are available for the operation this set up is often referred to as the box and one and may be done with overt or covert lighting see appendix 6004 marking procedures among the most difficult tasks to accomplish in tlz operations is the establishment of straight runway that has centerline aligned with the usable surface of the runway in order to ensure straight and properly aligned runway the following procedure is recommended 1 reference man the reference man will proceed as far as possible towards the departure end of the runway but not less than 3500 feet visually surveying the surface for fod or other hazards to aircraft operations once the reference man arrives at the predetermined distance down the runway he will pace off the usable surface of the

covert and informing the other team members that the reference point has been establi shed by means of brevity code the point the reference man has established effectively serves as sight on which to align the entire runway 2 base man the base man will proceed to the approach end of the runway visually surveying the surface for fod or other hazards to aircraft operations once at the approach end the base man will determine the left side of the tlz using the same procedure as the reference man after receiving the brevity code from the reference man the base man will use brevity codes or hand

runway at each marked interval will properly align the right side 65 marine air traffic control mobile team tacsop 6005 control point the control point for the tlz will be established at the direction of the mmt leader the team leader must take into account pertinent factors such as an unobstructed line of sight winds security as well as positive control of the tlz and surrounding airspace the entire landing taxiing and parking areas should be in full view of the control point it should when possible be upwind of the landing area so the dust and debris rising from an improved tlz will not

several operations fixed wing operations may be used in conjunction with rotary wing operations in magtf missions c 130 aircraft may be used for rapid ground refueling rgrs or for transporting personnel evacuated i n non combatant evacuation operations neos 7001 hlz selection during an amphibious assault operation or helicopterborne assault operation selection of hlzs is made by the magtf commander based on recommendations from the ace and the gce princip factors in the selection of hlzs are 1 landing force concept of operations ashore 2 enemy capabilities and dispositions with special consideration of enemy anti air installations 3 nature of the terrain over which helicopter units will maneuver after landing and proximity to initial objectives 4 requirements for logistic support 5 requirements for air artillery and naval gunfire support 6 available helicopter lanes to and from the hlz and any restri ctive effects on the employment of air artillery naval gunfire and fire support of other forces 7 ease of identification from the air 8 suitability and capacity for the landing and takeoff of helicopters 9 located just behind t he enemys detection and engagement range 7002 criteria 1 size appropriate hlz size is determined by the number and type of helicopters to be employed the landing of helicopter in small or restricted hlz requires the employment of precisio n type of approach which exposes the aircraft to enemy observation and fire recommended single aircraft hlz diameters are provided in the following table type ac surrounding obstruction height 5m 15m 15m 30m

size of the zone should equal the separation distance between aircraft 71 marine air traffic control mobile team tacsop 2 slope selected hlzs should be as level as possible terrain with slopes in excess of 14 percent eight degrees is usually considered too steep for helicopter l andings because of the dynamic rollover characteristics of all helicopters 3 surface material surface materials in the hlz must be considered during the planning stages dangers during the landing phase include restrictions to vision due to blowing dust or snow foreign object damage to jet engines from blowing debris obstruction of rocks stumps and terrain faults by tall grasses soil trafficability must be considered to ensure that helicopterborne units are able to move from the selected hlz to t he objective area with all the required equipment 4 obstacles obstacles in and around the hlz can affect helicopters ability to land take off successfully avoid enemy detection or affect troop mobility once the landing is made 5 adjacent terr ain and exits adjacent terrain and exits must be studied for lanes of approach lines of communication observation visibility cover and concealment compatibility of surrounding terrain with terrain flying should be examined along with the avoidance of enemy detection and fire 7003 marking patterns variety of landing zone lighting patterns exists mmt controllers should expect to provide diversity of lighting patterns when participating in operations with different helicopter squadrons th preferred method by most marine corps pilots is the lighted t pattern when conducting combined or joint operations lighting patterns in accordance with nato standardization agreements the nato should be used depending upon the squadron suppor ted any of these patterns or variation of them can be used as long as it is covered in the pilot briefing 1 lighted t the lighted t pattern is standard for most marine aviation squadrons it can be effectively used for all aircraft the ligh ts at the head of the t must be at least five meters apart and the lights in the stem must be at least eight meters apart to indicate wind direction the stem of the t should point into the wind see appendix f 2 the nato pattern is standard for joint and combined operations the lights in the split must be at least fourteen meters apart and the lights in stem must be at least seven meters apart to indicate wind direction the stem of the inverted should point into the wind see appen dix f 3 formation hlzs formation hlzs are established by building on the standard t or inverted patterns described above the landing point for each additional aircraft is marked with single light and wingmen will follow and align off the ad aircraft there are three standard formation patterns used the spacing between individual landing points for aircraft can be increased or decreased if the pilot is properly briefed but should never be reduced to less than 50 meters see appendix f 7004 marking equipment the type of marking and ground signaling devices used will depend greatly on lighting conditions and whether or not the pilots night vision is aided by nvgs various marking systems have been used successfully but regardless of the system used it should be easily visible to the pilot 72 marine air traffic control mobile team tacsop 1 day operations day hlzs are best marked with the use of the vs 17 air panels effectively secured to the ground the panels are simply placed in the same pattern with the same dimens ions as the lighting patterns described above the panels should be raised at an angle in order to provide better view at very low altitudes 2 night operations lz considerations due to the inherent danger involved in nighttime helic opter operations special considerations need to be made in order to ensure the safe operation of helicopters into and out of landing zones extreme care should be taken to consider all of the following items in establishing night hlzs 1 bright lighting align landing zones away from any bright lighting this may include such things as full moon during nvg operations 2 obstacles approach and departure corridors should be free of any large obstacles or power li nes 3 wind direction it is preferable to land helicopters into the wind consult the pilots concerning maximum cross and tail wind components that they will allow b unaided night hlzs where the pilots vision is ided require overt types of lighting standard acr l 32 runway lights are extremely effective for this use when securely anchored high intensity white chemlites are the next most preferable followed by any other color of chemlites c nvgs night hlzs established for nvg operations are the most common but require special consideration covert lighting is preferred in this case but overt lighting may be used in the form of chemlites however some colors of chemlites are invisible or may be washed out by ambient light when using nvg devices the following is list of marking aids that should be used in this order of preference 1 ir marking kit peanut lights may be too bright for low light level situations 2 acr l 32 runway lights with ir dome may be too bright for low light level situations 3 red chemlites 4 green chemlites 5 ir chemlites 4 ground to air signaling among the mos t difficult things for pilot to do is locate the intended landing zone regardless of how effectively it is marked effective ground signaling devices are required to draw the pilots attention to the general vicinity of the marked hlz the most effecti ve means of drawing the pilots attention is use of the aldis lamp for night operations ir filters can be acquired for use in nvg situations the use of signal mirrors or smoke grenades in day operations has proven to be the most effective once the pi lot has 73 marine air traffic control mobile team tacsop acquired the general location of the landing zone the signaling can be terminated on his request at time should the signaling device be used at range of less than 100 meters strobe lights have been used with variable success in the p ast but can be mistaken by helicopter gunners as flashes of enemy fire and friendly fire may be directed on them 74 marine air traffic control mobile team tacsop this page inten tionally left blank marine air traffic control mobile team tacsop

8005 83 marine air traffic control mobile team tacsop chapter eight rapid ground refueling 8000 general the ultimate objective in operating rapid ground refueling rgr and forward arming and refueling points farp is to minimize response time and decrease turn around time in support of susta ined operations additionally in limited objective raids these sites can increase the combat radius considered in both distance and time and can be an invaluable asset in supporting ship launched over the horizon operations three methods of refueling can be used the first is the helicopter expeditionary refueling system hers which can be delivered by helicopter or ground vehicle the second tactical bulk refueling dispensing system tbfds is employed out of ch 53 it can refuel up to two airc raft at time and is usually used to refuel other helicopters third is the rapid ground refueling rgr system using kc 130 assets which usually require less than 20 minutes to establish in most cases mwss or cssd personnel will be responsible for tablishing refueling operation at farps it is important however for marine air traffic controllers to understand refueling operations in order to ensure both their proper integration with airfield operations and to provide the most optimum traffic flow throughout this chapter the term rgr will be used as collective term for both rgr and farp sites 8001 site layout ideally the rgr will be located approximately 17 to 25 kilometers from the feba or flot this ensures positioning far enough to th rear to prevent enemy artillery preparatory fires from targeting the rgr yet allows the quick return of helicopters and logistical support the site should be planned around type of aircraft using the site as well as the following 1 staging areas staging areas should be divided into pre staging post staging and armde arm areas the pre staging area should allow the pilots to observe the rgr site and remain safe distance away from the site in the event of mishap however it should not be an excessive distance away due to the difficulty experienced by some aircraft ground taxiing at night 100 to 175 meters would be considered acceptable distances armde arm headings will be offset from the refueling point by at least 45 degrees 2 spa cing between aircraft there should be less than 50 meters between refueling points in order to accommodate all aircraft types including the ch 53e 3 wind direction the site should be arranged so aircraft can land refuel and takeoff into the win d if at all possible consult the pilots on maximum allowable cross and tail wind components 4 drainage spills should not drain into an area where equipment is located or into refueling point 5 camouflage when possible place pumps separato rs filters and bladders under camouflage or under surrounding vegetation place the site in position where natural shadows will cover the site if possible consideration should be given to using netting or natural vegetation for aircraft that must rem ain in the rgr site for extended periods of time 6 obstacles approach and departure corridors must be free from large obstructions 81 marine air traffic control mobile team tacsop 7 troops troops must be debarked at the pre stage and staged clear of the refueling point troops will be re embarked in the post stage attention during planning to ensure troops remain well clear of rgr site is essential these troops can be used for additional site security if necessary 8 site security the rgr site should be located in secure area if this is not possible consideration should be given to sound security plan to include use of laad assets for protection of the site an rgr should not remain in fixed location for more than 24 hours without deliberate mission planning 9 threat scatter plan should also be briefed the kc 130 should be positioned so it always has access to runway for immediate egress 10 foreign object damage all aircraft are susceptible to fod the rgr sites and helicopter movement should be planned t minimize fod hazards 11 control point the control point should be established in position in which the controllers can maintain constant visual contact with the refueling points in the event of an emergency the controller can immediately initi ate scatter plan 8002 rgr marking patterns although standard marking pattern an inverted with one light on the stem removed is displayed in the assault support helicopter manual to mark staging areas these provide poor reference for any mo re than single aircraft at time variety of markings may be used to mark these areas as long as they are readily visible to the pilots and they are properly briefed several marking techniques have been used successfully including large boxes marke d on four corners indicating individual staging areas or single lights to mark holding points for individual aircraft the second of these is most preferable because it not only allows use of the site by numerous aircraft but also ensures separation of ircraft while holding in given staging area fuel nozzles can be marked with chemlites to mark their position 8003 personnel requirements the following are minimum personnel requirements for rgr evolutions 1 refueling personnel tafds personn should be assigned with the hers normally five personnel are required to operate two refueling points kc 130 rgrs will provide team of seven personnel for establishing and operating the rgr site 2 ordnance all aircraft are required to arm before receiving fuel four trained ordnance men are required during any armde arm or loadingdownloading sequence it may be necessary to establish separate arm and arm areas but this will double the personnel support for this task 3 mmt ma rine atc mobile team will be required to establish and mark the tlz and rgr site as well as to control the aircraft into and out of the zone 4 security personnel an appropriate number of personnel will be required to provide ground security and air d efense for the site 82 marine air traffic control mobile team tacsop 5 laad at minimum laad team will be deployed for point defense of the rgr 8004 air traffic control all air traffic into and out of the rgr will be controlled by the mmt on site however once the aircraft have bee n positioned in the pre staging area until they are ready to depart from the post staging area the rgr flight crew or tafds personnel control all ground movement of aircraft in the refueling area ground movement instructions can be issued via visual or radio communications 8005 emergency procedures 1 refueling personnel in case of fire or accidents that could cause fire the refueling personnel will stop the flow of fuel in the rgr b free all aircraft from fuel l ines c sound alarm d

conditions where time restrictions prevent normal site survey and flight check prior to use if published approach procedures are available the mission briefing shall include written description for approach procedures b if necessary the mmt transmits complete verbal description of the desired approach procedures to the approaching aircraft 2 tactical non surveyed when time constraints prevent pre siting survey approach procedures will be developed from maps charts photos or any other avai lable information mmt navaid equipment will be site surveyed by the mmt and checked during vfr conditions by any available tactical aircraft but preferably by kc 130 for safety 3 tactical surveyed when time and the situation permit mmt personn in accordance with existing siting criteria will conduct pre siting survey during vfr conditions it will be checked for operational and safety by an available tactical aircraft in this case the mmt navaid system will be considered tactical surv eyed

available to provide imc control all ra dio frequencies will be monitored during operational hours 3 handoffs tactical agencies in control of enroute air traffic will not relinquish control of aircraft until such time as the aircraft is in contact with the terminal area mmt where enroute controlling agency exists the aircraft will not enter the holding pattern airspace at its destination airfield until such time as it has established radio contact and received clearance from the controlling mmt aircraft may proceed to the destinat ion airfield holding pattern if weather conditions permit flight as specified under vmc if unable to maintain vmc aircraft will request special vfr approach or return to the originating or alternate airfield 4 traffic flow aircraft flow will norma lly be determined at unilateral or joint planning conferences the size of the ramp if available runways landing surface condition weather and mission requirements will dictate the arrival flow at the destination airport 9007 special vfr procedur weather conditions may deteriorate to below vfr 93 marine air traffic control mobile team tacsop minimums but svfr may be preferable option to the mmt rather than non radar approach control this assures the commander continuous and expeditious flow of air traffic even in severely reduc ed meteorological conditions 1 operational procedures the

planning the ace staff with the assistance of macg representatives will establish control points approach procedur departure procedures and transfer of control responsibilities between mmts and other air control agencies involved due to numerous situations that will cause confusion in both tactical exercises as well as actual combat these control points and deco nfliction plans should always be developed and used by the mmt executing the mission regardless of the weather conditions expected 1 control point designation prior coordination must be effected between all control agencies to establish release point s control zones and other pertinent data these procedures may be devised utilizing any combination of several types of navaids that are already in place navaids tactically deployed by the mmt gps systems in the aircraft or visual reporting points full consideration needs to be given to procedures for control of airspace in all weather conditions 2 multiple terminal

communications deception is used by hostile radio electronic combat units to gather intelligence and to confuse and disrupt friendly c3 there are two categories of deception manipulative and imitative manipulative deception consists of the insertion of erroneous information t communications net to cause an enemy to act based on false information imitative deception is the active participation of an unauthorized station in the communications net with the intention of eliciting information concerning capabilities dispositi on strength or intentions the primary means of countering the deception threat is by use of authentication when communicator suspects an unauthorized station has entered the net the communicator shall require that station to authenticate if that station is unable to authenticate it shall be identified to all other stations on the net using the term gingerbread 11004 jamming jamming is the use of portions of the electromagnetic spectrum by an enemy to deny friendly forces the use of their ow n communications networks not all radio interference is jamming jamming effectiveness is dependent upon radiated power distance and frequency band three types of jamming are currently employed by threat forces spot barrage and sweep spot jamming concentrates the radiated power of the jammer on specific narrow frequency band permitting effectiveness up to relatively large distances barrage 111 marine air traffic control mobile team tacsop jamming spreads the radiated power over wide band of frequencies thus increasing coverage but decreasing effective range sweep jamming combines the two concepts by jamming only one frequency at given instant but sweeping so rapidly through the frequency band that it is highly effective when the station being jammed does not realize it if the enemy is unaware of our communications it is unlikely he will utilize his equipment in the blind when controller believes he is being jammed he should first check his equipment for internal malfunction care must be taken to prevent disclosing to the enemy the effectiveness of his efforts the following protection measures should be employed if jamming is suspected or confirmed 1 continue to operate even though an annoying signal is being experienced the controller should continue to operat as long as communications can be maintained do not acknowledge the presence of the disturbing signal for it will indicate to the enemy that his jamming is effective when operating with comsec equipment do not immediately assume that the crypto gear is malfunctioning enemy jamming efforts may be concentrated around forcing friendly forces to operate on uncovered nets when able complete and submit miji report about the incident see appendix i 2 rapid burst transmission jamming is often n ot continuous because the enemy looks through his jamming to determine whether station is still transmitting brief messages may be transmitted during these gaps 3 parallel circuit many times the station that the controller is attempting to cont act will monitor several nets to which the team has access by use of these parallel circuits the team may pass its traffic around the jammed net 4 visual signals use of signals to send messages represents an effective method of circumventing jammi ng 5 have quick and frequency hopping have quick operations are one of the most effective means of allowing maximum communications with minimum chance of jamming and detection even the most effective jamming systems in use today are not effective against proper have quick operations 11005 authentication the most effective technique for defeating imitative communications deception is to perform authentication the alphanumeric cipher systems most often used for encryption and authentication i s the akac 1662 or 874 the following general guidelines for use of authentication are provided 1 authenticate whenever net is initially established 2 authenticate whenever daily call signs and frequencies are changed 3 authenticate whenever bogus station is suspected 4 authenticate whenever important tactical instructions or commands are transmitted 5 authenticate whenever information of high intelligence value is requested or transmitted 112 marine air traffic control mobile team tacsop 6 do not authenticate after ever transmission 7 do not authenticate on secure circuit unless you suspect intrusion or interference 8 be suspicious of long delays and authenticate again if station delays in excess of thirty seconds 9 never use the same authentication comb ination twice 10 authentication procedures the following are examples of authentication procedures two way authentication first challenge consists of two letters randomly selected the first letter would be found on the set indicator column far left and the second letter would be found on the same line to the right of the first letter the reply to the challenge is the code letter found directly under the second letter of the challenge if there is line under the challenge lett ers go back to the top of the chart and use the first line example b mhu dfr sio pkj c gyt klo nbv aws gator this is sumo over sumo this is gator authenticate bp over gator this is sumo i authenticate over sumo this is gator roger go ahead both stations will then place line through the on line c so that the same combination will not be used again b triad airborne matrix system this system is used for airborne and air to ground authentication the aceoi that pilots carry on their kneeboards requires the alpha authentication when challenging aircraft select three letter combination beginning with the letter the authentication just adds one more step as outlined above beginning on the alpha line t he airborne matrix and the standard matrix are designed to work together so to reply if you have ground aceoi disregard the and use the next two letters as described above c one way authentication the reverse side of the akac is used for age ncies utilizing one way authentication these are used when an agency is providing information for more than one agency and urgency does not allow every station on the net to call back station will state twoletter authentication code followed by th two minute time period in minutes first find the twominute window of the current time in the left column next locate the column of the current time and read across to confirm the letter authentication 113 marine air traffic control mobile team tacsop example bandits seven miles north of the objective i authenticate cm time now 08 past day 01 0900 1000 1100 02 ak bc cj 04 gh ut it 06 or eo tp 08 ri cm qp 10 cm wp kg 11006 encryption when it is necessary to transmit messages containing unit locations injury reports or other information that could aid the enemy the numbers must be changed to code before transmiss ion to encrypt numbers first select set indicator the set indicator will consist of two letters randomly selected to identify the actual line which will be used to encrypt the numbers the following is an example of encryption procedures two let ters will be selected at random and used to determine the line which will be used to encrypt the numbers known as the set line the set line is determined in similar process as authentication but instead of reading the letter immediately under the cond letter the set line letter will be immediately to the right of the second letter you will then use any one of the letters in the groups of three under the appropriate numbers that are located at the top in the reading guides the following rules pply 1 never encrypt more than 15 digits on one set line 2 never encrypt and say in the clear what it means 3 add zeros occasionally to confuse the enemy ie encrypt 5 kias as 005 4 use the acronym read in remembering encryption proce dures right encrypt authenticate down example 0 1 2 3 sdf ghj ert iop b ref cml pqn

tacsop chapter twelve overland insertions 12000 general although overland inserti on is among the least desirable means of insertion for the mmts it can still be viable and effective means for successful mission mmts must be intimately familiar with ground movement techniques in order to accomplish those missions that demand it this chapter describes patrol techniques and immediate actions accepted by marine corps doctrine in the event that the mmt is attached to larger unit however due to the small size and limited firepower of the mmts break contact situations should be i nitiated on every clash with enemy forces this will allow the team to proceed with the mission with minimal losses 12001 preparation for movement 1 map reconnaissance the team leader will make thorough map reconnaissance of the terrain over w hich the team will be required to move consider the terrain in relation to all available information on the threat as well as friendly forces you should conduct your map evaluation from the enemy point of view aerial photo reconnaissance or aerial re connaissance should be conducted if available 2 route selection routes should be selected taking the following into consideration cover and concealment cover and concealment are desirable but route with these characteristics may lso present obstacles to movement the desirability of these features must be weighed against the requirements for speed of movement terrain that provides cover and concealment to moving unit also provides the enemy with ample ambush sites b observation and fields of fire the team leader must consider route which offers the appropriate balance between fields of fire and cover and concealment this will effect your decisions about formations rate of movement and method of control c key terrain key terrain includes features that have controlling effect on the surrounding terrain the team leader must plan around these pieces of key terrain in order to avoid being compromised or engaged by the enemy d rally points establish non consecutively numbered rally points along the route in order to provide areas to reassemble and reorganize the team if dispersed during movement to reconnoiter the objective area or for exiting and entering friendly lines ra lly points will be easily locatable areas that can provide good cover and concealment for re assembly of the team the team leader using the appropriate hand and arm signal will designate these points during movement 3 intelligence as in all situati ons the team leader needs to thoroughly consider the threat all available intelligence information is collected and considered before the patrol departs concentrate on known suspected and likely enemy positions 4 communications the team leader will need to plan his means of communication with other units involved in the operation additionally lines of communications between with the 121 marine air traffic control mobile team tacsop higher headquarters supported and supporting agencies need to be considered 5 fire support all av ailable supporting arms should be considered and coordinated to deliver fires in support of the operation special attention should be paid to key terrain and danger areas along the route 12002 movement 1 formations the column formation will be used as standard for mmts although this formation lacks sufficient combat power to reduce an ambush to its front or rear it greatly facilitates speed control and effective immediate actions to break contact from several situations the order of format ion for six man team will be point man navigator team leader radio operator assistant team leader and rear security this standard file formation will count personnel starting from the rear and go forward ie the point man is number six and the re ar security man is as always number one 2 security security is maintained through the organization for movement and every man keeping alert at all times the following general rules apply for security in movement point man provide s 180 degree security to the front b rear security man provides 180 degree security to the rear c navigator provides aerial security d even numbers provide right security odd numbers provide left security f weapons will always be pointed in the direction of responsibility g security halts will be made in numerous situations such as when team members need to confer check maps reconnoiter route listen for enemy movement or arri ve at danger area when the signal halt is passed all team members will pass the signal and take two steps towards their area of responsibility odd to the left and even to the right and take knee while providing 360 degree security the team mbers must still maintain sight of his teammates to his front and rear in order to receive and pass any signals longer security halts may be required at which time the team leader will pass the get down signal and all personnel will assume prone posi tion 3 avoid detection patrols must move with stealth and exploit cover and concealment move when visibility is reduced and use the noise of the environment to cover your movement make irregular stops so that you can detect any enemy attempting t infiltrate or locate your patrol use hand and arm signals and communicate vocally only when absolutely necessary hand and arm signals should be used that only require one hand and are below the head 4 maintain contact maintain visual contact wi th the team members to your front and rear at all times team members should continually look to the team leader and other team members for hand and arm signals or other instructions 122 marine air traffic control mobile team tacsop 12003 danger areas danger areas are those areas that will inc rease the teams chances of detection if crossed all danger areas will be avoided at all costs as the point man encounters danger area he will stop the patrol by passing the halt and danger area signals the team leader will then evaluate the s ituation and determine which of the following actions to take head count will be conducted after crossing any danger area 1 open areascross compartment when large open areas cannot be avoided the team leader will pass the line formation signa l and all personnel will transition to line formation to provide flank security for crossing the danger area the team leader will designate the near side as rally point and instruct the point man and navigator to conduct box shaped reconnaissance f the far side large enough to fit the entire patrol once the far side is determined safe enough to cross the team the point man will take position at the head of the reconnoitered area while the navigator will signal for the remainder of the team to c ross the team leader will then signal for the team to cross the area in line formation and transition to the file formation upon reaching the far side the far side of the danger area will be designated as rally point the team will then move safe distance away from the danger area conduct head count and listen for any enemy that may be following 2 linear the team will deal with linear danger areas in similar manner all procedures are the same until just after the reconnaissance of the far side when the signal to cross is received on the near side of the danger area the team members will cross one at time following the same path as the point man as each member reaches the other side they will assume the far side covering position and tap the member he is replacing who will then take his place in the normal file formation on the far side this process will continue until all team members cross the danger area the far side will be designated rally point the team will then move safe distance away from the danger area conduct head count and listen for any enemy that may be following 3 in given situations these methods of crossing danger areas may not be suitable other options are available such as crossing on line by two man elements successive bounds or bounding overwatch the team leader will always decide which option is most suitable for the situation 12004 immediate actions immediate action drills are designed to provide an aggressive and violent reaction to enemy contact they are simple courses of action in which all men are so well trained that their reaction to all types of enemy contact are instinctive and require thought on the part of the team members 1 general rules the following general g uidelines should be followed in conducting immediate actions the twelve oclock position is always the original direction of movement of the patrol b when instructions to halt are issued take two steps outboard and take kne facing in the direction of security responsibility this will be known as cigar shaped formation c always pass visual and verbal commands to ensure all personnel have seen or heard them 123 marine air traffic control mobile team tacsop d always roll prior to moving in break contact situations always use hand and arm signals unless detected by the enemy f always conduct head count after executing any immediate actions 2 chance contact used when any team member sights the enemy t directly approaching the patrol and believes the enemy has not sighted the team that patrol member will immediately signal freeze all team members will halt in place and remain motionless and quiet until receiving further instructions the enemy w ill be allowed to pass unless the enemy sees team member any team member seen by the enemy will quickly aim in and open fire and initiate break contact situation 3 hasty ambush this immediate action is used as defensive measure for the mmts when enemy personnel are sighted approaching the patrol directly and it is believed that the enemy has not sighted the team this can also be used as an offensive measure but will not be done so by an mmt acting alone the team member sighting the enemy in this instance will signal enemy in sight followed by the team leader signaling hasty ambush and indicate direction the team will move quickly into line formation in the direction indicated and establish an effective firing position the team will remain in this position motionless until the enemy has passed if the enemy detects the patrol or if it is an offensive measure the team leader or the first person realizing detection will initiate the ambush by opening fire and shouting fire 4 air observation when an enemy or unidentified aircraft which could detect the patrol is heard or observed the signal freeze will be passed if time is available the signal take cover will be passed by the team leader and each patrol member will take the nearest available cover every team member will freeze in that position until further instructions are issued 5 air attacks when an aircraft has detected the patrol and has begun an attack the teams only choice is to take cover and re turn fire the team leader will shout air attack followed by the clock direction of the aircraft from the patrols movement the team will immediately move into line formation perpendicular to the heading of the aircraft lay on their backs and fire i nto the air providing wall of lead through which the aircraft must fly fire should lead helicopters by 100 meters and jet aircraft by 300 meters 6 contact frontrear any contact situations to the front and rear of the patrol will be handled by us ing an australian peel to break contact upon receiving enemy fire from the front the team member detecting the enemy will shout contact front all team members will immediately move to the flanks and assume prone firing position aiming at the ene my position the point man or forward most surviving member will fire burst into the enemy position then turn outboard and run to point behind the rear security man successively from front to rear each member will roll rise and run to the rear f the team position even numbers will turn to the right and odd numbers to the left the team members movement will be covered by the fire of the members now at the head of the formation this process will continue until the team leader issues further instructions contact rear situation is handled the same way but all team members will first take two steps outboard and assume prone firing position in the six 124 marine air traffic control mobile team tacsop oclock direction and the peel will begin with the rear security man remember t hat in contact rear situation the leftright side of the patrol refers to the original direction of movement 7 contact leftright breaking contact is once again desired when encountering the enemy on the flanks when enemy fire is received from t he left or right the team member detecting the enemy position will shout contact left or contact right if contact left is shouted all odd numbered personnel will immediately take prone firing position towards the enemy their fire will protect the movement of the even numbered personnel who will immediately move fifteen meters to the right of the formation take prone position to cover the movement of the odd numbered personnel and shout move to indicate when to begin moving the odd numbe red personnel will then move fifteen meters beyond the even numbers and repeat the same process until the team leader issues further instructions the same procedure is used for contact right situations but the even numbered personnel will provide cover f ire first while the odd numbered personnel move to break contact 8 near ambush in near ambush the team would be caught in kill zone of heavily concentrated fire at close range there is little time or space for team members to maneuver or seek cover any team member will shout near ambush followed by the clock position of the ambush team members caught in the kill zone will immediately take prone position and fire directly into the enemy ambush site team members not caught in the kill z one will take covered positions and expend as much ordnance as possible into the enemy position violence of action in this case is the only means of escape turn the enemys attention away from the ambush by making rapid egress with the maximum firepo wer available 9 indirect fire after receiving indirect fire the team leader will shout clock position and distance to move that leads the patrol 180 degrees away from the fire for example if indirect fire impacts at the patrols three oclock the team leader will shout nine oclock 100 meters the team will then immediately run 100 meters to the nine oclock position take cover and await further instructions from the team leader 125 marine air traffic control mobile team tacsop chapter thirteen helicopter operations paragraph page general 13000 131 preloading

mmts will be attached to ground combat unit whose mission is to seize and secure ar eas suitable for tlz operations mmts should be inserted at the earliest possible time in order to allow proper set up time 13001 preloading procedures marines departing from an hlz will assemble at designated rally point personnel scheduled to debark the amphibious ships by helicopter will assemble in designated location such as the berthing compartment with all required equipment upon notification of their assigned helicopter serial number over the ic heliteams will move to the troop ac climatization room or hanger deck as directed personnel will remain in their sticks unless the stick or team leader grants marine permission to leave the following considerations should be taken prior to embarkation 1 place all short antennas on r adios 2 unbuckle 782 gear and open flack jacket for easy removal in the event of crash 3 life preservers lpps will be worn 4 collect embark cards appendix j and leave them with the combat cargo personnel or other embark representative whe n loading 5 secure helmet and hearing protection 6 test fire weapons if able 7 conduct last minute inspections 13002 loading procedures helicopter serials will be called to the front of the hanger bay and will be met by the helicopter c ontrol team members the sticks will then be lead to the helicopters on deck and the team leader should ensure that they are loading the proper aircraft by tail number when loading the aircraft 1 only approach the aircraft on the crew chiefs instru ctions and from an angle at which he can see you 2 the teamstick leader will lead the teamstick to the aircraft followed immediately by the assistant teamstick leader 3 ensure you have complete safe weapon when boarding ch 53 or ch 46 inve rt weapons before embarking if embarking on uh 1n keep muzzle pointed up 4 the assistant team leader will count the marines loading by physically tapping each marine as he boards and give the team leader two thumbs up when all have been counted abo ard the 131 marine air traffic control mobile team tacsop team leader will then give the aircraft crew chief thumbs up 5 load the aircraft rapidly in tactical formation order ie point man first navigator second etc with the exception of the team and assistant team leaders team membe rs will be seated with even numbers left odd on the right 6

leader verbally and visually with an unbuckle hand signal all stick members wil l repeat both signals and remove lpps close flak jacket buckle 782 gear unbuckle seat belts and don packs 3 one minute warning will be passed verbally and visually with lock and load hand signal all stick members will repeat both signals and l oad and charge their weapons keeping the muzzle down 4 when the ramp is lowered the assistant stick leader will be the first off the aircraft and physically count stick members coming off stick will immediately offload in reverse formation order 5 establish standard cigar shaped formation and be ready to react to hostile fire in the zone via immediate actions or to move to briefed locations immediately 13004 actions in hot lz every effort will be made to avoid hot lz however if the mission warrants debarkation in hot lz the stick leader will pass the hot lz hand signal team members will exit the helo as fast as possible and establish standard cigar shaped formation this allows for rapid response through immediate actions to any threatening force in the lz and provides break contact situation 13005 navigation it is absolutely essential that all mobile team members be able to navigate while airborne the inherent speed of heliborne movement makes such navigation difficult and requires constant training prior to each heliborne movement leaders must have executed the following 1 determine present location 2 know primary and alternate lz 3 execute map and photo recon of the route and lzs 132 marine air traffic control mobile team tacsop 4 locate key terrain features or landmarks to assist in your navigation ie lighthouses towers etc 13006 communications during helicopter movement it is essential that the team leader be able to communicate with the crew of the aircraft the inherent n oise involved in the helicopter makes verbal communication impractical and unreliable accordingly each team leader will use the following means to ensure positive and reliable communications during flight 1 stick leader will identify himself immediat ely upon boarding the aircraft and don the ics cranial and conduct an ics check 2 stick leader will use laminated lz slate to communicate with the aircrew 3 any additional information that needs to be passed to the team or pilots can be done on the blank side of the slate team members can also ask questions using the same slate and pass them back to the stick leader for effective use of this slate at night blue or green chemlite and alcohol pengrease pencil should be used 133 marine air traffic
