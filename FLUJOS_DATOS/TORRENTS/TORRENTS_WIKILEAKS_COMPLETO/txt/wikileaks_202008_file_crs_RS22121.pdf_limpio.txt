27 other federal agencies have independent landholding and leasing authorities that enable them to acquire or construct specific types of buildings4 gsa is responsible for the design and construction of its buildings and for alterations and repairs to existing facilities one of its primary goals has always been to assure the physical safety of federal employees who work in and the private citizens who visit governmentowned or leased buildings however the fede ral government had formally established building security standards for either federally owned or leased buildings when the april 1995 domestic terro rist bombing of the alfred p murrah federal building occurred in oklahoma city ok5 the oklahoma city bombing brought new awareness to the potential for violent acts directed at federal buildings as symbolic attacks against the federal government as whole the day following the april 19 1995 bombing president william clinton directed the department of justice doj to assess the vulnerability of federal facilities to acts of terrorism or violence and to develop recommendations for minimum security standards6 because of its expertise in federal courts security the us marshals service usms coordinated two working groups to accomplish these tasks standards committee and profile committee the sta ndards committee composed of security specialists and representatives from gsa th federal bureau of investigation the us secret service the so cial security administration and the departments of defense and state identified and evaluated the various type s of security measures that could be used to strengthen potential vulnerabilities the committee compiled list of proposed minimum standards pertaining to secure perimeter buffer zones the security of entrances and exits and related access pr ocedures the identification and admittance of employees and visitors garage and vehicle service entrances the location of day care centers and the use of closedcircuit television monitoring because of the differences among federal bu ildings and their related security issues the standards committee categorized federal facilities into five different levels with corresponding security standards based on f actors such as building size agency mission and function tenant population and volume of public access level i building is defined as having not more than 2500 square feet sq ft of space with 10 or fewer federal employees and little public access level ii building contains between 2500 to 80000 sq ft and has between 11 and 150 federal employees engaged in routine activities with moderate level of public access an example of level ii building is the social security administration office in dorado co level iii building ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22121crs3 7 us

facilities are similar to level iv buildings in size and numbers of federal employees however the missions of level v facilities are considered critical to nationa l security the central in telligence agency headquarters and the pentagon for example are both classi fied as level v for security purposes the profile committee composed of usms deputies and gsa security specialists conducted inspections at mo re than 1200 federal fac ilities to obtain security data on buildings for use in upgrading existing conditions to comply with the proposed minimum standards sixty days later the work ing groups findings and recommendations were published in june 1995 report entitled vulnerability assessment of federal facilities 7 security standards and design criteria the publication of the 1995 vulnerability assessment report was significant in that it represented the first time that broad security standards were applied to federal facilities and they are still in effect in conjunction w ith publication of the report president clinton directed all executive branch agencies to begin immediately upgrading their facilities to meet the recommended minimum security standa rds to the extent possible within funding limitations based on the doj recommendations he also required gsa to establish building security committees for all gs facilities and calle d upon other landholding agencies to establish programs for upgrading their facilities to appropriate minimum security standards8 four months later on october 19 1995 pr esident clinton issued eo 12977 which established permanent

federal facilities these actions might include encouraging agencies with security responsibilities to share secu rityrelated intelligence in timely manner evaluating technology and information systems to f acilitate costeffectiv security upgrades developing longterm construction standards for highrisk facilities that require blast resistant structures or have other specialized security requi rements evaluating standards for the location and security of day care centers in federal facilities and assisting the gsa administrator in creating and maintaining cen tralized security database of all federal facilities while the 1995 vulnerability assessment report provided guidance for overall security standards for existing facilities it did not provide criteria for the design and construction of new fe deral buildings in january 1997 gs completed its first draft of document entitled gsa security criteria which was revised nd issued on october 8 1997 to establish design standards for the pr otection of federal employees in civilian facilities11 the gsa security document attempted to integrate security standards throughout all functional and sign phases of the building pr ocess including site and interior space planning as well as structural and electrical design elements building upon gsas 1997 draft security criteria the members of the isc established series of working groups that addressed new technolog developments cost considerations the experience of architect s and builders in applying gsas design criteria and the need to balance security st andards with public access to federal buildings in may 2001 the isc issued its security design criteria for new federal office buildings and major modernization projects based on the five secur ity levels for federal facilities12 new isc security requirements for future construction projects included the use of glazing protection for windows the establishment of distances that buildings should be set back from the street the contro l of vehicular access to the buildings and the location and securing of air intakes in july 2001 the isc issued second product for federal agencies to implement

response to these events the isc issued revised procedures to respond to potential vehicle bomb attacks by recomme nding that new federal buildings be constructed at minimum distance of between 20 to 50 feet from the nearest perimeter barrier depending upon the security level13 even though the isc successfully completed its security design criteria and related draft documents 2002 general

were still active as of july 2002 also while gao reported that the isc was successfully disseminating security inform ation to member agencies it also found that the groups effectiveness was hindered by gsas lack of aggressive l eadership and support in that the agency failed to issue operating proce dures and did not provide sufficient staff support and funding gsa was also unable to provide any documention indicating that the agency or the isc had actually monitored agency compliance with the iscs security recommendations15 recent developments congressional enactment of the homeland security
