ptember 30 2002 but the current and long term budget outlook also had changed consid erably from the year before at the beginning of 2001 the congressional budg et office cbo pr ojected federal

budget actions during the session overview of the congressional budget process the congressional budget process consists of the consideration and adoption of spending revenue and debt limit legislation within th framework of an annual concurrent resolution on the budget additionally prior to september 30 2002 congressional action on budget legislation was constraine d by limits on discretionary spending and payasyougo paygo requirement for direct spending and revenue legislation congress begins its budget process once the president submits his budget the president is required by law to submit comprehensive federal budget later than the first monday in february the pres idents budget include s estimates of direct spending and revenues under existing laws as well as requests for discretionary spending ie funds provided through the appropriations proce ss for the upcoming fiscal year in addition the president frequently proposes new initiatives in his budget submission to congress although congress is not bound by the presidents budget congressional action on sp ending and revenue legisl ation often is influenced by his recommendations as well as subse quent budgetary

purpose discretionary spending for fy2002 p aygo generally required that projected increases in direct spending or decreases in revenues due to legislative action were offset so that the net effects of the new legislation did not increase the deficit or reduce the surplus the paygo requirement applied to legislation enacted through fy2002 but it covered the effects of such legislation through

cba the reconciliation process has two stages first congress includes reconciliation instructions in budget re solution directing one or more committees to recommend changes in statute to achieve the levels of spe nding revenues and debt limit agreed to in the budget resolution second the legislative language recommended by committees is packaged wit hout substantive revision into one or more reconciliation bills as set forth in the budget resolution by the house and senate budget committees in some instances committee may be required to report its legislative recommendations directly to its chamber once reconciliation legislation is reported consideration is governed by special procedures these special rules serve to limit what may be included in reconciliation legislation to prohibit certa in amendments and to encourage its completion in timely fashion in the house as with th budget resolution rec onciliation legislation usually is considered under sp ecial rule

requires revenue gislation originate in the house of representatives but the senate may amend revenue bill as it chooses most of the laws establishing the fe deral governments revenue sources are permanent and continue year after year without any additional legislative action congress however typically enacts revenue legislation changing some portion of the existing tax system every year revenue legislation may include changes to individual and corporate income taxes social insurance taxes excise taxes or tariffs and duties revenue legislation is not automatically considered in the congressional budget process on an annual basis frequently however the president proposes and congress considers changes in the rates of taxation or the distribution of the tax burden an initial step in the congress ional budget process is the publication of revenue estimates of the pr esidents budget by cbo these revenue estimates usually differ from the presidents since they are based on different economic and technical assumptions eg growth of the economy and change in the inflation rate estimates of any congressional revenuepolicy proposals are prepared by cbo based on joint committee on taxation revenue timates and are pub lished in committee reports or the congressional record the budget resolution includes baseline estimates of federal government receipts based on the continuation of existing laws and any proposed policy changes the revenue levels in the budget resolution provide the framework for any action on revenue measures during the session poi nt of order

by the public plus debt held by government accounts almost all of the fe deral debt is subject to statutory debt limit the debt held by the public represents the total net amount borrowed from the public to cover the federal governments budget deficits by contrast th debt held by government accounts represents the total net amount of fe deral debt issued to specialized federal accounts primarily trust funds eg social security trust fund surpluses by law must be invested in special federal government securities and thus are held in the form of federal debt because the statut ory limit applies to the combination of both types of debt budget deficits or trust f und surpluses may contribute to the federal government reaching the existing debt limit so long as federal budget policy results in an increase in the federal debt congress periodically must enact increases to the debt limit the most recent prior increase in the statutory debt limit was included in the balanced budget act of 1997 pl 10533 at the time of passage the increase to 595 trillion was considered sufficient to m eet the federal gove rnments financial needs through middecember 1999 the federal governments surpluses over the last 4 years contributed to the fact that the statutory debt limit has been sufficient beyond this date however treasury secretary paul oneill first indicated in december 11 2001 letter to congressional leaders that the existing debt limit might begin to interfere with the federal governments fi nancial responsibilities as early as february 20029 therefore he requested that c ongress raise the debt limit by 750 billion to 67 trillion on june 11 2002 the senate adopted s 2578 legislation to increase the public debt limit by 450 billion by 6829 vote on june

through early 200310 appropriations and other spending legislation federal spending is categorized as one of two different type s discretionary or direct spending discretionary spe nding is controlled through the annual appropriations acts while direct spending which consists mostly of entitlement programs is determined by existing law discretionary spending is under the jurisdiction of the house and senate appropriations committees direct spending is under the jurisdiction of the various legislative committees of the house and senate some entitlement programs such as medicaid and certain vete rans programs are funded in annual appropriations acts but such spending is not considered disc retionary and is not controlled through the annual appropria tions process the presidents budget includes recomme ndations for the annual appropriations account and program level tail about these recommendati ons are included in the appendix volume of the presidents budget docum ents in addition agencies submit justification materials to the house nd senate appropriations committees the budget justifications provide more detailed information about an agencys program activities than is contained in the pres idents budget documents and are used in support of agency testimony during appr opriations subcommittee hearings on the presidents budget request congress passes three main types of appropriations measures regular appropriations acts provide budget authority for the next fiscal year beginning on october 1 the 13 subcommittees of the appropriations committees of the house and senate are each responsible for one of the 13 regular appropriations acts supplemental appropriations acts provide additional funding for unexpected needs while the fiscal year is in progress continuing appropriations acts commonly referred to as continuing resolutions crs provide stopgap funding for agencies that have not received regular appropriations by the start of the fiscal year spending allocations to the appropriations committees and other committees accompany the conference report on the budget resolution soon after it is adopted the house and senate appropriations committees subdivide their spending allocations among their subcommittees and formally report these suballocations to their respective chambers on june 25 2002 the house appropriations committee

supplementals and eight continuing resolutions in some years such as in each of the three prior to 2001 19982000 instead of adopting all of the regular appropriations acts i ndividually congress
