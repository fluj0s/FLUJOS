in the highwa trust account while tea21 set guaranteed spending levels for the highway program through fy2003 based on forecast of future highway trust account revenues raba allowed the highway spending level to increase automatica lly if highway trust account revenues exceeded the forecasts it also provided that the highway spending levels would be reduced if revenues fell below the forecasts for several years the raba adjustment mechanism provided windfall gains for highway funding increases of 15 billion in fy2000 3 billion in fy2001 and 45 billion in fy2002 over the guaranteed f unding levels however the recession of 2001 slowed receipts into the highwa trust account and in january 2002 it became clear that revenues had dropped belo w the forecast levels the result was an automatic cut in the fy2003 highway prog ram funding level of 44 billi on the impact of this cut was magnified by th raba boost to fy2002 highway funding of 45 billion over the guaranteed level this meant that raba by giving 45 billion bonus in fy2002 and 44 billion cut in fy2003 created an 84 billion difference between fy2002 highway funding and fy2003 funding for more information see crs report

appropriations also supported total spending vel of nearly 136 billion for the faa like its senate counterpart the details of the bill differed in some wa ys from the administrations request the bill provided for larger general fund contribution for operations spending 35 billion the report accompanying the house bill enumerated growing concern about the long term health of the aviation trust fund the events of september 11 have reduced air travel with concomitant reduction in trust fund revenue collections as result the bill instructed the faa to reexamine its spending priorities in light of

fy2002 f unding level and significantly below the 249 million authorized for this activity by fair21 some of the difference is accounted for by proposed transfer of 50 million in appropriations to tsa

ost and receives its funding from designated user fees collected from overflig hts of united states territory by foreign aircraft eas has an annual authoriz ed funding level of 50 milli on the eas

estimates revenues fuel taxes and other fees accruing to the highway trust fund decreased in fy2001 as result of th then ongoing recession and the effects of september 11 most of this decrease in

means that the raba adjustment for fy2003 was negative 437 billion core highway program obligational authority for fy2003 w ould therefore have been cut from the tea21 guaranteed level of 277 billion to approximately 232 billion this 44 billion reduction in guaranteed spending combined with the fy2002 raba 45httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31308crs18 billion addition to the tea21 guaranteed spending resulted in potential 86 billion reduction from the fy2002 level this was an unexpected and unwelcome development for state and local governments whose longterm transportati on improvement plans tips

is also considered part of the discreti onary budget funding for the dot budget is derived from number of sources the ma jority of funding comes from dedicated transportation trust funds th remainder of dot funding is from federal treasury general funds the transportation trust f unds include the highway trust fund which contains two accounts the highway trust account and the transit account the airport and airway trust fund and the inland wa terways trust fund all of these accounts derive their respective funding fro m specific excise and other taxes in fy2002 trust funds accounted for well over twothirds of total federal transportation spending together highway and transit funding constitute the largest component of dot appropriations most highway and transit programs are funded with contract authority derived by the li nk to the highway trust fund this is very significant from budgeting standpoint c ontract authority is tantamount to but does not actually involve entering into cont ract to pay for pr oject at some future date under this arrangement specified in title 23 usc authorized funds are automatically made available at the beginning of each fiscal year and may be obligated without appropriati ons legislation although ppropriations are required to make outlays at some future da to cover these obligations where most federal programs require new budget authority as part of the annual appropriations process tr ansportation appropriators are faced with the opposite situation that is the authority to spend for the largest programs under their control already exists and the mechanism to oblig ate funds for these programs also is in place transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 during the 105th and 106th congresses major legislation changed the relationships between the largest transpor tation trust funds nd the federal budget the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 pl 105178 linked annual spending for highway programs di rectly to revenue collections for the highway trust fund in addition core high way and mass transit program funding was given special status in the discretionary tion of the federal budget by virtue of the creation of two new budget categories the act thereby created virtual firewall around highway and transit spending progra ms the funding guarantees were set up in way that makes it difficult for funding vels to be altered as part of the annual budgetappropriations pr ocess additional highway f unds can be provided annually by mechanism called revenue aligne d budget authority raba raba funds accrue to the trust fund as result of increased trust fund revenues for fy2003 however it now appears that the raba adjustment if it had been left intact during the appropriations process would have led to signif icant and unexpected drop in the availability of high way obligational funding tea21 changed the role of the hous and senate appr opriations and budget committees in determining annua l spending levels for high way and transit programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31308crs37 the appropriations committees are precluded from their former role of setting an annual level of obliga tions these were established by tea21 and are adjusted by an annual raba com putation in addition it appears that tea21 precludes at least in part the house and senate appropriations committees from exercising what some members view as their once traditional option of changing spending levels for specific core programs or projects in the fy2000 appropriations act the appropriators took some tent ative steps to regain some of their discretion over highway spending the fy2000 act called for the redistribution of some funds among programs and added two signifi cant spending projects in the fy2001 appropriations act the appropria tors continued in this vein by adding funds for large numbers of earmarked projects further the fy2001 act called for redirection of limited amount of funding between programs and includes significant additional funding for some tea21 programs this trend continued and even accelerated in the fy2002 act as appropriators made major redistributi ons of raba funds and in some instances transferred raba funds to agencies that are not eligible for raba funding under tea21 wendell h ford aviation investment and reform act for the 21st century fair21 or air21 the wendell h ford aviation inves tment and reform act for the 21st century fair21 or air21pl 106181 provide s socalled guarantee for federal aviation administration faa program spending the guarantee for aviation spending however is significantly diffe rent from that provided by tea21 instead of creating new budget categories the fair21 guarantee rests on adoption of two pointoforder rules for the house and the senate supporters of fair21 believe the new law requires significant new spending on aviation programs and for at least the fy2001 and fy2002 appropriations cycles sp ending grew significantly most observers view the fair21 guarantees how ever as being somewhat weaker than those provided by tea21 congress ca n and sometimes does waive pointsof order during considera tion of legislation enactment of tea21 and fair21 means th at transportation appropriators have total control over spending only for the ts the coast guard the federal railroad administration including amtrak and number of smaller dot agencies all of these agencies are concerned about their funding prospects in any year where it is believed that there is cons trained budgetary environmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31308crs38 appendix 2 transportation budget terminology transportation budgeting uses confusing lexicon for those unfamiliar with the process of budget authority and contract authority the latter form of budget authority contract authority provides obligational authority for the funding of trust fundfinanced programs such as the federa laid highway program prior to tea21 changes in spending in the annual tr ansportation budget component had been achieved in the appropriations process by combining changes in budgetcontract authority and placing limitations on obligations the principal function of the limitation on obligations is to control ou tlays in manner that corresponds to congressional budget agreements contract authority is tantamount to but does not actually involve entering into contract to pay for project at some future date under this arrangement specified in title 23 usc which tea21 amended authorized f unds are automatically made available to the states at the beginning of each fiscal year and may be obligated without appropriations legisl ation appropriations are re quired to make outlays at some future date to cover these obligations tea21 greatly limited the role of the appropriations process in core highway and transit programs because the act enumerated the limitation on obligations level for the period fy1999 through fy2003 in the statute highway and transit grant programs work on reimbursable basis states pay for projects up front and federal payments are made to them only when work is completed and vouchers are presented months or even years after the project has begun work in progress is represented in the trust fund as obligat ed funds and although they are considered used and remain as commitments against the trust fund balances they are not subtracted from balances trust fund balances therefore appear high in part because funds sufficient to cover actual and expected future commitments must remain available both the highway and transit accounts ve substantial shor t and longterm commitments these include payments that will be made in the current fiscal year as projects are completed and to much greater extent outstanding obligations to be made at some unspecified future date additionally there are unobligated amounts that are still dedicated to highway and transit projects but have not been committed to specific projects two terms are associated with the distribu tion of contract authority funds to the states and to particular prog rams the first of these apportionments refers to funds distributed to the states for formula driven programs for example all national highway system nhs funds are apportioned to the states allocated funds are funds distributed on an administrative ba sis typically to programs under direct federal control for example federal nds highway program monies are allocated the allocation can be to another federal agency to state to an indian tribe or to some other governmental entity these terms do not refer to the federal budget process but often provide frame of reference for high way program recipients who may assume albeit incorrectly that state apportionment is part of the federal budget per
