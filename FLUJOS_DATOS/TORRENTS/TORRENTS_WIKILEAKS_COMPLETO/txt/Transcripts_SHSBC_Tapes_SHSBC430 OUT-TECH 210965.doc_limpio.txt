outtech lecture given on 21 september 1965 thank you well you probably wont applaud so loud when you hear the kind of lecture im about to give you you know mean this is what date audience september 21st ad 15 twentyfirst of september isnt that awfully significant in some way what happened on the 21st of september fall or something all right i gave lecture on it i guess thats whats significant well you see i have reformed i have reformed and ive decided to lecture to you once in while but truth of the matter is there are so many lectures on tapes you see its rather like gilding it all and putting an unnecessary coat of paint on it and that sort of thing you see but the truth of the matter is whats happening at this particular moment is were in the eagleseyeview position do you see an eagles eye view that is were way up at the top of the gradation chart looking back down the lines now thats very optimum position to be in because you can see at once whats necessary and whats unnecessary you can take look at this and you can say well that stuff over there that just went into slight diversion dont you see and this material over here well that was not too important that datum right there though boy thats right straight through thats important do you see so that when youre taking an eagleseye view of the situation you can select importances of data now the one thing that the poor bloke down at the bottom of the line about along about has hes got an entirely different attitude hes got an entirely different attitude hes in sea of data and this sea of data is overwhelmingly and overpoweringly general every drop of water in the ocean has the same importance of every drop of water in the ocean hes unable to differentiate between one drop and another hes in this sad state then of drowning now he isnt drowning actually he doesnt start his drowning in scientology he starts his drowning in life and that is much more general than scientology at its early stages scientology at least tells you scientology is important but life is liable to tell you life is unimportant and life is important almost in the same breath in other words did you ever hear anybody say well life is unimportant hm it doesnt matter and so forth and then they say well life is very important and earnest you know next breath and then they say you should revere your parents the trouble with you is whats wrong with you is youve revered your parents see now the trouble with you is mr jones is sex here havent had enough and when you get all through you feel pretty groggy you start going through school for instance when you pick up body you get into kindergarten and so forth every teacher tells you that every datum in every part of subject is very important and not only that but each teacher tells you that only that subject is important really and when you get all through youve been told so much is important that you generally just go on retreat from the whole thing and the hardest thing that thetan has to do and the most significant thing he can recover across the boards is his ability to evaluate importances whats important and what isnt now processing the basic scheme of processing what is it the duplicative question the examination of the mind for the apparent answer to the question the knocking out then of this that and the other thing until the individual can take look at it and see before him some data that is important do you understand now you mustnt underestimate the value of the administration of processing as an entirely separate thing than what is processed in scientology we have developed the repetitive process which permits the individual to examine his mind and environment and out of it select the unimportances and importances now yes additionally he knocks out of restimulation he does little erasure he gets things out of his road he clarifies his view he can see better oh yes all of those things too but remember that all hes basically doing is taking look at the situation and finding out what is important and what isnt important but to do that he has to find out what is and what isnt that is even more fundamental so in all of the processing as you come up the line you are following in actual fact duplicative system of questioning which is in itself new strange and totally unique to scientology which makes the other things work other things work because of this do you see so it comes back in its original stages to the auditor now yes an individual can listen to few tapes and he can read few bulletins and read few books yes hell get great clarification of various things because all the time whats happening is is im presenting him with certain vistas of existence and conditions of existence and hes examining them and hes taking them in or knocking them out and handling it and reorienting himself dont you see now as he does this he however is straightening up his own mind and his real gain when the chips are all the way down largely depends upon the auditor and the auditor is very very important now the individual who is drowning in sea of life receives repetitive question from an auditor and his statements on it are the pcs statements on it are handled and asised and those statements are then acknowledged by the auditor making full cycle of the situation only then can get up to point of where he himself might all by himself confront his own mind hes got his own mind and life so mixed up that man has completely forgotten what mind was all about and in large numb the majority of cases isnt even aware of the fact he has mind he thinks the mind is himself hes made the same mistake that the religionist makes and the religionist has ball he talks about you must save your soul how you are going to save your soul im not sure see because your soul happens to be you but it would be too selfcentered and egotistical for you to go out on an allout crush of saving you wouldnt it so we have to divide this out so that it is save your soul and where is your soul well my soul is over there some theetieweetie will tell you yes i am over there oh i know im exteriorized now i am over there by the radiator now how can an individual be over there by the radiator well he cant be over there by the radiator because if he were exteriorized hed be oh im over here by the radiator do you see that so what is all this now it means that the importance the big important gain these all look important to you as you go up the line they all look important to you but the big ones the big ones actually are not at the top the big ones are getting started and you get some of the most startling gains from some fellow who walks in off the street and he starts to orient himself just by the fact that scientology exists that there is body of knowledge that leads somewhere that there is road out he starts orienting himself he gets tremendous gain now under expert handling by an auditor using duplicative question he is able to look at life and his own mind and himself and his circumstances and so forth and hes able to come up with additional gains and weve got tremendous numbers of things that can happen to this individual on improvement because its long ladder it isnt short ladder of course we live in society which rather demands of the individual that he takes twentytwogauge needle and receives it in the gluteus maximus with just one shot and at that moment goes whee im clear you see society has originated all youve got to do is eat one bowl of wheaties and you are superman well im afraid you have to work for it it isnt that scientology is slow its that man has gone so far down to dig him out at all is pretty heroic and the first step in making him come up the line is of course making him aware of the fact that such thing as scientology exists this alone will give him start but he actually makes his real first gains on becoming aware that there is road out because hes sure there is none hes heard that before hes been told that all he had to do was eat bowl of wheaties and he was superman you see and he ate bowls and bowls of wheaties and hes still not superman so whats the whats the dependency here basic dependency is upon your course supervisor the person who is teaching scientology thats basic dependency theres slightly prior dependency thats the fellow who disseminates scientology hes doing something for the society all like that just like that even though you get somebody up into arguing of is it or is it not hes better off than not being aware of it at all so you get the disseminator of scientology you get the teacher of scientology as in an introductory lecture as in early classes that sort of thing these people are performing tremendously important function and its function that you knowing the gains that can be achieved from auditing itself are prone to overlook if you present this acceptably and if you teach it so that it reaches in its early stages you will find the people right in front of your face are experiencing remarkable recoveries up along the road these things you dont ordinarily see because theyre not on an meter theyre not being categorized as an individual but ill give you an example i took rather raw crew of students one time and i did nothing but lecture to them nothing but lecture to them at all and got some of the best graph changes i have ever seen in an acc i didnt they didnt receive any auditing for six weeks at all auditing at all they just had lectures now some individual hears about scientology and having heard about it that there is road out hope resurges he thinks well maybe im not totally licked well that is something like finding straw in the middle of vast ocean of nowhere something exists now the suppressive counters this of course by saying it doesnt exist and it isnt and it isnt any good and it isnt that because all the suppressive is saying boy the last thing in the world i want to have happen to you is that you get any better because if you got any better you would then get stronger and im having hard enough time murdering you now so therefore therefore the person who begins with the dissemination of it he reaches people hes giving them the straw in the very tumultuous ocean something to grip on to then the fellow who tells them about it who teaches them why he gets another upward movement and then it comes into the hands of the auditor now in the auditor its in very sure hands because theres ways to audit and ways not to audit and theres ways to do good job on pc and ways not to and the big upsurging gains that the individual makes that can be marked on chart and so forth are of course found in auditing sessions but remember that if the disseminator and the teacher did not do their job first that person never gets into the chair of the auditor so the biggest mistake you can make is not to disseminate scientology and to teach it in an unacceptable fashion those are big steps that can be very badly muffed now when you reach into society at large and try to get some common denominators that you can get people to agree with and walk on forward with and so forth youre talking to very confused and very distracted people so that you actually could have many approaches and probably many answers as to how to do it one of the soundest of those answers is speak to them about communication and teach them simply one that scientology does exist that he has got some friends somewhere in the world that there is somebody interested in what happens to him this is all part of the message that scientology exists and then your next line that you throw to him and so on is that there is some value in being able to communicate you teach him the datum really that if he could communicate to his environment better he could handle it better now thats dicey because some fellows know that if you communicate you will be punished do you understand so youre selling across that line that hes afraid to communicate and you tell him well its all right and he eventually does get the idea that if he could just communicate bit better he could handle his life better now of course thats that is one of these horribly obvious truisms that you as as an auditor are so familiar with that you forget that this is new strange and startling datum to the man in the street that if an alarm clock is rolling off the table if you stopped the alarm clock from rolling off the table it would be better than letting it drop on the floor and therefore when you reach over and stop the alarm clock from falling off the table you are then handling your environment but if you dont know enough to reach over and stop the alarm clock from falling off the table you are not handling your environment you get the idea well he agrees with this of course he says well thats silly and you say well now if you talk to your wife about the situation it probably would straighten up better now thats getting adventurous and he looks that over so you fix it up on the basis that he might you say well now he might be she might be rather upset at first but itd come out better in the long run and nervously he tries to communicate to somebody and he has some wins and he has some loses and gradually it moves into his perimeter that there is some truth in this that if you communicate in your environment you can handle it better and if you dont communicate at all you dont handle it at all and you just get worse now when the auditor moves in on it and this fellow has never been able to pass driving test in his life and the auditor says touch that car and withdraw from that car and so on and he puts him through familiarization of just touch assist on car the fellow goes out and passes his driving test now thats very convincing thats very convincing he finds out all kinds of wild things happen with such basic and fundamental thing as touch assist hes now being brought up right he can now see the gains and so forth so that your first wins on dissemination and teaching scientology do not naturally have to follow perfect line they it can be pretty wobbly line and you can still get them along it but when it comes to that auditing line that if it is wobbly will sink him in other words our first touchy operation that weve really got to know our business on is auditing and that doesnt matter whether youre auditing little child or youre auditing dog or youre auditing somebody on very upstage processes it doesnt matter that auditing has got to be good its got to contain its auditing cycle its got to be addressed to the general condition of the person whom youre auditing the questions have to be understood and acceptable to the person you are auditing these conditions have got to be straight and youve got to be able to do good job so that although its very important to move the person in toward auditing remember that when you have moved him in toward auditing then we are now in position where technology is technology with an exclamation point up to that time its debatable its debatable what is the best way to disseminate scientology because youre disseminating into such confusion life as it exists its also debatable whats the best thing to lecture to people about scientology see thats also debatable now its little less debatable but its still debatable and we can have lots of opinions on this do you see the only common denominator we have well we tell them about communication and that sort of thing people seem in general to be happy with this but thats still subject to number of questions see and we can debate on this and find out this system is better that system is better what you tell students when they first come into scientology should be and then we can have opinions on it and weve had personal experiences you get the idea but when we move it into tech we are longer in debatable sphere that is such highly sophisticated highly developed technology that it works only if it is right along the line one two three four do you see that so we move out of the debatability of life into the precision of auditing and auditing is very precise now when we say technology is out although we might also include that we have instructors who refuse to let students study bulletins or something like this technology would be out you see if the instructor was never in the classroom and wouldnt give the students any bulletins and refused to teach them anything we would say that it was out but anybody would see that it was out do you understand anybody could see that fellow wasnt teaching scientology and so forth that well thats easy to see ah but auditing the ability to observe auditing and tell whether or not it is good or bad is far far more precise that is much harder to do we can observe whether the teaching is right or wrong thats easy but to observe whether the auditing is right or wrong thats much harder to do in the first place the auditor can make little tiny mistakes little microscopic mistakes that sufficiently upset the preclear that the preclear then acts up and the casual observer would then say that is simply difficult preclear do you follow where as matter of fact the auditor goofed somewhere you have to be very very good auditor to be able to perceive good and bad auditing now in the earlier days particularly the newer students on course would be observed to miss on tv demonstrations the most horrible auditing goofs you ever heard of you would ask them for an analysis of the session they have just seen and the new student being relatively unfamiliar with the subject of auditing he wouldnt be able to find any and quite uniformly he would say the best session there was the one that had the most goofs in it here ill give you an example he sees the auditor sitting there and the pc is little bit critical and the auditor with soothing syrup sort of butters the pc down and the pc subsides you see and they say wasnt that wonderful job of auditing and theyre absolutely amazed when the supervisor would say well that guy has flunked get him back to unit so and so and get him trained and the new student says get him back to unit so but the guy absolute genius look at the fellow he just said now now thats all right or well take that up later you get the idea of this they werent educated enough in it to see whether it was goofed now frankly almost any auditing is better than auditing so therefore what youre bargaining for is only about 60 or 70 percent of the gains of auditing youd get 30 or 40 percent of the gains of auditing you see if it was all goofed up just by duplicative question and somebody being interested in the fellow youre going to get some gain see but how about getting real gains out of this well when we say outtech which is what this lecture concerns when we say outtech we dont mean in actual fact that some auditor isnt sitting there interestedly auditing the pc we really dont mean that its not as corny as whats outsupervision see or outinstruction we mean that theyre just not getting that 60 percent of the gains see theyre settling for 20 30 40 percent of the gain and letting it go at that we mean tech is out because they are not getting out of auditing what they should be getting out of auditing on 100 percent basis do you follow this in other words is the niceties of the thing are not with it so that we can have an hgc which is auditing with mad enthusiasm pcs are coming in and theyre being audited and theyre being set goal and all this and this is all going on and we say goodness isnt that busy hgc and the auditors are seldom late for auditing sessions and that sort of thing and whenever pcs blow they get them right back to ethics really snap and pop see and we say tech is out somebody will say but thats impossible oh thats not impossible at all theyre just only getting 20 or 30 percent of what they ought to be getting why it is simply and entirely and completely matter of the fine points of auditing are missing and what really goes wrong with cases is not understood theyre sitting there giving the auditing command yes but making lots of goofs with it yes now what does it take to make good auditor now fellow who is good auditor is so far above somebody who can audit that it would take an expert in actual fact to differentiate the difference in other words youd have to be an awfully good auditor to watch the difference and watch what he is doing youd also have to be something of case supervisor youd have to know these various phenomena so good auditor is what it takes to get good results whats good auditor well lets take up here the first part of this the gaes now youve heard of this gae long time and this has not really to any great degree been published its not really been published the way it could have been published these are the five gaes and there are only really five gaes really only five cant handle and read the emeter gross auditing error gae auditor is sitting there hes got meter in front of him hes got pc connected to the meter hes getting blowdowns hes getting this and that and he sees falls falls occur but he doesnt see these falls do you understand hes getting tone arm action but he never adjusts the tone arm so as to be able to record or note the action you got the idea or when he brings his tone arm back to set and so forth he overcompensates so the pc is getting 435 divisions of ta for twoandahalf hours in other words he just goofed up on this subject about the emeter that needle moves he doesnt see it that tone arm moves he doesnt see it the needle doesnt move at all and he sees it move this type of error big errors now itd take fellow who could run an emeter in order to detect whether or not somebody was running an emeter right oh man can look terribly competent you know i see lot of these medical instruments and i see these fellows around in white coats and lead aprons and although why they use lead apron i wouldnt know but they here are these fellows and theyre all duded up and theyre reading meters and dials and turning them on and off honest some of their machines cover the wall and when theyre all finished reading that and looking so scientific and so forth they dont know anything about the person whatsoever and an emeter could have found it out long time earlier without any white coats and without whole wall it doesnt then matter the pose with which you handle an emeter or the attitude with which you handle the emeter the emeter just is reads do you see it read you see it doesnt read do you see that it doesnt read i mean its elementary when you adjust the tone arm well have you adjusted it or have you overadjusted it or not adjusted it you know thats it now let assure you every time you see an auditing session break down one of these gaes is going to be out one of them is going to be out man and dont go looking for whether or not he was worried about his girl friend while he was giving the session as the reason for giving lousy session its never that its always gross auditing error its always big one so outtech when it comes down to research on outtech if you go around looking for specks of dust on the session youre going to be wrong what you want is boulder and there are only five boulders and one of these boulders is going to be in that session i assure you theres one place where the case supervisor very often takes his finger off of his number he forgets these gaes and he thinks its something about the pc or its something about the process or its something about this and something about that and if that case supervisor went right down to it and looked real hard he would find in that session one of these gaes well weve covered the meter one lets get the next one doesnt know and apply technical data now actually the original writing of that was couldnt read and apply an hcob thats gross auditing error that also comes to the case supervisor the case supervisor says give the person an assessment for any present time problem and this auditor who has this as gross auditing error youll find out its rather consistent with this person will simply say to the pc you got any problems and then write assessment negative do you see so you gave one instruction and some other action resulted well its gross auditing error not to be able to read and apply auditing directions or bulletin or something you should be able to read it and apply it it isnt necessary that you have to do that one but dont do something else and think youve done that one you see thats the gross auditing error really the ability to read and apply data thats all now that actually moves into the zone of the next gross auditing error and the next gross auditing error is cant get or keep pc in session boy you will just be amazed how often that is the case the pc is flying all around the place and saying oh well my im terribly worried you know i have an appointment with bill this afternoon and i want to make sure that ive gone and and and the auditor says heres the next auditing question yeah well i hope i make the appointment with bill all right the auditor says well heres the next question do birds rap and the pc says do birds rap do birds i think yeah well i dont know about that but i do want to get out there in time to catch bill when he drives by well all right now do birds rap you see that can be so gross that the auditor doesnt even see that the pc is totally out of session pc isnt with it well now getting and keeping pc insession is little body of technology in itself part of the communication formula is youve got to get somebodys attention see youve got to get somebodys attention before you can tell them something well if the pcs attention is flying all over the mest universe how are you going to get his attention long enough to get in an auditing command so what you ought to do is try to find his where his attention is going to it actually doesnt matter much how you do it dont do it on an endless itsa but where is this guy whats he thinking about well naturally theres only few things that he could be thinking about he could be arc broken or he could have present time problem or hes got withhold or hes got an overt ill take those up in minute but thats the auditor who cant get the pc insession and keep the pc insession and so forth is actually committing gross auditing error because hes sitting there applying process to nobody in nothing he hasnt got any pc to audit now the ne plus ultra of this is of course is of course down in silliness these are all pretty gross but this can get that silly that he just didnt tell the pc to come to session didnt have pc in session and didnt himself appear and youll be very surprised to find out how often that was the source of gain for your pc youd just be amazed i know you say well such errors as that cant possibly exist the devil they cant man we had somebody around here who was just having an awful time few weeks ago and the hco exec sec and area sec and ethics officer were about to shoot this person down in flames for just raising the devil all over the place an investigation i heard about this and i said you wait minute see i know my auditing i said theres something else here youd better look at that just little bit further little bit further and they looked and ill be of gun that pc had been ended and wasnt audited for five consecutive days although toppriority pc gross auditing error didnt audit the pc much less just didnt get the pc in session you follow so at the bottom of all this stew and stir was sure enough one of these gaes do you understand pc wasnt being audited of course the pc was upset pc paid for auditing and wasnt getting audited obvious auditor never appeared in session pcs name never appeared on the assignment board you got the idea so gross auditing error dont you go looking for dust motes now cant get the pc insession and keep pc insession well that is very broadly stated and purposely so because there are innumerable ways to keep pc out of session such as locking the door other ways is the pc comes right into session sits right in the chair is totally insession says ive got the answer to that all night long ive had the answer to that next question and ive got it and so forth and i had terrific cognition on it and the auditor says well well have to go over the rudiments first so part of this could be the pc is right there in session madly you see and the auditor carefully picks him up by the scruff of the neck and moves him right out well have to find out if theres some reason you cant go into session before we audit you now im making jokes here but honestly these things occur and thats gross auditing error and thats gross auditing error number three all right now gross auditing error number four is cant complete an auditing cycle the auditor simply cant complete an auditing cycle now its quite remarkable that all this obsessive itsa you see will lay right here in this number four you know the pc just talked and talked and talked and talked and talked and talked and talked and you couldnt get question in sideways whats wrong with that pc well in life or in auditing sessions he has been prematurely acknowledged so often that he feels that hes never been acknowledged premature acknowledgment fellow says maybe to his mother you know habitually ive got brilliant idea and his mother says thats very good or instead of acknowledging they argue are you sure you have answered the question i asked you i asked you do birds fly and you said when they had wings now are you sure that that is an answer to the question i asked you in other words he stops the roll of the auditing cycle well believe there are literally hundreds of ways you can stop an auditing cycle from completing one of the ways is not starting one ive had this happen to in the early days of auditing the auditor simply sat there id answered the auditing command and the auditor simply sat there and said nothing literally factually true twenty minutes i dont know to this day whether or not it was the auditor couldnt think of the next auditing command never started the cycle to finish you got that that was all now therell be something wrong with that auditing cycle and thats gross auditing error to have something goofed up about your auditing cycle now you can get your auditing cycle better and better and better but there is point when it is passable auditing cycle and that is you ask the question the pc answers it and you say cheers you know if you can do that why from there on it really isnt gross auditing error it simply needs refinement and polish gross auditing error when you come down on it as number four gross auditing error cant complete an auditing cycle it will be something utterly mad if its really getting in the road of the session it will be completely gruesome the auditor never asks the auditing question just qsandas with every answer the pc says well i think my mother you know answered the auditing question who did you know you know i think my mother all right what about your mother oh well she had bunions what about bunions wheres this session going its going to go over the hills and get lost completely started one auditing cycle never finished it off never did anything with it never repeated it you got it if youre ever case supervising and you suddenly detect that your pc he could only get in one auditing question in twoandahalfhour session whats this it must have been that he prematurely acknowledged it or he must have told the pc not to say it or the pc is stark staring crazy and has been audited by somebody who only prematurely acknowledged theres something very wrong here and you got to handle it man you got to handle it auditing sessions will not progress because theres gross auditing error present here of some kind or another and somebody couldnt complete an auditing cycle thats for sure and the auditor for sure isnt handling the fact so that he can do you understand you could go even on this basis you find out you say do fish swim and to the some actual process you see and the pc says oh well now when you bring up something like that that brings to mind time when i was taking ichthyology in the university of glasgow and so forth and i had professor who had bugs in his skull and we used to have to get flit guns in the middle of class and blow them in his ear an auditor who listens to that very long without spotting something is in error and hes unable to finish his auditing cycle and who doesnt do anything about it has not even become aware that he should finish an auditing cycle do you see so its gross auditing error in just not knowing he should finish an auditing cycle do you follow youve seen pcs wander on and on and on theyre the very lowlevel guys in staggery frame of mind out in life you get ahold of them and you start asking repetitive questions psychologists are the real howl the psychologist is certain that an auditing question is disposed of by being answered once and its really crazy auditing those boys they have given you the answer you talk about fixated subject every question has one answer oh brother so of course they never discovered repetitive auditing all right thats number four cant complete an auditing cycle now number five is cant complete repetitive auditing cycle and thats gae now completely aside from an auditing cycle how about repetitive auditing cycle and youd be just be amazed at the trouble we had in early days of getting somebody to at least say do fish swim second time and by the time they had been duplicative for about three or four consecutive questions with somebody holding pistol on them their head began to burst and they started falling apart at the seams it was asking too much that they repeat the auditing question all sorts of shifts were gone to and we eventually developed the trs and then we also developed op pro by dup opening procedure by duplication and that is simply calculated to cure somebody of this weird malady but you should hear somebody who had just been caught and is just brought in for training when he is first told to do duplicative auditing command hes supposed to ask this question over and over and over many of them get away with it but youll find some bird who knows the proper thing to do is vary it do fish swim have you any idea about the swimming characteristics of fish see do you mind if we discuss fish give synonym for fish he thinks hes duplicating the auditing question now in other words these are the five gaes these are the five gaes which if committed will dish auditing squarely and tremendously just like that itll be finished now when youre case supervising and youre looking over auditors this is what you look over when you find that youre consistently having misses you look over this one you look over the five gaes on the auditor when youre when youre case supervising then you tell anybody responsible for training this is what im trying to relay that they had jolly well better look over the five gross auditing errors on that auditor because that auditor isnt going along all right the sessions werent going along all right so we suspect at once one of the five gaes if not two or three we dont inspect the antagonism of this girl for large ruddyfaced men we dont examine the auditors case you see we dont do this we dont do that all we do and so on is when we say john doakes has been having very rough time auditing his last two or three pcs i want you to go over this pc this auditor and find out what the score is now the training officer should not then get the auditor audited training officer should promptly and immediately check this guy out on five gaes can this guy read an emeter you sometimes find out hes been bluffing for long time hes needed glasses for quite while but as scientologist he doesnt dare wear them he cant even see the blur of the needle you find weird things like this if you look for them if you look for the gross error youre going to handle the situation but if you just look for little dust specks and dust motes and so forth youll never get to it and this is the list of the gross errors then you want to know you give him little checkout give him little checkout say well lets see last week you were studying up on assessment and so forth and we went into assessment quite little bit in the training classes heres little examination on assessment and the fellow cant pass any corner of it whats the matter with him well he doesnt know and apply his technical data so now now we could maybe go into his case little bit we could say what would happen to you if you did apply some technical data is there anything wrong with applying straight data oh well there isnt all right well then what word have you misunderstood in scientology and thats the secret of it and were away so wed straighten out his vocabulary all of sudden he could know and apply technical data you understand so we might go into it on case basis but only if we reached that point there doesnt know and apply technical data wed find out if he could get and keep pc insession wed ask him such an offhand question as whats wrong with pc whos critical of the auditor flunk the guyd say flunk you didnt give chance to answer it huh gave you second and half to answer the question as you ought to know that in millisecond you ought to know that right now that pc has got withhold and nothing else oh well i thought there were several other reasons there arent any other reasons gae do you see cant get and keep pc insession well he doesnt know the various things which take pc out of session or get pc insession so how the devil could he get pc insession or keep him out of session if he didnt know what took pcs out of session or got them back into session he couldnt do that at all could he so itd be gross auditing error on his part he just doesnt know that that little list of things because its not long and if he cant complete an auditing cycle we can tell that fast enough all weve got to do is set him up with some trs and inspect how he does his trs and youll find out about maybe he can do 1 2 and 3 or 0 all right but when you get him to 4 every time he hits origin matter how you run origin complicatedly or simply or anything of that sort he will go appetite over tin cup on this whole basis he cant handle the whole package all together the pc says something unexpected hes thrown now you know whatll happen this person will qanda with the pc because he gets thrown all the time the pc originates gee the wall is covered with spiders and the auditor says thats i didnt get that far in my drills and then we go into the inability to repeat an auditing cycle well one of the ways to do that is just go into any kind of repetitive line does the pc does this auditor get nervous make him say constantinople fifty times does this make him nervous youll find it will if he cant complete an auditing cycle oh boy he knows what happens if hes in the same place twice you get shot life is dangerous so that that handles where we consider outtech that handles what can be wrong with the auditor and thats all that can be wrong with an auditor and if you go and imagine bunch of other things can be wrong with an auditor why thats silly and so forth because even if you get to such extremities as the auditor is unable to talk at all not having any tongue or something well he cant complete an auditing cycle do you understand he cant even start one so youd have to teach him how to audit by writing his commands down well he cant write all right well fix him up so you teach him how to write there was somebody around the other day we were having to teach the english language so he could run r6 it was very interesting i think he was unable to run it in his own native language because hed forgotten it and he didnt know english well enough to run it in r6 and so forth well the answer to that was very elementary learn english so these things are resolvable but if you dont know that those are the five gross auditing errors then you cant resolve an auditor in his training or activities now lets go to the other side of this auditing team and lets take up pc and although this is much weightier and longer technology and you know is very difficult technology the actual fact is there are only four things really that can be wrong with pc but well expand it to six just to be happy about the thing we cover these in the hcob of 13 september 1965 out of which were speaking but i did not put in here the five gross auditing errors but could well have done so i gave some other data concerning the analysis of auditors i give you now very fundamental data on the analysis of an auditor whether or not he can audit hell have one of his five gross auditing errors out now lets take up pc which is very very important and lets find out what about the pc well there can be two things wrong with pc that immediately dont really come into the auditing session but tell whether or not the pc should be audited there are only two things these are only two things the pc is suppressive or the pc is pts now in either case youre running into heavy weather now what is suppressive well suppressive actually is somebody who doesnt get any case gain and that in actual fact is taken up under the later one here of the continuing overts he really doesnt get case gain because of continuing overts now suppressive is simply defined as for your information regardless this is an auditors viewpoint now not an ethics officers viewpoint but suppressive is somebody who doesnt get any case gain and you say well isnt that nice that lets you out so you dont have to get case gain on this fellow and if you dont get case gain on this fellow you just get rid of the whole thing you dont have to do better technical job you just say hes suppressive haha that lets us out well the truth of the matter is in my experience its very nearly impossible not to get case gain very close to impossible not to get case gain youre only talking about 2½ percent of the pcs in actual fact youll have trouble with about 20 percent of the pcs because theyre sps or ptses but in actual fact only about 2½ percent of the total pcs running along the line now this doesnt include the society as whole but its certainly people who come into scientology or around scientology youre only handling about 2½ percent of them that are suppressive now it doesnt mean that you didnt get gain in the session so therefore the fellow was suppressive it means this fellow has been audited by this one and that and the other one and people have really tried and this person gets case gain well it so happens that were good enough today to be able to say sp what makes an sp an sp from an auditors standpoint he is not even vaguely really interested in what makes an sp an sp hes just interested in the fact that you shouldnt ought to audit one and devote and dedicate your life to auditing an sp who isnt going to get any case gain anyhow whats going to happen to this fellow well im afraid he should have thought about that before he started going so bad so hes still populating the universe when the rest of us arent whats this worry about the sp believe he never worries about you now what about this boy well actually its covered down here under six on the same list as ive just said he actually is committing continuing overts now trying to get those continuing overts off and trying to get to the source of those continuing overts and trying to move forward with any kind of case gain on this person at all is very very hard to do but can be done and the only process that will really handle suppressive the only series of processes are power processes second stage release and that will handle one now occasionally person can be overaudited so heavily and so far particularly overaudited let us say on r6ew or in some very powerful process and theyve just been audited up the spout they thereafter wont get any case gain you have to go back and pick them up where they should have been picked up and rehabilitate where they were overrun before theyll get case gain and the funny part of it is is during that period the persons actions will be slightly suppressive quite interesting dont confuse then somebody whos been overrun and isnt getting any case gain the last few days what you want is on suppressive is hes never gotten any case gain it doesnt ever exist he has never had any case gain he has never had any ta you get the idea thats the category and youll find out that about 2½ percent of the people that are around on the streets and so forth will come under that category and he doesnt get case gain because he continually commits little tiny overts he is so engaged in fighting some imaginary battle in the past that he has time to have any friends in the present everyone to him is an enemy and each individual is an everyone he is the master of generalities the world itself around him is aaa hes actually in pretty mad spin and in institutions there are only two types of people suppressives and ptses there is nothing else in an institution from top to bottom therefore the poor old ruddy psychiatrist never gets crack at anything but suppressive or pts that is why consistently i have said to you dont fool with the insane i couldnt give you pat explanation of why you shouldnt fool with the insane but i told you you just shouldnt well that is why the insane are composed you see well theres an insane person hes always fighting an imaginary enemy thats one of the biggest definitions of insanity or hes retreating madly from an imaginary enemy and then in the insane asylum you will find the ptses that the sps have put there and you do anything for this person this pts and of course the sp will cave him in again within twenty four hours of contact youre going to see this inevitably you couldnt win if you had to here then is this whole subject of insanity now what is pts number one the pc case does not advance only six reasons case does not advance number one the pc is suppressive all right we could go into that we could get the person to saint hill and so forth but remember we dont have any padded cells here we cant accommodate certain types of personnel here we have hospital keepers guards all that sort of thing youd just be surprised how many people are walking around in that society out there who do need keepers and guards its quite interesting there are lot of them and because the psychiatrist isnt any better than he is he really cant spot his really insane people oh he spots them when they finally wind up in his lap his recognition is up to recognizing an insane person when the insane person is dropped in his lap but going out into the society and trying to analyze who is crazy and who isnt the psychiatrist being pts professionally himself has not actually done anything more than just give you big generality everybody is crazy you find menninger was saying that well everybody is crazy you know its quite interesting some people are more crazy than others hes not right at all hes not right at all every once in while guy gets sensation like hes going to blow his top or going nuts thats for sure but if he recognizes it is sensation he isnt crazy because crazy person never finds out now potential trouble source is simply for an auditors from an auditors viewpoint somebody connected to suppressive thats all potential trouble source is dont look for any other trimmings and from an auditor and case supervisors viewpoint pts potential trouble source is always recognized as rolly coaster now rolly coaster that unfortunately adds another tough term to scientology technology and vocabulary but rolly coaster is simply just that person goes up and he goes down and he goes up and he goes down and its just jollyo billyo around the corners whoop up ah whee i feel fine oh its terrific uah oh i feel awful now the psychiatrist specialized in type of thing called manic depressive maybe you remember the term that means the guy is www up and the guy is down manic up depressive down the manicdepressive is one of the common and standard symptoms of insanity but in some types of insanitytypes of insanity why its manifested mainly as just frozen fish you know the guy doesnt go up or down and thats the suppressive you got it psychiatrist has differentiated then between the manicdepressive and the paranoid the paranoid doesnt change hes already got his types see but this manicdepressive action is simply symptomatic of person being next to an undetected suppressive and i dont care whether hes insanely manicdepressive or sanely manicdepressive he feels good today and bad tomorrow dont you see thats rolly coaster now we particularly mean rolly coaster is he feels good after auditing and then feels bad he leaves the session hes terrific his tone arm is down everything is going along fine hes had some good cognitions the somatic is gone he walks out of that session he comes back to the next session and hes on the bottom and you say oh ive must have done something wrong oh the pc must have selfaudited oh figure figure figure figure figure figure and until you really till you really got your wits wrapped around this important datum youre going on figuring yourself to death about this that person is pts and then the next little bridge youre going to cover is well he couldnt be pts because he didnt meet the suppressive person between sessions now youve interjected that arbitrary nobody else has he didnt have to all he had to think was what will jonesy think about this do you follow person didnt have to be present you dont have to locate the physical presence this suppressive is around in the environment even though theyre ten thousand miles away do you see person rolly coastering theres only one reason person rolly coasters and that isnt because an auditor forgets to say end of session with the proper happy lilt in his voice that person felt good on monday and on tuesday came into session feeling bad now an auditor can pull couple of accidental suppressive acts like refuse to acknowledge the pc or arc break and make the guy feel worse were not talking about that sort of thing were talking about just pure outright rolly coaster and theres only one thing wrong with rolly coaster and that is he is potential trouble source meaning he is connected to suppressive i imagine ethics officers around the world are learning this and unlearning it and relearning it and all of sudden will eventually sort it out and say by god thats true you know because every once in while they cant find the sp they cant find the suppressive why do we say potential trouble source because they always commit trouble and thats the big generality that you can make about pts sooner or later youre going to have trouble any time you got we got one the other day i well the other day weve had one hanging around the fringes for about i dont know five six months and he wasnt convinced there was any sp and sp had been really located on the case and confirmed and so forth and this person was going up to hasi london and getting audited and getting tremendous results and going down to the bottom the next week and so on and they finally found the suppressive and got the good indicators in and straightened the person out after this long period of time actually it was just really not really convincingly locating the sp in that persons life and thats the only thing that masks it because an sp speaks totally in generalities an sp speaks everybody thinks you are heel like the community believes you are dog you see men are always like that all men are like that this is this type of sweeping generality and the guys are not locatable in the environment they just sort of butter themselves all over the environment and you try to get case to go spot suppressive in its vicinity and i havent got any theres nobody there this person has spoken in generalities to such point that he doesnt exist anymore hes just generality himself hes everybody so in scientology these days we know this well enough and somebody who sails in and so forth and says well everybody thinks we advertise too much the hco sec will inevitably say what is everybodys name or who is everybody and the person will think for moment and think for moment well his name is sweeney and good indicators will come in now if you audit this person youre just setting this person up and if you audit this person to tremendously successful gain you may get him killed i say that advisedly you know just shot down in his tracks lets say you really pulled the technology out and boy you really did bangup job of auditing man you really cleaned up this case and this case was just sailing of course you couldnt get the case up to clear which is where youd have had to take the case and you sent the case home at the end of the intensive and the person is really walking on air one of two things will happen this has happened the sp has committed suicide bang just like that or the sp just walks out in the kitchen and pours the arsenic into the coffee because they cant have anybody better theyre having enough trouble killing them while theyre sick do you see that you really you really can walk pts right straight into it man maybe its not that dramatic but it will be that gruesome so you really shouldnt audit an sp or pts actually here at saint hill we really shouldnt take on sps we can do so because were insouciant thats word you can look up afterwards but there we are theres the two things now and one of these days you will suddenly come up with tremendously important datum exclamation point that by god rons right person rolly coasters only because hes connected to suppressive person and you jolly well better not audit them and most of the trouble weve had has come from ptses actually not from sps but ptses sps have incited it all but the trouble has been made by the pts quite fascinating but see the trouble is made by the pts becoming better and then the sp gets desperate and makes all kinds of trouble do you get the idea so the source of the trouble is our auditing pts we wouldnt get any trouble auditing the sp because he wouldnt go anyplace anyhow all hed do is snarl and so forth and make an auditor bit unhappy and miserable but he wont do anything like when you audit pts and its very discouraging to an auditor this guy was fine on monday collapses on friday the auditor is absolutely certain he has done something wrong he hasnt done anything wrong except audit pts he audited potential trouble source and didnt recognize it there was another earlier rolly coaster and this is one of the things case supervisor on pcs has to be very alert to there was an earlier rolly coaster and they explained it all away oh it was because he was up too late that night yes i know the earlier rolly coaster that was last week on thursday when he was feeling so good and came back to the session on friday and was feeling so bad they ran that down and that turned out to be having been up too late thursday night they ignore that and there the guy rolly coasters again and so forth and people are wondering what on earth is going on here well they just werent industrious enough locating the sp of last week see what was it who is it where is it thats what you want to locate and when youve got that located you go right on hunting until you do locate it too because when you do locate the sp why the good indicators will all come in on the pc but if the pc has accepted the fact that you have located the sp and the good indicators arent in you havent found the sp thats the little technology back of that thats been quite interesting if you find the right sp youll always get the good indicators in if you dont find the right suppressive person to which the pts is connected you will not get the good indicators in and its as obvious as all that thats another one of these simple elementary things when you push down on the accelerator the engine will run faster and when you take your foot off the accelerator the engine will run slower you regulate the engine with the accelerator somebody goes out and they say im very sure you regulate the engine with the brake well they gets little tiny success of regulating it with the brake they try going sixty miles an hour and putting on the brake while leaving the car in gear and it slows down the engine so they say see burns the engine up but then that doesnt much burns the brakes up too long as they as long as they dont know this very interesting little datum then they keep coming cropper see they get in there somebody operates without meter or they cant run meter or something like this and they try to they found this person rolly coastered and then they try to get on this person what person it was and then they cant find one or they find one and they say well its your aunt mamie and the person says oh all right aunt mamie ill disconnect from her all right that pts is not pts because of aunt mamie nuh uh good indicators didnt come in your meter didnt blow up do you follow its very positive i mean its one of these things im actually trying to describe to you something but all the points im describing to you in this particular lecture are the types of points you make with searchlights see searchlights in perfectly black night i mean theyre of that value and importance this isnt just bunch of tiny data that is all buried with the dust motes you see these are the basic regulating data is what im talking to you about all on the basis of getting tech in so those are the first two you could consider them technical but actually to large degree they are personal and when we get right down to it then there are four the remainder of the six there are four things then that can be wrong with case and thats all that weve finished the whole door weve got it all built right there at that point and it opens and the corridor is long beyond it thats the lot and if youre going around worrying about somebody isnt being audited because i havent got the right process because if i just assess something or other with my left hand instead of my right hand and krishnamurti said that time was the devourer of all men maybe he has an eating fantasy thats mixed up with sex youre just talking in bunch of balderdash because there arent very many reasons why cases dont get along well first is the sp the second the guy is pts all right if youve gotten rid of those two and hes neither of those two then one of these remaining will be it not might be it will be it and they are arc broken pc is arc broken pc has got present time problem of long duration that comes under categories like hidden standards and all that sort of thing theyre just present time problems of long duration and number five the pcs got withhold or misunderstood word which is withhold of understanding hes withholding himself from it or reverse and number six continuing overts which he then withholds and that makes suppressive and there arent any more things which drive tech out than that because case supervisor who doesnt look at those things then cant get any process to work from there on down now what are the processes processes are things that work if these six things arent there got it so when you say tech is out in certain area you are saying they are trying to make processes work while paying attention to the five gross auditing errors in auditors and attention or minimum attention to the six things that prevent case from advancing you follow that so if you ignore these six things and try to go on auditing cases process under the sun moon and stars is going to work but the funny part of it is if these six cases are okay practically any process under the sun moon and stars will work which is quite fascinating the only reason process doesnt work is because it has worked and is now being madly overrun you got it processes dont work beyond the point when theyre finished you cant lift any more concrete off the sidewalk than there is concrete in the sidewalk and you try to lift more and people are going to get upset now therefore if anything goes wrong with technology from the case supervisors viewpoint on behalf of the auditor it is covered in these five gross auditing errors those satisfied if case does not advance and so forth then the case isnt advancing because of these six things pc is suppressive pc is pts pc is arc broken pc has present time problem of long duration pc has withhold or misunderstood word and continuing overts are hidden from view now honest thats all im talking now about an eagleseye view of the track and the mind and human beings and when you look back over it all on the vast oceans of data that we could be covering here and so forth you find out that if tech is out then its just covered in that list either one or more of the five gross auditing errors are present or one of these six things is wrong with the pc thats all there isnt whether he paid his dues to the i will arise burial society it isnt because he hasnt paid for his emeter so thats the total lump sum of important barriers that stop progress in auditing and believe i have been at this now for about actually eighteen years and i can tell you there are data that lie outside these data there are other data and i tell you that forcefully just mainly because i dont want you to go on stumbling around thinking that youre going to find one because youre cleaning clean youre looking for something else that isnt there now therefore analysis of outtech would bring about getting tech in well how would you get tech in well youd get tech in by fixing it up so these five gross auditing errors werent being made and so these six things when one of these six things when wrong with case would be promptly detected and handled and tech would then be in tech would be in well and youd go on and audit standard processes and all goes along like well oiled dream theres nothing worrisome or upsetting you have minimum upsets along the line then when all of sudden something shows up over the horizon some auditor is on his second pc and hasnt made very fast gains on the first pc and he didnt make very he isnt making it very good and he all of sudden is having big problem and suddenly comes up and wants to suddenly run give that hand in the middle of power process dont for gods sakes qanda with that at all dont qanda with that at all just go back to stable data because youre going to be led all over the pasture one of these five things is wrong with the auditor or one of these six things is wrong with the pc i dont care what the auditor said if its some departure from what you know to be standard or its suggestion that is over the hills and far away that doesnt have very much to do with the price of fish or theyre demanding that we change processes and run six of them in one session or theres something peculiar has suddenly been presented to view we dont bother to find out whats been presented to view we just abandon all of that body of data and we look for one of the five gross auditing errors in the auditor and one of the six things that can be wrong with pc and we just get those things looked for right now all of sudden we find out all this time this auditor thought that one process was another process and it was in actual fact had never run the first process they were supposed to run on the pc but had run an entirely different process you would get absolutely fascinated the gae here is indicated by the fact that the auditor also cant do checkout on current or modern processes second of the gaes is wrong so you go and look at what they you know compare these things have they done that on this case too ah well yeah yeah they were supposed to run process 1 2 3 and 4 they didnt they ran process 9 12 and 2 and then ran them with the wrong wording do you see and as far as the pc is concerned why isnt this pc making advances aw theres reason to stand around and try to blow your brains out and worry and lie awake all night saying lets see could there be some confusion with the collusion theres sense in lying around and lying awake on the thing relax you got pc youre worried about roll up your sleeves and say this pc has got one of six things wrong at this minute one of these six things is wrong now the funny funny funny part of it is you say oh well yes you can overrun processes that could also be wrong with the pc thats one hell of problem to the pc and it either will wind up as problem or an arc break i set up this exact run to be run little while ago by the qual sec on test case not test case particularly case we wanted to handle and i already knew this bird but i set it up and sure enough he got case overrun showing up as little tiny tick which when he developed it developed into blowdown the process had been overrun and had previously not been detected case state had been attained which had never been acknowledged it showed up on problem so there isnt even overrun ah youre worried about whats wrong with this case well just have good nights sleep and in the next session you just hammer at it has this just ask yourself look over this cases folders and so forth has this case ever got case gain has this case ever rolly coastered is this person arc broken does this person have chronic present time problem which would include hidden standards and overrun processes and unacknowledged this and that is this person running along here with withhold or something misunderstood that theyre not telling us is misunderstood and pretending they understand is something wrong here in the withhold department or is this person every time they leave the auditing session casually go out and phone the fda to give them some more data on us which is it well now if gae number one cant handle and read meter if an auditor can handle and read an auditing meter i assure you you can assess those things and youre going to find the right one every time there isnt anything else that can be wrong with case and then if you handled the five things that can be wrong with an auditor and if you handle the six things that can be wrong with pc then you wont ever have to worry about tech being out because it will be in and when it starts out it will go straight back in again but you talk about the sea of data tremendous tremendous sea of data where we could have anything important anywhere i pity you drowning amongst the data of life is it really my father that drove mad or was it my uncle jim or on the other hand was it the teacher in the seventh grade somebody drove mad i wonder who it was and youre absolutely certain that if you just solve that point and find out who it was that drove you mad then you will be totally sane forevermore well in the first place you couldnt be totally mad if you were trying to find out what drove you totally mad because the definition of madman is hes the last one to know he thinks hes totally right and you think if i just dig up that data thats what clear means all i have to do is dig up that one datum and ill be there and eventually get run on process and you find out it wasnt any of those people it wasnt any of those people actually you did have playmate who was rather mean to you and suppressive and you locate him and youll feel fine and youre shut of that problem and you have made an advance but you have made an advance of one little chip in vast ocean and when you look at all of the multitudinous data of your own past all the confusing data of your own present and add to that sea of data that youre given in scientology you say how can i possibly ever pilot my way through all this look at all these bulletins look at all these tapes and all these things seem to be so important and everything seems to be so important and nothing and that and so forth and all im doing is sitting here trying to find out who was mean to when i was five well just remember the saving grace is one that people are making it routinely and as you get on up the line the selection of importances becomes more and more an ability that is easily practiced in other words you could be more and more capable of selecting importances given sixteen data you can select the one that is important out of the sixteen and then you find out that youre really getting somewhere and when i tell you looking over all the auditing of the past that theres just those five things that can be wrong with an auditor and its just those six things that can be wrong with pc all youve got to find out is how to apply and remedy those five and how youve got to apply and straighten out those six do you understand and frankly there isnt an interminable body of data behind them there are only few data behind each one of those and when we get down to it that is what keeps the cases rolling thats what makes them come on up the line in auditing you generally look on it and say its processes that do oh yes thats perfectly true but if the case is going why the process will work but if the case isnt going and the process isnt working why then it isnt the process that isnt working you understand its one of these five things one of the five is wrong with you or one of the six is wrong with the pc you have to decide which it is and put it right and all of sudden itll all run like bomb that should give you terrific orientation furthermore it should give anybody who is in charge of any activity or getting anything done terrifically keen insight into the situation because the whole environment is trying to feed him different data than these and these are the data and the only data he can afford to look at and when he pays attention to those all works when he ceases to pay attention to those the whole world becomes complete sea of confusion again all right well i hope thatll help you out i hope that it narrows the field down i wanted to talk to you today just to give you fast reorientation on the subject of what youre looking at yes processes are important yes all the things youre studying are important yes you have definitely got to know how to run process and what are the manifestations and phenomena of the process but when it comes right down to it it isnt because youre running process badly in actual fact that youre not getting case gains on the pc its because either you are practicing one of the five gross auditing errors undetectedly or the pc youre auditing falls into one of the six which i have listed it isnt that youre doing the process badly so if you think that just by constant shift of process and constant changing everything around and constantly trying to invent scientology all over again in the middle of session youre suddenly going to get gain on pc who isnt gaining youre going to have lose every time what it takes is standard processing with all five gross auditing errors remedied in the auditor and none of those six things present in the pc and if youve got that all straight then it really doesnt matter youll get gains even if you run do birds fly do you follow and youll find out if you pay attention to this and learn how to handle these as set of tools that auditing application of becomes very very simple indeed and when youre very quick off the mark with these six things particularly the last four are the ones that you really work on and if youre very quick off the mark with those and you can spot them and you can handle them and you can get rid of arc breaks ptps and withholds misunderstoods overts you know that little category of things you can handle those brrrtt why there isnt pc in the world ever gets away with thing as far as youre concerned youve got it all taped all nailed sessions just go bzzoom onward and upward because youre not auditing pc who is having bad time youre auditing pc who is doing all right and i invite you to partake deeply of this wisdom because you will be very very much happier as an auditor thereby and case supervisor too thank you very much
