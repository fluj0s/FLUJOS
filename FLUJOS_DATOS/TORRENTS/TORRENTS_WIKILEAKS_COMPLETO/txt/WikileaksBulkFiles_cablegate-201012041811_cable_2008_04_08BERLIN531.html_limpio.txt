grand coalition faces strain of upcoming 2009 elections ref berlin 313 b 07 berlin 0674 classified by deputy chief of mission john koenig for reasons 14 b and d summary 1 c the german grand coalition will increasingly face tensions created by the need for the lead candidates to position themselves for the 2009 national electoral campaign chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frankwalter steinmeier both remain highly popular merkel however faces political risks if the economy turns for the worse in the second half of this year as the social democratic party spd moves closer to decision about its chancellor candidate potential candidate steinmeier will likely face scrutiny and criticism from his own partys leftwing it is too early to predict the likely coalition outcome in 2009 although merkels christian democrats cdu and the christian social union csu are likely to come out ahead they may not have better coalition option than continuing the current grand coalition with the spd us foreign policy is not likely to play central role in the campaign leading up to germanys national elections in fall 2009 improved usgerman relations under merkel and german fascination with the vibrant democratic process in the us primary elections have played significant roles in improving german attitudes towards the us thereby dampening the likelihood that the spd will use antiamerican rhetoric to rally voters as former chancellor gerhard schroeder did in 2002 end summary merkels possible archilles heel the economy 2 u chancellor angela merkel cdu remains highly popular among germans who view her as an effective leader with strong international stature her approval rating is 71 percent in large part due to merkels popularity the cdu has held commanding 8 to 14point lead over the spd in polls over the last year 3 c although merkels high popularity is expected to continue she faces diffuse risks on economic issues cdu parliamentarians suggest that an economic downturn would be the principal threat to merkels high popularity economic forecasts currently favor merkel with projections of 16 to 18 percent growth for this year though slightly lower for 2009 but with real evidence of recession despite the global slowdown 4 c among cdu leaders there is sense that the cdu may have peaked perhaps too early and that caution is the watchword merkel who campaigned in 2005 on program of economic liberalization and watched commanding lead in the polls nearly vanish during the campaign appears to be moving toward the political center in an attempt to expand her base and consolidate centrist support that the spd is losing because of its leftward shift she is demonstrating evergreater focus on domestic policy and espousing popular middle class enticements such as pension increases longer duration of unemployment benefits for older workers and enhancement of nursing care insurance while many consider this move to be politically smart some on the cdus rightwing have criticized the chancellor for abandoning core cdu values steinmeier could get roughed up by spds left wing 5 c social democrats have speculated in recent months that spd chairman kurt beck will eventually defer to the much more popular foreign minister frankwalter steinmeier as the partys eventual chancellor candidate ref spd insiders consider this 5050 proposition kurt becks recent victory in guiding competing factions of the spd to agreement on privatization of the railway monopoly deutsche bahn may help shore up his position septel it is uncertain whether steinmeier would choose to accept the spd nomination at time when the spd is hovering in the mid 20s in the polls and its electoral prospects seem poor note in any case steinmeier will run for political office federal parliament seat from brandenburg city for the first time in 2009 end note 6 c steinmeier would face some detractors in his own berlin 00000531 002 of 002 party deputy spd chair andrea nahles the leading leftwing critic of steinmeiers centrist approach told political mc that she was unhappy that the us knows more about steinmeier than i do referring to steinmeiers role as chancellery chief of staff and intelligence coordinator under gerhard schroeder nahles suggested strongly that the left wing of the spd could portray steinmeier as too close to the us on intelligencerelated issues especially his role in the murat kurnaz affair ref b thereby damaging his candidacy 7 c nahles admitted however that the spd likely would do better at the polls with steinmeier as chancellor candidate between 30 and 35 percent of the vote this would mean more spd parliamentarians holding onto their seats consideration that could have an effect on the spds choice nahles added that steinmeier has little experience in managing the party but hes fast learner grand coalition fated to continue 8 c deputy cdu national chairman and lower saxony ministerpresident christian wulff cdu told the dcm that another grand coalition is the most likely outcome in 2009 if the political landscape does not change significantly in the coming months the spds nahles agrees while merkel and the cdu still prefer to govern with the free democrats fdp the numbers may not suffice for majority although experiments such as the cdugreens coalition in hamburg are enticing replicating them at the national level remains difficult 9 c comment the cdus fear of opening up its flanks to spd attacks and the spds selfobsession during period of turmoil in the party reveal degree of caution on policy issues that is remarkable even by german standards this is reflected in german caution on foreign policy issues of interest to us such as afghanistan and iran particular usg concern is whether the spd or others will try to employ antiamerican rhetoric to curry voter support much as former chancellor gerhard schroeder did in 2002 even spd leftwingers like nahles tell us however that foreign policy is not as great consideration for german voters as it was around the time of the iraq war and therefore will not likely be decisive factor in next years national elections it is also important to note that german attitudes towards the us have improved over the past year due to our improved bilateral relations and german fascination with democracy on display in the us primary elections the current improvement is evidenced by recent harris poll which showed dramatic 21 percentagepoint increase in the number of germans who regard the us as trustworthy partner also the german federal election campaign will occur during what is expected here to be an extended popular honeymoon for the new us administration consequently german politicians might perceive less political advantage in critical stance toward the us end comment timken jr
