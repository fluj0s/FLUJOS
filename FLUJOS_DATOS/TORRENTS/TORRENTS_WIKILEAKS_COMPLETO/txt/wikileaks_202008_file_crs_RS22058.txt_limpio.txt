bankruptcy reform legislation see crs report rl32765 the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 s 256 in the 109th congress by robin jeweler this report will be updated if events warrant virtually all consumer bankruptcies are either chapter 7 or chapter 13 cases chapter 7 is the most common form of bankruptcy accounting for 715 of nonbusiness filings in 2004 or over 11 million cases in chapter 7 the debtors assets are liquidated and distributed among creditors and many remaining debts are discharged or cancelled leaving the debtor free to make fresh start some debts are not dischargeable and secured debts like mortgages are not affected by bankruptcy in practice most chapter 7 filings are zero asset cases where unsecured creditors get nothing several types of assets are exempt from liquidation and cannot be distributed to creditors in chapter 13 bankruptcies debtors with regular incomes agree to plan to pay back some or all of their debt under court supervision over period of several years at the plans conclusion remaining debts are discharged an advantage of chapter 13 for debtors is that wider range of debts can be discharged than under chapter 7 if the debtor is unable to complete the series of payments required by the chapter 13 plan the case may be dismissed or converted to chapter 7 upon dismissal remaining debts are congressional research service the library of congress crs2 not discharged unless the court finds that the debtor cannot justly be held accountable for failure to complete the plan and creditors have received at least the amount of repayment they would have received under chapter 7 filing under the old law the choice of chapters was left entirely up to the debtor supporters of reform long argued that the excessive generosity1 of the old bankruptcy system encouraged abuse and allowed some debtors to repudiate debts that they could have repaid at least in part pl 1098 responds to these concerns by restricting access to chapter 7 in cases where debtors income is determined to be sufficient to repay some debt after allowing for reasonable living expenses the means test set out in title i of the reform act will determine eligibility for chapter 7 relief debtors who pass the means test will either have their chapter 7 petitions dismissed or converted to chapter 13 or chapter 112 conversion will not occur without the debtors consent but other form of bankruptcy relief will be available the basic test under the means test chapter 7 filing is presumed to be abusive if the debtors httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22058 monthly income reduced by numerous allowances and living expenses discussed below and multiplied by 60 that is over fiveyear period is greater than 10000 if income thus adjusted is less than 6000 there is presumption of abuse and the debtor is free to choose chapter 7 if adjusted income is between 6000 and 10000 abuse is presumed only if income exceeds 25 of nonpriority unsecured debt in the case an abusive chapter 7 filing is subject to dismissal or conversion living expenses and allowances key determinant in whether debtor passes the means test is the amount by which actual monthly income3 is reduced by various allowances and living expenses the law sets out several categories of allowable monthly expenses debtors monthly expenses are calculated primarily by referring to set of allowances established by the internal revenue service irs that are used to help determine taxpayers ability to pay delinquent tax liability4 the allowances which the irs calls collections financial standards set out monthly living expenses in three basic categories 1 food clothing and other items 2 housing and utilities and 3 transportation the allowable living expenses are subject to several variables 1 see testimony of todd j zywicki before the senate committee on the judiciary hearing on s 256 feb 10 2005 2 chapter 11 is used primarily in business reorganizations it is rarely used by individuals because of its complex and expensive procedural requirements 3 current monthly income as defined in the reform act includes nontaxable income and payments from third parties such as alimony or child support but excludes social security benefits 4 in other words the irs will take all the taxpayers disposable income in excess of these allowances see httpwwwirsgovindividualsarticle0id9654300html crs3 in the food clothing and other5 category the irs sets out living expenses that vary according to the size of the household and gross monthly income for example single person with gross income of 832month would be allowed 403 in living expenses while family of four earning 5834month would be allowed 1564 for expenses in this category these amounts are national standards uniform across the contiguous 48 states except that higher schedules are provided for alaska and hawaii the allowance for housing and utilities varies according to size of household and geographical location the standards provide separate dollar figures for each county in the nation for households of one or two three and four or more persons single person living in wilkinson county in southwest mississippi would be allowed to deduct 774month while family of four in manhattan would be allowed 4799 the transportation standards provide regional allowances6 with variations for persons living in any of 28 specified metropolitan areas allowable living expenses include ownership costs 475 for one car an additional 338 for second car and operating costs or public transportation costs for those with car operating or public transportation allowances range from 161 per month for nondriving pittsburghers to 479 for new york httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22058 city residents with two cars these allowances are not reduced if bankruptcy petitioners actual expenditures are less than the standard in some cases the irs recognizes actual expenses that exceed the standards under the reform act debtors monthly expenses may include actual expenses in categories specified as other necessary expenses by the irs for the area in which the debtor resides beyond the irs allowances the bankruptcy reform law permits current income to be reduced by several other types of expenses monthly expenses for purposes of the means test may include reasonable and necessary spending to care for an elderly chronically ill or disabled member of the debtors immediate family or household reasonably necessary expenditures for health insurance disability insurance and health savings accounts actual expenses for the primary or secondary education of dependent child under age 18 up to 1500 per child per year home energy costs in excess of the irs housing and utility standards with proper documentation and justification 5 other items include housekeeping supplies personal care products and services and miscellaneous 6 the regions are northeast midwest south and west crs4 average monthly payments on secured debts most commonly home mortgages and car loans7 average monthly payments on priority claims eg child support student loans alimony etc reasonable and necessary expenses to maintain the safety of the debtors family from family violence as identified under section 309 of the family violence prevention and services act8 and administrative costs incurred in chapter 13 bankruptcy plan finally debtor may claim higher monthly expenses if special circumstances exist that require additional expenditures to establish special circumstances the debtor must itemize such expenses and explain in detail why each of them is reasonable and necessary given the number of factors that may reduce monthly income for purposes of the bankruptcy means test it is clear that simple gross income is not good indicator of httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22058 whether debtor will be allowed to file chapter 7 because some of the allowable expenses can be very large in dollar terms eg support for the elderly or infirm it is not difficult to imagine hypothetical cases in which debtor with relatively high money income would be allowed to make fresh start under chapter 7 while lowerincome filer might have to choose between chapter 13 and dismissal other provisions of the reform legislation address this potential disparity by creating safe harbors for lower income individuals and households safe harbor provisions based on state median income under pl 1098 motion must be filed in bankruptcy court to dismiss or convert chapter 7 petition who may bring such motion depends on the debtors income the law provides that if the debtors income exceeds the median family income adjusted for household size as calculated by the bureau of the census9 for the applicable state any party in interest including creditor may bring an abuse motion under section 707b tables of median family income by state by family size and by number of earners p p r n t h m r i c n b n k r u p t c in s t i t u t s w b s i t t httpwwwabiworldnetbankbillmedianhtml the figures reflect 1999 data collected in the 2000 census but the website includes consumer price index cpi figures that 7 since the irs standard for housing and utilities is meant to account for the costs of home ownership allowing monthly income to be reduced by mortgage payments in addition to the irsspecified amounts appears to create significant advantage for homeowners over renters 8 these expenses would normally be for counseling services 9 if census median income figure were available for the current year the most recent census figure would be adjusted for changes in the consumer price index for all urban consumers cpi u crs5 allow adjustment for inflation as of february 2005 the cpi stood 15 above the mid 1999 level the median income figures should be adjusted upwards by about that amount if the income of the debtor or debtor and spouse in joint filing is less than or equal to the median family income taking household size into account10 for the applicable state only the judge or bankruptcy trustee or administrator may file motion to dismiss or convert chapter 7 petition if the combined income of the debtor and the debtors spouse is equal to or less than the state median family income again adjusted for household size motion to dismiss or convert may be filed in addition pl 1098 creates an exemption from means testing for disabled veterans whose debts were incurred while they were on active duty or performing homeland defense activity rebutting the presumption of abuse httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22058 chapter 7 petition by debtor who passes the means test is presumed to be abusive the law provides that this presumption may only be rebutted by demonstrating special circumstances such as serious medical condition or call to active duty in the armed forces that justify additional expenses or adjustments to current monthly income conclusion how many bankruptcy petitions now filed under chapter 7 will be dismissed or converted to chapter 13 under pl 1098 which takes effect in october 2005 estimates range from about 3 to 20 of chapter 7 filings of which there were over 11 million in 2004 studies based on limited data samples indicate that the median annual income of bankruptcy petitioners is between 25000 and 3000011 this is considerably below the median income for all us households in 2003 which the census bureau reports as 42527 thus substantial majority of bankruptcy filers will be exempted from the means test under the safe harbor provisions linked to median income even among the minority of filers whose income is above the state median adjusted for household size large number will be able to claim enough monthly expenses that they fail the means test and are permitted to file under chapter 7 while the lack of data on petitioners incomes and expenses does not permit precise calculation it seems safe 10 the adjustment works as follows in the case of singleperson household the threshold is the state median family income for family with one earner for households with two three or four individuals the threshold is the highest median family income for family with the same number of or fewer individuals for households with over four individuals the family income threshold rises by 525 per month for each additional individual 11 see eg david u himmelstein elizabeth warren deborah thorne and steffie woolhandler illness and injury as contributors to bankruptcy feb 2005 exhibit 1 available online at httpcontenthealthaffairsorgcgicontentfullhlthaffw563dc1 data on bankruptcy filers incomes and other financial circumstances are not compiled by the courts crs6 to say that the new law will not bring about dramatic decline in the proportion of bankruptcy cases filed under chapter 712 this outcome would be consistent with the aims of bankruptcy reformers who have long argued that the means test was not aimed at the mass of americans seeking relief from financial trouble but at the few who abuse the bankruptcy system to repudiate debts they can afford to repay httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22058 12 it is worth noting that the ratio of chapter 7 to chapter 13 cases is not consistent nationwide but varies widely from state to state in texas for example 479 of personal bankruptcies filed in 2004 were chapter 13 cases in wyoming only 69 nationally chapter 13s accounted for 284 of all personal bankruptcies in 2004
