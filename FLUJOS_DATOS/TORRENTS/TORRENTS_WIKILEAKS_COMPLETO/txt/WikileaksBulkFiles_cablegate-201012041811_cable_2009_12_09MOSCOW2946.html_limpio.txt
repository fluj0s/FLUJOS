during four hour q and session classified by dcm eric s rubin reasons 14 bd 1 sbu summary prime minister vladimir putin displayed thorough knowledge of the issues facing russia during live televised question and answer session which highlighted his role as russias dominant political figure most of the questions were focused on the economic situation and socioeconomic issues septel but putin also repeated his previous statements on his possible run for president in 2012 and his good relationship with president dmitriy medvedev putin also touched both sides of the coin on stalins legacy infuriating some opposition politicians and human rights activists putins confident performance in front of millions of russians showcased his image as practical problemsolver and the tandem leader most in touch with the russian people end summary question and answer dynamics 2 sbu on december 3 putin conducted marathon fourhour question and answer session during which he answered 80 questions from variety of formats including studio audience telephone text message email and several live videofeeds from across the country putin was well prepared for the session and his spokesman certainly stretching the truth stated in the days leading up to the event that putin had read the overwhelming majority of the 700000 questions received at that point by the end of the session putin received over two million questions 3 sbu putin appeared comfortable with the events format and demonstrated an encyclopedic knowledge of statistics in his answers as he has done in the past putin stared straight at the camera repeated the names of those asking the questions some of whom had met the prime minister in the past year and responded directly to their questions in typical putin fashion he rarely showed any emotion and some of his attempts at deadpan humor missed the mark putin took control of the event towards the conclusion by personally calling on people in the carefully screened studio audience and responding to questions he had reviewed previously although some of the questions were not softballs and did not appear to be scripted putin was informed of the general topics ahead of time and the locations for the videofeeds 4 sbu putin personally selected controversial question about stalins legacy and whether he viewed the former soviet leader as good or bad putin said that stalin had achieved some positive achievements such as industrialization but that the cost was unacceptable and that during stalins reign massscale crimes were committed tandem politics show putin still on top 5 c tandem politics stood out as an important issue when people asked putin directly about his plans to run for president in 2012 and his relationship with medvedev he answered with the same standard notions he has used previously leaving vague his future plans putin responded that he was thinking about running in 2012 but needed to wait to see what the situation in the country would be like in couple years he noted that given the countrys problems it was better to concentrate on solving them rather than consume energy on an election campaign putin said he and medvedev knew each other well worked well together and shared the same principles individual experts continue to have varying opinions on the tandems presidential aspirations longtime kremlin insider gleb pavlovskiy stated that medvedev and putins vague statements about their 2012 intentions served as way to preserve the tandems balance and effectiveness however by early 2011 their intentions according to pavlovskiy would become clear 6 c putins excellent performance only added to his cultivated image as russias dominant national leader and the one in control of the tandem xxxxxxxxxxxx said that the event had strengthened putins political leadership and demonstrated who was the countrys practical leader and who was its theoretical leader experts xxxxxxxxxxxx also noted that the event showed russians who was able to resolve concrete socioeconomic issues such as pensions jobs and housing and who worked on abstract issues less important to the populace xxxxxxxxxxxx said that although the event was routine and scripted it served its purpose by portraying putin in positive light pavlovskiy called it perhaps the most brilliant performance of putins entire career 7 c in contrast communist party deputy chairman ivan melnikov told us that the show was nothing more than psychotherapy for population worried about salaries pensions and housing which clearly showed putins interest in reclaiming the presidency public chamber member vyacheslav glazychev an expert on monogorod oneindustry towns in russia called it nice public relations event and nothing more xxxxxxxxxxxx blasted putins view of stalin xxxxxxxxxxxx stated that the prime minister should have made more straightforward assessment of one of the most terrible criminals in human history 8 sbu preevent levada center poll emphasized that russians saw putin as the countrys leader and his meat and potatoes issues as more important the poll results showed that 28 percent of respondents named putin as the one who holds power in russia while 13 percent said medvedev thirtyeight percent of respondents were likely to watch putins address whereas 27 percent watched medvedevs nationally televised address in november fortythree percent of respondents considered putins address to be more important compared to only 16 percent of russians who thought medvedevs address was more important comment 9 c putins guarded comments about his participation in the 2012 presidential election have helped him retain his position as the national leader and elite faction mediator his comments on stalins legacy have infuriated longstanding critics like gozman but are extremely unlikely to result in any major negative backlash at putin in russia at this point putin and medvedevs recent nationally televised addresses only strengthened the image of prime minister who works on tangible bread and butter issues and president who focuses on bigpicture issues and strategic thinking beyrle
