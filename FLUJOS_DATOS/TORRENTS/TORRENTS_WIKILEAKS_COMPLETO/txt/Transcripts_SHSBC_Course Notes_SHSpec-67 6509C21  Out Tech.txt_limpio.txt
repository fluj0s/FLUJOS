6509c21 shspec67 out tech references hcob 13sep65 out tech and how to get it in and hcob 21sep65 out tech teachers tend to say that everything is important we are in good position to select out the important data from all the data that we have someone at the has level cant do this to him every datum looks as important as every other datum the guy at the bottom of the ladder is drowning in sea of data that is unevaluated this is true both in life and in scientology the person is already overwhelmed with the confusions of life which also overwhelm him with data so he goes on retreat from the whole thing the hardest thing thetan has to do and the most important thing that thetan can recover is his ability to evaluate importances to know whats important and what isnt the value of administration of processing is different thing from what is processed the duplicative question which is basic to auditing is the examination of the mind for the apparent answer to the question the knocking out then of this that and the other thing until the individual can take look at it and see before him some data that is important the repetitive process itself is therapeutic repetitive processes permit the individual to examine his mind and environment and out of it to select the unimportances and importances the duplicative question is unique to scientology other things work because of this duplicative action moreover to find out what is important and unimportant the person has to find out what is and what isnt he would get great clarification of things because he is being presented with certain vistas of existence and conditions of existence and he is examining them and he is taking them in or he is knocking them out he is handling existence and reorienting himself someone can get things clarified by getting more data about life from study however as he does this he is straightening up his own mind and his real gain when the chips are all the way down largely depends on the auditor someone who is drowning in the sea of life gets repetitive command from an auditor and asises various confusions the pcs statements on the question are handled and asised those statements are then acknowledged by the auditor making full cycle of the situation only then can the pc get up to point where he himself might all by himself confront his own mind only when hes got his mind straightened out can he really benefit from new data hes got his own mind and life so mixed up that he has completely forgotten what mind is all about and in large majority of cases people arent even aware that they have minds at best they think that they are minds and perhaps that they have souls saving oneself seems too egoistical so one saves ones soul man is at effect he looks for the oneshot clear or enlightenment its not that scientology is slow its that man has gone so far down but the big gains arent so much at the top they are at the bottom getting started these gains are startling just getting the idea that there is road out can be big win the individual has had lot of loses on this line to him scientology is like straw in the ocean helped by an auditor the person can look at himself and life and make more gains it is lone ladder contrary to the general idea and desire for fast way to the top the person makes his first real gains on coming to realize that there is road out so there is dependency on 1 the disseminator 2 the intro lecturer 3 the course supervisor they all perform vital functions and they can produce more dramatic results than you would ever expect being used to auditing as the way to get changes the changes on the chart are made in session but the biggest mistake you could make would be not teaching scientology and not disseminating people in society are very confused and distracted one of the soundest ways to reach them is to talk about communication and telling them that scientology exists and as their friend is interested in helping them you tell person that if he could communicate to his environment better he could handle it better you tell him that if he were to talk to his wife it would come out better the only dicey thing there is that he has been punished perhaps for communicating so it might be difficult along the way dissemination and teaching lines can be bit wobbly but if the individual makes some gains he will still do ok but auditing lines cant afford to be wobbly when the person gets to auditing that is where there is room for shakiness or flubbiness now tech is tech the comm cycle has to be good the questions have to be understood by and acceptable to the pc they must also be answered and acknowledged up to the point of getting the person in session it is debatable exactly what the correct technical action in disseminating to him is because you are disseminating into such confusion life as it exists it is still debatable what it is best to lecture to people about common denominator is that lecturing about communication is good idea but auditing isnt debatable it works with precision if it is applied with precision there must be gaes in auditing there is leeway in dissemination but not in auditing which must be standard all troubles in auditing stem from auditor goofs so dont butter up nattery pc pull his withholds the ability to observe and tell whether what is being done is right or wrong is harder to do in auditing than in disseminating or in course supervising the auditor can make tiny mistakes that upset the pc so that the pc acts up the casual observer would say that it is difficult pc when in fact it was auditor goofs you have to be good auditor to observe good and bad auditing you will get some gain 30 to 40 of potential even out of bad auditing just by duplicative questions and by the fact that someone is interested in the pc however full gain only comes from precise right auditing what we mean by out tech is not getting the whole 100 gains available on every pc not just obvious goofs out tech is what is happening when the fine points of auditing are missing and when what really goes wrong with cases is not understood when there is out tech the auditor is to be sure sitting there giving the auditing command but he is making lots of goofs with it what does it take to make good auditor first we have the gaes see hcob 21sep65 out tech there are only five gaes 1 cant handle and read the emeter he doesnt see reads he overcompensates when bringing the ta back to set giving falsely large amounts of ta action 2 doesnt know and cant apply technical data this used to be cant read and apply an hcob this also includes nonduplication of css and not knowing that you havent done what you were supposed to have done 3 cant get or keep pc in session this is very often the case the pcs attention is on something other than the auditing you have to be able to see when the pc is not in session distracted etc there is little body of technology in this area you have to get the pcs attention by finding out what it is on and asising it note and find the arc break ptp or missed withhold and handle it the auditor who would try to audit pc whose attention is elsewhere is applying tech to nobody the most obvious and silly version of this mistake is where one got the pc an auditor despite the pc wanting and having paid for auditing or the auditor is so wedded to form that when the pc comes in already in session the auditor carefully takes the pc out of session in order to start the session 4 cant complete an auditing cycle this accounts for the pc who itsas obsessively this pc has been prematurely acknowledged in life or in auditing and this has happened so much that he feels as though he has never been acknowledged eg kid says mommy i just had great idea whereupon mommy says thats wonderful dear failed acknowledgment and host of other errors will also give rise to obsessive itsa such as not asking the question not acknowledging q and etc there are hundreds of ways to stop an auditing cycle one is not to start one as when the auditor just doesnt give the command the auditor can always polish up his comm cycle and make it better but when it is fouling up the pc it is grossly out with q and question ack etc 5 cant complete repetitive auditing cycle auditors used to have immense trouble just asking the same question repetitively the trs and op pro by dup were developed to handle this inability in auditors as an auditing supervisor these are the things to look for not aspects of the auditors case dont audit the auditor as first action after you find the gae maybe the auditor could be audited say on his missed withholds there are really only four actually six things that can be wrong with pc 1 the pc is suppressive suppressive is someone who doesnt get case gain because he has continuing overts not because auditing wasnt applied well only about 2 12 of pcs are suppressive it is very hard to get this pc to give up the overts or to be made auditable for real case gain about the only way in which we can do it is with power processing occasionally someone can be overaudited so far especially on r6ew that they thereafter get case gain and will act slightly suppressive they have to be rehabilitated but true suppressive has never had any case gain or ta he is continually committing little overts because to him everyone is an enemy each individual is an everyone to the sp who is busy fighting everyone the sp is paranoid who doesnt change institutional cases are all ptss or sps that is why lrh has said dont fool with the insane he didnt know exactly why but now we know the psychiatrist is professionally pts 2 the pc is pts the pc who is pts rollercoasters in auditing this is the psychiatrists manicdepressive case he feels good after auditing and then feels bad the paranoid or catatonic who doesnt change is the suppressive pts doesnt have to see the sp between sessions he only has to think what will joe think about this or what would joe say the sp could be 10000 miles away ethics officers sometimes have trouble finding the sp but there is one on the case the sp speaks in generalities which puts up fog making the sp hard to find if you audit the pts and get him better the sp will do something to destroy him so it is dangerous to audit him if you give pts too much gain the sp will either commit suicide or murder him most of our troubles have come from auditing ptss who then threaten the sp who then incites the pts and others to cause our problems you have to find the right sp finding him gives very positive result not just tiny change when you correctly spot the sp in ptss case the pts lights up like spotlight 3 the pc is arc broken 4 the pc has ptp of long duration this includes hidden standards 5 the pc has withhold or misunderstood word the misunderstood word is just withhold of understanding the pc is withholding himself from the understanding or vice versa 6 the pc has continuous withheld overts this makes the pc suppressive the eleven items discussed in this lecture ie 5 gaes and the 6 things that can be wrong with pc given above are the only things that will act as barriers on case processes are things that work if these six things arent out with the pc and when auditors dont have gaes if they dont work one or more of these is why that is all that drives tech out d of p who doesnt look at these barriers to processing cant make anything work if these eleven reasons why processing doesnt work are ok almost any process will work unless it is overrun in other words the only other reason why process doesnt work is that it has worked all the way to result and it is done overrun is either problem or an arc break hence in fits into the above schema if the five gaes are not present then if the case is not progressing 16 are present you can just assess these six things and find out what is wrong with the case so these things are the points of out tech the whole environment is trying to feed the cs different data than these analysis of out tech would result in getting tech in by not allowing gaes and by detecting and handling the things that are wrong with pcs persons case is helped by the fact that as he advances he becomes more and more capable of selecting importances as you get on up the line the selection of importances becomes more and more an ability that is easily practiced
