regarding the amounts to be authorized purposes and eligibility criteria for various highway and traffic safety grants decision makers face the challenge of allocating resources used to advance primarily safety objectives against funds needed to meet other surface transportation needs this report provides background information on several of the key safetyoriented provisions and issues addressed in these bills and supplements crs issue brief ib10138 this report will not be updated1 the policy context and diversity of challenges2 traffic crashes each year in the united states result in some 42000 fatalities and about 29 million injuries and thus create major public health problem these traffic incidents result in significant economic costs totaling more than 230 billion annually 1 note paul rothberg who has retired from crs is the author of this report randy peterman is the crs analyst who currently handles issues covered by this report 2 clare brigidini resources science and industry division provided editorial support congressional research service the library of congress crs2 according to nhtsa3 motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death in the united states for people ages 3 to 33 despite these sobering statistics there is cause for optimism the lowest fatality rate ever recorded 148 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled was achieved in 20034 nhtsa reports that alcoholrelated fatalities declined significantly in 2003 the first drop in that level since 19995 preliminary 2004 nhtsa data indicate further improvement over the 2003 fatality rate and the number of alcoholrelated fatalities furthermore survey data indicate that the national average safetybelt use rate hit 80 in 2004 the highest level in the nations history nhtsa estimates that 15200 lives and 50 billion in economic costs associated with traffic related crashes injuries and deaths are saved every year when this high level of seat belt use prevails6 to help continue these improvements in safety trends and make progress toward many other national objectives the house and senate have passed their respective versions of hr 3 these bills reauthorize various federal surface transportation programs including those that significantly affect diverse safety challenges as envisioned in these bills congress seeks to revise some of the existing highway and traffic safety grants that are provided to the states and to create some new grants affecting httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22153 safety7 because many states and local governments are still struggling with tight budgets federal grants to enhance safety play an important role in promoting safety these bills also would catalyze significant changes in some federal safety programs and regulations because of their financial impacts and life saving potential legislative changes to federal grants and regulations are of fundamental importance to the states local governments industry and other users of the surface transportation system safety concerns resonate through numerous provisions of hr 3 essentially all groups support safetyoriented legislation that saves lives but the means favored to accomplish this objective vary the diversity of interest groups and their safetyoriented goals is substantial this diversity is reflected by legislative provisions intended to improve driver education motorcycle safety rural road safety state traffic safety information systems and commercial drivers licensing programs and information systems as well as child transportation safety conference committee will try to reconcile numerous differences between the house and senate versions of hr 3 in specific this committee will specify funding levels for the core federal safety programs administered by the fhwa nhtsa and fmcsa also its members will decide on the purposes eligibility criteria and structure of various safety grants provided to the states to large extent the final statute will determine the availability of federal funds provided to supplement state investments in 3 httpwwwnhtsadotgovnhtsawhatisbb2006pagesadminstmthtm 4 2003 is the latest year for which full year statistics are available 5 nhtsa press release 3804 august 25 2004 6 dot press release 17304 september 16 2004 7 highway safety programs can refer to efforts to improve or enhance the specific safety components of the surface transportation infrastructure eg hazardelimination investments or gradecrossing improvements traffic safety programs typically refer to efforts to improve driver or pedestrian behavior but sometimes these terms are used interchangeably crs3 highway safety infrastructure as well as the resources for such traffic safety activities as sobriety road checks and safety belt buckle up campaigns of pivotal importance is the funding formula used to determine how much money state receives from the federal highway trust fund to improve its highway infrastructure as well as the grant criteria that determine whether state qualifies to receive incentive funds to improve its occupant protection and alcohol countermeasure antidrunk driving programs in the reauthorization bill congress faces the challenge of providing the legislative framework to improve upon federal programs grants and regulations influencing specific areas of highway and traffic safety to different degrees the bills reflect the desire for continued efforts or improved laws to encourage more people to buckle up and to deal with repeat trafficsafety offenders who continue to violate drivingwhileintoxicated dwi or drivingundertheinfluence dui prohibitions both versions of hr 3 include authority to establish new grant program to improve motorcycle safety the substantial increase in the number of fatalities of motorcyclists in recent years has underpinned support to enhance state motorcycle training and outreach efforts with federal monies8 both bills also respond to those who seek changes in existing federal motor carrier programs and regulations by creating new grant program to improve httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22153 traffic information safety systems both bills respond to pleas from the safety community for resources that can enhance decision making including improved safety data systems and driver records despite many similarities there also are major difference between the two bills for example the senate version of hr 3 specifically addresses the mobility and safety challenges posed by some older drivers and authorizes 2 million in each year of fy2006 through fy2009 for this purpose the house bill does not include this provision competition for funds is intense among various safety programs key challenge will be to find additional funds to increase federal support for safetyoriented activities and to find the appropriate balance to meet such diverse objectives as improving safety retaining state flexibility and ensuring accountability decision makers also face the difficult hurdle of balancing funds primarily intended to promote safety against funds needed to meet other surface transportation objectives such as increasing mobility and reducing environmental impacts of highway operations key safety provisions included in hr 3 infrastructure and highway safety both versions of hr 3 authorize billions of dollars of federalhighway program funds intended to improve the design throughput and overall performance and safety of the highway infrastructure these bills authorize increased transit funding that is intended to reduce the growth in the number of vehicles on the highway system and thus also impact traffic safety both bills authorize new grant program called the highway safety improvement program that would fund an array of safety investments including funds to enhance safety at highwayrail grade crossings and reduce road hazards9 both bills establish safe routes to school 8 the number of motorcyclist fatalities rose from 3270 in 2002 to 3661 in 2003 an increase of 12 with preliminary 2004 nhtsa data indicating 3927 such deaths 9 for example for the highway safety improvement program specified under sections 130 and continued crs4 program with funds for the planning design and construction of projects to encourage children to bike and walk to school safely10 both bills call for improved regulations regarding the safety of highway construction workers if the senate version prevails states also would be required to develop and implement strategic plan that identifies and analyzes highway safety problems and opportunities and that results in strategies or projects to reduce such problems under the senate bill states also would be required to adopt performancebased goals that focus resources on areas of greatest need and establish and implement schedule for conducting safety projects for hazards correction and prevention the house bill authorizes new high risk rural road safety improvement program11 the set aside for highway safety infrastructure projects now specified as part of the surface transportation program is proposed to be eliminated fhwas and other highway research and development activities affecting safety the conferees are debating the amount of funding authorized for fhwas and other core research development and technology deployment activities safety is an integral component of these activities research and technical guidance and outreach activities regarding pedestrian grade crossing and intersection concerns and work to improve the visibility of road signage are illustrative activities likely to be funded httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22153 as envisioned in both bills the reauthorization statute will include funding amounts for the local technical assistance program the national highway institute and the university transportation research or centers program each of these training or technical assistance efforts has important safety components nhtsas section 403 activity both bills would increase significantly the amount of funds authorized for nhtsas section 403 provision which provides the working capital that this agency uses to address behavioral as opposed to vehicular issues congress historically has provided separate authorization for these activities and in recent years that funding amount was roughly 72 million per year nhtsa uses section 403 funds for variety of purposes including to enter into cooperative arrangements with numerous partners to achieve common safety objectives or to increase fundamental knowledge regarding traffic safety12 there is much evidence that the studies and 9 continued 152 the house version of hr 3 authorizes 630 million for fy2005 645 million for fy2006 660 million for fy2007 680 million for fy2008 and 695 million for fy2009 the senate bill authorizes for each year fy2005 through fy2009 roughly 132 billion for its version of the highway safety improvement program specified under section 148 10 house version of hr 3 authorizes specifically for the safe routes to school program 150 million for fy2005 175 million for each of fy2006 fy2007 and fy2008 and 200 million for fy2009 the senate version specifies that before apportioning amounts to carry out section 148 the highway safety improvement program for fiscal year the secretary shall set aside and use roughly 657million to carry out the safe routes to school program 11 under section 1403 the house version of hr 3 authorizes for the high risk rural road safety improvement program 105 million for fy2005 110 million for fy2006 120 million for fy2007 125 million for fy2008 and 130 million for fy2009 12 for example funds are used to formulate and implement various innovative traffic safety programs or campaigns sponsored by nhtsa these efforts seek to reduce impaired driving increase occupant protection collect and analyze safety data and sponsor demonstrations to test continued crs5 technical assistance resulting from section 403 funds have improved state and local governmental traffic safety activities and have been used as basis for strengthening related laws13 the house and senate bills differ substantially on the amount of funds set aside for section 403 funding and on specified purposes for these funds14 nhtsas vehicle safety and consumeroriented activities the reauthorization statute may set funding level for nhtsas operations and research account which includes support for its vehicle safety programs15 as part of the reauthorization process the conference committee is considering whether to require nhtsa to issue variety of vehicle safety regulations the administration maintains that congressional mandates take away nhtsas ability to prioritize its work while others maintain that such directives and deadlines are needed and expedite the rulemaking process or help promote accountability traffic safety grants penalties and transfers strategies are incorporated into federal law to encourage states to adopt and maintain certain traffic safety laws or programs three approaches include incentives transfers or loss of certain highway monies16 the house and senate bills would modify the specifications for law regarding httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22153 repeat intoxicated driver offense that any state must enforce to avoid transfer provision the senate bill also would extend transfer provision to affect any state not enforcing laws that impose certain penalties on an individual convicted of dwi or dui with blood alcohol concentration level of 015 percent or greater or driving with license suspended because of dui conviction the senate bill would impose financial penalty against any state that does not enforce law that prohibits the possession of any 12 continued or evaluate innovative safety measures nhtsa uses section 403 funds to help address key current issues in traffic safety such as those pertaining to older drowsy or fatigued drivers 13 see crs report rs21368 traffic safety reauthorization of section 403 14 for section 403 the house version of hr 3 authorizes 75 million each year for fy2006 through fy2009 while the senate version authorizes approximately 142 million each year during this period these amounts are not comparable for several reasons eg the senate bill would fund public information activities to support high visibility enforcement campaigns out of section 403 funds while this activity would be funded separately in the house bill 15 with these funds nhtsa issues new safety regulations checks vehicles for compliance with its regulations investigates vehicle safety concerns conducts an array of crashworthiness tests studies various safety systems and determines its vehicle rollover ratings nhtsa investigators develop technical information that can help consumers better evaluate aspects of vehicle safety performance the total amount of funding authorized and subsequently appropriated affects the ability of nhtsa to conduct these activities and thus the quality of the consumer information the agency provides as well as the effectiveness of federal oversight of vehicle safety 16 for example an incentive grant can be awarded to state if it adopts certain measures to improve occupant protection or state may lose some of its flexibility on how it can spend certain monies it receives from the federal highway trust fund eg state may be forced to transfer some of its highway construction funds into hazard elimination investments or alcohol impaired driving countermeasures if it does not enforce certain laws as penalty portion of states apportioned federal highway trust funds can be taken away if it does not enforce law which determines the threshold needed for someone to be convicted of drivingwhileintoxicated or an equivalent per offense crs6 open alcoholic beverage container or the consumption of any alcoholic beverage in the passenger area of any motor vehicle based on hr 3 congress is likely to change the amount of funding and the eligibility criteria for various traffic safety grants support exists for increasing funding for the section 402 state and community traffic safety section 410 drunk driving countermeasures and section 405 occupant protection enhancement grants17 the senatepassed bill places substantial emphasis on rewarding those states that adopt and enforce primary seat belt laws whereas the housepassed bill allows state to qualify for section 405 funding even if it does not enact and enforce such law motor carrier safety both the house and senate versions of hr 3 authorize on average slightly more than 500 million per year for fy2006 through fy2009 for the operations and the various grant programs administered by the fmcsa these bills also specify new required rulemakings affecting motor carriers and changes to agency enforcement authorities and programs18 the conference committee is now deciding the amount of federal funding to support federal and state programs or enforcement activities various programmatic changes to improve these efforts and future regulatory actions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22153 based on the bills passed the final reauthorization law will set funding levels for grants for 1 the motor carrier safety assistance program which supplements state funds for enforcement of commercial motor carrier safety regulations and hazardous materials transportation safety regulations and 2 various information systems which help monitor industry performance the final statute is likely to strengthen the enforcement powers of the fmcsa authorize dedicated grant program to improve commercial driver licensing efforts establish medical review board to provide advice on driver physical qualification standards and establish more clearly defined enforcement program intended to improve the safety of intermodal containers intelligent transportation systems its the federallysupported its program funds research development and demonstrations rdd of many different safetyoriented technologies the conference committee on hr 3 will debate the goals objectives and the amount of funding proposed at roughly 115 million per year as well as the purposes of the federal component of the national its rdd program the house bill identifies areas for higher priority funding including projects that enhance safety through improved crash avoidance and notification and infrastructurebased safety systems the senate version also identifies projects for priority funding including those to test the integration of at least three crashavoidance technologies in passenger vehicles integrate intelligent infrastructure vehicle and control technologies and improve the overall safety performance of vehicles and roadways safetyoriented projects will need to compete for funding against other projects funded by the dot its rdd program 17 websites that describe key components of these grants under current law include httpwwwnhtsadotgovpeopleperformtrafrecordspagestea21tea_21_issueshtm and httpwwwnhtsadotgovnhtsawhatsuptea21tea21programs 18 the house version of hr 3 would authorize 919 million for fy2006 through fy2009 funding for the administrative operations of the fmcsa the senate version would authorize 880 million for these activities separate authorization is provided for various grants to states
