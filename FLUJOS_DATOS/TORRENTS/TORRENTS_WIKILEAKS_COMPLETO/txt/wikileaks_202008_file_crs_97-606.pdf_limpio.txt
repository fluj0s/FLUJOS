larry m eig legislative attorney american law division background since 1940 congress has allowed the attorney general to grant lawful status to certain aliens who though not lawfully admitted have established deep roots here as first enacted the attorney general could suspend the deportation of aliens who could show 5 years of good moral character and prospective serious economic detriment to lawfully present members of their immediate families however several classes of aliens were ineligible and congress retained power to overturn relief by resolution over time congress has changed the basic eligibility rules for suspension of deportation the classes of ineligible aliens and the role of congress as enacted the immigration and nationality act of 1952 ina expanded potential eligibility by allowing relief premised on hardship to the prospec tive deportee and by shortening the list of ineligible groups but relief could only be granted if both the attorney general and congress acted the lists of ineligible groups for suspension under the ina which still is our primary immigration statute subsequently were amended further also the supreme court has precluded congressional participation in individual suspension cases new name new standards congress amended suspension of deportation under the ina in the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 iirira before iirira relief could be granted to an alien who had been physically present for 7 years who had had good moral character and whose deportation would result in extreme hardship to the alien or to the aliens citizen or permanent resident spouse child or parent stricter standards 10 years presence and exceptional and extremely unusual hardship existed for aliens who were deportable on certain criminal fraud or security grounds while eased standards existed for certain abused spouses and children iirira tightened standards for suspension of deportation and made it part of new remedy called cancellation of removal the new suspension remedy permits the attorney general to cancel the removal of an alien who has been physically present at least 10 years has had good moral character has not been convicted of crime that makes the alien removable and whose removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusualhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97606crs2 hardship to the aliens permanent resident or citizen spouse parent or child thus iirira 1 generally adopts the stricter 10year presence and exceptional and extremely unusual hardship standards except for abused aliens 2 eliminates prospective hardship to the alien as basis for relief and 3 disqualifies most criminal aliens previously criminal conviction was relevant only as it bore on good moral character generally the new iirira rules cover removal cases initiated on or after april 1 1997 however two provisions discussed below have clouded potential relief for certain aliens like the many central americans who came here during the civil strife of the 1980s whose deportation cases were initiated long ago but who have been allowed to remain and work for extended periods while their cases are pending the attorney general has acted to foreclose application of these restrictive provision s in cases started before april 1 by vacating decision by the board of immigration appeals meanwhile bill introduced at the administrations request s 1076 would protect certain central americans and others from the iirira rules as would more limited house bill hr 2302 numerical limits iirira imposes three separate limits of 4000 per fiscal year on relief 4000 per year limit is placed on adjustments to permanent resident status of aliens granted cancellation of removal another 4000 per year limit is placed on combined cancellations and adjustments under iirira and suspensions and adjustments under cases continued under prior law third 4000 per year limit is placed on suspensions and adjustments under prior law both the subject of these limitations and their implementation have been problematic some argue that the latter two limitations are like the first essentially limits on adjustments only they interpret cancel and adjust and suspend and adjust as both comprised of two distinct acts and argue that it is permissible to cancel or suspend the expulsion of more than 4000 aliens in one year so long as more than 4000 of them are adjusted in the same year such an interpretation bypasses the apparent arbitrariness of denying relief or delaying consideration to those aliens with meritorious applications that come before immigration judges after the yearly cancellationsuspension limit has been reached however such an interpretation also raises issues as to the status of those whose expulsion has been suspended or canceled but who have not yet been able to adjust it also may be seen as vehicle for bypassing any meaningful limit on suspensions or adjustments if the limit on suspension and adjustment means only that both acts may not occur in the same year for more than 4000 aliens what would prevent suspending 20000 deportations during one year and allowing those 20000 to adjust in the subsequent year retroactive application of tolling provisi ons iirira changed the practice of allowing time spent here after the initiation of deportation proceed ings to be counted toward the physical presence requirements under iirira presence ends when an alien 1 commits certain criminal or terrorist acts or 2 is served with notice to appear document established by iirira for the initiation of removal proceedings iirira states that the new termination rules cover notices to appear before iiriras enactment legal decisions have disagreed as to whether this means that the new rules apply to suspension of deportation in cases that were initiated by orders to show cause under preiirira practice see crs rept 97702 suspension of deportation
