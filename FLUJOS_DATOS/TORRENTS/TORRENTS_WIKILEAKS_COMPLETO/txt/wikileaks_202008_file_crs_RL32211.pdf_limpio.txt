which would constitute means of discrimination among suppliers of other parties or protection to dom estic producers or suppliers28 article xv provides numerous situations where limited tender provisions are appropriate29 the situations include the absence of tenders under ope n or selective procedures when the tenders received are collusive when the tenders received are not in conformity with the essential requirements of the tender when the tenders received are from suppliers who do not comply with the conditions for participation established in accordance with the agp when the
