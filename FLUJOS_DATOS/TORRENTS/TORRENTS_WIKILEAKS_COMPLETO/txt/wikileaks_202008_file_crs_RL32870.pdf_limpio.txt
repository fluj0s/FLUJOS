eu has been considering lifting its arms embargo on china which was imposed in respons to the june 1989 tiananmen crackdown france germany and other eu members claim that the embargo hinders the development of strategic partnership with china the bush administration and members of congress strongly oppose an nd to the eus arms embargo and urge stronger arms export controls the unite d states contends that engagement with china need not send the wrong signals on chinas human rights record and military buildup that threatens peaceful resoluti on of taiwan and other asian issues the eu argues that the arms embargo which is not legally binding is weak and largely symbolic indeed some eu members reportedly ve allowed defense related exports to china under the arms embargo while such sales have raised questions about the effectiveness of the eu s arms embargo on china they also point to the potential for future sales of milita ry equipment or technology to china particularly without the politi cal restraint of the embarg eu governments led by the united kingdom stress that if and when the embargo is overturned its end would be accompanied by stronger eu arms export control regime including an enhanced eu code of conduct on arms exports that will improve accountability and better control arms sales to china and elsewhere us critics however remain skeptical that even tighter eu code will contain sufficient enforcement and transparency mechanisms to dissuade eu countries from exporting advanced defense technologies that could enhance china s military buildup and ultimately threaten common us european and asian interests in peace and stability all 25 eu member states must agree before the embargo can be overturned although many observers had expected that the eu would lift the embargo in the spring of 2005 some members grew hesitant amid vocal and highlevel us opposition especially since early 2005 thos arguing against lifting the embargo have cited persistent human rights problems in china including refusal to reexamine the tiananmen crackdown and chinas adoption in march 2005 of its antisecession law warning of possible use of force against taiwan at present ending the arms embargo on china does not appear to be high on the eus agenda still the eu is politica lly comm itted to overturning the embargo and many observers believe that its end is ultimately only matter of time in the meantime us diplomacy could be effective and th disagreement presents chance for closer coordination of useuropean policies including those dealing with arms export controls and rising china overall there are two sets of questions for congress in examining us policy toward the fate of the eus arms embargo on china what are the implications for us interests in transatlantic relations and china if us interests are adversely affected what are some options for congress to discourage the eu from lifting its arms embargo on china and if it is lifted to protect us national security interests in both asia and europe issues raised by these questions are the subject of this crs report this report will be updated as

embargo on china implications and options for us policy background policy dilemmas over the last two years the european union eu has been considering lifting its arms embargo on the peoples republic of china prc imposed after the june 1989 tiananmen square crackdown1 many countries imposed sanctions on china after deng xiaoping and other prc rulers ordered the military the peoples liberation army pla to violently s uppress peaceful demonstrators in beijing on june 4 1989 although the killin g of demonstr ators took pl ace beyond the tiananmen square in the capital of beijin g the crackdown is commonly called the tiananmen crackdown in reference to the s quare that was the focal point of the nationwide prode mocracy movement the bush administration opposes an end to the eus arms embargo on china seeing it as relaxation in the eus human rights and arms export policies toward china and out of step with us sanctions on arms sales to china that have remained since 1989 overall there are two sets of questions for congress in examining us policy toward this question what are the implications for us political and security interests concerning europe nd china if us interests are adversely affected what are some options for congress to discourage the eu from lifting its arms embargo on china and if it is lifted to protect us national security interests the purpose of this crs report is to discuss us concerns and implications for us interests as the eu considers the future of the arms embargo as well as options for us policy given strenuous us objections there are concerns that decision made by the eu to expand engagement with china by lifting the arms embargo would negatively impact the transatlantic alliance if there is division in us and european approaches toward china and defense c ooperation if the united states responds by restricting technology transfer s to europe or defense pr ocurement from europe at the same time the current disagreemen t presents an opportunity for closer coordination of useuropean policies including controls over militaryrelated exports and strategy towards china the united states has important interests in maintaining strong alliances with common approaches toward rising chinahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32870crs2 2 see crs report rl30341 chinataiwan evolu tion of the one china policy key statements from washington beijing and taipei and crs report rl30957 taiwan major us arms sales since 1990 both by shirley kanlike europe washington increasingly has engaged beijing on the economic political and military fronts fundamental issue then has been how engagement is pursued and whether it contributes to more responsible china in domestic and international affairs or aggravates developments in china with adverse implications for decades usprc relations have expanded with trad and cooperation on international issues there remain wester n concerns however about restrictions on human rights and democracy in china and about the impact of chinas weapons proliferation practices nd military buildup on peace and stability in asia and other regions around the world because some european companies have transferred defenserelated systems to china under the arms embargo that is not gally binding the united states has called for the eu to maintain the embargo and strengthen export controls there are fears that any acceleration of chinas military modernization with european defense technology would result in instability in th taiwan strait which could involve us military intervention this concern st ems from one dilemma for us policy adherence to the one china policy since the nixon administration started secret talks with the prc in 1971 wh ile maintaining di plomatic relations with the republic of china commonly called taiwan until 1979 and unofficial relations since then taiwan remains the major usprc issu that could bring the countries into conflict the 1979 taiwan relations act tra pl 968 governs us policy toward taiwan including offering arms to assist its selfdefense the tra did not commit the president and congress to determine any decision to intervene in the event of threats to taiwan other than to consider any nonpeaceful efforts to determine taiwans future of grave concern to the united states nonetheless among the stipulations of us policy the tra declared that it is us policy to maintain the capacity of the united states to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the secur ity or the social or economic system of the people on taiwan2 thus in addition to issues about arms sales to taiwan and the extent of any us commitment to help defend taiwan one question is whether the us forces have the capability to deter or defeat the pla not only in the event of use of force but also coercion against taiwan maintenance of crossstrait stability has required careful balance of ties with both the prc and taiwan there have been periodically heightened tensi ons between the prc and taiwan since the taiwan strait crisis of 1995 1996 sensitive assertions of separate national identity in taiwan since 1999 and president bushs articulation of strong er us support for taiwans selfdefense in 2001 later qualified by criticism of taiwans president in 2003 for perceived attempts to ch ange the crossstrait status

member states these include the suspension of military cooperation and highlevel contacts reduction of cultura l scientific and technical cooperation programs and the prolongati on of visas to chinese

the eus june 1989 declaration on china is not legally binding it represents political commitment that ll eu members are supposed to uphold and enforce15 each eu member however define s and implements the arms embargo differently this has allowed some eu countries to conti nue to export certain types of military equipment to china despite the embargo according to the eu the embargo does not cover

issued its policy pa per on the eu urging the eu to lift its arms embargo in order to remove barriers to greater bilateral cooperation in defense industries and technology17 the eu began reexamining the arms embargo in early 200418 france and germany were key dr ivers of this review process the euchina summit on december 8 2004 came three days before crucial elections in taiwan for which its presid ent campaigned unsuccessfully to win majority for his coalition in the legislature that some feared would lead to constitutional changes cons idered by beijing to pr ovocatively push for jure independence the eu decided to maintain the embargo at that sensitive time although it asserted its political intention to continue to work towards lifting the embargo china welcomed this positive signal for development of the comprehensive strategic pa rtnership with the eu19 the decision to end the eu arms embargo rests with the member states of the union and requires unanimity in other words all member states of the now25 member eu must agree before the arms embargo can be lifted at the december 16 17 2004 meeting of eu heads of state and government in brussels eu leaders reaffirmed the political will to continue to work toward lifting the arms embargo20 the eu did not state firm date for ending the emba rgo but statements by eu officials strongly suggested that the emba rgo would be lifted in the spring of 2005 france and germany under the previous leadership of german chancellor gerhard schroeder have b een key proponents of ending the eu arms embargo on china other member states have been more hesitant the united kingdom uk and the netherlands have shar ed us concerns about the strategic implications of an end to the embargo while some of the s candinavian countries and other smaller states with strong human rights advocacy policies have also been less enthusiastic but by early 2005 sufficient consensus appeared to have been built up among eu members to lift the embargo in may or j une 2005 the willingness of the uk and others to overturn the embargo appeared ba sed on their view that the embargo itself was largely ineffective and that it would only be lifted if stronger eu export control regime was put in place at the same time some observers also suggest that london was eager to burnish its european credentials and keen to avoid another fight with paris and berlin so soon after their rift over the war in iraq however the eu did not move ahead w ith lifting the embargo in the spring of 2005 eu officials attribute the delay rgely to the prcs

taiwans separation fro m china or the possibilities of peaceful unification are completely exhausted th country may adopt nonpeaceful means and other necessary measures to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity21 the european union quickly criticized this antisecession law stating that the eu opposes any use of force and asks all pa rties to avoid any ilateral action which might rekindle tensions22 uk foreign secretary jack straw stated that the new prc law created quite difficult political environment23 the prc move appeared to strengthen us arguments that lifting the embargo could send the wrong signal to beijing and that pla possibly equipped with improved euprovided defense technologies could pose threat to taiwan and us forces in asia highlevel eu delegation to washington in midmarch 2005 failed to c onvince us officials and members of congress that existing eu plans for tig hter export controls would sufficiently constrain arms sales to china strong us opposition and lingering human rights concerns about china also caused some eu members to cons ider post poning the decision on the arms embargo24 as result ending the arms embargo on china does not appear to be high on the eus agenda for the near to medium term the new german government of chancellor angela merkel which assumed office in november 2005 is perceived as being much less enthusiastic about lif ting the embargo especially without us consent than the previous schroeder g overnment the united states and the eu have also begun strategic dialogue on china and other asian security issues however many analysts point out that the eu remains politically committed to lifting the embargo and believe that its end may ultimately be only matter of time china continues to

to the eus arms embargo on china based on two major points the first argument is that chinas human rights violations that formed the basis for the em bargo still exist the second is that any expanded eu defense sales to china would da mage us security interests the us national interests threatened by lifting of the arms embargo deal with security and valueprojection especially human rights and democracy whether the eus arms embargo is significant or symbolic lifting it would reduce the leverage of the united states and europe on china to improve its human rights situation from the viewpoint of us concerns relaxation would send signal to china that it can continue to violate internati onal standards of human rights and that the united states rather than china is increasingly isolated in its views the pressure would also lessen on the rulers in beijing to reexa mine the tiananmen crackdown since the late 1990s the united states has urged china to ratify and adhere to the international covenant on civil and political rights26 on the eve of the euchina summit in december 2004 china acknowledged that it was s till studying how to ratify the covenant27 on january 28 2004 state department spokesman acknowledged that the united states had held seniorlevel disc ussions with france and other eu countries about the issue of whether to lift the embargo on arms sales to china he said certainly for the united states our statutes and regulations prohibit sales of defense items to china we believe that others should maintain their current arms embargoes as well we believe that the us and european prohibitions on arms sales are complementary were imposed for the same reasons specifically serious human rights abuses and that those reasons remain valid today28 the bush

department spokesman argu ed on january 25 2005 that the united states would continue to champion human ri ghts in countries wh ether they are small or big and that chinas human rights situation not only has not improved but has suffered some negative developments31 on february 28 2005 the state department issued its report on human ri ghts in 2004 it reported that chinas human rights record remained poor and the government continued to commit numerous and serious abuses althoug h it amended the constitution to mention human rights for the first time moreove r authorities were quick to suppress religious political and social groups th at they perceived as threatening to government authority or national stability especially before sensitive dates such as the 15th anniversary of the 1989 tiananmen ma ssacre and other significant political and religious occasions the prc government also used the international war on terrorism as pretext for cracking down harshly on suspected uighur separatists expressing peaceful political dissent and on independent muslim religious leaders32 however there is an apparent inconsistency in the administrations claim that the eu is not taking into adequate cons ideration chinas human rights conditions on march 17 2005 china released uig hur woman named rebiya kadeer whom china arrested in 1999 in xinjiang and on the same day the state department announced that the administration decided not to introduce resolution on chinas human rights abuses at the human rights commission in geneva citing some significant steps on human rights the state department acknowledged that kadeers impending release was factor in the decision the decision raised question about whether it undermined the u s position that the eu should not end the arms embargo because of human rights concerns the state department responded that the embargo was imposed because of the tiananmen crackdown and there are hundreds of demonstrators that remain imprisoned and there is complete unwillingness to revisit or examine that incident in critical light so with regard to the conditions leading to the embargo those have not changed at all period33 regarding this us argument chinas government remains unmoved in its position that it was justified in using mil itary force in the tiananmen crackdown the state departments report on human rights

as larg ely worthless they point out that the language in the eus 1989 political declara tion calling for the embargo is extremely vague and each member state defines and imp lements it differently many countries including the uk and france have interp reted the embargo narrowly to cover lethal military items but have tinued to supply avionics radar and other military related equipment nor does the embargo apply to dualuse items that can be used for both civil and military purposes75 nevertheless some defense experts and us officials claim that the embargo has exerted restraining influence on many member states and thus has prevented sales to china of weapons systems such as fighters and submarines european officials claim that they have intenti on of selling their next generation weapons systems to china even if the embargo is lifted french defense minister michele alliotmarie has asserted that we dont sell our stateoft heart technologies to just anyone76 some defense analysts however belie ve that an end to the eu embargo could cause ripple effect in this view other countries already selling to china such as israel may be compelled to sell even more advanced or hightech items to china in order to remain competitive with european sellers77 the eus code of conduct and arms export control regime78 eu officials also stress that the arms embargo is neither the only nor the principal mechanism governing member states military exports to china member states maintain their own national export controls and in 1998 they agreed on the eu code of conduct on arms exports79 the code sets out eight criteria for eu members to utilize when reviewing license requests and making decisions on whether or not to make an arms export these can be summarized as follows 1 consistency of export with international commitments arising from eu or the organization for security and coopera tion in europe osce arms embargoes 2 risk that export would be used for in ternal repression or where the recipient country has engaged in serious violations of human rights 3 risk that export would provoke or prolong armed conflicts 4 risk of recipient using export to undermine

export would undermine the stainable developmen t of the recipient country in june 2000 the eu adopted common list of military equipment covered by the eu code in an effort to encourage standardization across the union80 the eu asserts that the code is intended to complement national arms export control legislation adopted by member states so eu members such as germany have also reportedly translated the code into their national legislation the code also applies to dualuse goods if the enduser may be the recipient countrys police or military forces in ddition eu member states exports of dual use items are governed by an eu regulation that is directly applicable in eu member states it establishes requirements that must be met and procedures to be followed for granting export licenses for dualuse g oods in june 2003 eu members also established common rules to control arms brokering to prevent circumvention of eu or osce embargoes on arms expor ts and the criteria established in the eu code it calls on member states to put in place legal norms for lawful brokering activities including obtaining written authorization prior to engaging in arms brokering and to keep records for least 10 years81 many europeans argue that the 1998 code of conduct has been much more instrumental in blocking arms sales to china including hightech and dualuse exports than has the 1989 arms embargo because the code spells out specific criteria and sets up denial notification and consultati on mechanism and other arms sales reporting requirements these measures they claim exert considerable peer pressure on the member states to abide by the code for example under the denial notification procedure member states are required to transmit through diplomatic channels information on licenses refused and reasons for the denial before member state authorizes license for the same transaction that has already been refused by another member state it must first consult the member state that rejected the license if member state decides to issue the license it must inform the state that refused to grant authorization nevertheless numerous analysts have criticized the code for containing several weaknesses and loopholes that militate against the code bein g strong regime in its current form for example some point out that although the code sets up denial notification procedure there is require ment for notification of licenses granted many also say that the codes gene ral reporting requirements do not providehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32870crs23 82 the eus annual

transparency or accountab ility the code calls on each member state to prepare confidential annual re port which is to be circulated by each member to the other eu states on its defense export s and implementation of the code consolidated public report is subsequent ly produced based on the submissions of individual eu members however the complete details of actual arms exports made by eu states are not set out in this pub lic document although it does provide values of arms export licenses issued and values of deliveries made if available by the exporting country supplier list is also provided giving tota l of sales denials made but not what specific weapon sale wa s denied nor to w hom consequently some analysts say that the codes re porting requirements do not provide full or clear picture of all eu arms exports this in turn fuels suspicions that some eu member states may be understating the exte nt of defense deals already taking place with china furthermore critics argue that individual states have different arms trade licensing data collecting and reporting pr actices so there is often lack of uniformity in reporting across the membersh ip of the eu for example the eus 2003 public report on the codes implementation breaks dow n the export data by eu common military list category for those states whose licensing systems categorize their arms export licenses in detail it is possible to get sense of what general types of military equipment are being licensed however the uk provides detailed breakdown of its licenses because the way its standard export licenses are valued in its national licensing system currently preclude this the same is true for italy and the czech republic france and germany are able to break down the categories of their licenses for purposes of the eu report82 another complaint that some us critics level against the code is that it is neither legally binding nor enforceable they are skeptical of eu arguments that the code represents an effective politically binding commitment or that its reporting requirements dissuade member states from financially profitabl arms exports as evidence they point to the increase in eu arms sales licenses to china over the last few years eu officials maintain that lthough the code is not legally binding it is not voluntary either all member states have agreed and are expected to implement the common foreign policy goals and mo ral imperative embodied in the code some analysts suggest that the code should be transformed into an eu common position in the context of the eus

china and continues to urge the eu to maintain its embargo and strengthen export controls in the event that the eu opts to overturn the embargo eu officials insist that it will not lead to more arms sales to china they point out that at the eus december 2004 summit the eu pl edged that any eventual eu decision to end the arms embargo on china should not result in an increase of arms exports from eu member states to china neither in quantitative nor qualitative terms this pledge has been dubbed the standstill clause in addition the eu announced plans to adopt revised code of conduct and new toolbox ie measures that will pertain to arms exports for countries like china that are emerging from an eu arms embargo both the revised code and th toolbox seek to improve consultation transparency and accountability among member states the united kingdom and some smaller member states with human ri ghts concerns about china have been key drivers behind these efforts aimed at strengthening the code they claim that the eu arms embargo on china will not be lifted until there is agreement on more robust code and on the toolbox85 the strengthened code and the toolbox have reportedly been finalized at the technical level but await political approval from eu leaders86 publicly available details of the contents of both documents however are currently sketchy press reports and discussions

the extent to which the european allies share us interests and threat perceptions decision by 19 nato allies to lift the eus arms embargo on china in the absence of stronger eu arms export control

credible and relia ble security partners lifting the embargo in order to pave th way for closer euchina ties may also heighten us concerns that the eu is seeking to create multipolar world to constrain us influence eu members argue that they are not trying to strengthen china in order to balance or rival the united states european policymakers admit that they did not adequately anticipate u s strategic concerns about ending the embargo but that they are now trying to address us worries at the same time some europeans bristle at such vocal u s opposition because in their view the bush administration has appeared unintereste d until recently in consulting with or listening to its longtime allies on range of international issues from iraq to climate change they also worry that washingtons attempts to encourage one or more eu member states to veto ending the arms embargo on china may hinder eu efforts to develop more common foreign policy some us and european officials and defense companies are concerned that if the eu moves ahead with ending the arms ban on china this could impede us european defense cooperation on weapons sy stems and technology transfers over the years the united states has develope d defense arrangements with individual eu members states either by the direct sales of us defense article s defense services and military technology to them or by engagi ng in joint cooperative ventures in the defense area overturning the eu emba rgo on china would probably increase us fears that military equipment or sensitive weapons technologies sold to or shared with european countries might be reexported to china consequently should the united states d ecide to impose severe restrictions on current or future sales or on defense cooperation due to c oncerns raised by the lifting of the eu arms embargo on china the effect on useu defense industrial cooperation and the quality and quantity of defense items so ld to or purchased from eu countries could be significant th potential effects are illustrated by the following american sales of defense artic services and technology to individual states of the european union have been notable from

between 2000 and 2004 the united states has imported from single member of the eu the united kingdom approximately 6 billion in defense products94 various eu member states are suppliers of defense

to us restrictions on military sales to them see the text box below for examples of such weapons system s and the eu members that supply these defense articles to the unite d states although the

member states from existing us arms export controls for several years efforts have been underway to exempt in particular the united kingdom from the requirements of s ection 38j of the us arms export control act aeca this has generally b een referred to as seeking waiver from the international traffic in arms regulations itar95 under such an exemption unclassified defense items quipment and intellectual mate rials could be exported without the need for us export license the rationale for such an exemption has been that certain allied countries with prove n records of strict arms export controls and common concerns about weapons pro liferation should be permitted to obtain us defense articles and services with minimum of regulatory review prior to the recent controversy over the eu embargo on china the uk had not yet fully overcome congressional concerns about the nature of uk export controls including concerns about retransfer controls in october 2004 congress passed provision

receptive to us arguments that lifting the eu embargo could also damage useuropean relations in nato if the us strategy however is perceived as trying to divide and weaken the eu it could backfire and increase transatlantic tensions washington might also more systematically and publicly raise concerns about russian and is raeli arms sales to china in order to deflect european complaints that eu members are being singled out for criticism encourage the eu to strengthen its code of conduct the united states could encourage significant strengthening of the european unions code of conduct to enhance its transparency nd provide eu member states with nearrealtime notice of prospective arms sales to china prior to issuance of an export license in this way those eu members concerned about the negative implications of such sale could bring peer pressure to bear within the eu arms control context sufficient to dissuade the prospective seller from agreeing to such sale urging the eu to make the eu code of conduct in its strengthened form common position could also enhance its cred ibility as an instrument of arms exports control the united states could also encourage the eu to incorporate into its own military control list the munitions lists of all major international arrangements including the wassenaar arrangement military control lists fully encompassing all weapons lists in one place would further nhance the credibility of the eus code as the principal vehicle for eu arms exports control promote cooperative useu strategy the united states could promote c

east asia may also enable washington to draw its european allies and friends into deeper engagement on the question of taiwan greater intelligence sharing might be pursued within this broad strategic dialogue the united states could promote regular consultative meetings on potential us and eu arms sales to the region the united states could in this way express to the eu what its greatest concerns may be regarding specific types of arms transfers to china such vehicle would not intrude on the sovereignty of the eu member states by mandating prohibited arms sales list for china but would provide the eu the united states and possibly japan with clear picture of what arms sales may be in prospect and afford private opportunity for the united states in advance of any sale to china to explain in detail its concerns about such sale in this way it is possible that controve rsies over potentially problematic sales to china could be minimized or avoided pursue robust bilateral efforts on european arms exports the united states could seek bilateral agreements with individual eu member states to constrain arms sales to china and possibly to ban the transfer of sensitive us weapons or technology to china this might help ensure that us interests are taken into consideration by each eu member state given that national sovereignty concerns still limit the coordination of arms export control policies at the eu level such arrangements would also protect us defense cooperation with those eu member states that have agreed with us conditions however it is unclear whether eu member states would be receptive to such bilateral arrangements some may prefer an euwide agreement in order to bolster harmonization of export controls throughout the union some member stat might demand itar waivers or greater access to the us defense market as the price of such bilateral agreements engage with the european parliament members of congress could seek to play role in shaping the transatlantic debate on east asia by engaging in disc ussions with counterparts in the european parliament through the existing transatlantic legislators dialogue the european parliament has passed
