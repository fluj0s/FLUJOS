in public finance government and finance division summary us federal taxes generally do not apply to individuals in puerto rico with the exception of social security taxes instead puerto rico levies its own taxes at level higher than those of most us states but lower than that of the federal government for businesses partial federal tax exemption is provided by the puerto rican economic activities credi t and the possessions tax credit under sections 30a and 936 of the internal revenue code puerto rico itself provides set of partial tax exemptions that are designed to complement the special federal corporate tax benefit however under federal legislation enacted in 1996 the credits are currently being phased out and will expire entirely in 2006 congress has frequently considered the tax treatment of puerto rico in the context of several different policy issues for example is the current partial application of federal taxes to puerto rico equitable given the partial application of federal transfer programs to puerto rico and is the federal corporate tax benefit effective in promoting investment and employment in puerto rico also because statehood or independence would each alter the federal tax treatment of puerto rico federal tax policy has been an issue in deliberations over puerto ricos political status this report will be updated as major legislative developments occur individual income taxes normally the united states taxes its citizens on their worldwide income regardless of its geographic source and puerto ricans are us citizens but while this would ordinarily mean that puerto ricans would be subject to full federal taxation section 933 of the us internal revenue code irc exempts residents of puerto rico from federal income tax on that part of their income that has its source in puerto rico thus puerto ricans pay federal income tax only on income they receive from the united states or other nonpuerto rican sources for example wage and salary income of person living and working in puerto rico is normally exempt from federal tax1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20718crs2 1 continued credit puerto rican taxes they pay against their federal tax liability 2 federal law requires the us virgin islands guam and the commonwealth of the northern marianas to mirror the federal tax code american samoa is not required to mirror the federal system but has nonetheless adopted the federal tax code as its own territorial system with some modifications 3 total state individual income taxes though varying significantly by state are 32 of us person

economic report of the president washington gpo 2000 pp 399 404 more general comparison contrasts the level of all taxesnot just individual income taxes collected in by each jurisdiction as percentage of gross national product gnp in 1998 federal taxes were 215 of us gnp puerto rican taxes were 154 of the commonwealths gnp and state taxes were 101 of us gnp we use gnp rather than gross domestic product in the comparison because of the large outflow of factor payments from puerto rico puerto ricos own tax system is distinct from that of the other us possessions in that puerto rico is not required to mirror the federal irc and adopt federal tax rules and rates as its own2 puerto ricos rate structure is slightly lower than the federal structure but its brackets are substantially narrower so that the higher rates apply at much lowe r levels of taxable income also while puerto ricos tax system provides for personal exemption amounts and standard deduction they are smaller than those of the federal system nonetheless the level of puerto ricos individual income tax revenue is roughly half that of the federal government puerto rican taxes are 60 of puerto rican personal income federal taxes are 113 of mainland personal income the reason is doubtlessly that puerto ricos lower per capita income places more individuals in lower tax brackets compared to residents of the 50 states at the same time puerto ricos taxes apply at higher rate than do those of most us states3 corporate income taxes just as us citizens are ordinarily subject to federal tax on their worldwide income corporations chartered in the 50 states or the district of columbia likewise pay corporate income tax on their worldwide income but as with individual income taxes special exemption exists with puerto rico in this case provided by two alternative tax credits the possessions tax credit and the puerto rican economic activity credit respectively provided by sections 936 and 30a of the us internal revenue code under either credit us firm can exempt part of its puerto ricosource income from federal corporate income taxes the possessions tax credit generally enables qualifying firms to exempt 40 of their income from federal tax prior to 1993 firms could use the possessions tax credit to exempt all their puerto rican income from tax the essential elements of the economic activity credit were enacted in 1993 and provide an exemption linked with employment and investment in puerto rico the more wages and depreciation firm claims in puerto rico the larger the exemption delivered by the credit in the years following world war ii the government of puerto rico depended on the possessions tax credit and its own set of tax benefits to attract investment to puerto rico from the us mainland the tax benefit and the inflow of investment it stimulated helpedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20718crs3 4 for furth er information on the tax credits see crs report rs20695 the puerto rican economic activity tax credit current proposals and scheduled phaseout by david l brumbaugh 5 this point is made in us congress general accounting office us insular areas information on fiscal relations with the federa l government gaotggd9571 washington continuedtransform the puerto rican economy from one based on agriculture to one based on manufacturing services and trade however the credit was criticized on several grounds that it had high revenue cost compared to its employment effect that large share of the benefit did not accrue to residents of puerto rico and that it distorted deliberations over puerto ricos political status as result over the past 20 years the credit has been subject to series of modifications designed to limit its revenue cost and tie the credits benefit and effects more tightly to puerto ricothe 1993 revisio ns that capped the possessions tax credit at 40 and that linked the alternative credit to wages and depreciation were two such revisions the modifications culminated with the small business job creation act of 1996 which scheduled the credit for phaseout and ultimate repeal after 20054 an alternative tax benefit known as deferral is also available for mainland firms in puerto rico although most us firms in puerto rico currently use the tax credits rather than deferral deferral is available for us firms operating through foreign subsidiaries in foreign countries as well as the us possessions and works like this the united states taxes the income of corporations chartered in the united states on their worldwide income at the same time however corporations chartered abroad or in the us possessions are not subject to us tax on foreignsource income or income earned in the possessions thus us firms can avoid federal taxes on their foreign or possessions income by arranging to earn that income through subsidiary corporations chartered in the possessions or abroad the income the subsidiaries earn is generally not subject to federal taxes until it is repatriated to the mainland us parent corporation as dividends or other income for many firms the possessions tax credit and economic activity credit provide larger tax benefit than deferral because possessions income that is exemp t under the possessions tax credit is not subject to federal taxes when it is remitted to mainland parents the deferral benefit in other words provides postponement of tax while the exemptions afforded by the tax credits are permanent also the tax codes rules governing allocati on of income between taxfavored possessions subsidiaries and their mainland parents are more generous under the tax credit regimes in theory puerto ricos own corporate income tax could nullify any corporate tax benefit provided under the federal tax if puerto rico were to tax what the federal government does not however puerto rico has enacted set of its own tax benefits for businesses that complement the federal tax benefits excise taxes in general federal excise taxes apply in puerto rico only where the internal revenue code explicitly extends them to puerto rico5 by this standard most federal excise

consumed in puerto rico however there are exceptions notably the environmental taxes imposed under chapter 38 of the tax code on petroleum and certain chemicals different type of exception is provided by section 7652 of the tax code which applies special equalization excise tax to items produced in puerto rico or the us virgin islands and shipped to the us mainland the tax is equal to any excise tax that would apply to an identical item produced on the mainland and was first imposed to ensure that producers in the possessions would not have tax advantage over mainland produced goods that are subject to excise taxes all revenue from this socalled equalization tax however is returned covered over or rebated by the federal government to the treasuries of puerto rico and the virgin islands in addition the caribbean basin initiative of 1983 provides that all revenue from federal excise taxes on rum imported into the mainland from any source including any foreign country is remitted to the treasuries of puerto rico and the virgin islands6 in 1998 the rebates to puerto rico amounted to 2003 million 34 of the puerto rican governments revenue7 special limitation applies to the cover over of the tax on distilled spirits which ordinarily applies at the rate of 1350 per proof gallon in general the tax code limits the amount of this tax that is covered over to 1050 per proof gallon however in 1999 public law 106170 temporarily increased the coverover rate to 1325 per proof gallon during the period june 30 1999 to january 1 2002 other taxes federal estate and gift taxes essentially do not apply to residents of the possessions including puerto rico in general federal estate taxes apply to the estates of decedents who were us citizens they apply to estates of nonresident aliens only in the case of tangible property located in the united states while residents of the possessions are generally us citizens special provision exempts them in the same manner as nonresident aliens if their us citizenship is derived solely from their birth or residence in possession thus for example the estate of person born on the mainland but

puerto rico as do federal unemployment tax act futa taxes puerto rico is within the united states customs jurisdiction us customs duties apply to goods imported into puerto rico however as with excise taxes revenue from the customs duties is rebated to puerto rico in 1998 the rebates were 722 million9 financial flows between the federal government and puerto rico one policy issue with respect to federal taxes is whether their current partial applicability is equitable as us citizens should puerto ricans be fully subject to federal taxes this in turn is an issue that cannot be addressed by looking at taxes alone the manner in which federal transfer programs apply to the possessions also has bearing and some federal programs do not apply fully in puerto rico the equity issue regarding taxes is thus whether the partial application of federal taxes to puerto rico is fair given that not all federal spending programs extend fully to puerto rico comprehensive description of how federal spending programs apply to puerto rico is beyond the scope of this report nonetheless we make several general observations puerto rico participates fully in the social security and medicare programs but at the same time while they participate in most other federal welfare programs federal funding for most of the programs is capped at maximum dollar amount10 data provide detail on this situation tables 1 and 2 below present numbers on federal spending and federal revenue collections in puerto rico the data are presented in separ ate tables because they are from separate sources and are therefore not strictly comparable table 1 payments by residents of puerto rico to the federal government puerto rican fiscal year 1998 in millions of dollars totalsocial security medicare and civil

several factors have changed since 1990 welfare reform and the scheduled repeal of the federal corporate tax creditstable 2 federal outlays in puerto rico federal fiscal year 1998 in millions of

consolidated federal funds report 1998 state and county areas washington gpo 1999 pp 2530 while precise comparisons between the two tables cannot be made because of their separate sources it is nonetheless clear that federal payments to puerto rico outstrip puerto ricos payments to the federal government by wide margin yet this is not the full story on per capita basis federal spending in puerto rico is substantially less than either the united states average or that of the poorest state mississippi in 1998 per capita federal spending in puerto rico was 2880 compared to 5491 for the united states as whole and 5565 for mississippi11 the relationship holds even when procurement and wages and salaries are subtracted out leaving only transfer payments this last comparison underlines the point that if puerto rico does not bear the full burden of federal taxes neither does it participate fully in federal transfer programs how might the flow of funds to and from puerto rico change if puerto rico were to become state in the case of taxes puerto ricos low income level would severely limit the amount of additional federal tax that would be collected 1998 general accounting office study concluded that there would be small revenue loss less than 200 million under the individual income tax due primarily to payments of the refundable earned income tax credit the revenue gain under the corporate income tax would depend on how firms react to the repeal of the economic activities credit after 2000 and would amount to 1 billion to 46 billion12 in the case of spending the per capita comparisons in the preceding paragraph suggest that if puerto rico were treated like states spending would increase substantially and the increased outlays would likely be larger than increased revenue collections13
