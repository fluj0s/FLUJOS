homosexuals and us military service came into effect reflecting compromise in policy this compromise colloquially referred to as dont ask dont tell holds that the presence in the armed forces of persons who demonstrate propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts would create an unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale good order and discipline and unit cohesion which are the essence of military capability service members are not to be asked about nor allowed to discuss their homosexuality this compromise notwithstanding the issue has remained politically contentious prior to the 1993 compromise the number of individuals discharged for homosexuality was generally declining since that time the number of discharges for homosexual conduct has generally increased until recently constitutional challenges to the former and current military policies regarding homosexuals followed in the wake of the new 1993 laws and regulations based on the us supreme court ruling in bowers v hardwick that there is fundamental right to engage in consensual homosexual sodomy the courts have uniformly held that the military may discharge service member for overt homosexual conduct however the legal picture was complicated by the courts 2003 decision in lawrence v texas which overruled bowers by declaring unconstitutional texas law that prohibited sexual acts between same sex couples in addition unsettled legal questions remain as to whether discharge based solely on statement that service member is homosexual transgresses constitutional limits meanwhile efforts to allow individuals of the same sex to marry legally appear unlikely to affect the dod policy in the near term since such individuals are barred from serving in the military although court challenges are possible in recent years many academic institutions have enacted rules that protect homosexuals from discrimination on campus as result colleges iversities and even high schools have sought to bar military recruiters from their campuses andor to eliminate reserve officer training corps rotc programs on campus because of the dod po licy on homosexuals in the military at the same time legislation has been enacted that bars giving federal funds to campuses that block access for military recruiters on march 6 2006 the supreme court reversed federal appeals court ruling in rumsfeld v forum for academic and institutional rights f air and upheld the constitutionality of the solomon amendment which prohibits certain federal funding to higher educational institutions that deny access by military recruiters to their students equal to that provided to other employers on november 14 2006 the san francisco school board voted 42 to phase out junior rotc over two years that phaseout was later delayed by an additional year this report will be updated as events warrant

he would lift the ban on homosexuals serving in the military2 existing policies had been in place since the carter administration and historically speaking homosexuality had not been tolerated in the military services the issue drew heated debate among policymakers and the public at large in response to congressional concerns president clinton put into place in early 1993 an interim compromise that allowed the department of defense an opportunity to study the issue and develop draft executive order that would end discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation this interim compromise announced on january 29 1993 also provided congress additional time to more fully exercise its constitutional authority under article i section 8 clause 14 to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces including the consideration of legislation and the holding of hearings on the issue in announcing the interim agreement the president noted that the joint chiefs of staff agreed to remove questions regarding sexual orientation from the enlistment application 3 one of the elements of the compromise was an agreement within the congress not to immediately enact legislation that would have maintained the prior policy of barr ing homosexuals from service and continuing to ask recruits questions concerning their sexuality until after the completion of congressional review4 the senate and house armed services committees sasc and hasc held extensive hearings on the issue in 1993 by may 1993 congressional consensus appeared to emerge over what thensasc chairman sam nunn described as dont ask dont tell approach under this approach the department of defense would not as k questions concerning the sexual orientation of prospective members of the military and individuals would be required to either keep their homosexual orientation to themselves or if they did not they would be discharged if already in the service or denied enlistmentappointm ent if seeking to join the service on july 19 1993 president clinton announced his new policy on homosexuals in the military according to the president the policy was to be made up of these essential elements one service men and women will be judged based on their conduct not their sexual orientation two therefore the practice of not asking about sexual orientation in the enlistment procedure will continue three an open statement by service member that he or she is homosexual will create rebuttable presumption that he or she intends to engage in prohibited conduct but the service member will be given an opportunity to refute that presumption and four all provisions of the uniform code of military justice will be enforced in an evenhanded manner as regards both heterosexuals and homosexuals and thanks to the policy provisions agreed to by th joint chiefs there will be decent regard to the legitimate privacy and associational rights of all service members 5 1

pursue it is noteworthy that the president did not mention dont pursue in the announcement of the policy on july 19 1993 the inclusion of dont pursue akin to dont investigate stance advocated by homosexual rights groups seemingly created contradiction in the presidents policy6 on the one hand it maintained the notion of military necessity and privacy as found in the congressional compromise of dont ask dont tell and then appeared to prevent efforts to enforce the regulations and laws which implement the broad policy by limiting the militarys role via dont pursue this problem was discussed at hearings with thensecretary of defense aspin secretary aspin indicated that individuals could acknowledge their homosexuality without risking an investigation or discharge 7 later he said that individual statements might not be credible grounds for investigating if the commander so decided but if investigated such statements could be credible grounds for discharge proceeding ultimately the secretary agreed that statements are grounds for investigations and possible discharge in these same hearings held from march 29 1993 through july 22 1993 senators raised numerous questions as to what behavior if any would justify the commencement of an investigation and what grounds would justify an administrative discharge 8 since commanders and noncommissioned officers are not usually lawyers many critics argued that such rules created legal technicalities that would prove dysfunctional in military setting andor lead to an expansion of unpredictable court remedies 9 at the same time some argued that this outcome continued 1 july 19 1993 published 1994 1111 6 according to senior administration official we think that probably the most significant advance is heightenedno witch hunts pursuit policy so i think its fair to call this policy dont ask dont tell dont pursue white house briefing federal news service july 16 1993 7 the previous policy was ask do not tell investigate the proposed policy is do not ask do not tell do not investigate secretary of defense aspin us congress senate committee on armed services hearings policy concerning homosexuality in the armed forces senate hearings 103845 103rd cong 2nd sess 1994 746 and even secretary of defense aspin seemed bit confused about the clinton administrations new policy allowing homosexuals in the military expressing doubt as to whet her single acknowledgment of homosexuality by service member would constitute grounds for discharge but grasping the policys details could prove difficult as aspin himself demonstrated yesterday in response to question from sen jeff bingaman dnm the senator asked aspin what would happen in the case of homosexual soldier who reveals his sexual orientation to another soldier who then reports the conversation to commander at first aspin said flatly that such disclosure would not be grounds for dismissal but that brought puzzled response from committee chairman sen nunn who quoted aspin as saying in his opening remarks that homosexual statements were form of prohibited conduct at that point aspin seemed to shift position lancaster john senators find clinton policy on gays in the military confusing washington post july 21 1993 a12 8 an administrative discharge is designated as honorable general or other than honorable and is provided by an executive decision reflecting the nature of the service performed by the member bad conduct or dishonorable discharge can only be awarded via courtmartial during sentencing as discussed in the section entitled discharge statistics the vast majority of homosexuals who are discharged receive administrative discharges and most of those are designated honorable see the hearings with thensecretary of defense

103 rd cong 2nd sess 1994 700 et seq 9 the complex nature of the compromise was evident in the puzzlement of committee members who described the policy as confusing contradictory and an invitation to endless litigation in the courts lancaster july 21 1993 clinton interpreted this language at news conference yesterday to mean that gay service personnel do not necessarily have to remain in the closet the senior pentagon official acknowledged however that homosexuals probably will not be able to disclose their sexual orientation lancaster john policy tosses issue to courts ambiguity seen

the original intent this thesis held that implementation of the compromise polic would have encouraged judicial intervention and thereby would have provided means to seek judicial resolution asserting that the compromise was unconstitutional these critics hypothesized that the clinton administration may have been following strategy of tacitly im plementing muddled regulation awaiting legal challenge then poorly defending the policythereby encouraging judicial intervention in finding the policy unconstitutional 10 administration officials insisted that the president was merely trying to pursue compromise that would take into account the concerns of the congress and the military but would also minimize discrimination against homosexuals11 the policy announced by the clinton administration was based in large part on sexual orientation12 this term has generated problems concerning its practical definition some view sexual orientation as nonbehavioral while othe rs do not exclude behavioral manifestations when speaking of sexual orientation as will be discussed below the clinton administrations use of the term was subject to varying interpretations the ambiguities in the administrations interpretation of the policy as well as conflicting legal rulings at the time seemingly encouraged cong ress to act on november 30 1993 the fy1994 national defense authorization act was signed into law by president clinton pl 103160 section 571 of the law codified at 10 united states code 654 describes homosexuality in the ranks as an unacceptable risk to morale good order and discipline the law codified the grounds for discharge as follows 1 the member has engaged in attempted to engage in or solicited another to engage in homosexual act or acts 2 the member states that he or she is homosexual or bisexual or 3 the member has married or attempted to marry someone of the same sex the law also stated that dod would brief new entrants accessions and members about the law and policy on regular basis finally the law instructed that asking questions of new recruits concerning sexuality could be resumedhaving been halted in january 1993on discretionary basis as such this law represented discretionary dont ask definitely dont tell policy notably the law contains mention of orientation in many ways this law contained reiteration of the basic thrust of the pre1993 policy although it does not mention any restrictions regarding asking about persons sexuality on december 22 1993 secretary of defense aspin released new dod regulations to implement the statute enacted the preceding month language in these regulations indicated that the secretary was trying to incorporate both the restrictions in the law and the presidents desire to open military service to those who have homosexual orientation the policy stated service member may also be separated if he or she states that he or she is homosexual or bisexual or words to that effect such stat ement creates rebuttable presumption that the 10 clinton was also asked by reporter whether he would direct his justice department which had days before been in court arguing for the ban not to appeal the antiban ru ling but he did not answer today the clinton department of justice has not only appealed the antiban ruling but is arguing in court that the government can discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation burr chandler reprinted from california lawyer magazine june 1994 11 secretary of defense aspin stated the chiefs understood that the commanderinchief wanted to change the existing policy to end discrimination based solely on status the president understood that it was extremely important that any changes occur in way that maintained the high vel of morale and unit cohesion

do so the service member will have the opportunity to rebut that presumption however by demonstrating that he or she does not engage in homosexual acts and does not have propensity or intent to do so 13 however the policynot the law it ostensibly implementedstated that sexual orientation is considered personal and private matter and homosexual orientation is not bar to service entry or continued service unless manifested by homosexual conduct according to this statement of dod regulations sexual orientation was defined as sexual attraction to individuals of particular sex following aspins resignation and the confirmation of william perry as the new secretary of defense in february 1994 dod report edly accepted the recommendation of certain senators to delete from dod regulations the phrase homosexual orientation is not bar to military service 14 in its place dod inserted the statement persons sexual orientation is considered pers onal and private matter and is not bar to service or continued service unless manifested by homosexual conduct15 in addition the definition of sexual orientation was modified an abstract sexual preference for persons of particular sex as distinct from propensity or intent to engage in sexual acts 16 the elusiveness of the definition of orientation is apparent under the administrations original definition orientation is sexual attraction under the revised definition it is an abstract preference other sources define sexual orientation to include overt sexual behavior17 current regulations therefore are based on conduct including verbal or written statements since sexual orientation is personal and private dod is not to ask and personnel are not to tell should an individual choose to make his or he r homosexual orientation publicie longer private and personal nor abstractan investigation and discharge may well occur the ambiguous nature of the term orientation and its usage has not been without problems in 1994 navy tribunal decided not to discharge lt maria zoe dunning after she had made the statement i am lesbian at january 1993 rally her attorneys argued that she was not broadcasting her intentions to practice homosexuality but merely acknowledging her sexual orientation in the view of the reviewing officers she had successfully rebutted the presumption 13 office of the assistant secretary of defense public

inconsistent with the law and regulations created legal avenue via which homosexuals could announce their sexuality without being discharged shortly afterward the departme nt of defense office of the general counsel released memo18 in august 1995 addressing this issue member may not avoid the burden of rebutting the presumption merely by asserting that his or her statement of homosexuality was intended to convey only message about sexual orientation and not to convey any message bout propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts to the contrary by virtue of the statement the member bears the burden of proof that he or she does not engage in and does not attempt have propensity nor intend to engage in homosexual acts if the member in rebuttal offers evidence that he or she does not engage in homosexual acts or have propensity or intent to do so the offering of the evidence does not shift the burden of proof to the government rather the burden of proof remains on the member throughout the proceeding 19 as written the law makes mention of sexual orientation and is structured entirely around the concept of sexual conduct including statements concerning an individuals sexuality therefore attempts to implement the statute or analyze and evaluate it in terms of sexual orientation have resulted in confusion and am biguity and are likely to continue to do so more recently representative martin meehan introduced hr 1246 february 28 2007 to repeal the 1993 law and establish policy of nondiscrimination based on sexual orientation in the armed forces following representative meehans retirement from congress representative ellen tasucher has championed this legislation the legislation has 143 cosponsors on june 3 2008 former senator sam nunn chair of the senate armed services committee in 1993 when the current law was passed said that it could be time to revisit the issue 20

policy in 1993 the number of discharges for homosexuality has increased 21 according to data provided by dod and reproduced in table 1 page 12 from the early 1980s until fiscal year fy 1994 the number

properly applied and enforced dod also stated first we found that the large majority of the discharges for homosexual conduct are based on the statements of service members who identify themselves as homosexual as opposed to cases involving homosexual acts the services believe that most of these statements although not all of theminvolve service members who voluntarily elect to disclose their sexual orientation to their peers supervisors or commanders the increase in the number of discharges for homosexual conduct since 1994 is attributable to this increase in statement cases discharges for homosexual acts and marriages has declined by 20 over the past three years 19941997 second most of those discharged under the policy are junior personnel with very little time in the military and most of the increase in discharges for homosexual conduct has occurred in this sector the number of cases involving career service members is relatively small third the great majority of discharges for homosexual conduct are uncontested and are processed administratively finally more than 98 of all members discharged in fiscal year 1997 under the po licy received honorable discharges separation of enlisted members in their first 180 days of military service are generally uncharacterized discharges under other than honorable conditions or courtsmartial for consensual homosexual conduct are infrequent and have invariably involved aggravating circumstances or additional charges 22 with over decade 19932006 of experience under the most recent changes instituted during the clinton administration other explanati ons as to why individuals may announce their homosexuality have come forward most notable is the observation that the vast majority of those discharged for homosexuality are discharged because they made voluntary statements identifying themselves as homosexual bisexual or having such an orientation some have speculated recently that these statements are made by service members so as to enable them to terminate their military obligations before their term of service is completed regardless of their sexual orientation 23 22 us department of defense office of the assistant secretary of defense personnel and readiness report to the secretary of defense review of the effectiveness of the application and enforcement of the departments policy on homosexual conduct in the military april 1998 3 this report stated that investigations could only be initiated after commanders receive specific and credible information concerning homosexual c onduct and that inappropriate investigations occurred only in isolated instances 23 for example see moskos charles the law worksand heres why army times october 27 2003 62 homosexual separations for whatever reason are onetenth of 1 of military personnel of those discharges more than 80 are the result of voluntary statements by service members the number of discharges for homosexual acts has declined over the past decade gayrights advocates argue that the growth in discharges for statements is due largely to commanders improperly seeking out gays undoubtedly that happens sometimes yet commanders also report being worried they might be accused of c onducting witch hunts so they tend to process out an alleged homosexual only when case of telling is dumped in thei r laps let offer another possible explanation whether youre gay or not saying you are is now the quickest way out of the military with an honorable discharge and identifying oneself as gay carries less stigma in our society than it once did consider that whites are proportionately three times more likely than blacks to be discharged for homosexuality are commanders singling out whites and investigating their sexual orientation highly unlikely the stigma against homosexuality is stronger among blacks than whites and thus blacks are less w illing to declare they are gay gay advocates are quick to draw an analogy between the exclusion of homosexuals and racial segregation in the military many black soldiers find that analogy offensive see also christenson sig recruits deny lackland harassment san antonio expressnews

increased since the 1998 review and that those discharges were brought about by witch hunts or invasive and unwarranted searching and discharging of homosexuals in the ranks24 although cases of aggressive investigations have been reported the data would not appear to support the general use of such tactics recently as the number of discharges has decreased activists claim the administration is retaining homosexuals because of the need for manpower as result of operations enduring freedom and iraqi freedom at the same time activists bemoan the discharge of number of linguists who were found to be homosexuals 25 critics contend that the activists are trying to have it both ways when analyzing data from the data it can be seen that homosexuals who are discharged represent an extremely small percentage of the force for instance if it is assumed that homosexuals make up only 16 of the total active force of approximately 14 million 26 there would be an estimated 22400 homosexuals in uniform in 2003 653 or 29 of the estimated homosexuals in uniform were discharged for homosexual conduct some have claimed that discharges decline during time of war suggesting that the military ignores homosexuality when soldiers are most needed only to kick them out once the crisis has passed27 it is notable that during wartime the military services can and have instituted actions to suspend certain laws relating to separation that can limit administrative discharges these actions known as stoploss 28 allow the services to minimize the disruptive effects of personnel turnover during crisis however administrative discharges for homosexual conduct normally are not affected by stoploss it can be speculated that claim of homosexuality during crisis 24 for example see langeland

investigation stoploss as implemented requires an investigation to determine if the claim is bona fide or being used for some other reason such as avoiding deployment ov erseas andor to combat zone if following an investigation such claim were found to be in violation of the law on homosexual conduct the services could not use stoploss to delay an administrative discharge29 in practice it is quite possible for an individual during crisis to claim to be homosexual and to be deployed while awaiting the results of an investigation likewise claim made during noncrisis situation would more likely be dealt with in routine manner leading to discharge homosexual rights groups assert that commanders tend to be more reluctant to discharge someone during crisis situation they contend that differing treatment of gays during crisis and noncrisis situation creates double standard likewise commanders and others are often more skeptical of such claims made during crisis according to an army reserve component unit commanders handbook 30 homosexual conduct is one of many criteria necessitating personnel action during the mobilization process according to this document if discharge for homosexuality has been requested and approved prior to the units receipt of alert notification the member will be discharged prior to the units effective date of active duty further if discharge is requested but not yet approved delayed entry will be requested pending final determination finally if discharge is not requested prior to the units receipt of alert notification discharge is not authorized some homosexual activists claim that this is proof that the military retains known homosexuals during time of crisismobilization this language addresses the possibility of false claim of homosexuality being used as means of avoiding mobilization if such claim is made an investigation is likely to occur if the claim is fa lse the individual would be retained and possibly disciplined for making false claim if the claim is found to be true discharge would be in order retaining individuals who violate the rules pertaining to homosexuals in uniform is violation of federal law listed in table 1 are the homosexual discharge statistics from fy1980 to fy2006 in january 1981 the thencurrent policy on administrative discharges for homosexuality was reinstituted under new wording to allow for the continuation of homosexual discharges while addressing legal concerns over the wording of the previous policy 31 the active duty force numbered approximately 21 million throughout the 1980s by fy2000 active duty personnel numbers fell to low of 1384338 the numbers increased to 1434377 in fy2004 because of this drop in manpower levels it is important to consider not just the number

begun to decline these percentages were declining prior to and continued to decline following the 1991 persia n gulf war operations desert shielddesert storm if as some have speculated dod was using stop loss to retain homosexuals during that war we would have expected to see drop in the wartime discharge rate followed by an increase following the crisis such pattern is not evident in these data during the period covered by these data the average percentage discharged was 0064 for the period prior to the implementation of the new policy and law ie fy1980 to fy1992 the average percentage discharged was 0060 for the period fy1993 to fy2005 the average was 0062 the difference in the percentage discharged before and following the implementation of the new policy was statistically insignificant thus although the data appear to move in differing directions prior to and following the implementation of the new policy statistical analysis suggests that such changes may reflect

military policies regarding homosexuals began to accelerate following implementation of the dont ask dont tell compromise in 1993 lengthy tradition of special deference to the political branches led most federal district and appeals courts to affirm the considered professional judgment of military leaders to discipline or discharge service member for homosexual conduct or speech based on the 1986 supreme court ruling in bowers v hardwick that there is fundamental right to engage in consensual homosexual sodomy 33 the courts ruled that the military could constitutionally discharge service member for overt homosexual behavior judicial challenges to dont ask dont tell focused on the statements provision of the new policy which presumes absent contrary evidence homosexual activity or

1999 when it declined to hear the appeal of two former service members who were discharged after declaring their homosexuality to commanding officers without comment the jus tices declined to consider arguments that the policy was based on prejudice against homosexuals and violates their free speech rights35 complicating the legal picture however is the courts 2003 ruling in lawrence v texas 36 which declared unconstitutional texas law that prohibited sexual acts between same sex couples justice kennedy writing for the majority held that the liberty interest in privacy guaranteed by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment protects right for adults to engage in private consensual homosexual conduct the lawrence majority expressly overruled bowers contrary conclusion justice kennedy agreed with the dissent in bowers that the statutes do seek to control personal relationship that whether or not entitled to formal recognition in the law is within the liberty of persons to choose without being punished as criminals the majority opinion continued the petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives the state cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct crime the right to liberty under the due process clause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without the intervention of the government it is promise of the constitution that there is realm of personal liberty which the government cannot enter the texas statute furthers legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual 37 in particular the communitys moral disapproval of homosexuality was rational justification for deploying the power of the state to enforce those views justice oconnor concurred in the judgment but rather than overrule bowers would have declared the texas statute unconstitutional on equal protection grounds because it did not likewise prohibit sodomy between opposite sex couples based on bowers earlier federal appellate courts uniformly ruled that the military ban on homosexual acts intruded upon constitutionally protected right and was rationally related to legitimate military needs for unit cohesion and discipline moreover by equating the admission of homosexuality by individual service membersunless demonstrated otherwisewith propensity for illegal conduct the dont ask dont tell policy successfully avoided equal protection and first amendment challenge as well after lawrence however the constitutional bulwark of bowers has crumbled arming opponents of article 125 38 and dont ask dont tell with an argument that current military policies abridge the due process right to privacy of homosexual service members but to prevail in that argument any future challenger may still have to demonstrate that findings by congress regarding those policies defy minimal rationality weighty burden given the deference historically accorded the political branches in the management of military affairs the precise standard of judicial review in the wake of lawrence however has yet to be firmly established 35 holmes v californi

executive in the organization and regulation of the military dates from the earliest days of the republic motivating development of this constitutional doctrine was the separation of powers among the executive judicial and legislative branches the constitution grants exclusive authority to raise and support the armed forces to congress39 which has broad and sweeping power to make all laws necessary for that purpose40 similarly the constitution grants exclusive command of the armed forces to the executive branch designating the president as commanderinchief41 nowhere does the constitution delineate specific role for the judiciary in military matters judicial authority over the armed forces arises only indirectly as arbiter of constitutional rights thus the policy of extraordinary deference to the professional judgment of military authorities has emerged from case law42 particularly when legislative action under the congressional authority to raise and support armies and make rules and regulations for their governance is challenged43 originally framed as doctrine of noninterference the early court avoided all substantive review of military disciplinary proceedings provided only that jurisdictional prerequisites were met more skeptical judicial attitude emerged during the warren court era which frequently questioned the scope and operation of military rules particularly as applied to onbase civilians and nondutyrelated conduct of service members but the pendulum returned to what has been described as the modern military deference doctrine with series of burger court decisions in the mid1970s rather than abandoning all substantive review the current judicial approach is to apply federal constitutional standards in more lenient fashion which with rare exception favors military needs for obedience and discipline over the rights of the individual servicemen the fundamental necessity for obedience and the consequent necessity for imposition of discipline may render permissible within the military that which would be constitutionally impermissible outside it 44 among leading contemporary precedents are the supreme court rulings in goldman v weinberger and rostker v goldberg 45 goldman was an orthodox jew and rabbi serving as commissioned officer and psychologist for the air force for five years he wore yarmulke while in uniform without objection from superiors until he testified as defense witness in court martial proceeding the prosecuting attorney at the court martial complained to goldmans commanding officer that wearing the yarmulke violated air force regulations that prohibited wearing of headgear indoors goldman was ultimately separated from the service for refusal to remove the yarmulke goldman argued that the air force regulation banning headgear infringed upon his first amendment freedom to exercise his religious beli efs writing for fivetofour supreme court majority justice rehnquist disagreed our review of military regulation challenged on first amendment grounds is far more deferential than constitutional review of similar laws or regulations designed for civilian 39 us const art i 8 40

protest to the extent that such tolerance is required of the civilian state by the first amendment to accomplish its mission the military must foster instinctive obedience unity commitment and esprit corps the essence of military service is the subordination of the desires and interests of the individual to the needs of the service46 because the air force argued that standardized uniforms were necessary to encourage the subordination of personal preferences the majority deferred to the professional judgment of the air force the ramifications of the majoritys subrationalbasis standardabsolute uncritical deference drew vigorous dissent from justice brennan and separately from justice oconnor who objected the court rejects captain goldmans claim without even the slightest attempt to weigh his asserted right to the free exercise of his religion against the interest of the air force in uniformity of dress within the military hospital test for free exercise claims in the military context is even articulated much less applied it is entirely sufficient for the court if the military perceives need for uniformity 47 in rostker v goldberg 48 the supreme court dealt specifically with an equal protection challenge to genderbased military classificationsnamely congress decision to register men but not women for the military draft in applying the intermediate scrutiny test of craig v boren49 the majority found the draft law did not reflect unthinking gender stereotypes but was the product of extensive congressional deliberations on the role of women in combat and the necessities of military mobilization the purpose of registration was to create pool from which combat troops could be drawn as needed because women were barred from combat by another law they were not similarly situated to men and their exemption from registration was not only sufficiently but closely related to an important governme ntal purpose as important to the outcome however was the courts articulation of the healthy deference due the political branches in managing military affairs thus according to the majority opinion the military constitutes specialized community governed by separate discipline from that of the civilian such that congress is permitted to legislate both with greater breadth and with greater flexibility when prescribing the rules by which military society shall be governed constitutional rules apply and may not be disregarded but the different character of the military community and of the military mission requires different application of those principles 50 equal deference to the militarys judgment was apparent in four federal appeals court rulings to uphold the dont ask dont tell policy before lawrence first to rule was the fourth circuit in an appeal by lt paul g thomasson who had been honorably discharged under the policy after he announced in march 1994 that he was homosexual writing for the ninemember majority in thomasson v perry 51 chief judge j harvie wilkinson iii stressed congress plenary control of the military and the deference owed both the executive and legislative branches in matters of national defense as factors calling for judicial restraint when faced with challenges to military decision making what thomasson challenges the opinion notes is statute that embodies 46 id at 507

branches of american government and an enactment that reflects month upon month of political negotiation and deliberation under this standard judge wilkinson concluded that the government articulated legitimate purpose for excluding individuals who commit homosexual actsthat of maintaining unit cohesion and military readinessand that the laws rebuttable presumption was rational means of preventing individuals who engage in or have propensity to engage in homosexual conduct from serving in the military similarly thomasso ns first amendment claims were rejected for the reason that the statute does not target speech declaring homosexuality rather it targets homosexual acts and the propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts and permissibly uses the speech as evidence the use of speech as evidence in this manner does not raise constitutional issuethe first amendment does not prohibit the evidentiary use of speech to establish the elements of crime or as is the case here to prove motive or intent 52 subsequently the fourth circuit relied on thomasson to affirm ruling by federal district judge ellis in thorne v us department of defense53 after reviewing the record in eight other administrative separation proceedings where the presumption that declared homosexual has propensity to engage in forbidden conduct was successfully rebutted judge ellis in thorne held that conduct rather than speech was the target of the dont ask dont tell policy in richenberg v perry 54 the eighth circuit upheld the statement provision of dont ask dont tell as applied to the discharge of an air force captain who had informed his commanding officer that he was homosexual as in thomasson the policy was alleged to violate equal protection and free speech rights by targeting decl arations of homosexual orientation or status unrelated to conduct and for irrational catering to prejudice against and hatred of homosexuals agreeing with the fourth circuit however the richenberg court found that the policy ban on homosexual acts was justified by legitimate military needs and rationally served by the rebuttable presumption of propensity to act on the part of declared homosexuals and because the focus of dont ask dont tell is to identify and exclude those who are likely to engage in homosexual acts while prohibiting direct inquiries into an applicants sexual orientation there was basis for first amendment challenge the court concluded in appeals from three district court rulings during 1997 the ninth circuit approved the discharge of naval petty officer who admitted to sexual relations with other men philips v perry 55 and of california national guardsman and navy lieutenant who had submitted written documents to their commanding officers acknowledging that they were homosexual56 in the former case the appeals court ruled that homosexuals are not members of suspect class for purposes of federal equal protection analysis that the military ban on homosexual acts was rationally related to legitimate governmental interest in maintaining effective armed forces and that evidentiary use of admitted homosexuality did not violate service members first amendment rights because sufficient homosexual acts were alleged to justify discharge the perry court declined considering 52 id at 931 53 945 f supp 924 edva 1996 affd per

the inference that they engage in homosexual acts may constitutionally be discharged from the service writing for divided threejudge panel circuit judge wiggins agreed with the second fourth and eighth circuits on this issue although the legislatures assumption that declared homosexuals will engage in homosexual conduct is imperfect it is sufficiently rational to survive equal protection scrutiny 57 in able v united states 58 upholding the dont ask dont tell policy the second circuit faulted contrary federal district judges decision for failing to give proper deference to congress and the military judgment the opinion emphasized judi cial tradition of applying less stringent standards of constitutional review to military rules than to laws and regulations governing civilian society judicial deference was warranted by the need for discipline and unit cohesion within this specialized community matters fo r which courts are illsuited to secondguess military judgments that bear upon military capability and readiness in addition extensive congressional hearings and deliberation provided rational basis for the governments contention that the prohibition on homosexual conduct promotes unit cohesion enhances privacy and reduces sexual tension consequently the court concluded given the strong presumption of validity we give to classifications under rational basis review and the special respect accorded to congress decisions regarding military matters we will not substitute our judgment for that of congress some argue that the lawrence ruling in 2003 altered the constitutional framework for analyzing both article 125 and the dont ask dont tell policy according to this view by finding fundamental liberty interest in consensual homosexual activity lawrence demands closer scrutiny of both the means and ends of the curre nt military policy under traditional equal protection doctrine the legislature has broad latitude to draw lines based on any nonsuspect classificationhomosexuality includedprovided only that the policy is rationally related to legitimate governmental interest in the past the military has satisfied this lenient test by invoking the need for unit cohesion discipline and moraleinterests uniformly affirmed by pre lawrence appellate courts to uphold the dont ask dont tell policy the government generally bears far greater burden however when defend ing any action that interferes with individual rights or liberty interests deemed fundamental for due process purposes to pass constitutional muster the challenged measure or policy must be narrowly tailored to compelling governmental interest 59 in this regard article 125 has been criticized by its opponents for codifying the same moral disapproval as the texas statute involved in lawrence and for being overbroad and underinclusive one commentator stated this broad ban does not limit itself to sodomy on military premises nor to acts of sodomy between superiors and inferiors in the chain of command it is not limited to any context in which one might think there were secondary effects separate from moral disapproval 57 124 f3d at 1135 see also jackson v dept of

inadequate basis for such law60 consequently some argue that military interests in good order and discipline previously accepted by the courts are not sufficient to trump the liberty interest identified by lawrence supporters of the continued viability of article 125 and the dont ask dont tell policy however argue that there is immediate parallel between constitutional precedent as applied to the civilian and military sectors thus the unbroken line of appellate decisions supporting current homosexual policies aided by the modern military deference doctrine would as likely tilt the balance in the governments favor in any future judicial contest moreover some argue that whatever implications lawrence may have on article 125 penal statute may not be directly translatable to the dont ask dont tell policy which provides for administrative separation from the military but criminal penalty the task of parsing these issues has fallen to the courts as they confront new generation of legal challenges to the militarys homosexual policies in 2004 for example the us court of appeals for the armed forces which is the militarys highest judicial tribunal issued decision regarding the appeal of an air force linguistic specialist who was convicted by court martial on sexrelated charges including consensual sodomy with subordinate that case united states v marcum appears to have established the current standard that military courts use to evaluate post lawrence challenges to military policies regarding homosexuals 61 central issue in the case was whether lawrence nullifies article 125 and compels reversal of the servicemembers sodomy conviction the appeals court upheld marcums conviction but not strictly on the basis of homosexual activity instead pointing to the inappropriateness of sex between subordinate and superiors in the same chain of command in dicta the court strongly suggested that lawrence s ban on laws prohibiting sexual intimacy may apply to the military as well it even went on to assume without deciding that marcums conduct did fall within the protections of lawrence such protection however was insufficient to shield him from the genderneutral charge of sex with subordinate in reaching its decision the marcum court established test that provides guidance on how to apply the principles of lawrence to the military environment any challenge to convictions under article 125 are reviewed on casebycase basis according to the following threepart test first was the conduct that the accused was found guilty of committing of nature to bring it within the liberty interest identified by the supreme court second did the conduct encompass any behavior or factors identified by the supreme court as outside the analysis in lawrence eg involving public conduct minors prostitutes or persons who might be injuredcoerced or who are situated in rela tionships where consent might not easily be refused third are there additional factors relevant solely in the military environment that affect the nature and reach of the lawrence liberty interest 62 in the wake of marcum some courts appear to be skeptical of challenges to article 125 and dont ask dont tell especially when other factors such as homosexual activity with subordinate are involved for example in loomis v united states the united states court

lieutenant who was discharged for homosexual conduct63 because the lieutenant was of significantly higher rank than the private with whom he had had sexual relations the court found that the nature of the relationship between plaintiff and the pfc is such that consent might not easily be refused and thus it is outside of the liberty interest protected by lawrence 64 in other cases however courts have been more receptive to lawrence based challenges to military policies regarding homosexuals for example in united states v bullock 65 the us army court of criminal appeals relied on lawrence to overturn the guilty plea of male soldier who engaged in consensual oral sodomy with female civilian in military barracks although the case involved heterosexual conduct it appears to be the first decision by military tribunal to recognize right to engage in consensual adult sodomy under principles that may be equally applicable to article 125 prosecutions targeting homosexual activity 66 meanwhile only two federal courts of appeals have issued decisions in cases involving post lawrence challenges to dont ask dont tell and both of these courts have grappled with questions regarding the standard of review that should apply the problem is that the lawrence decision did not explicitly deem the right to engage in private consensual homosexual conduct to be fundamental liberty interest nor did the court specifically identify the standard of review to be used in the future indeed the decision appeared to apply neither traditional rational basis review nor strict scrutiny identifying the standard of judicial review to apply was the central issue in witt v department of the air force 67 recent decision in which the court of appeals for the ninth circuit reinstated lawsuit against the militarys dont ask dont tell policy in 2004 major margaret witt decorated air force officer who had been in longterm relationship with another woman was placed under investigation for being homosexual although witt shared home 250 miles away from base with her partner never engaged in homosexual acts while on base and never disclosed her sexual orientation the air force initiated formal separation proceedings against her due to her homosexuality witt filed suit in district court claiming that the dont ask dont tell policy violated her constitutional right to procedural due process substantive due process and equal protection but the district court dismissed her suit for failure to state claim 68 the ninth circuit affirmed the district courts dismissal of the equal protection claim but remanded the procedural and substantive due process claims to the district court for further consideration finding that the result in lawrence was inconsistent with the minimal protections afforded by traditional rational basis review and that the cases upon which the lawrence court relied all involved heightened scrutiny the ninth circuit ultimately held that lawrence applied something more than traditional rational basis review but left open the question whether the court had applied strict scrutiny intermediate scrutiny or different type of heightened scrutiny69 hesitating to apply traditional strict scrutiny to witts claim in the absence of the application of narrow tailoring and compelling governmental interest requirements in lawrence the ninth 63 68 fed cl 503 ct cl

applied heightened level of scrutiny to substantive due process claim70 extrapolating from its analysis of this case the ninth circuit concluded we hold that when the government attempts to intrude upon the personal and private lives of homosexuals in manner that implicates the rights identified in lawrence the government must advance an important governmental interest the intrusion must significantly further that interest and the intrusion must be necessary to further that interest in other words for the third factor less intrusive means must be unlikely to achieve substantially the governments interest in addition we hold th at this heightened scrutiny analysis is as applied rather than facial under this review we must determine not whether dont ask dont tell has some hypothetical post hoc rationalization in general but whether justification exists for the application of the policy as applied to major witt 71 although the court ruled that the government clearl advances an important governmental interest in management of the military the court was unable to determine from the existing record whether dont ask dont tell satisfies the second and third factors and therefore remanded the case to district court for further development of the record it is important to note that even if the district court does ultimately find in favor of major witt the decision would not invalidate the dont ask dont tell policy unlike facial claim in which the constitutionality of statute is evaluated on it face as if it applies to all hypothetical plaintiffs the ninth circuit directed that the constitutional inquiry in witt be conducted on an as applied basis as result the impact of any decision by the district court would be limited to major witt and would not apply to other plaintiffs who would be required to file their own individual claims shortly after the ninth circuit issued its opinion in the witt case the court of appeals for the first circuit handed down decision upholding lower courts dismissal of challenge to dont ask dont tell brought by 12 gay and lesbian veterans who had been discharged under the policy in the case cook v gates 72 the first circuit agreed with much of the ninth circuits reasoning in witt although the opinions differed in some important respects like the ninth circuit the first circuit concluded that the lawrence case did indeed recognize protected liberty interest for adults to engage in private consensual sexual intimacy and applied balancing of constitutional interests that defies either the strict scrutiny or rational basis label73 in contrast to the ninth circuit however the first circuit evaluated the claim as facial challenge and concluded that the plaintiffs challenge failed according to the court the lawrence decision recognized only narrowly defined liberty interest in consensual adult sexual activity that excludes other types of sexual conduct including homosexual conduct by service members 74 although the first circuit noted that an asapplied challenge might involve conduct that does fall within lawrence s protected liberty interestsuch as homosexual conduct occurring offbase between consenting adultsthe court nevertheless concluded that such asapplied challenges fail when balanced against the governmental interest in preserving military effectiveness 75 as result the court dismissed the plaintiffs asapplied challenge 70 sell v united states 539 us 166 us 2003 71 527 f3d 806 819 9th cir 2008 72 528 f3d 42 1st cir 2008 73 id at 52 74 id at 56 75 id at 60

following the murder of army private first class pfc barry winchell in 1999 at fort campbell ky efforts were made by numerous groups to change or create new policies due to allegations of homosexual harassment on military bases the killing of pfc winchell had implications beyond the specifics of his case including judicial legislative and administrative actions some of these involved administrative and legislative actions concerning hate crimes others involved legislative and administrative actions involving those in the chain of command including the reassignment of individuals and senatorial holds being placed on the consideration of certain promotions this case generated large amount of media and political attention 76 winchells death was connected in part to his offduty romantic relationship with biologically male preoperative transsexual this relationship became intertwined with relationship winchell had with another soldier his roommate specialist justin fisher the complications of these relationships led to fight between winchell and third soldier during barracks party winchell it is reported had the upper hand in the fight on july 6 1999 private calvin glover who had lost the fight entered the hallway where winchell was sleeping and bludgeoned him to death with baseball bat fisher soon after entered the hallway and reportedly tried to assist glover in cleaning up the scene both glov er and fisher were arrested 77 press reports of the incident labeled it hate crime78 glover was tried by courtmartial and received life sentence fisher was sentenced to 12 and Â½ years imprisonment as part of plea bargain79 winchells murder became an example and focal point for gayrights groups and some in the media who criticized military leaders at fort campbell over the incident80 some suggested that 76 the winchell case is cited routinely in press reports particularly when changes to the militarys homosexual policy are considered it is primarily for that

death they claimed that dont ask dont tell reinforces negative attitudes toward homosexuals in uniform because the policy treats homosexuals differently than heterosexuals in uniform as such it is claimed that this policy fostered an atmosphere of homophobia in the military that encouraged violence against homosexuals others contend that winchells death occurred in spite of the policy and that the incidents in question would not have occurred had he and fisher abided by its provisions under this policy homosexual behavior does not become an issue for those in uniform because it must be kept personal and private these individuals cite the death of winchell and the incarceration of fisher and glover as classic examples of how open homosexuality in the ranks can lead to disruptions to good order and discipline that dont ask dont tell was designed to prevent many in the media and homosexual rights advocacy groups viewed the winchell murder as representative of homophobia in the services or at the least lax attitudes toward preventing the harassment of those suspected of being homosexual partly in response to winchells murder in october 1999 president clinton signed an executive order modifying the uniform code of military justice ucmj by allowing evidence to be presented during the sentencing phase of trial that violent crime can be considered hate crime 81 in response to concerns over the handling of the case both the army and dod inspectors general ig investigated the incident later the dod ig released report on march 24 2000 the dod ig found the command climate at winchells post fort campbell ky was generally supportive and healthy but the report said winchells company in the 101 st airborne division air assault was marred by poor morale because of an abusive first sergeant who has since been replaced the defense department ig in march found that antigay attitudes were commonplace and widely tolerated in the military when the report was released defense secretary william cohen launched task force headed by air force under secretary carol dibattiste to develop plan to reduce harassment of all kinds within the ranks 82 on july 21 2000 little more than

defense network sldn claiming that the military had failed to issue directive regarding ahap several members of congress wrote letter to secretary of defense rumsfeld asking dod to implement the ahap although the ahap has been implemented it appears that sldns focus is on the lack of an overarching dod directive in recent report sldn states the bush administration and its pentagon leaders continue to ignore growing epidemic of antigay harassment within the armed forces despite the adoption of comprehensive antiharassment action plan defense departme nt leaders refuse to implement the plan and continue to turn blind eye to dangerous harassment within the ranks the plan continues to collect dust on pentagon shelves 85 in response the under secretary of defense personnel and readiness david chu in june 24 2004 letter to congress described existing service policies and programs as sufficient to address harassment86 the department has determined the overarching directive recommended by the plan is not necessary the services policies and programs are sufficient to address this important issue it is the departments view that all service members should be treated with dignity and respect this is value held by all four serv ices and cornerstone of our leadership and human resource strategies that is reflected in the core values and institutional training throughout the department 87 in this letter under secretary chu describes anti harassment efforts implemented by the services including training reporting measurement and enforcement independent of these actions winchells parents

longstanding recruiting concerns congress passed language allowing the secretary of defense to collect and compile directory information pertaining to each student who is 17 years of age or older or in eleventh grade or higher and who is enrolled in secondary school in the united states or its territories possessions or in the commonwealth of puerto rico 94 the collection of this information was limited to three years for any individual and further limited to name address telephone listing date and place of birth level of education degrees received and most recent educational agency or institution attended and was required to be kept confidential nothing in the law required or authorized the secretary to require any educational institution to furnish the information95 the collection of this information or further the matter of recruiter access to the campuses however voluntary were not without some controversy96 for example in 1998 two high schools broke with the portland or school board by allowing military recruiters on campus97 proponents of the ban insisted th ey were opposing discrimination against homosexuals by the military critics contend the school board was merely and hypocritically substituting discrimination against the military in favor of homosexual rights agenda 98 in recent years the congressional legislative activity concerning the recruiting of high school students has increased in 1999 congress enacted language requesting secondary schools to provide dod with the same access to secondary school students and to directory information concerning such students as is provided generally to postsecondary educational institutions or to prospective employers of those students 99 despite this changepreviously dod had been allowed to compile such informationrecruiter access to secondary schools in some cases continued to meet resistance100 the following year 2000 congress enacted language stating that the educational agencies concerned shall provide such recruiter access to campus and to directory information if request for this access were denied this language instructed the services to send an appropriate designated officer or official to meet with the agency if after meeting such access continued to be denied the services were to notify the designated state official such as governor and request access should the denial of access continue the secretary of defense was instructed to notify the secretary of education upon determinatio n by the secretary of defense that the denial is extended to at least two of

the jurisdictions involved were to be notified certain schools could be excluded from this process specifically private schools that maintained religious objection to service in the armed forces or in the case of local educational agency policy resulting from majority vote of denying such access101 in 2001 congress strengthened this language by requiring local educational agencies who are receiving assistance under the elementary and secondary educational act to provide recruiters with the access to students and directories that had been requested in 1999 in addition the language provided that students with parental consent or the parent alone on behalf of the student could opt out of having the students information released 102 in 2002 the child left behind act stated that as condition of receiving funds under the act local educational institutions were required upon request to provide recruiter access and access to directory information optout provisions were included as before as were exceptions for private schools with religious objections to military service 103 it has been reported that certain educational agencies and others have taken an active role in limiting such access primarily this is done by sending optout forms to students andor parents104 many educational agencies and secondary schools however have provided recruiter access and access to directory information also hundreds of thousands of secondary students participate in federally funded junior reserve officers training corps at affiliated secondary schools 105 finally in 2003 congress amended the law by removing the provision that had allowed for majority vote of the local educational agency to deny recruiter access or access to directory information thereby removing one impediment to such access106 in 2007 dod announced changes concerning how it trea ts information in its military recruiting database following settlement with the new york civil liberties union dod agreed to use the database only for recruiting and not to share th at data with other government agencies dod agreed to destroy information on individuals after three rather than five years dod also agreed to collect

ask dont tell compromise the exclusion of homosexuals from military service and hence rotc had proven to be problematic on some college campuses110 from 1986 to 1994 28 students reportedly were discharged from rotc on grounds of homosexuality and nine were ordered to repay their scholarships in may 1990 for example it was reported that two students from harvard and the massachusetts institute of technology were dismissed from the navy rotc program at mit the navy sought recoupment of its scholarship funds totaling over 80000 for both students the provost of mit john deutch wrote to then secretary of defense richard cheney stating that it was wrong and shortsighted to maintain the rotc policy not to accept gay or lesbian st udents into its programs and to require avowed homosexuals to disenroll and pay back their scholarship funds after reviewing the cases on the merits the navy made decision not to seek recoupment from these two students 111 on may 17 1994 thendeputy defense secretary john deutch issued directive under that directive and based on the dont ask dont tell compromise service secretaries could seek recoupment of rotc scholarships when there were violations of military law however the service secretaries would not seek recoupment for homosexuality individuals using claim of homosexuality as means of avoiding military service were likely to be required to repay their scholarships 112 over the past 10 years there has been considerable congressional and judicial activity on military access to colleges and universities the national

instructed the secretary of defense to consult with the secretary of education in prescribing regulations to determine when an educational institution denies or prevents access in 1996 congress enacted additional language pertaining to rotc at colleges and universities the national defense authorization act for fy1996114 stated funds appropriated or otherwise available to the department of defense may be made obligated by contract or by grant including grant of funds to be available for student aid to any institution of higher education that as termined by the secretary of defense has an antirotc policy and at which as determined by the secretary the secretary would otherwise maintain or seek to establish unit of the senior reserve officer training corps or at which the secretary would otherwise enroll or seek to enroll students for participation in unit of the senior reserve officer training corps at another nearby institution of higher education this law required the secretary to notify the secretary of education senate armed services committee and the thenhouse national security committee now house armed services committee when such determination had been made in addition every six months the secretary was required to publish list of ineligible institutions in the federal register the connecticut supreme court in 1996 upheld lower court ruling that the dod policy on homosexuality violated the states 1991 gay rights law barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and therefore military recruiters could be permanently banned from the university of connecticut law school campus in hartford 115 these actions led to seemingly contradictory situation although military recruiters were barred from the law school campus the university of connecticut maintained military rotc units on its storrs campus the university of connecticut uconn has been designated by the state legislature landgrant university under the morrill act116 as signed by president lincoln in 1862 institutions aided under the act must teach military tactics along with their regular curriculum rotc fulfills this requirement117 thus due to the court ruling military recruiters were prohibited from recruiting at the uconn law school in hartford but the university maintains an rotc unit at its campus in storrs this campus continued to enroll students in rotc and accepted federal funding the presence of and continued enrollment by this rotc unit may also have been in conflict with the states 1991 gay rights law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation the omnibus appropriations act for fy1997 118 contained language that limited the ability of educational institutions or subelements thereof such as law school or satellite campus to block

of march 29 1998 the secretary of defense may use the funds in reprogramming or recision activity notwithstanding this sequestering of funds the conferees insist that military recruiters be afforded

modification federal funds in the form of student financial assistance could not be withheld from students attending schools that violated the law with regard to recruiter access and rotc121 opposition to these varied restrictions took number of forms many law schools in particular sought ways to mollify ameliorate or terminate these restrictions for example it was reported that law professors carol chomsky and margaret montoya copresidents of the society of american law teachers salt sent letter to associate deans listing 27 action items in response to the threat of military recruiting among items cited designate particular person in the deans or associate deans office to make sure on an ongoing basis that law school resources including career services are not used to facilitate any oncampus recruiting by the military 122 while some have viewed these efforts as intended to harass recruiters others point out that these efforts and others are merely supporting campus nondiscrimination policies on february 2 2005 the house of representatives voted in favor of hconres 36 32784 resolved by the house of representatives the senate concurring that 1 congress remains committed to the achievement of military personnel readiness through vigorous application of the requirements set forth in section 983 of title 10 united states code relating to equal access for military recruite rs at installations of higher education and will explore all options necessary to maintain this commitment including the powers vested under article i section 9 of the constitution 123 2 it is the sense of congress that the execut ive branch should aggressively continue to pursue measures to challenge any decision impeding or prohibiting the operation of section 983 of title 10

law schools and professors that it was unconstitutional for the federal government to condition university funding on compliance with the solomon amendment previously divided third circuit panel had agreed that the solomon amendment had compelled the law schools to convey messages of support for the militarys policy of discriminatory exclusion but the court reversed the lower courts decision the appellate panel had relied in part on 2000 supreme court decision dale v boy scouts of america 130which held that the boy scouts have an expressive right to exclude gay scoutmastersfor the converse proposition that the nations universities have right to expressive association in opposing military recruiters where there is conflict between the dod stance on sexual orientation and academic nondiscrimination policies in the case the universities objected that because of the militarys dont ask dont tell policy permitting recruiters on campus would undermine their policies against discrimination and that the federal law therefore violated their free speech rights fairs core argument was that the solomon amendment amounts to an unconstitutional condition because it exacts penalty for the law schools engaging in first amendment expressive conduct while the government may impose reasonable conditions on the receipt of federal largesse respondents contended it cannot attach strings to benefit to produce result which it could not command directly 131 when law school violates the equal access rule the government threatens loss of funding not only to the law school but to the entire university thus they claimed requiring equal access forces laws schools to propagate accommodate or subsidize an unwanted message132 the government countered by pointing to the plen ary powers of congress to raise and support armies and to provide for the common defence133 the third circuit decision could undermine military recruitment in time of war it argued while neither the law schools right to free speech nor to expressive association were infringed by allowing military recruiters to conduct on campus interviews134 in particular the solicitor general distinguished the boy scouts case in that recruiters are not part of the institution itself and do not become members through their recruiting activities135 recruiters speak for their employers the brief claims not the

in the earlier case moreover the government emphasized that the law schools remain free to protest the militarys message as long as they give recruiters equal access if the schools choose not to allow equal access it was argued they simply forego funding in general the court was receptive to each of the governments arguments first the court was unmoved by fairs theory of unconstitutional conditions largely because of fatal flaws they found in the law schools first amendment analysis this unsettled area of the law however may be further obscured by the observation that i ndirect compulsion by congress via funding condition cannot be unconstitutional if it could be constitutionally imposed directly whether this implies that congress may even legislate access for military recruiters to college campuses and elsewhere regardless of federal funding or federal policy with respect to all other recruiters may be fertile subject for future legal debates on the question of whether the solomon amendment impairs the first amendment rights of the objecting institutions the courts opinion rejected all three arguments put forward by the law schools first while expressive conduct may be subject to first amendment scrutiny there is nothing in this case approaching governmentmandated pledge or motto that the school must endorse and it has never been deemed an abridgement of speech or press to make course of conduct illegal merely because the conduct was in part initiated evidenced or carried out by means of language 136 otherwise practices having nothing to do with government dictating the content of speech expressing disapproval of the internal revenue service by refusing to pay taxes for example would enjoy first amendment protection requiring law schools to facilitate recruiters access by sending out emails and scheduling military visits were deemed far cry from the compelled speech found in earlier cases accommodating the militarys message does not affect the law schools speech because the schools are not speaking when they host interviews and recruiting receptions 137 nor the opinion finds would they be endorsing or be seen as endorsing the military policies to which they object law schools decision to allow recruiters on campus is not inherently expressive138 secondly the court distinguished the doctrine of expressive association as applied by dale v boy scouts of america 139 if the government were free to restrict individuals ability to join together and speak it could essentially silence views that the first amendment is intended to protect such was not the situation here however according to the court merely allowing recruiters on campus and providing them with the same services as other recruiters did not require the schools to associate with them nor did it prevent their expressing opposition to military policies in other ways they could put up signs they could picket they could make speeches and they could hold forums of protest moreover unlike the boy scouts case group membership practices or affiliations were implicated by the solomon amendment recruiters do not become 136 rumsfeld v forum for academ ic inst rights inc 126 s ct 1297

are by definition outsiders who come onto campus for limited purpose and not to become members of the schools expressive association140 finally the court recognized as beyond dispute that congress has broad and sweeping powers over military manpower and personnel mattersincludingthe authority to require campus access for military recruitersthe exercise of which is generally entitled to judicial deference accordingly in rejecting fairs position the court concluded the issue is not whether other means of raising an army and providing for navy might be adequate regulations are not invalid si mply because there is some other imaginable alternative that might be less burdensome on speech that is judgment for congress not the courts it suffices that the means chosen by congress add to the effectiveness of military recruitment141 g10g152g150g152g156g142g161g158g138g149g156g561g138g151g141g561g15g138g155g155g146g138g144g142g156g561 under current law marriages are covered under the

major general valery kulikov said i would not advise such persons to publicize their sexual orientation in the army they are not liked and will probably be beaten146 foreign military experiences were given substantial consideration by the us senate in its 1993 hearings on homosexuality and the military although information concerning these military experiences may prove useful to us policy makers their relevance is not entirely clear during the hearings prof charles moskos stated comparative analysis can shed light on some of the policy issues with regards to gays and straights in the armed forces due attention must be paid to both points of difference and similarity for sure certain lessons can be drawn from the experience with gays in the militaries of other countries but inasmuch as the united states has the most formidable military force in the world it could also be argued that such countries might draw lessons from the united states 147 indeed there are problems in considering foreign military comparisons for example international variations in the definition of homosexual or orientation make comparisons difficult additionally military recruiting structures eg draft versus volunteers force structures certain foreign armed forces personnel are represented by unions roles and missions home guard paramilitary forces or forces subject to international deployment suggest limits on the relevance of any such foreign comparison to actually making policy as noted in the hearings many countries maintain distinction between the stated policies and the policy in practice in addition as noted during the hearings look at official foreign regulations and statements rarely captures the realties of how persons of different sexual orientations are treated in their respective militaries furthermore certain countries allow homosexuals to serve but do so in manner that would arguably not be legally allowed in the united states for example some countries allow open homosexuals to serve but they can opt out of such service if they choose eg netherlands other countries allow homosexuals to serve but their promotion opportunities may be limited eg germany some countries have religious andor other principles that prevent openly homosexual individuals from serving eg saudi arabia iran
