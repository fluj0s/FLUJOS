study bbe has been approached by the national institute f or safety and health niosh in the united states of america to conduct review on the best practises regarding the use of refuge chambers in south african coal mines the purpose of this research effort by niosh is to continue to understand the issues associated with the use of refuge chambers andor s afe havens in underground coal mining operations as part of the mine escape and rescue st rategies this will assist in the development of effective mine disaster plans part of this understanding is to gain knowledge of refuge chamber use in other countries this research effort will provide specific information on the characteristics of the design and use of refuge chambers and safe havens currently being used in underground coal min in south africa this will include review of regulations risk assessment emergency p reparedness and response performance testing of refuge chambers and identif ication of chamber manufacturers 2 background the use of rescue chambers is widely practised in s outh african underground coal mines with both fixed and portable types of rescue chambe rs currently being used the successful implementation of underground rescue chambers is pendant on various issues some of these are the location or deployment of rescue chambers rela tive to the underground workforce factors that needs to be considered is h ow to safely get miners from their various places of work into and out of t he rescue chambers during emergencies assuming an irrespirable atmosphere the construction and maintenance requirements of r escue chambers to remain operational during underground emergencies s uch as the aftermath of underground methane and coal dust explosions and fi res also of importance is the ingress and egress from the rescue chamber i n situations of irrespirable outside atmospheres equally important is how these requirements are assessed the minimum equipment and amenities required to stain the life and morale of the miners located in the rescue chamber eg ir supply water food communications toilet facilities physical environ ment safety equipment first aid etc emergency preparedness training and frequency of xercises required to ensure that miners will be able to locate refuge ch ambers with provided systems in an irrespirable and zero visibility envi ronment and to communicate effectively with rescue coordinators and personnel once secured in rescue chamber and lastly what is the rescue strategy and stay p eriod required to bring the miners to safety 2 this report contains confidential information and i s for the use of niosh only the document may not b used for any other purpose or transmitted to any other party in any form without written

equipment including overview of spe cific designs 4 regulatory review 41 regulatory environment the requirement for the use of underground refuge c hambers in south african colliers is governed by law namely the mine health and safety act of 1996 act 29 of 1996 mhsa 42 origins of the mine health and safety act the mhsa came into effect on 15 january 1997 it re placed the minerals act 50 of 1991 as the legal basis for the regulation of occupational health and safety for the south african mining industry the mhsa flows from an extensive p olicy review which originated from the commission of inquiry into health and safety in min the leon commission which held hearings in 1994 and published report and recomme ndations in april 1995 one of the four major issues identified by the leon commission which required immediate investigation was that of disasters from explosion s of gas and coal dust in coal mines this report recommended that legislation pertaining to mergency preparedness and response be developed as matter of urgency from the findings of the leon commission the mhsa w as developed following extensive tripartite consultations involving representatives from the department of minerals and energy dme employers and trade unions in the mining ind ustry the parliamentary portfolio committee on minerals and energy conducted extensiv hearings on this subject which resulted in legislation which enjoys high level f acceptance among employers and employees 3 this report contains confidential information and i s for the use of niosh only the document may not b used for any other purpose or transmitted to any other party in any form without written permission copyright bluh m burton engineering the mhsa replaced the prescriptive based minerals ct with one that compares favorably with international standards and contemporary legis lative trends it draws extensively on the international labor organization ilo mine safety and health convention 177 of 1995 which recommends risk based approach certain prescript ive regulations from under the previous minerals act were kept in place under schedule 4 of the mhsa see appendix these regulations are being revised and this report will make reference to the relevant current legislation as well as new legislation being develo ped 43 framework for acts in south africa all acts in south africa including the mhsa are g overned by the constitution act 108 of 1996 the constitution under section 24 states that everyone has the right to an environment that is not harmful to their health or well being and to have the environment protected through reasonable legislative measures refer to figure 41 mine health and safety act act 29 of 1996 constitution of sa act 108 of 1995 other acts and legislation

44 framework to amend improve the mhsa to amend the mhsa the minister of minerals and ener gy and the mine health and safety council mhsc needs to agree on proposed amendment s the mhsc functions in terms of the mhsa is to advise the minister on occupational health and safety legislation and research outcomes focused on ameliorating and promo ting occupational health and safety at south african mines the council as well as its thr ee statutory tripartite permanent committees consists of 15 nonexecutive members rep resenting the state employers and employees under chairmanship of state member

minister to develop regulatory framework the principal elements of t he regulatory framework are regulations guidelines for mandatory codes of practice cops chief inspectors instructions or directives and guidance notes often the proper regulation of topic would requir making use of more than one of these regulatory mechanisms the principle regulatory mec hanisms are discussed in the following sections 451 regulations regulations are drafted where an issue is common to all mines and can be complied with regulations must be drafted in such nature that m ines would not need to apply for exemption from these regulations furthermore regu lations are to be outcomes based and hence should not prescribe to the employer on how t address significant risk identified in terms of the hazard identification and risk assessm ent hira process but should allow the employer to implement hierarchy of control measur to reduce or eliminate the risk 452 guidelines for mandatory codes of practice guidelines are drafted where site specific flexibil ity is required as result of varying conditions existing at the different mines 453 chief inspectors instructions and directives directives or instructions are issued by the chief inspector of mines on any health and safety matter that requires attention or to distribute inf ormation relating to health and safety at mines 6 this report

bluh m burton engineering 454 guidance notes guidance note sets out good practice 46 responsibilities for ensuring compliance with legis lation 461 role of the inspectorate the mhsis head office is responsible for the develo pment of policy and legislation and it produces guidelines for codes of practice and othe r guidance documents for the mining industry the primary functions of the regional mhsi are to i nspect mines to investigate and conduct inquiries into accidents and other health and safet incidents and to enforce compliance with the mhsa 462 role of employers in terms of this legislation the employer is ultima tely responsible for the health and safety of employees and this is inclusive of safe place of work safe system of work competent and properly trained staff and supervi sors and fit for purpose plant and equipment the employer is required to adopt systematic appr oach to identify hazards assess the health and safety risks to which employees may be xposed while they are at work and record the significant hazards identified and risk assessed the employer must determine how the significant risks identified in the risk as sessment process must be dealt with having regard to the requirement of section 112 and 3 of the mhsa in that as far as reasonably practicable attempts should first be made to elimi nate the risk thereafter to control the risk at source thereafter to minimize the risk and ther eafter insofar as the risk remains to provide personal protective equipment and to instit ute programme to monitor the risk 463 role of employees as far as employees are concerned section 22 of th mhsa places number of obligations on employees including that they must take reasona ble care to protect their own health and safety and the health and safety of other persons w ho may be affected by their conduct employees also have the right to leave dangerous working place whenever circumstances arise at that working place which with reasonable justification appear to that employee to pose serious danger to the health and safety of t hat employee 47 current applicable legislation to refuge chambers all refuge chamber cops are drawn up in accordance with section 91 of the mhsa which states that any employer may prepare and implement code of practice on any matter affecting the health or safety of employees and oth er persons who may be directly affected by activities at the mine refer to appendix c further to this as stated in section 46 above and referring to section 42 there are currently regulations under the minerals act mhsa and chief inspector directives applicable to the use of refuge chambers in underground mines includ ing coal mines tables 41 to table 43 refer to applicable legislation regarding refuge ch ambers in

of mandatory code of practice for emergency preparedness and response has been developed and h as been approved by the mhsc in january 2007 this guideline has to be signed off b the chief inspector of mines before it comes into effect the scope of this guideline relates to measures or procedures that are established to prepare to respond to and recover from the impact f emergencies but does not address any emergency prevention aspects this guideline addresses issues relating to hazard identification and risk assessment detection and early warning systems communication systems first aid

the mhsa 473 chief inspectors instructions and directives directive b5 is directive that was issued under t he signature of the chief inspector of mines on the 14 th february 1994 the aim of directive b5 is to ensu re that refuge chambers are properly sited constructed equipped and maintaine d the directive also required mine managers to draft cop to ensure the effective struction maintenance and preparedness system for such refuge chambers refer to appendix 474 guidance notes there are current guidance notes related to refu ge chambers 48 mining qualifications authority the mining

of refuge chambers regulation 242021 states that the manager shall see to it that there is refuge chamber or other safe place in mine or works are within asy reach of workmen and within the limits of protection afforded by self rescuing device i n the event of an explosion fire or other emergency this regulation is further supported by directive b 5 which requires that the manager employer in the new guidelines ensures that refug chambers are positioned at an appropriate place in areas free of combustible mat erial or combustible material rendered inert in the new guidelines and within an appropri ate distance from the working places further due consideration must be given to factors such as the travelling conditions from the workplace eg height walking surface gradient possible disorientation etc the duration of the selfcontained selfrescuers u sed on the mine 492 construction and maintenance directive b5 gives clear guidance on the requiremen ts for the construction of refuge chambers these are as follows refuge chambers should be of robust construction nd where there is significant risk of explosions it must be able to w ithstand the effects of such an explosion the size of the refuge chamber should be determine d by the maximum number of persons likely to be present in the area served by the refuge chamber with minimum floor area of 06 m 2 per person lifesustaining services installed in the refuge c hamber should be of fire resistant material or else be fire protected refuge chamber must be air tight and sealed in s uch way so as to ensure positive pressure that will make the refuge chamb er inaccessible to air containing noxious smoke fumes or gases refuge chambers should be provided with man door and where there is significant risk of an explosion flexible type f door that would not be rendered ineffective in the event of an explosion s hould be considered refuge chambers should be provided with seating ar rangements where practicable where applicable such as at collieries surface borehole system for the provisioning of respirable air to the refuge chambe r may be provided access requirements for equipment and vehicles to the bore hole site must be taken into account an identification system of refuge chambers must b implemented and must be clearly indicated on the inside and on the outsi of the refuge chamber where surface borehole system is used such corres ponding identification must also be indicated at the borehole site on surf ace this corresponding identification must be indicated on the mine rescue plan contemplated in regulation 1719 refer to appendix i 10 this report contains confidential information and i s for the use of niosh only the document may not b used for any other purpose or transmitted to any other party in any form without written permission copyright bluh m burton engineering in the new guidelines two additional requirements h ave been put in place these are where the lifesustainability of refuge chamber is dependent on compressed air the supply to the inside of the refuge chamber should be tamperfree with control valve on the inside of the refuge chamber access arrangements into the refuge chamber should be such that it does not negatively affect the integrity or size of the refu ge chamber under the maintenance requirements directive b5 req uires that all refuge chambers be flushed and pressure tested before being commission ed and be repeated at appropriate intervals regulation 242023 requires that refug chambers be examined at intervals determined by the manager in consultation with the inspector of mines by persons appointed in writing by the manager for this purpose 493 minimum life sustaining equipment required the minimum requirements of rescue chamber to be emed life sustaining are captured in regulations 242022 b and c under the nerals act and expanded in directive b5 under this legislation refuge chamber shall at ast have the following in it supply of respirable air unless conditions are such that this is not required sufficient supply of potable water at least two l iters per person for 24 hours first aid equipment consisting of at least suita ble stretcher two blankets and substantially constructed first aid box contain ing tourniquets splints bandages individually wrapped sterile dressings an d antiseptic solution one or more notices on which are legibly printed i n simple directions setting forth the approved procedures for the immediate tre atment of cases of gassing heat stroke heat exhaustion drowning and electric shock communication system with surface with relevant co ntact details of emergency personnel clearly visible reflective tape with symbolic sign indicating entrance to the refuge chamber conspicuous light with reliable independent po wer supply or any other physical means placed in such position in the tra velling way so as to indicate the location of the refuge chamber an audible device positioned outside the refuge ch amber that can be activated from the inside toilet facilities and notice board inside the chamber displaying the correct procedure to be followed during occupation in an emergency for exa mple activate the ventilation arrangements activate the audible device the most senior person to take charge of the operat ions and to contact the attendant at the surface control room or any ot her senior official on the mine take roll call remain calm and do not move around unnecessarily conserve lights keep only enough cap lamps on at any one time to provide sufficient illumination persons to remain in the refuge chamber until other wise instructed by the official in charge at the control centre or re scued and keep the door closed during occupation 11

provide employees with any informa tion instruction training or supervision that is necessary to enable them to per form their work safely and without risk to health specific mention is made of required tra ining specifically relating to refuge chambers in the mhsa regulations guidelines direc tives or notes but as the risk of underground explosions and fires has been identifie d the employer must provide employees with training regarding emergency response which w ould imply the use of refuge chambers under the national qualifications network the mqa h as developed outcomes based unit standards for underground miners for which they mus t demonstrate competence the unit standard titled demonstrate basic knowledge and derstanding of emergency preparedness and response require learners to demo nstrate the required actions in case of an emergency this includes the donning of self tained self rescuers and in some cases entering place of safety which could include r efuge chamber and following the procedures specifically assessment criterion 4 req uires learners to demonstrate the importance of adhering to the symbolic signs in ter ms of the consequences to health safety and production 12 this report contains confidential information and i s for the use of niosh only the document may not b used for any other purpose or transmitted to any other party in any form without written permission copyright bluh m burton engineering 5 implementation of regulatory guidelines as required by the mhsa section 91 the employer t any underground mine may prepare and implement cop on any matter affecting the hea lth or safety of employees and other persons who may be directly affected by activities at the mine as the potential of an underground explosion of fire has been identified and refuge chambers forms part of the emergency response strategy cop specifically for refuge chambers need to drawn up by employers between major and minor mining groups it was found that the general content and extent of the refuge chamber cops was very similar the only difference is that for the major mining houses the cop is drawn up internally and for mino r groups external consultants are mostly used to develop their cops this was also found by van achtenbergh and gouws in 2003 van achtenbergh and gouws 2003 from discussions with the people responsible of dra wing refuge chamber cop it was found that the work done by oberholzer in 1997 obe rholzer 1997 forms the basis of the inputs to the cops further to this the variations observed in the reviewed cops is mostly concerned with the equipment used by the mine eg duration of scsr units guidance equipment to the refuge chamber refuge chamber loc ating devices etc and the general mining conditions eg seam height mining method surface topology etc at some mine of the mines the leaflet resqpacs h ow to calculate safe traveling distances published by the research organization of the chamber of mines of south africa is used as guideline to determine the maximum dista nce of refuge chambers from working places comro 1998 the following sections will collate the findings of the review of the practicable aspects of the development of cops with specific reference to the following location and deployment of refuge chambers construction and maintenance minimum life sustaining equipment required emergency preparedness training 511 location and deployment of refuge chambers from the cops reviewed if was found that refuge cha mbers are located at maximum distance from working places of approximately 1 000 m this maximum distance from the working places varied from 1 000 m to 660 m sec ondary consideration for locating refuge chamber is the surface topography because s outh african coal seams are relatively shallow the preferred method of supplying fresh ai r communication first aid and sustenance is via surface boreholes to be able to do this it is strived not to place refuge chamber under dams structures or private property were difficulties with access might be problem it is strived to place these rescue chambe rs near access roads and on mine property all refuge chambers are clearly marked on the escap and rescue plan and on surface were applicable 13 this report contains confidential information and i s for the use of niosh only the document may not b used for any other purpose or transmitted to any other party in any form without written permission copyright bluh m burton engineering refuge chambers form an integral part of the escape and rescue strategy in the south african coal mining industry the escape and rescue strategy developed consists of the following steps don your selfcontainedselfrescuer then for mo st strategies find the cache of long duration units stored at the production section wai ting place and then proceed to place of safety two options are available ie either reach plac of safety or alternatively reach fresh air source firstly if visibility is good and the self containedselfrescuer will allow you enough time to reach the shaft bottom or surface procee d to shaft bottom most south african collieries have been operating for decades and typ ical distance from the mine shaft is in excess of 8 km 10 km this generally prohibits ners from reaching the mine shaft with their selfcontainedselfrescuer units if this is the case refuge chambers are generally deployed to provide places of safety until external help arrives in the form of proto teams or rescue drills from surface for extraction the rescue chambers can be permanent or intermediat fixed or portable in nature the major difference between the two types as reflecte d in the cops is that permanent refuge chambers are connect to surface via 160 mm to 200 mm borehole with fan to force air into the refuge chamber and allow for life sustaini ng and rescue assistance to be rendered from surface indefinitely the intermediate refug bays however have limited supply of fresh air and life sustaining assistance is availab the majority of intermediate refuge bays are designed to supply life sustaining assistance f or 24 hours but in some cases 8 hours has been specified this is based on the rescue strateg of the mine were rescue is expected tot take place within 8 to 24 hours of the incident by proto teams 512 construction and maintenance of the reviewed cops all refuge chambers are constr ucted in the coal seam itself there are various configurations which can be used refuge ch ambers can be either mined into the rib pillar figure 51 or it can be mined into spec ial refuge chamber pillar which is left in the general mining area figure 52 or it can be cons tructed between pillars left in the workings figure 53 for this option depending on the siz it can be sealed on four sides or on two in general it is recommended that when wall is co nstructed it not be placed between return and intake road this is to minimize the ris k of air ingress due to intake and return air road way differential pressure figure 51 typical configuration of refuge chamber in rib pillar 14 this report contains confidential information and i s for the use

configuration of refuge chamber in dedicated refuge chamber pillar figure 53 typical configuration of refuge chamber between mined pillars all the cops reviewed required that 140 kpa proof s toppings be used and that non flammable materials be used for the construction t his is based on the finding of the work done by oberholzer oberholzer 1997 two types of wall construction methods were encountered firstly normal brick wall is constru cted and sand bags stacked against it at 45 angle alternatively any method approved by t he united states bureau of mines is acceptable this based on the work done by van der merwe and cook in 2000 for simrac van der merwe and cook 2000 the most common met hod used is the use of masonry or concrete block construction the size of the rescue bay according to directive b5 must have floor area of at least 06 m 2 per person in the cops reviewed this value ranged from 10 m 2 to 15 m 2 15 this report contains confidential information and i s for

the refuge chamber are via stee l doors single and double door configurations were observed and clear preferen ce could be determined to assist miners to locate refuge chambers in low visibility conditions three types of methods is generally used these are ether audible locators wh ich are permanently on or visual locators which are permanently on or physical locators or combination of the three the audible locators consist of siren located at the entrance to the refuge bay visual locators typically consist of flashing light typically red at the entrance to the refuge chamber the physical barrier consist of something hanging from the roof to shoulder height in the main travel way and the belt road conveyor belting ropes mesh wi re plastic sheets etc has been observed the principle is that miners will bump into the barrier and know that they must follow the barrier to the refuge chamber to further assist the integrity of refuge chambers most cops require that an area surrounding the entrance to the refuge bay be cover ed in stone dust to reduce the potential impact of coal dust explosion in the region of th refuge bay all the requirements of the regulations and directi ves are met in the cops it has to be mentioned that all the cops specifically require th at emergency lighting be put in place in refuge chamber inspections of rescue chambers are done on daily basis by shift personnel and monthly by mine management and the ventilation department all maintenance required is done by mining personnel for permanent refuge chambers the surface condition of the refuge chamber boreholes are regularly inspected to ensure obstruction is present to assist in maintaining the integrity and the life sustaining ability of refuge chambers most cops require that an emergency store be setup on s urface to ensure speedy maintenance to the rescue chambers 513 minimum life sustaining equipment required for permanent rescue chambers ie connected to rface the minimum life sustaining equipment is specified by the regulations and direc tive b5 refer to section 493 all the cops reflect these requirements to establish an adequate supply of respirable air the permanent rescue chambers use an electric fan with backup batteries to pull fresh ir down the borehole into the rescue chamber air is expelled under this positive pressu re into the mine via 100 mm pipe further than 300 mm from the roof of the rescue bay to further enhance the life sustaining ability of permanent rescue chambers some cops req uire that dedicated response trailer be present at the shaft for rapid deployment to the surface location of the borehole these trailers will typically contain further first aid quipment communication equipment fans water sustenance etc for intermediate and portable refuge chambers adequ ate respirable air is ensured by typically three means the first is to locate furth er caches of selfcontainedselfrescuers in the chamber to ensure sufficient air supply for the duration the risk assessment requires the miners to be rescued secondly solid state oxygen g enerators are used in combination with body worn replaceable soda lime co 2 filters refer to figures 54 and 55 the typica l solid state oxygen generator used in the south african ning industry produces approximately 2 900 liters of chemical pure oxygen within 3550 min utes 16

chamber cops mine personnel however do under go re fresher training on all aspects of mine health and safety upon returning from annual l eave this includes emergency preparedness and escape strategies which encompass the use of refuge chambers the new guideline for mandatory cops for emergency preparedness and response see section 472 has specific section devoted to tr aining and awareness section 815 of the new guideline requires training and awareness to be included in the cop in order to ensure that all potentially affected persons are educated trained and made aware on how to deal with emergencies to achieve this the guideline re quires that the new cops must at least cover following the content and frequency of such training see so section 102d of mhsa the procedures and appropriate actions to be taken in the event of an emergency including simulated exercises the correct procedures and applications on the use of emergency equipment the actions required relating to the location and description of shutdown controlslock out devices instructions in the use of beltworn selfcontaine d selfrescuers and the locality of copies of the emergency procedures and instructions as part of the training for general underground m ining qualification training is required by individuals to qualify as underground mine worker refer 48 part of this training includes the

practical implementation of em ergency preparedness and response codes of practice with specific focus on rescue ch ambers at major and minor mining operators was conducted the assessment consisted f site visits past experience and discussions with the senior inspector of occupation hygiene for the witbank area one the major coal fields in south africa 61 practicable application of codes of practices 611 location and deployment of refuge chambers major area of concern among major and minor minin g operators is to keep the refuge chambers within 1 000m from the working areas the use of portable refuge chambers is not yet wide spread in the coal mining industry one colliery deploys nine portable refuge chambers with success operational need required up to date other collieries in the same mining gr oup have each acquired one unit per shaft but it has not been fully deployed in the group yet discussions with various other operators major and minor regarding the use of portable ref uge chambers revealed that they are either unaware or is currently unconvinced about th deployment of portable refuge chambers 612 construction and maintenance it was found that although the cop in general requi res 140 kpa stoppings to be constructed the majority of refuge chambers do not comply with this standard various entrance methods were observed for refuge c hambers ranging from single steel doors to double steel doors to pipe type entrance s in general it was found that refuge chambers are we ll maintained and comply with the minimum requirements it has to be noted that most refuge chambers has provision for emergency lighting the biggest non compliance was supply of fresh potable water as most of the refuge chambers do not have dedicated wate r supply and replacing the potable water on regular basis is cumbersome process 613 minimum life sustaining equipment required in general the minimum life sustaining equipment is in good working order and inspections are carried out as per schedule and maintenance ducted 614 emergency preparedness and training on mine refresher training was found to vary from m ine to mine even within mining houses in general selfcontainedselfrescuer training was conducted adequately the only training directly related to refuge bays was periodic escape drills from the workplace to the refuge chambers 19 this report

unit standard assessor criteria assessors should keep the following principles in m ind when designing and conducting assessments again st this unit standard focus the assessment activities on gathering evid ence in terms of the main outcome expressed in the title to ensure assessment is integrated rather than fragmen ted remember we want to declare the learner compet ent in terms of the title where assessment at title level is unmanageable then focus assessment around each specific outcome or groups of specific outcomes make sure evidence is gathered across the entire range wherever it applies assessment activities s hould be as close to the real performance as possible and wher simulations or roleplays are used there should be supporting evidence to show the learner is able to perform in the real situation do not focus the assessment activities on each as sessment criterion rather make sure the assessment activities focus on outcomes and are sufficient to enable evidence to be gathered around all the asses sment criteria the assessment criteria provide the specification s against which assessment judgements should be mad in most cases knowledge can be inferred from the qual ity of the performances but in other cases knowle dge and understanding will have to be tested through questi oning techniques where this is required there wil l be assessment criteria to specify the standard require d the task of the assessor is to gather sufficient evidence of the prescribed type and quality as sp ecified in this unit standard that the learner can achieve the out comes again and again and again this means assesso rs will have to judge how many repeat performances are requ ired before they believe the performance is reprodu cible all assessments should be conducted in line

general princip in mind when designing and conducting assessmen ts focus the initial assessment activities on gatheri ng evidence in terms of the main outcomes expressed in the titles of the unit standards to ensure assessment i s integrated rather than fragmented remember that the learner needs to be declared competent in terms of the qualification purpose and exit level outcomes where assessment across unit standard titles or at unit standard title level is unmanageable then foc us assessment around each specific outcome or groups of specific outcomes take special note of the need for integrated assessment make sure evidence is gathered across the entire ra nge wherever it applies in particular assessors should assess that the lea rner demonstrates an ability to consider range of options by measuring the quality of the observed practical p erformance as well as the theory and underpinning knowledge using methods that are varied to allow the learne r to display thinking and decision making in the demonstration of practical performance maintaining balance between practical performan ce and theoretical assessment methods to ensure eac h is measured in accordance with the level of the qualif ication taking into account that the relationship between practical and theoretical components is not fixed but varies according to the type and level of qualification all assessments should be conducted in line with th following welldocumented principles appropriate the method of assessment is suited t the performance being assessed fair the method of assessment does not present ny barriers to achievements which are not related to the evidence manage the methods used make for easily arranged costeffective assessments that do not unduly inte rfere with learning integrate into work or learning evidence collect ion is integrated into the work or learning process where this is appropriate and feasible valid the assessment focuses on the requirements laid down
