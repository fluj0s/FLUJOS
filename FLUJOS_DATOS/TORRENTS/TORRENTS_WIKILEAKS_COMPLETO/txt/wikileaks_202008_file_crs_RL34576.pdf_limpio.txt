divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34576managing disaster debris overview of regulatory requirements agency roles and selected challenges summary after disaster when region turns its attention to rebuilding one of the greatest challenges to moving forward ma involve how to pr operly manage debris generated by the event options include typical methods of waste management landfilling recycling or burning the challenge after major disaster eg building or bridge collapse or flood hurricane or earthquake is in managing significantly greater amounts of debris ofte n left in the wake of such an event debris after disaster may include wast soils and sediments vegetation trees limbs shrubs municipal solid wast common household garbage personal belongings construction and demolition debris in some instances entire residential structures and all their conten ts vehicles cars trucks boats food waste socalled white goods refrigerators freezers air c onditioners and household hazardous waste cleaning agents pesticides pool chemicals each type of waste may contain or be contaminated with certain to xic or hazardous constituents in the short term removal of debris is necessary to facilitate the recovery of geographic area in the long term the methods by which these wastes are to be managed require proper consideration to ensure that their management by landfilling for example will not pose future threats to human health or the environment after presidentially declared disaster federal funding or direct assistance in response to the disaster may be available to state or local government the federal emergency management agency fema may provide funding through its public assistance pa grant program for debris removal operations that eliminate immediate threats to lives public health and safety or elimin ate immediate threats of significant damage to improved public or private property the federal share of funding to the affected area will be stated in the disaster declaration but will be less than 75 the funding will be availa ble for response activities in designated geographic area for specific period of time in addition to funding if the state or local government does not have the capability to respond to the disaster it ma request direct fe deral assistance from fema federal agencies most likely to assist with debris removal operations are the army corps of engineers the corps nd the us environmental protection agency epa activities they may perform include rightofway clearance curbside waste pickup private property debris remova l property

threat to safety and obstacle to recovery and rebuilding is the presence of significan t amounts of disaster debris depending on the type of disaster debris ma include waste soils and sediments vegetation trees and shrubs manmade structures collapsed homes buildings or bridges and personal property the ability of residents to return to the area and live in safe and healthy nvironment may depend on how quickly and effectively community manages its debris there are many factors that influence the proper and timely management of disaster debris for one the sheer volum of debris can overwhelm community as an illustration what follows are disaster debris amounts generate d during three major disasters hurricane katrina 2005 more than 118 million cubic yards cy1 over 93000squaremile area hurricane andrew 1992 43 million cy over 500squaremile area the northridge earthquake 1994 7 million cy large volume of waste can quickly ove rburden existing landfill space the likely best choice for most regions will involve di verting as much debris as possible from area landfills through recycling burning composting or another method of volume reduction the logistics of which however can prove complicated without proper predisaster planning also the desire to manage disaster debris as quickly as possible can have detrimental longterm reperc ussions if debris is managed improperly during disaster some amount of hazardous waste will lik ely be commingled with nonhazardous wastes for instance under flooding conditions household hazardous waste or sewage may contaminate nonha zardous personal pr operty afterward improper disposal of hazardous waste may l ead to future environmental health or safety problems such as the c ontamination of local groundwaterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34576crs2 2 in this report the term debris removal is used broadly where necessary actions such as disposal or recycling are referred to specifically 3 for more

management agencys fema325 public assistance debris management guide july 2007 pp 5457 available online at httpwwwfemagovgovernmentgrantpademagdeshtmthis report addresses debris resulting from major disaster or emergency declared by the president first it discusses the types of debris commonly generated during and after disaster and selected factors that can make debris removal2 such costly complex operation second it discusse s the roles of federal state and local agencies after disaster s been declared with regard to both funding debris removal and the actual physi cal process of removal types and amount of debris generally disaster debris includes waste materials created after natural disaster such as an earthquake tornado fi re flood hurricane or winter snow or ice storm before community can move forw ard with debris r ecovery it must have some understanding of the ty pes of debris involved nd the volume it must handle the type of debris generated is rgely dependent upon the nature of the disaster3 for example debris caused by flooding differs somewhat from debris resulting from an earthquake or tornado ach category of debris poses individual challenges to disposal particularly when generated in significant amounts or when forms of waste become mixed with one another to the point that separation is difficult typical disa ster debris includes municipal solid waste msw pe rsonal belongings and general household trash soil and sediment putrescibles animal carcasses pets or farm animals rotten or spoiled fruits vegetables seafood or meats white goods refrigerators freez ers air conditioners washers dryers stoves water h eaters and dishwashers household hazardous waste oil pesticides paints cleaning agents construction and demolition cd debris road bridge or building materials such as metals asphalt drywall plaster brick concrete roofing mate rials and treated or untreated lumber vegetative debris trees br anches shrubs and logs vehicles and vessels cars tr ucks and boats fuel motor oil batteries and tires and electronic waste computers levisions printers stereos dvd players and telephoneshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34576crs3 4 fema325 public assistance debris management guide pp 5362 and appendix b 5 epa planning for natural disaster debris pp 331 6 open burning includes both burni ng debris in an open pit and burning debris in an air curtain incinerator aci the air curtain thod incorporates pit constructed by digging below grade or building above grade if there is shallow groundwater table and blower the blower and pit make up an engineered sy stem which must be precisely configured to properly function the blower must have adequate air velocity to provide curtain effect to hold smoke in and to feed air to the fire below see epas planning for natural disaster debris pp 30 7 solid waste is defined broadly under the law as any garbage refuse and other discarded material 42 usc 6903 haza rdous waste subset of solid waste is defined as solid continuedto appropriately manage these different waste streams it is also necessary to estimate the total volume of debris this is important for various reasons including the identification of appropria staging grounds to separa wastes determination of necessary landfill space dete rmination of necessary contract services and anticipation of special handling requireme nts applicable to hazardous debris there are various methods of estimatin g debris totals the army corps of engineers the corps uses mathematical modeling forecasts that take into account such factors as the number of households affected the amount of vegetative cover in given area commercial density and storms intensity4 to effectively manage di saster debris the us environmental protection agency epa and the federal emergency management agency fema recommend that states develop disaster debris manageme nt plan before disaster strikes such plans delineate the types of disaster debris that will be handled under particular emergency conditions and existing laws that apply to the handling and disposal of different types of waste ie hazardous waste nonhazardous waste asbestoscontaining materials state plans may also specify requirements regarding selection of debris storage and stagin g sites and wasteha ndling methods eg chippinggrinding burning or landfilling for certain types of waste provide an inventory of debris capacity at local debris management facilities including recycling waste to energy and disposal options and evaluate equipment and administrative needs such as prenegotiated waste management contracts and pre qualified contractors5 federal and state waste management requirements generally disaster debris will be sent to landfill or it may be managed in some way that reduces its volume s uch as open burningincineration6 recycling or chipping and grinding each choice invol ves activities that ma require compliance with certain local state or federal regulations for example states are required to manage solid and hazardous waste in acco rdance with provisions of the resource conservation and recovery act rcra7 in addition to rcra depending on howhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34576crs4 7 continued waste that is either specifically listed in the regulations 40 cfr 2613126133 or meets specific criteria that make it toxic ignita ble ie burns readily corrosive or reactive eg explosive 40 cfr 2613 8 epa planning for natural disaster debris p 2224waste is managed provisions of other environmental laws such as the clean air act or clean water act may also apply under rcra businesses that generate hazardous waste above certain thresholds must transport treat store and dispose of their hazardous waste in accordance with certain regulatory require ments however hous eholds and certain small businesses are essentially exempt from rcra this means that hazardous waste generated by these entities can be disposed of in common household or municipal garbage after disaster this can be particular concern when hazardous waste is generated in significant amounts by these unregulated entities although any waste management choice may involve certain environmental concerns landfilling and burning generally cause the most concern among regions residents with regard to landfilling municipal solid waste landfills are predominantly regulated by state and local governments epa has however established minimum criteria that these landfills must meet states are then authorized to implement their own criteria provided they are at least as stringent as federal requirements often sizable proportion of disaster bris is managed as construction and demolition cd waste under federal law cd waste is classified neither as hazardous waste nor as municipal solid waste therefore cd landfills are not subject to federal design and operational criteria ie cd landfills are not required under federal law to have protective liners that municipal solid waste landfill which is expected to receive certain amount of hazardous waste from households would have the disposal of cd waste is primarily stateregulated issue this means that states have the authority to determine what criteria cd landfill must meet and what materials constitute cd waste in the event of an emergency state may change the regulatory definition of cd debris to more broadly characterize larger volumes of debris that have been generated in the wake of particular disaster one issue of concern with this approach is that cd waste commingled with more hazardous materials could be disposed of at landfills that are not designed to accept such wastes therefore it is suggested th at hazardous materials such as asbestos leadbased paint pcbs and any other c ontaminated materials should be separated from cd waste before landfill disposal8 further to lessen the burden on disposal facilities and potentially reduce costs it is recommended that cd waste be reused and recycled like cd waste vegetativ debris often represents significant proportion of disaster debris vegetative debris can be chipped or ground up for reuse it is estimated that the volume of vegetative debris can be reduced by as much as 75httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34576crs5 9 the impact to the community depends on the burning method used for example air curtain pit incinerators have fewer envi ronmental impacts than uncontrolled openair burning 10 for more information on provisions of the stafford act and the national response plan see crs report rl33053 federal stafford act disast er assistance presidential declarations eligible activities and funding by keith beausing this thod of wast reduction b ecause of the potentially huge volume of vegetative debris following disaster bur ning may be prefe rred method of waste handling which reduces the waste by as much as 95 if that is the case local state or federal regulations that control emissions of air pollutants will likely apply further when mixed or contaminated with other wastes such as sewage burning may not be an option also if residents have begun to return to disaster area there may be significant opposition to burning by community members who would be affected by the smoke9 following are other common categorie s of waste and special handling requirements pursuant to local state or federal regulations or recommendations that apply to each white goods must be separated from ot her waste and delivered to certified recyclers permitted to drain refrigerants and other regulated chemicals and oils household hazardous waste hhw should be collected separately and disposed of in specially designed landfills putrescible wastes rot or decay quickly and must be managed quickly to avoid disease vectors rodents flies mosquitoes some putrescibles can be co mposted and rendered electronic wastes which contain lead mercury and other heavy metals should be sepa rated from other waste recycled or disposed of as hhw automobiles and boats generally can be recycled but gas tanks mercury switches ba tteries and tires should be removed and managed separately soils and sediments can be reused however in agricultural areas soil may be too contaminated with fertilizers or other chemicals to be used on residential or agricultural lands federal and state agency roles in debris removal federal agency response to debris remova l after disaster is generally done in accordance with provisions of the robert t stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act the stafford act 42 usc 51215206 and the national response plan10 the stafford act authorizes the president to issue major disaster or emergency declaration in response to catastrophes that overwhelm state and local governments the declaration may also authorize all federal agencies as necessary to provide assistance to respond to disaster including the demolition of unsafe structures which endanger the public 5170b and debris removalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34576crs6 11 the stafford act and implementing regulations use the term debris removal in broad sense to encompass the entire process of removing handling recycling and disposing of debris 44 cfr 206224 12 in accordance with provisions of the nrp all presidentially declared disasters and emergencies under the stafford act are consid ered incidents of national

proper disposal of equipment that may contain pcbs and proper handling and disposal of asbestos containing debris state and local agency roles the states help coordinate local govern ment requests for federal assistance and work with fema to define the missi on the corps coordinates with state representatives regarding operational issues alternatively state or local governments may choose to accept the debris removal ssion themselves and apply to fema for reimbursement local agencies are responsible for provi ding rightsofentry permits to allow the corps or its contractors to enter private property for debris removal activities within the corpss authority establishing criteria and procedures for classifying different types of debris selecting disposal met hods and approving disposal operations condemning proper ties providing demolition pl ans and designating the appropriate type of landfill state environmental protection agencies or departments of environmental quality are the environmental regulatory arms of state governments state environmental agency may issue declaration of emergency after disaster such declaration would specify how debris rem oval operations should be carried out for the particular disaster for example after hurricane katrina the louisiana department of environmental quality expanded the definition of cd waste to essentially allow the entire c ontents of flooded homes in new orleans to be disposed of in cd landfills each state is authorized to implement its own solid and hazardous waste manageme nt programs including siting and permitting debris disposal sites selected challenges to managing disaster debris there are many challenges to managing di saster debris partic ularly if region does not have debris management plan in place some of these challenges include issues associated with managing large volumes of waste ensuring the ability of property owners to return to an area nd assist with clea nup separating hazardous and nonhazardous waste and managing asbestos contaminated wastes managing large volumes of waste the logistics of managing tens of thous ands or millions of cubic yards of waste form daunting task even when commun ity is prepared when not prepared region must coordinate the physical rem oval of debris and likely designate temporary staging area to sort and separate the waste before determining the appropriate manage ment method if debris removal c ontractors have not already been identified it may be timeconsuming to find sufficient number of waste haulers able or qualified to do the workhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34576crs10 21 the clean air act 112 establishes nati onal emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants neshap including asbestos indi vidual states in coordination with epa must manage acm in compliance with the asbestos neshap with regard to asbestos removal and disposal during building destructi on and renovation 40 cfr 6114061160 22 for example see the louisiana department of environmental qualitys ldeq protocol to comply with the leshap regulations march 16 2006 available at httpwwwdeq louisianagovportaldefaultaspxtabid 2251 and the february 24 2006 letter from granta nakayama epa assistant administrato r office of enforcement and compliance continuedfurther as discussed previously it is generally recommended that communities conserve landfill space as much as possible by reusing and recycling their disaster debris however this is an option only in so far as there are available markets for those materials ensuring the ability of residents to return to disaster area in the event of widespread devastation to region the speed with which cleanup and rebuilding occurs may depend on how qui ckly debris on private property can be removed generally debris removal from pr ivate property does not qualify for federal funding because it is considered respons ibility of individual property owners that may be covered by private insurance howe ver if residents m ove disastergenerated debris to public rightofway eg curbsi federal funding of debris removal may be available therefore to certain degree the speed with which debris from private property is removed will pend upon the speed w ith which residents are able to return to the area and assist in the cleanup separating hazardous and nonhazardous wastes as discussed above the sepa ration of waste is also necessary to comply with existing local state and federal waste management regulations to ensure that disaster debris is managed appropriately returning resi dents are generally asked to separate debris as much as possible if re sidents do not or are ble to separate their waste waste management contractors or landfill operators may have to do so separating debris is timeconsuming costly and potentially dangerous process further disaster debris ma be mixed to the point that separation is either very difficult or essentially impossible ie in flooding situations this may mean that hazardous waste is mixed w ith nonhazardous waste and di sposed of in landfill not intended to hold such waste managing asbestoscontaining materials if disaster involves the destruction of homes and buildings built before the late 1970s the presence of asbestos containing materials acm will likely be concern the need to segregate that material befo re demolition and dispos will add to the time it takes to demolish individual structures both federal and state laws specify criteria that must be met when demolishi ng structure with asbestoscontaining materials21 further after disaster states will likely develop their own protocols for complying with asbestos requirements as they apply to the destruction and cleanup22httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34576crs11 22
