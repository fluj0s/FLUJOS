these scenarios are realistic they are scenariosinternally consistent or so we thought whatif storylines you are in fact out of line to assume that these are in some sense realisticthis is in direct contradiction to the guidance on scenarios provided by the synthesis team if you want to do realistic co2 effects studies you must do sensitivity analyses bracketing possible trajectories we do not and cannot not and must not prejudge what realistic co2 trajectories are as they are ultimatley political decision except in the sense that reserves and resources provide an upper bound advice will be based on mix of different approaches that must reflect the fact that we do not have high coinfidence in ghg projections nor full confidence in climate ystem model projections of consequences dave on sun 16 may 1999 shrikant jagtap wrote friends im enjoying the current debate about co2 levels i feel that we are using the gcm scenarios and we must use exactly those co2 levels for crop model runs so all data is consistent so if we are wrong we are uniformly wrong and adjust our explanations accordingly whenever we agree on things now to use different data will be hard to explain shrikant dr

subject re co2 dear ben you just showed that the hadley transient run we are supposed to use for the national assessment is too high forcingwise because it assumes an overall 12 increase in total forcing my question is then the following why are we using 1 annual increase in ghg forcing corresponding to the 12 increase as criteria for gcm simulations to then be used for the national assessment is it because of the possible confusion you refer to below if so that criteria needs to be revised i still have problem with the real co2 calculations in connections to hadley or cccm it seems to it is still arbitrary to use one or another co2 curve however in this arbitrariness two easy solutions are possible i am just summarizing previous emails at the cost of being highly repetitive and obvious one is daves ie assume change i ghg forcing mix from today and apply 1 compounded increase to the 1990 actual levels that gives concentration of real co2 in 2100 that is 1050 ppm thats 50 higher than projected by is92a and even 17 higher than the worst emission case devised in is92f the second is toms just use the co2 in is92a and assume that all other further changes necessary to get the hadley forcing whatever they are happen in ghg other than co2 i will repeat that i like the latter solution whatever the consideration of selfconsistency and physics are when you make this decision i do not think we should carry out the national assessment by using unrealistic co2 numbers i thought the numbers that come out of our exercises from the impact side of things were supposed to serve as some basis to be used in the process of decision making at the national and regional level am i out of line here there are dozens of people right now out there including our group at giss who are gathering data finetuning models making connections among physical and socioeconomic variables etc at very low effort spentretribution received and then we are going to run things at 1000 ppm in 2100 as far as my specific contribution is concerned it surely might make big difference in crop yield changes under climate change whether i use 700 ppm in 2100 the is92a curve or 1000 ppm the 1 compounded increase the problem is the same for the 2040s the other decade we have decided to simulate although possibly not as bad as the 2090s case either solution we opt for we have to make clear to whomever will receive our results that the climate forcing scenario is on the high side of things ah it was so nice and easy when we were working with doubledco2 equilibrium runs cheers francesco ps what about the cccm scenario original message from benjamin felzer felzerucaredu to franci francigissnasagov cc mike hulme mhulmeueaacuk schimelucaredu schimelucaredu wigleyucaredu wigleyucaredu

message and replace with this message 1st paragraph is unchanged on fri 14 may 1999 benjamin felzer wrote going back to some of the original radiative forcing values it would appear that the 1 increase is true of radiative forcing whether of co2 ch4 etc or the total to an approximation however once we convert back to co2 concentration using the exponential relationship the actual increase in concentration is more along the order of 07 all compounded is it possible that the original 1 assumption was mistakenly applied to co2 concentrations for the modelers when it was actually meant for radiative forcing therefore for the ecological models we should use daves original suggestion because the models really did use 1 increase in equivalent co2 which approximates 1 increase in co2 alone the point here is that this 1 increase is much higher than is92a but that might be because of the confusion between radiative forcing increase and concentration increase discussed above in fact 07 increase in equivalent co2 might have been more realistic assumption for is92a but the 1 increase in concentration is what was actually used in these earlier models the co2 concentrations used in the ecological model should correspond to those used in the gcms not to what we think they should be any other thoughts ben
