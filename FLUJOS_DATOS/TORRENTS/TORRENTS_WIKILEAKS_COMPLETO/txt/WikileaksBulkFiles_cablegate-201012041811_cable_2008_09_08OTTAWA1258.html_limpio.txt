subject the us in the canadian federal election not ref ottawa 1216 classified by polmincouns scott bellard reason 14 d 1 c summary despite the overwhelming importance of the us to canada for its economy and security bilateral relations remain the proverbial 900 pound gorilla that one wants to talk about in the 2008 canadian federal election campaigns this likely reflects an almost inherent inferiority complex of canadians visavis their sole neighbor as well as an underlying assumption that the fundamentals of the relationship are strong and unchanging and uncertainty about the outcome of the us presidential election end summary 2 c the united states is overwhelmingly important to canada in ways that are unimaginable to americans with over 500 billion in annual trade the longest unsecured border in the world over 200 million border crossings each year total investment in each others countries of almost 400 billion and the unique north american aerospace defense norad partnership to ensure continental security excellent bilateral relations are essential to canadas well being canadians are by and large obsessed with us politics especially in the 2008 presidential race and follow them minutely with many canadians even wishing they could vote in this us election rather than their own according to recent poll us culture infiltrates canadian life on every level 80 pct of canadians live within 100 miles of the border and canadians tend to visit the us much more regularly than their american neighbors come here 3 c logically the ability of candidate or party or most notably the leader of party successfully to manage this essential relationship should be key factor for voters to judge in casting their ballots at least so far in the 2008 canadian federal election campaign it is not there has been almost deafening silence so far about foreign affairs in general apart from prime minister stephen harpers pledge on september 10 that canadian troops would indeed leave afghanistan in 2011 according to the terms of the march 2008 house of commons motion commenting that you have to put an end on these things the liberals and many media commentators seized on this as major conservative flip flop with liberal party leader stephane dion noting on september 10 that i have been calling for firm end date since february 2007 and that the conservatives cant be trusted on afghanistan they cant be trusted on the climate change crisis they cant be trusted on the economy he has returned in subsequent days to the conservative record on the environment and the economy but has not pursued the afghan issue further all three opposition party leaders joined in calling for the government to release parliamentary budget officers report on the full costs of the afghan mission which pm harper agreed to do with some apparent hesitation however other foreign policy issues have yet risen to the surface in the campaigns apart from new democrat party leader jack layton opining on september 7 that i believe we can say goodbye to the george bush era in our own conduct overseas 4 c the us market meltdown has provided some fodder for campaign rhetoric with the conservatives claiming their earlier fiscal and monetary actions had insulated canada from much of the economic problems seen across the border comment there is probably more truth in the fact that the canadian financial sector does not have large presence in qcanadian financial sector does not have large presence in us and other foreign markets and instead concentrates on the domestic market the canadian financial sector has also been quite conservative in its lending and investment choices end comment pm harper has insisted that the core canadian economy and institutions were sound while promising to work closely with other international players ie not specifically the us to deal with the current problems he warned on september 19 that voters will have to decide who is best to govern in this period of economic uncertainty do you want to pay the new liberal tax do you want the liberals to bring the gst back to 7 the liberals have counterclaimed that canada is now the worst performing economy in the g8 while noting earlier liberal governments had produced eight consecutive balanced budgets and created about 300000 new jobs annually between 1993 and 2005 the ndps layton argued on september 16 that these economic woes are the clearest possible warning that north american economies under conservative governments in both canada and the united states are on the wrong track but promised only that an ndp government would institute toptobottom review of canadas regulatory system not delving into bilateral policy territory 5 c on the environment liberal leader dion in defending his green shift plan on september 11 noted that ottawa 00001258 002 of 002 both barack obama and john mccain are in favor of putting price on carbon our biggest trading partner is moving toward greener future and we need to do so too pm harper has stuck to the standard conservative references to the liberal plan as carbon tax which will hit every consumer in every sector and claimed on september 16 that under earlier liberal governments greenhouse gas emissions increased by more than 30 percent one of the worst records of industrialized countries ndp leader layton argued that on the environment pm harper has plan while dions plan is wrong and wont work unlike the ndp plan to reward polluters who clean up their act and imposing penalties on those that dont which he said had also been proposed by both us presidential candidates barack obama and john mccain 6 c nafta western hemisphere travel initiative border crossing times the future of norad canadas role in nato protection of canadian water reserves canadian sovereignty in the arctic and the northwest passage at least among the leaders of the major parties these issues have not come up so far in the campaigns although they seize much public attention in normal times even in ontario and quebec with their long and important borders with the us the leadership candidates apparently so far have not ventured to make promises to woo voters who might be disgruntled with us policies and practices however these may still emerge as more salient issues at the riding level as individual candidates press the flesh door to door and may also then percolate up to the leadership formal debates on october 1 and 2 7 c why the us relationship appears off the table at least so far is probably be due to several key factors an almost inherent canadian inferiority complex may disincline canadian political leaders from making this election about the us unlike in the 1988 free trade campaigns instead of sticking to domestic topics of breadandbutter interest to voters the leaders may also recognize that bilateral relations are simply too important and successful to turn into political campaign fodder that could backfire they may also be viewing the poll numbers in the us and recognizing that the results are too close to call had the canadian campaign taken place after the us election the conservatives might have been tempted to claim they could work more effectively with president mccain or the liberals with president obama even this could be risky strategy as perceptions of being too close to the us leader are often distasteful to canadian voters one recurrent jibe about pm harper is that he is clone of george w bush ultimately the us is like the proverbial 900 pound gorilla in the midst of the canadian federal election overwhelming but too potentially menacing to acknowledge visit canadas economy and environment forum at httpwwwintelinkgovcommunitiesstatecan ada wilkins
