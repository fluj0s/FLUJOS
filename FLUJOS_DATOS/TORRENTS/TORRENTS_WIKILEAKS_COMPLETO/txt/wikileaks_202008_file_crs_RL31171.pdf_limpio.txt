justice sandra day oconnor of her intention to retire and the death of chief justice william h rehnquist in the summer of 2005 created the need for two new supreme court appointments the process for making these appointments to three nominations to the associate justice position the first two of these nominations were subsequently withdrawn by president george w bush while the thirdof samuel alito jr was confirmed by the senate the two withdrawn nominationsof john g roberts jr and harriet miersare the latest of 36 nominations to supreme court posts that have failed to be confirmed these two nominations exemplify the range of this class of supreme court nominations the roberts nomination to associate justice was withdrawn as formality so that the president could nominate him to be chief justice therefore although the first nomination was not confirmed the nominee was confirmed for another position the miers nomination on the other hand was withdrawn without the expectation that she would subsequently be nominated for another position on the court consequently neither this particular nomination nor the nominee was confirmed over the course of the nations history approxim ately onequarter of the presidential nominations to the supreme court of the united states have failed to place new associate or chief justice on the bench of the 158 nominations to the court between 1789 and 2007 114 individuals were confirmed and served 7 individuals were confirmed and declined to serve 1 confirmed nominee died before he could take his seat and 36 nominations were not confirmed this report discusses this last group of supreme court nominations these 36 nominations that did not lead to confirmation represent 31 individuals whose names were sent forward to the senate by presidents some of those 31 individuals were nominated more than once the supreme court nominations discussed here were not confirmed for variety of reasons including senate opposition to the nominating president the nominees views or the incumbent court senatorial courtesy perceived political unreliability of the nominee perceived lack of ability interest group opposition and fear of altering the balance of the court the senate committee on the judiciary has played an important role in the confirmation process particularly since 1868 summary discussions of the senate confirmation process and the unsuccessful nominations follow the reasons some nominations have failed confirmation and the role of the senate judiciary committee are also discussed finally the report includes detailed table that identifies each nomination and provides for each the facts that can be documented about the dates of relevant activity and votes in the judiciary committee and the full senate list of additional relevant literature is also provided g22g145g142g561g5g152g151g143g146g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561g18g155g152g140g142g156g156g561 the constitution of the united states provides for the appointment of justice to the supreme court in article ii section 2 this section states that the president shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate sha ll appoint judges of the supreme court the practices involved in following this constitutional mandate have varied over the years but they have always involved the sharing of the appointment power between the president

senate represent 31 individuals six of these 31 were later renominated and confirmed for positions on the court of the other 25 nominees four were nominated and failed confirmation more than once table 2 provides summary information concerning unsuccessful nominations the first of the six nominees who were not confirmed only to be later renominated and confirmed was william paterson nominated by president george washington washington withdrew the nomination on the day following its submission he noted that paterson was member of the senate when the law creating that office was passed and that the time for which he was elected had not yet expired 2 for this reason president washington felt that the nomination was in violation of the constitution3 president washington renominated paterson at the beginning of the following congress few days later and paterson was immediately confirmed 4 in this case the failure of the first nomination was due to what might be considered formalities rather than opposition to the nomination itself t able 1 supr eme cour t nominations not conf irmed 17892007 b final disposition disposition number of nominations rejected by vote of the

president he was renominated and confirmed by onevote margin 7 butler was first nominated to the high court during the third session of the 67th congress confirmation was blocked during that session but butler was re nominated and confirmed during the fourth session harlan was initially nominated to be an associate justice late in the 83rd congress and this nomination remained in committee at the

of five men in the space of the last 15 months of his presidency eight of these nominations were not confirmed giving president tyler the highest tally of unconfirmed supreme court nominations

justice had left the court and this time was being nominated for chief justice another was sitting associate justice nominated for elevation to the chief justice position the first of these was also the first nomination in which the senate voted not to confirm john rutledge had previously served as one of the first associate justices from 1789 to 1791 in addition he served as chief justice in 1795 under recess appointment by president washington when the president nominated him later that year to succeed john jay as permanent chief justice however the senate asserted its constitutional power and voted against confirmation the second such nominee justice abe fortas was sitting associate justice at the time of his nomination by president lyndon b johnson to be chief justice in 1968 the nomination was favorably reported out of committee but filibustered on the floor of the senate until the president withdrew the nomination 10 one unsuccessful nomination coincided with legislative initiative to decrease the size of the court on april 16 1866 president andrew johnson nominated henry stanbery to replace john catron who had died the previous may by the time stanbery was nominated however the house of representatives had passed bill decreasing the number of justices in the supreme court11 the act as signed into law on july 23 1866 called for decrease in the number of associate justices from nine to six through the process of attrition12 at the time the bill was initiated and also at the time its final version was signed only one vacancy that to which stanbery was nominated existed on the court ei ght associate justice positions remained on the bench until the death of james m wayne in july 1867 seven associate justice positions remained until law was passed in april 1869 to increase the number back to eight 13 several scholars have suggested that by reducing the number of associate justice positions14 the republican congress was trying to thwart the ability of democratic president johnson to shape the supreme court although the record of house an d senate debate is silent as to each chambers intention in this regard 15 the law increasing the associate justice positions to eight was passed within two months of the beginning of the ad ministration of president ulysses s grant

the failure of the senate to confirm nomination the official senate records particularly those prior to the twentieth century have usually been silent on the issues involved scholars have used other records in an effort to shed more light on the factors underlying unsuccessful supreme court nominations this scholarship consists of 10 for more on the senates consideration of the fortas nomination

general understanding of the reasons that more than one in five nominations has failed to be confirmed by the senate one widely cited scholar in the area of the s upreme court appointments process and history henry j abraham has developed categories of unsuccessful nominations among the more prominent reasons have been 1 opposition to the nominating president not necessarily the nominee 2 the nominees involvement with one or more contentious issues of public policy or simply opposition to the nominees perceived jurisprudential or sociopolitical philosophy ie politics 3 oppositio n to the record of the incumbent court which rightly or wrongly the nominee presumably supported 4 senatorial courtesy closely linked to the consultative nominating process 5 nominees perceived political unreliability on the part of the party in power 6 the evident lack of qualification or limited ability of the nominee 7 concerted sustained oppos ition by interest or pressure groups and 8 fear that the nominee would dramatically alter the courts jurisprudential lineup 16 the sections below discuss the nominations with respect to these categories based on the preponderance of scholarly evidence many of the nominations fall into multiple categories two nominations that were not confirmed by the senatethe first nomination of william paterson and the nomination of john g roberts to be associate justicedo not appear to fall into any of the following categories as discussed above in both cases the nomination was withdrawn as formality and the nominee was then renominated and confirmed

having announced he was not seeking re election he was considered by some to be lame duck even before the election of his successor nineteen senators issued statement indicating that on this basis they would oppose any nomination by president johnson 22 the committee report accompanying the nomination of abe fortas to chief justice however suggests that the opposition to justice fortas was based to considerable extent on concern about money received by fortas for delivering university lectures while an associate justice fortass close relationship and advisory role with president johnson while an associate justice and his judicial philosophy23 president rutherford b hayes nominated stanley matthews in late january 1881 about six weeks before the transfer of power to the garfield

general prior to his nomination to be associate justice in 1869 in that capacity hoar had alienated senators by recommending to grant nominees for circuit judge without regard for the senators preferences in addition the majority of the senate disliked his active labors on behalf of merit civil service system for the federal government and his opposition to andrew johnsons impeachment 28 despite praise for hoars nomination in the press the senate rejected it stanley matthews was nominated first by president rutherford b hayes in 1881 in the last weeks of hayes presidency the senate opposed the nomination because of matthews close ties to railroad and financial interests and the judiciary committee postponed the nomination although matthews was subsequently renominated by president james garfield and confirmed concerns about him persisted and the senate vote at 2423 was the closest for any successful nominee 29 pierce butlers first nomination by president warren g harding in 1922 was reported favorably by the judiciary committee but blocked from consideration on the senate floor in part because of alleged procorporation bias and his previous advocacy for

africanamericans in politics33 in addition parkers record on labor issues as chief judge of the us fourth circuit court of appeals was criticized by labor at the hearing the american federation of labor afl representing several labor groups objected in particular to an opinion authored by parker that affirmed lower court opinion in support of yellow dog contracts in which employees agreed not to join union as condition of employment34 president dwight d eisenhower first nominated john marshall harlan ii to be an associate justice in late 1954 but that nomination was never reported from committee among the objections to his nomination was the perception by some senators that harlan was ultraliberal hostile to the south and dedicated to reforming the constitution by judicial fiat35 eisenhower renominated harlan at the beginning of the next congress in early 1955 and he was then confirmed as noted previously president lyndon b johnsons nomination of justice abe fortas in 1968 for elevation to chief justice failed for several reasons including his judicial philosophy although the committee on the judiciary reported the nomination favorably several committee members strongly dissented in the committees printed report one senator wrote that fortass judicial philosophy disqualifies him for this high office another criticized fortas as part of the majority on the supreme court led by chief justice earl warren the warren court making an extremist effort to set itself up as superlegislature third senator also found fortas lacking on the broader question of the nominees judicial philosophy which includes his willingness to subject himself to the restraint inherent in the judicial process yet another senator objected to positions taken by justice fortas since he went on the supreme court as associate justice which had reflected view to the constitution insufficiently rooted to the constitution as it is written 36 opposition to fortas was also based on money received for delivering university lectures while an associate justice and his close relationship and advisory role with president johnson while an associate justice president richard m nixons nomination of clement f haynsworth jr in 1969 also failed partly on the basis of his perceived views like the fortas nomination the haynsworth nomination was reported favorably by the committee on the judiciary in this case the dissenting views in the committees written report focused on perceived ethical lapses on the part of judge haynsworth in addition joint statement by five senators referred to doubts about his record on the appellate bench and one senator opposed the nomination on the basis of the judges record on civil rights issues 37 furthermore haynsworth drew criticism from labor and minority groups on the basis of his record one historian has suggested that because of the recent rejection of fortas 33 u s congress committee on the judiciary subcommittee confirmation of hon j

questions the ethical questions concerning haynsworth played the largest role in his rejection38 president nixons nomination of g harrold carswell in 1970 was also opposed partly on the basis of his perceived views the committee on the judiciary reported the nomination favorably with several dissenting views one statement issued jointly by four senators opposed the nomination in part because his decisions and his courtroom demeanor had been openly hostile to the black the poor and the unpopular 39 more persistent theme in the dissent however was perceived lack of competence and qualification for the position40 robert h bork nominated by president reagan in 1987 is the most recent supreme court nominee not to be confirmed by the senate as well as the most recent to be rejected on the basis of his views much has been written about this nomination and it remains controversial the committee on the judiciary reported the nomination unfavorably after 12 days of hearings although the written report raised some concerns about the nominees evaluation by the american bar association and academic and legal communities and his role in the firing of special prosecutor archibald cox during the nixon administration the bulk of the report detailed concerns about and opposition to his publicly stated positions and judicial philosophy 41

of opposition to the incumbent court is closely related to opposition on the basis of the nominees views in this case the views and record of the incumbent court majority are opposed whereas the nominee is presumed to support the courts views in the case of abe fortass nomination for chief justice for example the opposition of many senators to the warren court has been cited as an influential factor fortas had been an associate justice for almost three years at the time of his nomination and some opposition hinged on his positions while on the court as discussed above in addition however his elevation was opposed because of his affiliation with the warren court and its wider reputation this opposition to the warren court in the context of the fortas nomination is reflected in the individual views of senator in the committee report 42 in addition during the confirmation hearings another senator pointedly brought up warren court opinion with which he disagreed mallory v united states 43 although as he acknowledged the case had preceded fortass appointment as associate justice by eight years44 38 abraham justices and presidents pp 1415 39 us congress senate committee on the

in the twentieth centuryparker fortas thornberry haynsworth carswell and bork the number of organized interest groups testifying at the confirmation hearings grew from two for the parker nomination to more than twenty for the bork nomination 57 interest groups have been active in unsuccessful supreme court confirmation processes in number of other ways as well including conducting research on nominees positions lobbying senators providing information to the media conducting television ad campaigns sending mailings and organizing constituent letters and calls58 observers of the supreme court confirmation process have suggested that interest group opposition has not only grown but has also been effective in preventing confirmations the impact of interest group opposition relative to other factors is matter of continuing study59 g8g142g138g155g561g152g143g561g3g149g157g142g155g146g151g144g561g157g145g142g561g5g152g158g155g157g561 in addition to the abovementioned reasons for not confirming nomination the senate may fear altering the jurisprudential philosophy of the cour t in this case opposition would be not only to the perceived views of the nominee but also to the impact the nominee could have on the courts ideological balance the bestdocumented case where this factor appears to have been influential was president reagans nomination of robert h bork bork was nominated to replace associate justice lewis f powell jr who had been the swing voter on an often evenly divided bench if confirmed bork was expected to tip the court to the conservative side and some of the opposition to his nomination came from those who opposed this change 60

led to the withdrawal62 many of the factors identified by abraham seem to apply in the miers case opposition to the nominees perceived views for one appears to have played role for example position miers took in 1993 speech reportedly contributed to opposition to her nomination by at least one conservative interest group and it raised concerns for some conservative senators63 in addition some conservative observers expressed concerns that miers selfidentified conservative would be ideologically unreliable addressing concerns about mierss views and ideological reliability was made more difficult for her supporters by the relatively sparse available record of her views on controversial constitutional issues as close legal advisor to president bush much of her most relevant writing in these areas would likely be found in white house documents and these documents were not made publicly available because of their confidential nature 64 three other factors identified by abrahamperceived lack of qualifications interest group opposition and fear of altering the courtalso seemed to contribute to the nominations failure some observers raised questions about mierss qualifications for the position and these concerns appear to have intensified as she met individually with senators furthermore her response to the questionnaire of the senate committee on the judiciary was seen as inadequate by the chair and ranking member of that committee65 miers also faced interest group opposition but this case was unusual because the opposition came predominantly from conservative groups that had previously been allied with the president who submitted the nomination 66 finally in variation on abrahams fear of altering the court factor it seemed that some conservatives feared that miers if confirmed would not alter the court as they had long hoped republican president would do67 in addition to the factors identified by abraham another factor that may have played part in the failure of this nomination was the close proximity of the nominee to the president mierss continued at httpwwwwhitehousegov newsreleases200510200510272 html harriet miers the

eliminated and his nomination was also withdrawn at that time the thornberry nomination had not been reported by the judiciary committee the sixth of these nominations was that of john g roberts to be associate justice before the judiciary committee acted on this nomination chief justice william h rehnquist died creating vacancy roberts nomination to be associate justice was withdrawn shortly before the hearings were to begin so that he could be nominated to be chief justice the last of this group of seven nominations is that of harriet miers although the judiciary committee had scheduled hearings on her nomination to be associate justice her nomination was withdrawn in the face of opposition before any formal committee action although their first nominations were never reported second nominations of matthews hornblower and harlan in subsequent sessions of congress were reported to the full senate and roberts nomination to be chief justice during the same session of congress was also reported to the full senate only in the cases of stanbery thornberry and miers did nominations that had been referred to committee fail to be reported out of committee on any occasion the first two of these nominations were to fill associate justice vacancies that ceased to exist while the nominations were pending 70 and the last as just mentioned was withdrawn prior to any formal committee
