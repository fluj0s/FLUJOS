that are permanently appropriated with the money av ailable to be spent without further action by congress because the accounts are not reviewed annually b congress in the appropriations process oversight of these programs is infrequen t compared to other agency programs various groups have expressed concerns about these accounts in recent years especially those administered by the forest service alleging rewards for environmentally damaging behaviors insufficient compensation for the tax exempt status of federal lands and bsidies to special interests congress has begun to review and

financial and technical assistance to state or loca l governments other federal agencies andor private landowners the four agencies have substantial annual expenditures totaling more than 8 billion in fy1998 13 billion for the blm 19 billion for the nps 14 billion for the fws and 35 billion for the fs most of the funds come from annua l appropriations but each agency has numerous permanently appropriated trust r special funds that provide money without annual appropriations from congress many permanent appropriations are quite modest but few exceed 100 million in annual funding the permanently appropriated accounts are gene rally valued by the agencies and support ed by many interest groups however in recent years other groups hav expressed concerns about the trust and special funds environmental groups fo r example have asserted that many fs accounts reward environmentally damagin g behaviors counties are concerned that the accounts are providing substantially less compensation for taxexempt federal lands than they did decade ago and taxpayer groups have suggested that some accounts subsidize special interests this report summarizes the permanently appropriated trust funds and specia l funds of the four major federal land management agencies it describes permanen t appropriations and explains why they are significant and then describes trust an d special funds the subsequent two sections present general overview of the types of sources and uses of these perma nently appropriated accounts these are followed by brief descriptions of each agencys permanently appropriated accounts th information is drawn largely from the agencies annual budget justifications that are submitted to the appropriations committees and from the statutes that created

accounting of fice classifies permanent spending authority into five categories6 of which per manent appropriations is only one however in its last inventory of permanent spending authority gao identified only one account included in this report as other tha n permanent appropriations the npss glacier bay national park resource protection fund was identified as spending authority from offsetting collections see us genera l continuedpermanent appropriations 2 the constitution article i 9 requires that funds may be withdrawn from the treasury unless appropriated by law but there is constitutional limit on th duration of an appropriation while many programs receive their funds throug h appropriations bills enacted each year others receive p ermanent appropriation in the law that created them3 two terms trust fund and special fund commonly used in federal budget document s are often misunderstood because the federal budget meaning of th word trust differs significantly from the private sector usage in glossary f4 federal budget terms the only distinction between trust funds and special funds is that trust funds are designated as trust funds in their authorizing legislation one of the5 few differences is that interest on the balance in trust fund accrues is added to the trust fund while the interest on special fund accrues to the general fund of th treasury confusion over the operation of federal trust and special funds is typically greatest where there is disparity betw een the receipts supplying the account and the amount obligated annually generally the greater the disparity between receipts and obligations the greater the confusion over special funding that is not immediately available for spending in this report the terms are used interchangeably and either term may be used collectively to refer to both the trust funds and the special funds some but not all trust and special funds have been permanently appropriated in the authorizing legislation permanent appropriations can generally be identifie d in the authorization by the phrase available without further appropriation or b similar language and the funds in these accou nts can be spent by the relevant agency without any additional action by congress the money in any trust or special fun d created without such language generally can be spent only when congress enacts an appropriation from that account6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30335crs3 continued6 accounti ng office budget issues inventory of accounts with spending authority an d permanent appropriations

general those trying to create special and trust funds ultimately are seeking greater fiscal security for their favored programs permanent appropriations ma provide such stability compared to the vagaries of the annual federal budget an d appropriations processes however programs fun ded with permanent appropriations might be subject to less regular congressional oversight than those funded annually the permanent appropriation that as sures funding also typically eliminates the annual review of programs often conducted by the appropriations subcommittees review by the auth orizing committees might also be reduced thus it may be uncertai n whether the programs are achieving the purposes for which they were created whether funds are well or wisely spent etc funding sources most of the permanently appropria ted trust and special funds of the federal land management agencies are funded with agency receipts few including some of the largest ones are funded from other sources including excise taxes license fees import duties donations and the general fund of the treasury these sources ar described below agency receipts all four of the federal land management agencies collect money from the sale lease or other use of the lands and resources und er their jurisdiction but the amounts of the receipts vary widely among agencies and over time most of the natura l resource trust funds and special funds have been created to use receipts for specified purposes such as to rehabilitate sites following an extractive use or to otherwis invest in federal land and resource management their creation attests to the belief that such use of receipts is warranted and their persistence attests to the benefits they have produced over the years however critics argue that agency use of receipt s creates perverse incentives internal rewards for environmentally damagin g activities to generate the funds needed to m itigate those environmental damages for example fs wildlife managers receive funding for projects from timber receipts via the knutsonvandenberg fund if they support the timber sale in internal discussions even though many of those projects are intended to mitigate damages to wildlif habitat from timber harvesting7 the discretion over disposition of receip ts varies among agencies and programs some dedicate 100 of certain receipts to specific purp oses eg the recreational fee demonstration program others direct portion of receipts to be used in specifi c ways eg 15 of recreation fees to pay the administrative costs of collecting th fees still others allow the agency to decide the amount deposited into the trust fundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30335crs4 us dept of the interior fish and wildlife service report of receipts for fy

significant factor i n determining how controversial the account is most nps rece ipts result from recreation uses since the agencys mission is to provide recreation while preserving the lands and resources it manages fy1998 nps receipts were 203 million fws receipts result from wide array of activities timber sales grazing leases recreation uses etc but are relatively modest because the agencys mission is t administer the lands and resources primarily to benefit fish and wildlife the fws does n ot report receipts in its annual budget justifications as do the other three agencies but fy1996 receipts from lands and resources totaled 168 million8 the blm and fs have similar missions to produce sustained yields f multiple uses recreation grazing timber water and wildlife timber sales hav accounted for the vast majority of re ceipts for these two agencies totaling more than half of blm receipts and abou t 90 of fs receipts because timber sale levels have declined over the past decade agency receipts have declined fy1998 blm receipts were 147 million down from the fy1989 peak of 313 million while fy1998 fs receipts were 689 million down from their fy1989 peak of 1548 billion mineral leasing on federal lands also generates receipts but none of the four land management agencies collects leasing receipts the minerals management servic mms of the partment of the interior

billion mms does not distinguish among the administering agencies in its statistical9 reports on feder onshore lease collections although internal records from the mid 1990s show that the bulk of collections are from lands administered by the blm10 excise taxes and licensing fees federal excise taxes are funding source for two major fws programs federal aid in sport fish restoration wallopbreaux and federal aid in wildlife restoration pittmanrobertson licensing fees fund one major fws program the migratory bird conservation fund the duck stamp program and two minor fs programs woodsy owl and smokey the bear it is not required that program s funded by excise taxes or license fees be permanen tly appropriated however all five accounts of the federal land management agencies funded by excise taxes or license fees have been permanently appropriated in their authorizing legislationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30335crs5 excise taxes are taxes charged on specific ite ms or groups of items sometimes the receipts from fe deral excise taxes accumulate in special funds which can then be used for various purposes the fws federal aid programs are funded with excise taxes the excise tax receipts of both programs are permanently appropriated under laws that predate the strictures of subsequent budget reforms in both programs the taxes are paid substantially if not entirely by the people who are likely to benefit from the subsequent expenditures under the wallo pbreaux program the taxed items are sales of sport fishing tackle and equipment electric trolling motors and fishfinders and part of the gasoline taxes on users of motorboats and small engines with th funds used for programs to benefit sport fishing for pittmanrobertson the taxed items include the sales of guns including handguns ammunition and archer equipment with the funds used for wildlife programs under licensing fee programs users pay for some particular privilege or right the resulting receipts may be placed in fund to benefit either an outside user group or to support the continued existence of an agency program for duck stamps the program beneficiaries waterfowl hunters and refuge visitors purchase the licenses that fund the program waterfowl hunters over 16 years old must buy duck stamp which must be displayed on their hunting licenses while nonhunters purchase th stamps for various reasons to gain admission to fee areas in the national wildlif refuge system to provide support for the fws land acquisition program which i t funds and to collect the stamps which they value in the two fs programs licensees receive the privilege of using the agency icons woods ey owl and smokey the bear the former character is intended t promote wise use of the environment and ma intenance of environmental quality the latter character is used in the publicity and educ ation campaign to prevent forest fires the license fees are permanently appropriated and are used to further these values private enterprises purchase licences to use the characters in their own publications but the license purchasers gain direct benefit from the license fees they pay import duties one accoun t is funded entirely by tariffs while import duties contribute to two others the fss reforestation trust fund receives tariff collections on importe d wood products up to 30 million annua lly the history of the authorizing legislation does not identi fy why wood import tariffs were chosen to fund this account tariffs on imported fishing p roducts are added to excise taxes for the fwss federal aid in sport fish restoration while tariffs on hunting pro ducts are transferred to the fwss migratory bird conservation fund donations in general the federal land management agencies can accept donations fro m individuals and organizations for the agencies to carry out specific projects r research the nps and the fws each have permanently appropriated account for collecting donations the blm has two modest permanently appropriated accounts for such purposes with any donations in excess of the project costs returned to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30335crs6 donor in contrast the fs has one very small s pecial fund for research donations but the fund requires and has always received appropriations from congress annually in addition contributions fo r specific sites or projects may be made through the three foundations that support the nps f ws and fs the blm has comparable supporting foundation the national park foundation national fish and wildlif foundation and national forest foundation exist to assist the relevant agencies by matching federal funds with nonfederal contributions to leverage various activities thus essentially expanding agency appropriations all were created by acts f congress the national park foundation in 1967 pl 90209 the national fish and wildlife foundation in 1984 pl 98244 and the national forest foundation in 1990 title iv f pl 101593 these foundations provide an alternative means for donors to support the agencies directly general fund of the treasury two permanently appropriated accounts currently are funded from the general fund of the treasury the blm and fs receiptsharing accounts are funded fro m receipts from moneygenerating activities mostly timber sales these programs were supplanted for 10 years for the areas of washington oregon and california where timber sales were substantially reduced because of efforts to preserve spotted ow l habitat and othe r values the new programs were created in 1993 and were initially funded from agency receipts co ncerns about the adequacy of receipts led to 1994 amendment directing the payments to be made out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated thus these two accounts are funded from the genera l fund of the treasury rather than from any specific source uses of the funds most of the permanently appropriated natural resource trust funds and special funds were established to fund certain agency activities or to compensate state r local governments for the taxexempt status of federal lands some also provid funding for specific state or local agency programs traditionally such funds wer allocated by formula but competitive grants are becoming more common agency activities several permanently appropriated accounts were established to fund specifi c activities for the agencies although the various accounts display wide array f possible uses of the funds sometimes these activities are related to the activities that generate the receipts such as to reforest areas following mber sales or to recover the cost of collecting the receipts other activities for which such funds are commonly used are to restore degraded lands resources or facilities or to otherwise invest in the federal lands and resources some accounts authorize relatively narrowly defined purposes for which th funds can be used the migratory bird servation fund for example can be used only to acquire land for the national wildlife refuge system and the recreationfeehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30335crs7 the broadest compensation program payments in lieu of taxes pilt requires annual11 appropriations but is linked to many of these permanent payment programs this is described in crs report 98574 enr pilt payments in lieu of taxes somewhat simplified collection accounts can be used only to recoup administrative costs of collecting those fees other accounts have broader range of purposes for example the fs s knutsonvandenberg fund can be used to reforest sale areas to improve timbe r stands or to mitigate damages or enhance nontimber resource values within timber sale areas funding allocation among multiple purposes can b specified such as 80 of the recreation demonstration fees being available at the site where they ar collected and the blms payments to nevada from land sale recei pts 5 to the state 10 to clark county and 85 to fede ral land acquisition however allocations of many funds among multiple purposes are at the discretion of the agencies th purposes and allocations among multiple purposes are distinctive characteristics f each account state and local compensation many of the permanently appropriated accounts were created to compensat state or local governments for the taxexempt status of federal lands the accounts11 generally are funded as share of agency receipts ranging up to 90 at least partly because many of the accounts were creat ed before the federal income tax system was created before the federal government had other receipts to use for state benefits some programs encompass broad land base eg all national forests while other have much narrower base eg the national forests in three counties in norther n minnesota in addition some pr ograms specify the allowed uses of the funds while others are not restricted fs payments to states for example can only be used n roads and schools while blm sharing of grazing receipts can be used for any local governmental purpose state grant programs with formula allocations states territories and trib governments receive certain payments from federal agencies based on formula the programs provide federal money to accomplis h some shared pur pose the area of the state territory reservation etc and the size of some population whether the whole state or some group of people within it are common parameters used in calculating payments in the t wo natural resource special funds with formula allocations wall opbreaux and pittmanrobertson there is also maximum and minimum that sta territorial or tribal government may receive there may be matching requirement for some programs in contrast to many other federal programs inclu ding state and local compensation programs the combination of formula fixed in law and permanent appropriation gives the states substantial predictability of federal funding th is makes state governments especially supportive of this type of funding competitive programs without fixed formulas the payments from some permanentl appropriated accounts are not prescribed by formula rather the funds are allocated in som other manner often with projectshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30335crs8 the act authorizes another 25 to be paid to the oc counties initially to repay bac k12 taxes due on the land and subsequently after reimbursable charges against the oregon and continuedcompet ing for the funds for example the migratory bird conservation fund i s permanently appropriated and can be used only for acquiring migratory bird habitat the specific projects on which the money is spent are determined by federall appointe d panel and the selections must have approval from either the governor of the state or the state fish and game agency der the recreation fee demonstration program 80 of the collected funds must remain at the unit that collected them however the agencies are permitted to use the other 20 of the funds for othe r purpose s such as for units that cannot efficiently or economically collect the fee s directly in this sense the h abitat acquisitions recreation projects or other activities must compete to obtain some portion of the programs funds federal land management agencies trust funds and special funds this section describes the permanently appropriated trust funds and special funds of each of the four federal land management agencies the description of each fund with at least 5 million in fy1998 obligations includes the enabling legislation th fy1998 obligations and the source and uses of the fund also for each agency there is an other accounts entry to identify accounts with less than 5 million i n fy1998 obligations some of these other accounts had 0 in fy1998 obligations perhaps because the fund is relatively new ie receipts have not yet accumulated or because it is used only intermittently ie receipts do not occur every year i t should be recognized that the accounts are grouped as above or below 5 millio n based on fy1998 obligations and some might have been c lassified differently if based on budget authority or on another fiscal year bureau of land management the blm has 21

national forest timber sales with 75 of the money to prepare timber sales and 25 to address the backlog of recreation projects overview and comparison each of the four major federal land management agencies has several specia l funds and trust funds th at are permanently appropriated with the money available to be spent without further action by congress most of these accounts are funded by receipts from the sale lease or use of federal lands and resources other fundin g sources include excise taxes license fees import duties donations and the us treasur for many accounts the amount deposited is dictated by the authorizin g legislation the excise tax rates for the pittmanrobertson fund for example ar specified in law while depos its of import duties for the reforestation trust fund are limited to 30 million annually for other accounts the agency has some discretion in determining the deposits for example the fs and blm deter mine whether timber sale is salvage with the receipts deposited in specific accounts generally greate r agency discretion over the amount deposited in specific account is likely to lead to greater controversy over its use and in some cases there have been allegations f abuse the permanently appropriated accounts for these four agencies generally ar used for one of three purposes to fund agency activities to compensate state an d local governments for the taxexempt status of federal lands or to fund grants with formul allocation or with competition permanent appropriations for agenc yhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30335crs24 the fs 25 payments an d the blm oc payments have generated congressional interest28 in recent years because the counties have argued that declining federal timber sales hav substantially reduced their compensation payments the administration has propose d changing the payment formulas and bills have been introduced in the 106 congress t oth change the formulas see crs report rs 20178 forest service receiptsharing payments proposals for changeactivities can be contentious especially if the fund can be used for several possibly competing purposes and the agency has the discretion to allocate the funds amon g those purposes the compensation programs have generally not been controversial largely because the compensation level has been established in law similarly the28 grant programs typically have been uncontroversial and are likely to remain so s long as the people who pay the fees or taxes benefit from the expenditures bureau of land management the blm has 21 permanently appropriate d

discretion on allocating receipts among the accounts and funds larger share of agency activitie s 14 versus 110 from trust and special funds in addition the fs has used substantial and rising fraction of the funds in at least some of the permanently appropriated accounts to pay agenc overhead costs finally county concerns about declining payments under the 2529 receiptsharing and the b lms oc receiptsharing programs have led to legislation in the 106 congress to alter the historic formulath 30 if the recreation fee demonstration program were permanently authorized s some have suggested though such legislation has been introduced the np s seems likely to get more attention since this program alone funds 7 of all np s activities however it and many other nps trust funds and special funds are stil l relatively new and thus the full extent of the ir use is not yet known the blm might also get more congressional attention if its two large relatively new accounts fo r funding agency activities grow significantly the extent of such possible growth is unclear the fws has faced relatively little concern over its accounts even though it administers the two largest permanently appropriated natural resource accounts because the individuals who are the source of the fws funds are also the primar beneficiaries of the spending from these accounts congress is responsible for enacting all appropriations for agency programs for many of the trust and special funds the appropriations are permanent with n required annual enactment by the appropriations committees and thus typicall without the annual review conducted by the appropriations subcommittees th authorizing committees may also have conducted less oversight of the program s funded from permanently ac counts than of the programs that are funded annually it therefore may be unclear whethe r the programs are achieving the purposes for which they were created and whether the funds are well or wisely spent
