doj has taken the position that any executive department or agency whose authorizing legislation vests all powers and functions of the agency in its head and allows the head to delegate such powers and functions to subordinates in her discretion does not have to comply with the vacancies act which limits the time during which advice and consent positions may be filled by temporary designees before nomination is forwarded to the senate all executive departments have such provisions as consequence during 1998 some 20 of the 320 advice and consent positions in the departments were being filled by temporary designees most of whom had served beyond the 120day limitation period of the act without presidential submissions of nominations the designation by the attorney general of an acting assistant attorney general for civil rights in december 1997 in apparent contravention of the vacancies act precipitated congressional hearings and the introduction of legislation in both houses to remedy the perceived noncompliance also federal appeals court ruling in march 1998 narrowly construing the vacancies act further piqued congressional concerns on july 15 1998 the senate

consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act which became law on october 21 1998 pl 105277 the new vacancies act rejects the doj position and makes it the exclusive vehicle for

december 15 1997 as acting assistant attorney general for civil rights in the department of justice doj revived longstanding interbranch controversy over the legal propriety of the failure of executive branch departments and agencies to cons istently comply with the provisions of the vacancies act since at least 1973 doj has taken the position that any executive department or agency whose authorizing legislation vests all power s and functions of the agency in its head and allows the head to delegate such powers and functions to subordinates in her discretion does not have to comply with that act which limits the time during which advice and consent positions may be filled by temporary designees before nomination is forwarded to the senate all executive departments have such provisions as consequence during 1998 some 20 of the 320 advice and consent positions in the departments were being filled by temporary designees most of whom had served beyond the 120day limitation period of the act without presidential submissions of nominations several bills introduced in the 105 th congress sought to remedy what was seen by many to be noncompliance with the vacancies act that seriously undermined the senates confirmation prerogative following hearings on s 2176 the federal vacancies reform act of 1998 was reported by the senate committee on governmental affairs on july 15 1998 although the bill failed to survive cloture vote on the senate floor on september 24 1998 negotiations between the senate sponsors and the administration continued and compromise was reached on revision and included in the fy 1999 omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act which became law on october 21 1998 pl 105277 division c title i section 151 the new vacancies act rejects the doj position on temporary appointments and makes it clear that the act is the exclusive vehicle for temporarily filling vacant advice and consent positions unless congress expressly provides otherwise th legislation provides substantial incentives for prompt presidential submissions of nominations including an increase in the time during which an acting officer may serve when timely nominations are submitted but the presidents choices of action are strictly confined and the failure to comply with the statutes requirements may lead to the vacation of the authorities and responsibilities of the office and to rendering the actions of acting officials void without the possibility of subsequent ratification special provision is made for vacancies that occur during change of administration after presidential election finally responsibility for monitoring compliance with the provisions of the law is placed with the comptroller general this report will proceed as follows first the legislative history of the vacancies act is briefly described with particular attention to the early understanding of doj with respect to its intended purpose and coverage that legislative history is also examined for clues as to the congressional intent with respect to the applicability of the act to doj next the development of the conflicting provisions of doj and the comptroller general is reviewed and explained followed by recounting of congress 1988 attempt to resolve the uncertainty of dojs stance through amendatory legislation the discussion continues with review of the events that precipitated the most recent controversy and confrontation and the history of the legislative actions that culminated in the passage of the new legislation and concludes with detailed description and analysis of that legislation t

originally passed in 18682 was intended to prevent the president from delaying sending forth nominations for advice and consent positions which could thereby evade the senates confirmation prerogative and to provide the exclusive means for temporarily filling vacancies in covered positions unless congress explicitly provided superseding mechanism only two options were available under the statute either first assistant or presidential designee who had previously received senate confirmation could serve for strictly defined and limited period prior to 1988 the limitation period was 10 days until 1891 and then 30 days in that year it was increased to 120 days an unbroken line of attorneys general and office of legal counsel opinions from 1880 through 1977 reflected the understanding that there could be only one limited period of occupancy per vacancy first assistants and presidential designees service could not be piggybacked and that pending nomination did not toll the limitation period 3 these opinions held that once the time period was exhausted the office had to remain vacant and the powers and duties of the office could not be lawfully exercised the act was understood by the department of justice doj to apply in this rigid manner whether bureau chiefs or the heads of cabinet departments were involved the only recourse of president to fill position in the event the vacancies act was unavailable was the nomination process or recess appointment 4 however since 1973 doj has taken the position that the vacancies act only provides one possible method for filling certain positions on an interim basis and that some departments and agencies including doj have statutory authority to assign duties and powers of positions on temporary basis outside the vacancies act doj asserts that it has such authority under section 509 of title 28 which provides that all f unctions of other officers of the department of justice and all functions of agencies and employees of the department of justice are vested in the attorney general and under section 510 which permits the attorney general from time to time to make such provisions as he considers appropriate authorizing the performance by any other officer employee or agency of the department of justice of any function of the attorney general it also contends that these vesting and delegation provisions make the time limitations of the vacancies act on the filling of vacant positions inapplicable to the department this special authority is said to date from the establishment of the department in 1870 5 in the past doj has denied the applicability of the vacancies act relying on sections 509 and 510 with respect to vacancies in the offices of fbi director and assistant attorney general for the criminal division and the departments of health and human services hhs education and labor with the apparent support of doj have adopted the same rationale with respect to administrative provisions in their own enabling legislation that similarly vests all powers and 1 5 usc 33453349 1994 2 act of july 23 1868 ch 227 15 stat 168 3 see 16 op atty gen 596 597 1880 18 op atty gen 530 1883 18 op atty

discretionary delegations to subordinate officers and employees with equal consistency the comptroller general of the united states has disputed dojs position the comptroller argued that the language and history of the vacancies act establish that it is the exclusive authority for the temporary filling of vacant positions which require presidential appointment with the advice and consent of the senate unless there is specific statutory language providing another means for filling the particular vacancies neither the doj provisions nor similar provisions in other department enabling statutes which have common origins the comptroller general argued have either the requisite specificity or legislative purpose to effect displacement of the scheme of the vacancies act 6 following challenges in 1986 to rulings of noncompliance with the act by the hhs labor and education departments the comptroller general requested that congress address the growing compliance problem it was facing two significant amendments were made to the act first the act was amended to cover all executive departments and agencies thereby overruling 1973 court ruling limiting its coverage to executive and military departments second section 3348 was rewritten to allow 120 days rather than 30 days for temporary designee to fill vacancy the new provision was designed to give the president more time to find nominee and at the same time emphasize the centrality and importance of the senates confirmation prerogative thus if nomination was sent forward the time limitation was abated during the period during which it was under consideration only if the nomi nation was rejected or withdrawn did the clock start ticking again on the temporary assignee in its report the senate committee expressed the belief that in this manner it was dealing with the interpretative controversy between doj and the comptroller general by giving more leeway to the president to find nominee and tying the time limitation on actings to the prompt forwarding of nominations the committee believed it made more effective and clear the section 3349 declaration that the acts provisions are the sole means for filling vacancies in covered agencies 7 1989 opinion by dojs office of legal counsel acknowledged the senate committees disagreement with its longstanding view that th vacancies act does not extinguish other general authorities relating to the appointment of officers but characterized the committee reports explanation of the statutory changes as an impr oper and unsuccessful effort to alter the proper construction of statute through subsequent legislative history8 the opinion signaled that doj would continue to adhere to its position that ce rtain provisions in agency enabling statutes may trump the vacancies act the effect of the application of dojs supersession policy throughout the executive branch and consequently on the senates confirmation power has been significant at the justice department 45 individuals since 1981 have been designated as actings in advice and consent positions for periods exceeding the permissible limitation of the vacancies act the acting head of the departments criminal division served in excess of 30 months until nomination was submitted on march 13 1998 and the acting solicitor general served over 14 months until his resignation

contention that section 14 of its 1870 enabling legislation which vests all powers and functions of the department in the attorney general and allows her to delegate these powers and functions to such officers and employees as she deems necessary supersedes the vacancies act and permits her to fill vacant advice and consent positions for an indeterminate period does not appear supportable review of the legislative history of the provisions asserted to be the basis of the supersession does not provide the necessary explicitness and clarity to support the claim in fact the debates on the establishment of the department in 1870 indicate that the provision said to be the original source of the authority had wholly different purpose and did not in any way address the problem of vacant advice and consent positions the singular purpose of the 1870 legislation was to bring order out of the chaos which fragmentation and dispersal of legal authority throughout the federal government over time had engendered as succinctly put by representative jenckes the principal sponsor of the bill it is for the purpose of having unity of jurisprudence if i may use that expression in the executive law of the united states that this bill proposes that all the law officers herein provided for shall be subordinate to one head 10 the debates concerning section 14 make it evident that it was not provision designed to override the recently enacted vacancies act its purpose was purely administrative to establish chain of command and to allow the attorney general flexibility in organizing the new department which would have transferred to it myriad of new substantive authorities and responsibilities and new legal personnel from other executive departments purpose consonant with the centralization of control of legal business in law department 11 it is not the type of explicit exemptive provision that would take it out from under general legislation like the vacancies act which was itself meant to be preemptive in nature further the presence in section 2 of the legislation of provision making the new solicitor general the attorney generals chief or first assistant with the authority to act in his stead in the event of vacancy in that office is an indication of not only congressional awareness of the vacancies act but of an intent to utilize it 9 roger garcia

occupancy congress has also enacted provisions requiring that filling of vacancies by recess appointments be promptly followed by submissions of presidential nominations for such positions 14 and prohibiting the payment of salary of recess appointees who had been rejected by vote of the senate15 congress historic attention to the protection of the senates confirmation prerogative accords with the supreme courts view of the high importance the appointments process has in our constitutional scheme of balanced separated powers the court has made it clear that the principle of separation of powers is embedded in the appointments clause freytag v commissioner of internal revenue 501 us 868 882 1991 and most recently emphasized that the clause is more than matter of etiquette or protocol

the failure of executive agencies to adhere to the directives of the vacancies act16 witnesses from both sides of the aisle senators byrd and thurmond representative of the comptroller general and academics generally concurred that the noncompliance with the act was unlawful but that the act needed to be strengthened and clarified to make it effective senators byrd and thurmond announced that they were introducing legislation to address the problem department of justice representatives declared the agencys continued adherence to its position several remedial bills were subsequently introduced s 1761 introduced by senator byrd provided that anyone performing the duties of position that had been vacant in excess of the 120day limitation of section 3348 would not be paid for any day that such duties are performed even if the person performing such duties occupied another position for which he was being paid the bill provided that the director of the office of management and budget report monthly to the comptroller general about vacancies in advice and consent positions and directed the comptroller general to report when the 120day period had been exceeded to the congress the president the treasury secretary and the office of personnel management the vacancies act was deemed to have superseded any other provis ion of law unless that law expressly provided that it supersedes the act the new provisions were to be prospective and to have effect on pending nominations or occupiers of vacant positions s 1764 introduced by senators thurmond and lott proposed more extensive revisions to the vacancies act the bill made it clear that it is the exclusive vehicle for temporarily filling vacant advice and consent positions in executive agencies for another statutory provision to supersede the act it must expressly have provided that it was intended to do so the president could fill vacancies only with the first assistant of the officer who was serving on the date the vacancy occurs or with an officer who had received senate confirmation and was currently serving if vacant office was not temporarily filled in the manner provided within 120 days the office was to remain vacant until person was nominated by the president and confirmed by the senate validly assigned acting official could serve for 120 days but if that period was exhausted without the submission of nomination the position must remain vacant until nominee was confirmed one who performed the duties of the vacant office after the 120day period had expired could be paid either out of monies appropriated for the vacant position or for the position the assignee occupied while performing such duties the heads of all executive departments and agencies were required to report vacancies in advice and consent positions upon their occurrence to the comptroller general and if the comptroller general determined that the 120day period had passed without submission of nomination he was required to report that determination to the congress the president the secretary of the treasury and the office of personnel management the bill was to apply prospectively to vacancies that occurred after enactment hr 3420 introduced by representative hyde and 12 others would have amended section 510 of title 28 to reject the applicability of justices vesting and delegation theory to itself and specifically make the vacancies act applicable to the department it also provide that if the 120 day period of the act lapse without the submission of nominee for department vacancy the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia would appoint an acting official for the vacant position who would serve until the vacancy was filled but the court could not appoint 16 see vacancies act

official under the terms of the vacancies act following the march hearing chairman thompson introduced his own legislative proposal s 2176 the federal vacancies reform act of 1998 was introduced in the senate on june 16 1998 by senators thompson byrd thurmond lott and roth the bill as amended was reported by the senate committee on governmental affairs on july 15 199817 s 2176 made clear that the vacancies act was to apply to all positions in executive agencies requiring senate confirmation except for positions in independent regulatory agencies and other boards and commissions and for approximately 40 positions including that of attorney general that may be temporarily filled under other specific statutes the bill repudiated the contention of the department of justice that the head of department may temporarily fill position under law authorizing that head to delegate or reassign duties among other officers in the department person would have been prohibited from serving as an acting officer if 1 that person was serving as first assistant when the incumbent of the position resigned or wa s unable to continue to serve 2 during the 365day period preceding the appointment such person served as first assistant for less than 180 days and 3 the president nominates that person for the position the bill extended from 120 to 150 days the time period that an acting officer might serve and would have extended that period for another 150 days if nomination were submitted if nomination was not submitted within 150 days of the vacancy however then the office would remain vacant and the duties of the office could be performed only by the head of the agency any action taken by an acting officer in violation of these provisions would be invalid and one would be permitted to ratify those actions if the president submitted nomination after the 150 days an acting officer could be allowed to serve while the nomination was pending or until 150 days after it was withdrawn or rejected each executive agency would be required to report to the comptroller general an existing vacancy the name of the person serving as acting officer and when such service began the name of any nominee and when such nomination was submitted and the final disposition of the nomination the comptroller general was to notify the congress the president and the office of personnel management when

the situation it ruled however that the 120day time limit of section 3348 does not begin to run until the president acts to designate current advice and consent official or first assistant succeeds by operation of law in the situation before it neither occurred until retsinas was designated four years after ryan left the court refused to consider doolins contention that fiechter was actually ryans

office we do not decide whether fiechter lawfully occupied the position of director thus the court did not address the effect of section 3349 which makes the act the exclusive vehicle for temporarily filling vacant positions on fiechters assignment further the courts assu mption that the lack of presidential action does not trigger the time limits of the act and the failure to definitively resolve the validity of the fiechter designation left open the possibility of revitalized use of the justice departments vesting and delegation theory or the assignment of acting officials by outgoing officials coupled with presidential inaction without regard to the requirements of the vacancies act 18 the senate committees concerns with the doolin decisionthat it recognized right in the president to do nothing under the vacancies act and thereby allow an agency to designate an acting head for an indefinite period and also the ability of lawful successor of an unlawful acting official to

piecemeal remediati on of the 130yearold statute would not address and resolve contemporary problems in policing through the confirmation process the effective and efficient staffing of responsible political bureaucracy and the understanding that the congressional goals of timely presidential subm ission of nominations and minimization of the period during which unconfirmed acting officials serve in key positions meant to be politically responsible and responsive had to be balanced against executive concerns that the vetting process for potential officeholders has become more complex difficult and protracted and that the need 18 three months after the appeals courts ruling one of the parties discovered documents that indicated that fiechter had in fact been designated by outgoing

administration during the period of interim service of an acting official was being unduly constrained by current law the rewrite appears animated by these considerations the president now has three options when an advice and consent position in any executive agency becomes vacant as result of the death resignation or other inability to perform the functions and duties of the office under new section 3345 the president may allow the first assistant to such officer to assume the functions and duties of the office or he may direct current officer in any agency who has been subjec t to senate confirmation to perform those tasks or he may select any officer or employee of the subject agency who has been with that agency for at least 90 of the 365 days preceding the vacancy and is at least at the minimum gs15 grade level however person may not temporarily serve if that person did not in the previous 365 days served as first assistant or was first assistant for less than 90 days and the president submits nomination of that person to the senate section 3345 b 1 section 3345 is designed to provide optimal flexibility and administrative continuity in the case of covered vacancy first assistant may now be either one who is designated such by law or by agency regulation if there is provisi on of law or agency regulation designating such person and the president deems it inappropriate to assign an advice and consent officer from another agency to occupy the office he may select person in the agency who has been there sufficient amount of time and at high enough grade level to perform the duties of the office the limitation of section 3345 b 1 noted above is to prevent placing an employee in an agency simply for the purpose of having him in place while his nomination is pending the desirability of administrative continuity in office also explains the exception in section 3345 where person is serving in position for term of years and the term expires he may continue to hold that office subject to the time limitations of section 3346 if the president nominates him for reappointment to that same office under section 3346 person who is serving in an acting capacity pursuant to section 3345 may temporarily hold that office for 210 days beginning on the date the vacancy occurs the limitation period is suspended however if first or second nomination is submitted to the senate for as long as the nomination is pending in that body if the first nomination is rejected by the senate or is withdrawn or is returned to the president the acting officer may continue to serve for more than 210 days after such action but if second nomination is submitted within that 210day period the acting officer may serve until the second nomination is confirmed or for longer than 210 days after the nomination is rejected withdrawn or returned if vacancy commences during sine die congressional adjournment the 210day limitation period does not begin until the senate reconvenes new section 3347 declares that sections 3345 and 3346 are the exclusive means for authorizing the temporary filling of advice and consent positions unless 1 congress expressly provides by law that the president court or the head of an executive department may designate an officer or employee to perform the function or duties of specified office temporarily or 2 congress designates by law particular officer or employee to temporarily serve or 3 the president exercises his recess appointment power pursuant to article ii sec 2 cl 3 of the constitution section 3347b

responsibilities to other agency officers or employees thereby provides an alternative to the acts otherwise exclusive means of temporarily filling vacant positions

temporarily serving in accordance with sections 3345 3346 and 3347 the office must remain vacant but if it is an office other than the head of an agency the head of the agency may perform the duties and functions of that office thus if the president submits nomination for an office during the 210day period from the date of the commencement of vacancy the options available under the act can longer be utilized or if the options provided under the act are exhausted only the nomination process or recess appointment are available to the president further if an action is taken by person who is not

is serving longer than the 210 day limitation and its applicable exceptions he is to report his determination of that fact to the specified house and senate committees the president and the office of personnel management special provision is made for vacancies that occur during the transition to new administration after presidential election under section 3349a for any vacancy that exists in the 60day period after inauguration day the 210day limitation period begins either 90 days after inauguration day or 90 days after the date which the vacancy occurs the new act does not apply to statutory provisions that authorize an officeholder to continue to serve in office after the expiration of the term for which the person was appointed or until successor is appointed or specified period of time has expired ie socalled holdover provisions section 3349b the act also does not apply to advice and consent officers on boards commissions or similar entities that are composed of multiple members and govern independent establishments or government corporations the commissioners of the federal energy regulatory commission members of the surface transportati on board or article i judges section 3349c section 3349d provides that written notification by the president to the senate that nomination will be submitted to the senate after recess or an adjournment of more than 15 days is deemed to

actually submitted within two days after the end of such recess or adjournment the nomination will be treated as withdrawn for the purposes of sections 3345 through 3349c this provision would appear to be an encouragement to the president not to utilize his recess appointment power the act is effective on november 20 1998 and will apply to any vacancy occurring after the effective date but the time limitations of section 3346 apply to any office that is vacant on the effective date as if the office became vacant on that date finally nomination for vacant office submitted after the effective
