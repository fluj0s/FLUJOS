domestic support randy schnepf specialist in agricultural policy resources science and industry division summary most provisions of the current farm bill the farm security and rural investment act fsria of 2002 pl 107171 do not expire until 2007 however hearings on 2007 farm bill could begin in late 2005 at that time congress will begin to examine farm income and commodity price support proposals that might succeed the programs due to expire in 2007 key question likely to be asked of virtually every new proposal is how it will affect us commitments under the wtos agreement on agriculture aa which commits the united states to spend more than 191 billion annually on domestic farm support programs most likely to distort trade the aa spells out the rules for countries to determine whether their policies are potentially trade distorting and to calculate the costs this report which will be updated if events warrant describes the steps for making these determinations introduction major farm income and commodity price support provisions of the last omnibus farm bill the farm security and rural investment act fsria of 2002 pl 107171 do not expire until 20071 however discussions of 2007 farm bill are already underway within various farm and commodity organizations the house and possibly the senate agriculture committees could begin hearings on new farm bill before the end of 2005 such hearings would mark the official start to an examination of the options for modifying and extending the current programs one major constraint affecting future policy choices will be us agricultural policy commitments made under the wtos agreement on agriculture aa2 1 for more information see crs report rs22131 agriculture previewing farm bill 2 the official text of the aa is at httpwwwwtoorgenglishdocs_elegal_elegal_ehtmag for more information see wto understanding the wto the agreements agriculture fairer markets for farmers at httpwwwwtoorgenglishthewto_ewhatis_etif_eagrm3_ehtm congressional research service the library of congress crs2 regarding domestic farm programs the aa contains detailed rules and procedures to guide countries in determining which programs are the most likely to distort production and trade known as amber box subsidies in calculating their annual cost measured by the aggregate measurement of support ams index and in reporting total cost to the wto the united states currently is committed under the aa to spending more than 191 billion per year on amber box support so key question that policymakers will ask of virtually every new farm proposal is how will it affect us commitments under the aa the answer rests not only on cost but also on the proposals design and objectives aa provisions for domestic farm spending the wtos aa procedures for classifying and counting tradedistorting support are somewhat complex however four questions might be asked to determine whether particular farm measure will cause total us domestic support to be above or below the 191 billion annual limit 1 can the measure be classified as green box policy one presumed to have the least potential for distorting production and trade and therefore not counted 2 can it be classified as blue box policy that is production limiting program that receives special exemption and also therefore not counted 3 if it is potentially tradedistorting amber box policy can support still be excluded from the ams calculation because the total is more than 5 of annual production value the socalled 5 minimis exemption explained later in more detail 4 if such support does exceed the 5 threshold when it is added to all other forms of nonexempt support is total us ams still beneath the 191 billion maximum can this measure be placed in the green box to qualify for exemption in the green box aa annex 2 program must 1 be publicly funded government program defined to include either outlays or forgone revenue that does not involve transfers from consumers and also 2 not have the effect of providing price support to producers and also 3 meet the following policyspecific criteria and conditions general service benefitting the agriculture or rural community in general cannot involve direct payments to producers or processors such programs can include research pest and disease control training extension or advisory services inspection services including for health safety grading or standardization marketing and promotion services including information advice and promotion but not spending for unspecified purposes that sellers could use to provide price discounts or other economic benefits to purchasers and generally available infrastructure like utility transportation or port facilities water supply facilities or other capital works construction crs3 public acquisition at current market prices and stockholding of products for food security must be integral to nationally legislated food security program and be financially transparent domestic food aid is to be based upon clearly defined eligibility and nutritional criteria be financially transparent and involve government food purchases at current market prices decoupled income support is to use clearly defined eligibility criteria in specified fixed base period not be related in any way after the base period to domestic or world prices b type or volume of crop or livestock production or c factors of production and further not be contingent on any production in exchange for payments government financial participation in an income insurance or income safety net program should define eligibility as agricultural income loss exceeding 30 of average gross income or equivalent in net income terms in the preceding threeyear period or preceding fiveyear period excluding the highest and lowest years the socalled olympic average with such payment compensating for less than 70 of the income loss in year of eligibility and payments based solely on income not production price or production factors and total annual payments under this and natural disaster relief see below cannot exceed 100 of producers total loss payments whether direct or through government crop insurance for natural disaster relief are to use eligibility based on formal government recognition of the disaster payments determined by production loss exceeding 30 of production in the preceding threeyear or fiveyear olympic average period applied only to losses of income livestock land or other production factors and for not more than the total replacement cost and not requiring typesquantities of future production and total annual payments under this and the above measure cannot exceed 100 of producers total loss structural adjustment through producer retirement shall tie eligibility to clearly defined criteria in programs to facilitate producers total and permanent retirement from agricultural production or their movement into nonagricultural activities structural adjustment through resource retirement shall be determined through clearly defined programs designed to remove land livestock or other resources from marketable production with payments conditioned on land being retired for at least three years and on livestock being permanently disposed b not contingent upon any alternative specified use of such resources involving marketing agricultural production and c not related to production typequantity or to prices of products using remaining productive resources structural adjustment provided through investment aids must be determined by clearly defined criteria for programs assisting financial or crs4 physical restructuring of producers operations in response to objectively demonstrated structural disadvantages and may also be based on clearly defined program for reprivatization of agricultural land the amount of payments cannot be tied to typevolume of production or to prices in any year after the base period b shall be provided only for time period needed for realization of the investment in respect of which they are provided c cannot be contingent on the required production of designated products except to require them not to produce designated product and d must be limited to the amount required to compensate for the structural disadvantage environmental program payments must have eligibility determined as part of clearly defined government environmental or conservation program and be dependent upon meeting specific program conditions including conditions related to production methods or inputs and payments must be limited to the extra costs or loss of income involved with program compliance regional assistance program payments shall be limited only to producers in clearly designated contiguous geographic region with definable economic and administrative identity considered to be disadvantaged based on objective clearly defined criteria in the law or regulation which indicate that the regions difficulties are more than temporary such payments in any year shall not be related to or based on typevolume of production in any year after the base period other than to reduce production or to prices after the base period b where related to production factors must made at degressive rate above threshold level of the factor concerned and c must be limited to the extra costs or income loss involved in agriculture in the prescribed area in conclusion the above measures are eligible for placement in the green box ie exempted from ams as long as they 1 meet general criteria one and two above and 2 additionally comply with any criteria specific to the type of measure itself if these conditions are satisfied further steps are necessary the measure is exempt however if not then the next step is to determine whether it qualifies for the blue box exemption can this measure be placed in the blue box to qualify for exemption in the blue box aa article 65 program must be direct payment under production limiting program and also either be based on fixed areas and yields or be made on 85 or less of the base level of production or if livestock payments be made on fixed number of head if these conditions are satisfied the measure is exempt however if not then they are considered to be amber box policies and the next step is to determine whether spending is above or below the 5 minimis rate see below crs5 if amber will this support exceed 5 of production value the aa article 64 states that developed country members including the united states do not have to count when calculating their total ams the following amber box ie potentially tradedistorting policies productspecific domestic support where it does not exceed 5 of the members total value of production of basic agricultural product during the relevant year support provided through all of the measures specific to product not just single measure in question is tallied to determine whether the 5 level is exceeded nonproductspecific domestic support where it does not exceed 5 of the value of the members total agricultural production all non productspecific support not just single measure is tallied to determine whether the 5 level is exceeded these provisions are known as the socalled minimis clause to reiterate it is not enough to determine whether single amber box measure ie one not classified as either green or blue by itself may be beneath the 5 of production value trigger its level of support must be added to the support provided by other nonexempt amber box measures if the cost of this particular measure effectively boosts total support above 5 then all such support must be counted toward the us total annual ams does this total annual ams now exceed 191 billion finally all support that fails to qualify for an exemption is added for the year if the total does not exceed 191 billion then the united states has met its wto commitment if it does exceed 191 billion the united states has not met its wto commitment classification of us policies the last us notification to the wto was for 2001 following are examples of how various us domestic policies were classified in that notification green box policies usda research cooperative extension and economics programs animal and plant health inspection service aphis

grazing programs federal crop insurance value of indemnities less premiums paid outlook negotiations are now under way in the wto to further reform agricultural trade they are not expected to be completed before congress decides on new farm bill as lawmakers consider policy options other countries will be evaluating not only whether in their view these options will comply with the us commitments under the aa but also how they reflect on the us negotiating position in the ongoing talks the us objective is for negotiations to result in substantial reductions in tradedistorting support and stronger rules that ensure that all productionrelated support is subject to discipline while preserving criteriabased green box policies that can support agriculture in ways that minimize trade distortions at the same time congress might seek methods that it can justify as aacompliant us officials also may seek to influence multilateral roles in ways that are consistent with us
