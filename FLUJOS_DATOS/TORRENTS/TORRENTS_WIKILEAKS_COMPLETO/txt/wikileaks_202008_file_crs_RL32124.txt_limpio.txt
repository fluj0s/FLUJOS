centurieslong tradition of mostly autocratic rule toward representative government democratic constitution was adopted in 1985 and democraticallyelected civilian government inaugurated in 1986 eighteen years later democratic institutions remain fragile of all the conflicts that ravaged central america in the last decades of the 20th century guatemalas conflict lasted the longest guatemala ended its 36year civil war in 1996 with the signing of the peace accords between the government and the guatemalan national revolutionary unity unidad revolucionaria nacional guatemalteca urng group created in 1982 from the merger of four leftwing guerrilla groups some of these groups were inspired by the ideologies of the cuban and nicaraguan revolutions and by liberation theology some had bases in the highlands with mostly indigenous population and incorporated the historical grievances of the mayans into their agendas for social and economic reform the accords not only ended the civil conflict but constituted blueprint for profound political economic and social change to address the conflicts root causes embracing 10 other agreements signed from 1994 to 1996 the accords call for one third reduction in the size and budget of the military major investments in health education and other basic services to reach the rural and indigenous poor and the full participation of the indigenous population in local and national decision making they require fundamental changes in tax collection and government expenditures and improved financial management the accords also outline profound restructuring of state institutions especially of the military police and judicial system with the goal of ending government security forces impunity from prosecution and consolidating the rule of law former president alfonso portillo of the guatemalan republican front frg whose fouryear term just expired took office in january 2000 following elections generally regarded as free and fair upon taking office president portillo embraced the peace accords and declared them to be state policy for his administration portillo survived the revelation made by the guatemalan press during the presidential campaign that he had fatally shot two men in mexico in 1982 and had been fugitive from justice until mexican judge declared the case inactive in 1995 portillo admitted to having committed the murders and said they were in self defense1 he went on to win by large margin in runoff elections with some analysts concluding that voters had overlooked portillos personal background

criticized for inadequate implementation of the peace process and increases in human rights violations drug trafficking and common crime he was also criticized for allegedly extensive corruption in his administration transparency international said guatemala was perceived as the 33rd most corrupt country out of 133 countries in 20033 in the economic realm growth slowed during his administration and unemployment rose although portillo initially reduced the governments deficit spending reducing the budget by an average of 10 he then resumed deficit spending oscar berger pronounced bershay of the great national alliance gran alianza nacional gana recently formed and fractious coalition of centerright parties was inaugurated president on january 14 2004 bergers election ends the dualparty dominance of the pan and frg that has characterized guatemalan national politics in recent years berger has promised to make fulfilling the peace accords central theme of his administration he says signing freetrade agreement with the united states is top priority and that he plans to stimulate the economy by encouraging private investment while noting that insufficient enactment of peace accord reforms are mainly the responsibility of the government the united nations verification mission in guatemala minugua states that civil society also bears responsibility for fulfilling the accords guatemala requested mission in 1994 in the guatemalan comprehensive agreement on human rights the first of the peace accords to verify human rights and compliance with the commitments of that agreement in its may 2003 report minugua criticized the organized private sector for systematically opposing efforts to increase taxes preventing guatemala from reaching the minimum target set in the peace accords of tax base equal to 12 of gross domestic product and thereby limiting funding available for key social ministries and institutions of justice november 2003 elections guatemalans elected new president legislature and other officials in 2003 elections were held on november 9 but because presidential candidate received over 50 of the vote runoff election between the top two candidates

constitute the majority needed to pass legislation berger negotiated governing coalition with coloms party and his former party pan which creates 96seat majority in the legislature some observers believe that of equal or greater importance is who did not run in the second round retired general efrain rios montt of the frg whose nomination generated much controversy received only 19 in the first round presidential election rios montts candidacy caused great concern among the international community much of guatemalan society and human rights organizations rios montt age 77 took power through coup and was military dictator from 19821983 while the army carried out counterinsurgency campaign resulting in what the guatemalan truth commission has now characterized as genocide of the mayan population he founded the frg and was president of the guatemalan congress until he stepped down in august 2003 to focus on his election campaign the frg named rios montt its presidential candidate despite provision in the constitution that bans participants in military coups from running for president and that prevented his running twice before after the supreme court temporarily suspended rios montts candidacy frghired gangs launched violent protests guatemalas highest court the constitutional court decided in late july to allow rios montts candidacy supporting his argument that he carried out his coup before the constitution was written and therefore the prohibition against running should not apply to him the decision was criticized as illegal by some supreme court justices and further polarized the electorate two appeals by opposition parties were dismissed on september 12 although rios montt was far behind in polls prior to the election some analysts believed that an electoral victory by rios montt could not be ruled out because of targeted spending by the frg government strong rural support and concerns that the frg would use fraud to guarantee reelection thenpresident portillo who is also rios montts soninlaw was said to be putting the full weight of the government machine behind his partys contender4 according to amnesty international prior to the firstround elections the electoral process had already been manipulated via pressure threats violence terror intimidation and improper use of state and municipal resources and more manipulation along with falsification or alteration of electoral rolls and election results was likely to occur5 press reports indicate that electionrelated violence between july and october led to the deaths of 21

mission began operating in guatemala months before the november election with other groups joining in the observation efforts closer to the polling date observers reported the second round elections to be relatively peaceful and free of fraud although rios montt lost analysts are concerned that he will continue to be destabilizing element he resigned from congress to run and thereby lost the parliamentary immunity that protected him from indictment proceedings in guatemala rios montt also has indictments against him in spain and belgium he now faces possible prosecution on charges of genocide and other offenses allegedly committed during his facto regime opposition to such prosecution could come from his network of supporters in the military judiciary and legislature which includes his the former army chief of staff and his daughter who was vice president of the congress president berger has been unclear on whether he will allow genocide charges against the former general to proceed nonetheless some observers believe that the repudiation of rios montt in the november polls in which almost threefourths of eligible voters cast ballots represents significant step forward in guatemalas efforts to strengthen democracy and respect for human rights socioeconomic background8 guatemala has the largest population in central america 12 million people approximately half the population is indigenous with about 23 different ethno linguistic groups the indigenous population is economically and socially marginalized and subject to significant ethnic discrimination distribution of income and wealth remains highly skewed in guatemala according to recent world bank report guatemala ranks among the more unequal countries of the world with the top 20 of the population accounting for 54 of total consumption indigenous people constituting about 50 of the population account for less than 25 of total income and consumption according to the world banks recent

oas mission chief demands security latin american weekly report sept 30 2003 8 socioeconomic data in this section are primarily from guatemala poverty assessment the world bank february 2003 and background note guatemala us department of state sept 2003 crs5 impoverishment of the indigenous population massive land expropriations forced labor and exclusion of the indigenous from the educational system all served to develop coffee as guatemalas primary export crop yet inhibit development among the indigenous rural population by 1960 guatemala had double the per capita gross domestic product gdp of neighboring honduras and nicaragua but lower social indicators this remains the case today guatemalas per capita gdp is 3630 in the mid range internationally its total gdp 205 billion is the largest in central america yet the world bank says data suggest that poverty is higher in guatemala than in other central american countries estimates of the portion of guatemalas population living in poverty vary the us state department reports that 80 of guatemalans live in poverty with twothirds of that number living in extreme poverty the world bank reports that 54 of the population lives in poverty with indications that poverty has increased slightly in 200120029 poverty is highest in rural areas and among the indigenous 75 of all people living in the countryside live in poverty and 25 in this category live in extreme poverty poverty is significantly higher among indigenous people 76 of whom are poor in contrast to 41 of nonindigenous people guatemalas gdp for 2001 was 22 billion gdp growth rate was 33 in 2000 21 in 2001 and 23 in 2002 low worldwide coffee prices contributed to guatemalas slowed growth over the last couple of years despite the downturn in commodity prices traditional exports such as coffee and sugar continue to lead guatemalas economic growth over the last decade nontraditional exports such as assembled clothing winter fruits and vegetables furniture and cut flowers have grown dramatically tourism also has grown though continued growth may depend on the governments ability to address security issues problems limiting growth include illiteracy and low levels of education high crime rates and an inadequate capital market the 36year civil war generated social and economic costs economic growth rates did not fall until the height of the conflict in the 1980s but cumulatively from 1960 to 1996 the war entailed significant loss of life jobs and productivity and caused disruption especially in the hardhit rural areas guatemalas social indicators continue to be among the worst in the hemisphere its malnutrition rates are among the worst in the world its infant mortality rate is 43 per 1000 live births and its under5 mortality rate is 58 per 1000 children10 guatemalas illiteracy rate is extremely high at 31 only nicaragua and haiti have worse levels in latin america and the caribbean the average level of schooling is an extremely low 43 years among the poor it is less than two years schooling is lowest among women indigenous people and the rural poor as result of malnutrition 44 of children under five years of age have stunted growth drought and low coffee prices triggered rural economic crisis beginning in 2001 which has caused severe malnutrition among the rural poor 9 the difference in the figures is probably due to methodology 10 guatemala country profile the world bank group august 2003 crs6 throughout the peace accords there are provisions seeking to reverse the historical exclusion of indigenous peoples and women in signing them the guatemalan government agreed to implement more inclusive development strategy it also agreed to increase investment of the national budget in education health and other social sectors in order to create more equitable distribution of wealth reduce poverty improve living conditions of the poor and increase access to education health and other social services implementation of the elements of the peace accords relating to improving the living conditions and the rights of indigenous people and women are far behind schedule however access to education according to the interamerican commission on human rights is still far from becoming reality the portillo administration outlined poverty reduction strategy in 2002 addressing most of those issues minugua reported in 2003 that there were slight improvements in social spending in the national budget over the previous year but that the amounts allocated to key social ministries remained extremely low in relation to the needs of the country the indigenous population and women continue to face limited opportunities and discrimination in the labor market according to the world banks poverty assessment the indigenous appear limited to lowerpaying jobs primarily in agriculture which the report says is unlikely to serve as major vehicle for poverty reduction other obstacles hindering social and economic advancement among the indigenous poor which the report says the government still must address are higher malnutrition rates less coverage by basic utility services wage discrimination and discriminatory treatment by public officials and other service providers international donors and others have criticized guatemala for not increasing the tax base to the minimum target of 12 of gross domestic product gdp agreed upon in the peace accords at may 2003 meeting of the consultative group for guatemala donors told the guatemalan government it needed to increase its tax revenue decrease spending on the armed forces and increase social spending as mandated in the accords the consultative group is made up of over 20 donor countries and international organizations including the us canadian and japanese governments the world bank and the idb in its report prepared for that meeting minugua said the organized private sector shares the responsibility for inadequate social budgets because it systematically opposes efforts to increase taxes thereby limiting funding available for key social ministries and institutions of justice president berger says signing freetrade agreement with the united states is top priority and that he plans to stimulate the economy by encouraging private investment his campaign was supported by coffee and sugar producers and several members of his cabinet are from the business sector crs7 human rights guatemala endured 36year civil war which ended in 1996 with the signing of the accord for firm and lasting peace signed by thenpresident alvaro arzu 1996200011 and the guatemalan national revolutionary unity unidad revolucionaria nacional guatemalteca urng the peace accords incorporated 10 other previously negotiated agreements the first of which was the comprehensive agreement on human rights the latter was signed and became effective in 1994 the peace accords established historical clarification commission commonly referred to as the truth commission to investigate human rights violations and acts of violence that occurred during the armed conflict from 1960 to 1996 in its 1999 report guatemala memory of silence the commission reported that more than 200000 people died or disappeared because of the armed conflict and that over 80 of the victims were indigenous mayans the commission concluded that the systematic direction of criminal acts and human rights violations at the civilian mayan population amounted to genocide the commission attributed responsibility for 93 of the violations to agents of the state principally members of the army and said that the majority of human rights violations occurred with the knowledge or by order of the highest authorities of the state the commission concluded that although much of the states actions were taken in the name of counterinsurgency efforts the magnitude of the states repressive response was totally disproportionate to the military force of the insurgency and that the vast majority of the states victims were not guerrilla combatants but civilians 12 through that first peace accord in 1994 the comprehensive agreement on human rights guatemala requested mission to verify human rights and compliance with the commitments of that agreement the united nations verification mission in guatemala minugua was established in the country soon after and regularly issues reports and recommendations based on its findings in the fall of 2003 minugua was extended for another year it will now be supported by human rights commission which the guatemalan government approved in december 2003 on january 7 2004 guatemala and the agreed to establish an investigating committee on illegal security corps and clandestine organizations an agreement endorsed by thenpresidentelect berger guatemalas legal obligations regarding human rights guatemalas commitment to respect human rights is spelled out in various internal laws and international accords to which it is party the 1996 peace accords included the comprehensive agreement on human rights which was the only agreement to go into effect when it was signed in 1994 rather than when the 11 arzu was elected mayor of guatemala city the nations capital in the november 2003 elections he held the post prior to becoming president in 1996 he is member of the opposition party pan 12 commission for historical clarification guatemala memory of silence conclusions and recommendations at httpshraaasorgguatemalacehreportenglishtochtml crs8 final peace accord was signed in the human rights agreement the government of guatemala committed to protect the full observance of human rights to strengthen institutions for the protection of human rights to take firm action against impunity in respect to human rights violations to ensure there are illegal security forces or clandestine security apparatus and to regulate the bearing of arms13 in the guatemalan national constitution adopted in 1985 title i states that it is the states duty to guarantee to its inhabitants life liberty justice security peace and the integral development of the person title ii covers human rights this section establishes basic civil and political rights including the right to life liberty and equality and due process of the law it also establishes the principle that in the area of human rights international treaties and conventions ratified by guatemala have precedence over municipal law14 the law of amparo habeus corpus and constitutionality seeks to ensure adequate protection of human rights and the effective functioning of the guarantees and protections of the constitutional order15 guatemala is member state of the organization of american states within that system guatemalas obligations to respect human rights stem from the oas charter the american declaration of the rights and duties of man and the american convention on human rights which guatemala ratified in 1978 guatemala accepted the jurisdiction of the interamerican court in 1987 guatemala is also party to other regional human rights agreements such as the interamerican convention to prevent and punish torture and the interamerican convention on the prevention punishment and eradication of violence against women international obligations stem from the universal declaration of human rights and conventions such as the covenant on economic social and cultural rights guatemalan government actions to promote respect for human rights analysts agree that from the signing of the human rights agreement in 1994 through mid1998 respect for human rights improved steadily since then however the and other groups have reported deterioration in human rights conditions with sharp increase in human rights violations as the november 2003 elections approached on the positive side observers point out that the armed conflict is definitively ended and the state policy of human rights abuses during that conflict has been terminated sectors of society previously excluded from political processes have been able to participate institutional reforms have been initiated on the other hand all of these processes remain to be deepened and consolidated in the view of 13 general assembly security council doc a48928 s1994448 letter dated 8 april 1994 from the secretarygeneral to the president of the

ch i p4 crs9 many strengthening of civilian power over military forces is progressing slowly or not at all security forces reportedly continue to commit gross violations of human rights with impunity and civilian defense patrols pacs which were responsible for many human rights violations during the civil conflict have reemerged an important policy change made first by president arzu and continued by president portillo was to acknowledge the human rights violations committed by the state and the deficiencies in the state allowing those violations to occur both administrations also committed to taking action to correct those deficiencies in order to improve human rights conditions upon taking office in january 2000 president portillo embraced the peace accords and declared them to be state policy for his administration he has also acknowledged the state role in prominent human rights cases that have come up since he took office according to the interamerican commission on human rights the guatemalan state acknowledges that the systems for public security and the administration of justice are gravely deficient among the problems identified by the state itself are abusive and arbitrary action by the police forces the lack of institutional capacity to investigate and prosecute crime especially when committed by state agents and serious deficiencies in due process and the administration of justice16 the portillo administration ratified international human rights instruments such as the additional protocol to the american convention on human rights in the area of economic social and cultural rights known as the protocol of san salvador in october 2000 the portillo administration was praised by both the interamerican commission on human rights iachr and the verification mission in guatemala for its positive approach in dealing with human rights cases before the iachr in cases addressed during his term portillos administration recognized the states institutional responsibility for the specified human rights violations said it would undertake to comply with the iachrs recommendations and that it would pursue the friendly settlement of these and other cases nonetheless minugua qualified its praise with the observation that these significant initiatives have not had any substantive impact on the overall enjoyment of human rights in the populations daily life17 upon taking office in january 2004 president berger said he would adhere strictly to the peace accords and appointed several people who have played important roles in negotiating or promoting the accords his vicepresident eduardo stein was the governments lead negotiator in 1996 his top advisor on security policy is retired general otto perez who signed the peace accords on behalf of the army berger appointed indigenous leader rigoberta menchu winner of the 1992 nobel peace prize as goodwill ambassador to the accords to help oversee their implementation 16 iachr opcit p 1 17 verification mission in guatemala minugua report of the united nations verification mission in guatemala minugua for the consultative group meeting for guatemala guatemala jan 18 2002 p5 crs10 current human rights conditions the united nations verification mission in guatemala the oas inter american commission on human rights and the us department of state all have expressed concern that government actions have not matched its repeated pledges and that the government of guatemala has taken only limited steps to improve respect for human rights within the country human rights conditions improved for the first year and half following the signing of the peace accords but several human rights organizations have reported worsening of conditions since then an evaluation of the overall human rights situation in guatemala must take account of the end of the internal armed conflict and the end of institutional policies that violate human rights which have brought qualitative and quantitative improvement however it should also be borne in mind that there has been significant polarization in the internal political debate under the portillo government and at the same time there have been isolated specific cases of limited duration of constitutional rights being suspended although they did not result in any irreversible deterioration in the enjoyment of civil rightsthe steady progression of significant improvements in the human rights situation from 1994 until mid1998 has given way to stagnation and signs of deterioration18 in their discussion of worsening human rights conditions human rights groups have pointed out several areas of concern19 failure to adhere to implementation timetable according to the timetable originally agreed upon to implement the peace accords many government actions were to have taken place by 2000 these pending commitments were rescheduled to occur between 2001 and 2004 the consultative group for guatemala which comprises foreign donor countries and international institutions that have supported guatemalas peace process called on the portillo administration to reinvigorate the peace process in february 2002 year later however the characterized implementation of the accords as disappointing in report to the consultative group noting that advances made were modest in comparison to the vast backlog in the accords implementation and that the very breadth and complexity of the peace commitments demands high levels of political will and management capacity on the part of the government 18 ibid pp45 19 these

strengthening of civilian power some progress in demilitarizing the country and strengthening civilian power has been made such as disbanding the mayor presidencial or presidential guard unit known for its human rights abuses and closing outdated military installations failure to demilitarize the state remains serious problem however minugua reported in 2003 that thenpresident portillo violated the spirit of the peace accords which call for demilitarization of the police by expanding the role of the army in law enforcement functions and other areas of government rather than separating the functions of the army and of the national civil police the national civilian police academys budget was reduced further weakening the force excesses in the military budget and the lack of budget transparency are reported as persistent problems under the accords funds were to be directed away from the military and into the underfunded health education and police sectors the government met the target for reduction of the military budget in 1997 and 1998 but beginning in 1999 the military budget began to exceed the ceiling of 066 of gdp set by the peace accords in 2001 the portillo administration carried out extraordinary supplemental transfers to the defense ministry raising the budget to 094 of gdp and increasing the allocation originally approved by the guatemalan congress by 85 in 2002 two supplemental transfers again increased the armys budget above the targets established in the peace accords minugua warned that this increased military spending was siphoning funds that should be used for social spending in the 1994 human rights agreement the government committed to ensuring that there are illegal security forces or clandestine security apparati president portillo promised to dismantle these structures which interfere with the administration of justice within six months of taking office but failed to do so by the end of his term he cooperated in mid2003 however with the in forming commission to investigate these parallel clandestine structures although the portillo administration complied with another part of the accords by presenting new defense policy important elements of it have not yet been implemented for example tangible progress has been made in creating civilian intelligence system to regulate or supervise intelligence agencies other observers expressed concern about the renewed prominence of retired general efrain rios montt as reflection of the ongoing difficulty in asserting civilian power over the military and in addressing military impunity for past human rights violations see discussion of rios montt in november 2003 elections above rios montt exerted considerable influence in gaining the right to run for president but was soundly defeated in the 2003 elections president berger has avoided saying whether he will allow legal proceedings for crimes against humanity to proceed against rios montt two of the people appointed to his administration frank larue as head of the presidential human rights commission and rigoberta menchu have sought prosecution of rios montt continued impunity for human rights violations minugua has identified impunity or failure to prosecute abusers as the main obstacle to the effective enjoyment of human rights since it began reporting in 1994 and in its report issued in january 2002 notes with profound concern that it is an entrenched crs12 phenomenon the main factors said to contribute to this continued impunity are an ineffective administration of justice and failure of the government to investigate and punish human rights offenders although the government attained convictions in few important human rights cases most human rights cases were not investigated for long periods of time or experienced lengthy delays in the ineffective judicial process high level officials have allegedly covered up or obstructed efforts to investigate human rights violations advances made in addressing impunity were often reversed for example three military officers were convicted in 2001 of the murder of bishop juan jose gerardi who headed the archbishops human rights office and was murdered in 1998 two days after the churchs critical recuperation of the historical memory report on past human rights violations was issued their 30year noncommutable sentences were annulled however and retrial ordered by an appeals court in 2002 the judicial process used to reach that decision was challenged and the supreme court ruled in 2003 that the appeals court must re examine the appeals continued gross violations of human rights by security forces guatemalan security forces continued to commit serious human rights violations in 2002 including extrajudicial killings and torture according to the state department human rights report for that year from 2001 to 2002 there was reported increase in attempted lynchings some with the participation of local leaders former civil defense patrol members or at an increased rate municipal officials the number of deaths from lynchings decreased according to the state department due to the improved efforts of the police to intervene continued existence of clandestine security units both the iachr and minugua express concern over consistent reports that clandestine and illegal security units and structures continue to exist and have participated in acts of intimidation and lynchings united nations team began helping guatemala create commission of investigation into illegal groups and clandestine security apparatuses ciciacs in july 2003 the commission has been endorsed by the government the human rights ombudsman and civil society groups in guatemala under an agreement signed in january 2004 the will appoint the commission which will investigate arrest and prosecute people linked to illegal and clandestine security organizations and suspected of human rights violations20 climate of intimidation various human rights observers have reported an increased climate of intimidation over the past two years human rights activists have been threatened and attacked although many of the threats have been against human rights activists judicial officials trial witnesses journalists and labor organizers have also been targets of intimidation according to the state department parallel investigations the obstruction of justice threats and intimidation were traced to groups related to the guatemalan government revival of civilian defense patrols according to the guatemalan

of income and wealth remains highly skewed in guatemala according to recent world bank report guatemala ranks among the more unequal countries of the world with the top fifth of the population accounting for 54 of total consumption indigenous people constitute close to half the population but account for less than onefourth of total income and consumption the peace accords call for investment of the national budget into education health and other social sectors in order to create more equitable distribution of wealth reduce poverty and improve socioeconomic conditions estimates of the portion of guatemalas population living in poverty vary the us state department reports that 80 of guatemalans live in poverty with twothirds of that number living in extreme poverty the world

economically and socially marginalized and subject to significant ethnic discrimination poverty is significantly higher among indigenous people 76 of whom are poor in contrast to 41 of non indigenous

becoming reality the average level of schooling among the poor is less than two years schooling is lowest among women indigenous people and the rural poor the indigenous and women continue to face limited opportunities and discrimination in the labor market according to the world banks poverty assessment the indigenous appear limited to lowerpaying jobs primarily in agriculture which the report says isunlikely to serve as major vehicle for poverty reduction other obstacles hindering social and economic advancement among the indigenous poor which the report says the government still must address are higher malnutrition rates less coverage by basic utility services wage discrimination and discriminatory treatment by public officials and other service providers relations with the united states us policy objectives in guatemala include strengthening democratic institutions and implementation of the peace accords encouraging respect for human rights and the rule of law supporting broadbased economic growth sustainable development and mutually beneficial trade relations combating drug trafficking and supporting central american integration through resolution of territorial

democraticallyelected government in 1986 to 1990 congress placed conditions related to democratization and improved respect for human rights on military assistance to guatemala and prohibited the purchase of weapons with us funds in 1990 the george h bush administration suspended military aid because of concerns over human rights abuses allegedly committed by guatemalan security forces especially the murder of us citizen congress has continued to prohibit foreign military financing to guatemala since then although it has allowed international military education and training imet assistance currently congress allows guatemala only expanded imet which is training for civilian personnel in defense matters and requires notification to the appropriations committees prior to allotment the berger administration has lobbied washington to ease the military aid prohibition noting that within its first six months in office it had reduced the size of the military by half and developed proposals for other military reforms the government says it needs funds to modernize the military and provide equipment for border protection and counternarcotics efforts while applauding the reduction in forces some human rights groups say that other reforms required by the peace accords such as adopting military doctrine limiting the military to external defense have not yet been enacted they also express concern about continued human rights abuses impunity for such offenses and corruption among current and former military officials furthermore the proposed commission for the investigation of illegal armed groups and clandestine security organizations ciciacs has still not been formed ciciacs which would investigate and prosecute clandestine groups through which many military officers allegedly engage in human rights violations drug trafficking and organized crime was approved by the portillo administration and has yet to be approved by the guatemalan congress some human rights groups argue that the us ban on military aid should not be lifted crs16 until these and other reforms are carried out and others not until reparations are made to civilian victims of the armed conflict24 us trade and investment guatemala and the united states signed framework agreement on trade and investment in 1991 through which they established bilateral trade and investment council the signing of the guatemalan peace accords in 1996 removed major obstacle to foreign investment there guatemala was certified to receive export trade benefits in 2000 under the caribbean basin trade and partnership act pl106200 title ii which gives preferential tariff treatment and also benefits from access to the us generalized system of preferences the united states is guatemalas

trade representative 2003 national trade estimate report on foreign trade barriers guatemala p 140 crs17 some supporters of drcafta argue that the agreement will help farmers especially those who grow nontraditional crops not grown in the united states they also argue that it will help slow migration to the united states of central american farm laborers seeking work even the central american governments expressed fear however that small subsistence farmers will be unable to compete against subsidized and therefore lowerpriced us commodities they wanted to negotiate the elimination of us farm subsidies as part of cafta talks but acquiesced to the us position that the issue should be addressed in the world trade organization others express concern that if small farms producing basic foods fail due to competition from us imports already high malnutrition and unemployment rates will rise even further27 they argue that staple crops such as corn rice and beans should therefore be excluded from trade agreements the central american governments agreed to include all of these staple food crops in the concluded agreement however the agreement establishes quotas on sensitive agricultural commodities imported from the us that will increase over time by the year 2020 most quotas and tariffs will be eliminated white corn however will receive some protection in perpetuity although quota on us white corn imports will increase annually the high tariffs on white corn imports above the quota level will remain in place indefinitely some us industries have also criticized the trade agreement us sugar growers argue that including sugar in drcafta will harm the domestic industry and say that they will work to defeat drcafta28 guatemala wanted the quota for sugar to be expanded under cafta as concluded the agreement establishes an additional quota of 32000 metric tons for guatemala onethird of the additional access granted to the five central american countries for sugar exported to the united states because certain benefits for the textile industry in guatemala would become permanent under drcafta some us producers have objected to it saying it will harm their businesses supporters of drcafta say it will generate new jobs some members of congress have expressed concern however that labor rights are inadequately protected by the agreement legally guatemalans right to freedom of association and to form and join trade unions are protected by the constitution and the labor code practically however those rights are inadequately protected by the government according to the state departments 2003 human rights report critics argue that the labor provisions under drcafta are less stringent than those currently in place under us preferential trade arrangements under drcafta argue critics such as the aflcio governments would only be required to enforce their existing flawed laws but not to reform laws to meet international labor standards advocates of drcafta argue that accompanying technical cooperation programs will help improve the enforcement of labor laws in the region while acknowledging the importance of such technical assistance the aflcio maintains 27 trade and the rural sector in fair trade or free trade understanding cafta an educational briefing packet washington office on latin america 28 for further

increasing the effectiveness of all usgovt programs in guatemala recent world bank report listed guatemala as one of nine countries that regulate businesses the most heavily the report concluded that
