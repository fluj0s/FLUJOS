defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31120peacekeeping military command and control issues summary coalition warfare and the leadership of foreign commanders has played part in us history since the war for independence when the commander of the troops of the predecessor colonies george washington entrusted key mission and command of 2000 continental soldiers to french major general the marquis lafayette since 1900 there have been at least seventeen military operations in which the united states has placed us troops under foreign commander as of november 1 2001 some 6515 us troops serve under french general in the nato kosovo force kfor some 865 troops also serve in the multinational force in the sinai mfo an ad hoc coalition under canadian commander as of august 31 2001 the united states had 43 us troops serving under commanders from various nations in seven operations during the last decade some members of congress have expressed concern about the placement of us troops under foreign commander in general this concern has centered on such placement in operations until the end of the cold war us support for operations had been generall limited to air lift even though congress in 1949 had granted the president the authority to detail up to 1000 personnel in noncombatant capacity for peacekeeping activities but controversy arose in the early 1990s when the united states began to place us troops under commanders since then members of congress have made various legislative attempts to restrict the placement of us troops under command the first in 1995 was included in the contract for america legislation which passed the house hr 7 but not the senate the second was contained in the fy1996 dod authorization bill vetoed by president clinton hr 1530 in part due to this provision congress deleted the provision from the version that became law and since then has not passed such restriction although troops from other nations have served under us commanders some members of congress are troubled by several issues raised by ceding even some level of control over us troops to foreign commanders these revolve around questions about whether placing us soldiers under foreign commander in any way impinges on us sovereignty and whether us troops face greater danger under foreign commander those who favor such placement put forth various procedures and arrangements that are taken to avoid such problems for instance us troops are placed under foreign commander only for specified time and specific mission the foreign commande rs authority over us troops is limited to the authority necessary to organize coordinate and direct the missionrelated tasks of those units provided to him in order to accomplish the assigned mission in addition variety of safeguards are recognized as needed to protect us troops many of which were spelled out in former president william clintons presidential decision directive pdd 25 of may 1994 in particular the united states participates actively in the policymaking bodies that oversee the military operation seeks the clear delineation of operational missions in governing agreements and limits the authority of foreign commandershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31120contents introduction 1 definition of command and control 2 presidents constitutional and statutory authorities 2 historical precedents and issues in

however nations often combine their forces in common effort the national military strategy of the united states has long recognized the value of allies and coalition warfare success on the battlefield may depend on unified command and control system with one senior officer in charge the united states has often been in leadership position and provided the senior commander desert storm is recent example sometimes however other countries have led coalitions and us forces have been placed temporarily under foreign commanders congressional concerns have centered primarily around the united nations role in command of us forces concerns are less evident with nato officers with whom the united states has longstanding ties and training experience more so with those outside this longstanding alliance until the united states began to place us troops under commanders with the expansion of peacekeeping operations in the early 1990s there were few complaints that the united states had suffered loss of control over its forces or compromise of its sovereign will since 1995 with house passage of the contract for america legislation hr 7 members have made number of attempts to prohibit or limit the placement of us troops under command hr 7 was referred to the senate but not reported out of committee also in 1995 congress included restrictions on such placement in fy1996 dod authorization bill hr 1530 this bill was vetoed by president clinton for variety of reasons among them this provision which was cited as an infringement on the presidents constitutional authority as commander in chief congress deleted the provisions from its subsequent version of the fy1996 dod authorization bill which was signed by the president since then congress has not approved any restrictions on dod funding regarding the participation of us troops in peacekeeping operations some members of congress remain concerned about this issue in the 107th congress the american sovereignty restoration act of 2001 hr 1146 introduced by rep paul would among other actions withdraw the united states from the united nations and prohibit the use of funds for the participation of any member of the us armed forces in peacekeeping operation or force httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31120crs2 1 us department of defense dictionary of military and associated terms jcs pub 102 1 december 1989 washington pp 77 and 262263 also see jcs pub 02 and title 10 usc chapter 6 section 164definition of command and control the term command has several applications the power of command usually given to the leader of multinational force is called operational control or operational command in nato1 for specified time and specified mission the designated leader has authority to organize coordinate and direct the missionrelated tasks of those units provided to him in order to accomplis h given mission this leader cannot interfere with their internal activities or many other command functions normally retained within national military structures thus he cannot separate units divide their supplies administer discipline promote anyone or change their internal organization typically this type of command arrangement has raised limited concern about loss of national control or compromise of sovereignty the broadest command includes the total range of responsibilities exercised by the national command authority the president and the secretary of defense over its units and soldiers besides operational activities full command includes logistics training and all aspects of personnel discipline morale and welfare in the us case this command ultimately resides with the president as commanderinchief and much is nontransferable from the highest echelons of dod although some logistics and training responsi bilities could be shared by agreement another nation would be reluctant to assume responsibility for pay promotions courts martial individual assignments replacements and longterm medical care even if they could us soldiers serving in multinational commands always retain their ultimate allegiance to the united states of america they wear their national uniforms and insignia and oaths are given to other powers or organizations they may however also wear other missionspecific insignia and headgear for instance in operations us troops may wear patch and blue beret in order to identify clearly their role and status in possibly ambiguous situation presidents constitutional and statutory authorities article 2 of the us constitution designates the president as commander in chief although specific duties are not delineated it is traditionally assumed that the president may organize for military operations to include approving command arrangements as he sees fit congress has however made two laws to govern some recurring noncombat uses of us military forces within international entities as noted below since 1949 the president has held standing authority under section 7 of the participation act pl 79264 to detail up to 1000 personnel in non combatant capacity at one time for peacekeeping activities besides outlining fiscal and logistical arrangements the law states that while so detailed such personnel shall be considered for all purposes as acting in the line of duty includinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31120crs3 2 pl 79264 59 stat 619 approved december 20 1945 as amended by pl 81341 approved october 10 1949 3 section 628 of the foreign assistance act of 1961 pl 87195 as amended 22 usc 2388 the receipt of pay and allowances as personnel of the armed forces of the united states2 the administration also can and has detailed specialized military personnel to international units under the authority of section 628 of the foreign assistance act of 1961 pl 87195 as amended section 628 provides that whenever the president determines that it serves us foreign policy interests any officer or employee of any us government agency can be made available to any international organization to serve with or as member of the international staff of such organization or to render any technical scientific or professional advice or service to or in cooperation with such organization3 historical precedents and issues in ceding control to foreign commanders us military history provides many precedents for placing troops temporarily under foreign commanders the precedents date back to the united states colonial history when general george washington entrusted key mission to french major general the marquis lafayette and appointed him as commander over 2000 continental soldiers rebelling against the british crown during world war i some 2 million us soldiers served under the coordination of the french commanderin chief of the allied armies in france during world war ii us units served under british commanders in several areas during the cold war period there were few instances of us military personnel serving under foreign commanders in multinational operations mostly in ad hoc coalitions as the united states usually provided only air lift and supplies to operations during the 1991 desert storm campaign in the persian gulf us brigade was placed under operational control of french commander for more information on these and other instances of such placements see appendix which details such instances from 1900 till the present in the balkans us troops serve under commanders from nato nations who rotate every six months as of november 1 2001 some 6515 us troops are serving under french general in the nato kosovo force kfor in bosnia some 3132 us troops in natos stabilization force sfor are serving under the american general who commands that operation lt general john b sylvester some 865 us troops also serve in the multinational force in the sinai mfo an ad hoc coalition under commander from canada as of august 31 2001 the united states had 43 us troops serving under commanders from various nations in seven operations the placement of us troops under foreign comman ders only became controversial in the 1990s when the us involvement in multilateral peacekeepinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31120crs4 4 responding to questions whether us troops are able to refuse to obey or question what they continuedoperations became more frequent of particular concern was the placement of troops in two peacekeeping operations under commanders from countries other than longstanding us military allies another concern has been the cumulative effect of such placements with the commitment of significant number of troops to nato operations since that time the issue of placing us troops under foreign command often has been posed as symbolic one reflecting larger issues about us leadership in the world and concerns about whether the united states cedes any degree of sovereignty when it participates in collective security mechanisms the pragmatic question also persists whether the united states should trust its citizens lives to the judgment of foreign officers particularly in those from countries whose military standards may be questioned to most officials and analysts substantial injury to the sovereignty of the united states control over or longterm effectiveness of the us armed forces appear evident most such arrangements have balanced the military advantages of clear chain of command and greater mass on the battlefield with the political need to recogniz the national pride and competence of sovereign allies some however were not particularly successful and all had difficulties that provide future cautions still some members and military officers are reluctant to relinquish any authority to foreign officers whose judgment may differ from that of us officer military analysts note that training and cultural differences may create differences in approach and style thus foreign officers might put us troops at risk where us officers would not some also note that cultural and language difficulties can make combined operations too cumbersome for the quick responses needed in the more difficult peace enforcement operations some analysts also point out that decisions on the use of us soldiers in peacekeeping missions involve different criteria than the use of soldiers of other countries when us soldiers are involved the prestige of the worlds sole superpower is on the line although in some circumstances this could confer greater authorit in others it might make us soldiers more tempting targets particularly in conflictive peacekeeping missions it also may complicate the response of us soldiers for instance where soldier from another country would be praised for negotiating his units way through roadblock us soldier must consider whether that would make it appear that the us could be intimidated and was backing down practical consideration s and standard arrangements are cited to counter these objections most importantly the united states takes precautions that us troops serve under respected foreign officers and that us officers are positioned to look after us troops us officials have virtual veto power over the selection of top commanders for operations in which us troops participate in addition commanders of us military units participating in multilateral operations will monitor the actions and orders of foreign commanders and question them if necessary4 thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31120crs5 4 continued may regard as illegal or unwise orders from foreign commanders the clinton administrations presidential decision directive 25 pdd25 states that commanders of us military units participating in operations can report separately to higher us military authorities and will refer to higher us authorities orders that are illegal under us or international law or outside the mandate of the mission to which the us agreed with the ununited states also reserves the right to take any action necessary to protect us forces in addition military analysts note that under us and international law soldiers are obliged to refuse illegal orders the temporary nature of operational command and control arrangements ensures that participatin g subunits retain national characteristics and allegiances even in relatively permanent multinational formations such as the mfo in the sinai and natos standing naval force atlantic us units rotate every six to 12 months although us brigades and divisions are assigned to nato multinational corps for exercises and operations the bulk of their time is spent within their permanent us chains of command the michael new challenge challenge was raised to the constitutional authority of the president as commanderinchief to enter into multinational command arrangements and to the practice of placing us troops under foreign commanders until 1996 that year us army specialist michael g new challenged his january 1996 courtmartial and badconduct discharge which was upheld by his commanding general in june 1996 new who refused to obey an order to wear the designated patch and blue beret when his unit was assigned to the preventive deployment force in macedonia argued that he owes allegiance to the united states not to the that the insignia are not authorized that the chain of command was not constitutional and that the operation was not legal new has appealed his case to several appeals fora which either have refused to reconsider the case or have upheld the initial decision in march 1996 the us district court of the district of columbia rejected news civil suit of habeas corpus challenging the courtmartials finding and sentence in november 1997 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit upheld the district courts dismissal on the grounds that civilian courts must await the final outcome of military court proceedings on court martial before considering an action brought by service member the us army court of criminal appeals heard the case on may 28 1998 and affirmed the court martial in april 1999 on february 4 2000 new appealed the decision before the final military appeals venue the court of appeals of the armed forces which affirmed the us army court of criminal appeals decision on june 13 2001 on september 10 2001 news attorneys petitioned the us supreme court to review and overturn the military courts decisions on october 5 2001 the supreme court declined to hear the case according to news website httpwwwmikenewcom new is considering whether to take further actionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31120crs6 lessons for collective security actions occasional placements of us forces under foreign commanders within multinational commands for agreed purposes appear likely to continue in the future world war i established facto guideline for us forces that coalition integration only extends so far in fact during that war the united states attempted to retain total command at the highest or army level exigencies however often required us divisions to be under the tactical command of french and british corps commanders since then the united states has relinquished partial command at much lower echelons as noted above full command is never relinquished at the individual soldier level and all soldiers placed within multinational structure are commanded by us officer one duty of the us commander is to ensure his troops are linked to the us chain of command particularly for such essential responsibilities as pay and discipline the proper echelon ie the level of military organization for integrating us forces into multinational formation will probably continue to be major point of negotiation for combat larger national units are more selfsufficient and can be integrated more quickly and with fewer logistical problems than smaller units for conventional ground warfare the corps is currently the most comprehensive or independent element corps frequently take tactical command or control of divisions from allied nations multinational corps are rapidly becoming the norm for nato since corps and divisions are large expensive formations future multinational operations may well depending on the mission integrate at lower levels particularly for specialized and supporting units potential safeguards to acknowledge and protect the sovereign control of those forces are suggested by precedent practice and law many now are spelled out in the clinton administrations presidential decision directive 25 pdd25 these include participating actively in the policy making bodies that oversee the military operation eg security council clearly delineating operational mission in governing agreements limiting foreign command authority to operational command operational control tactical control or similar formulation ensuring the temporary nature of personal involvement by rotation of us units or individuals even though the national commitment may be to longterm support of standing multinational force providing active support and oversight through permanent command chain for those us units and individuals committed to multinational operations to usually include the regional us commanderinchief
