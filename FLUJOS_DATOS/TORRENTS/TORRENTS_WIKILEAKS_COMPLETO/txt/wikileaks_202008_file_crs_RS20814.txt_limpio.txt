occur when senator or representative dies resigns declines to serve or is expelled or excluded by either house the constitution requires that vacancies in both houses be filled by special election but in the case of the senate it empowers the state legislatures to provide for temporary appointments to the senate by the governor until special elections can be scheduled1 senate prevailing practice for senate vacancies is for state governors to fill them by appointment with the appointee serving until special election can be held the winner of the special election then serves for the balance of the term in the event the seat becomes vacant between the time of statewide election and the expiration of the term the appointee usually serves the remainder of the term oregon and wisconsin are the only states that do not provide for gubernatorial appointments their senate vacancies can only be filled by election house of representatives all house vacancies are filled by special election scheduling for special elections is largely dependent on the amount of time remaining 1 for house vacancies see us constitution article i section 2 clause 4 and 2 usc8 for senate vacancies see us constitution article i section 3 and amendment 17 paragraph 2 congressional research service the library of congress crs2 before the next regular elections for the house when vacancy occurs during the
