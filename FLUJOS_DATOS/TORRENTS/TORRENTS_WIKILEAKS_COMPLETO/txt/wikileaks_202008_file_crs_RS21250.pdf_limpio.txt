it in santa fe independent school district v doe 530 us 290 2000morning and that the federal and state statutes violated the establishment clause of the first amendment4 the trial court decision on july 21 2000 the federal district court for the eastern district of california held the incl usion of the phrase under god in the pledge not to violate the establishment clause on the grounds the phrase does not convey endorsement of particular relig ious beliefs5 the court noted that the supreme court has not ruled on the issue but it found persuasiv decision by the us court of appeals for the seventh circuit in sherman v community consolidated school district 216 upholding state statute mandating the daily r ecitation of the pledge in the public schools the court stated that under both th tripartite test set forth in lemon v kurtzman7 and the endorsement test8 the pledge does not violate the establishment clause of the first amendment the ninth circuits initial decision newdow i on june 26 2002 panel of the us court of appeals fo r the ninth circuit reversed 219 the majority judges goodwin and reinhardt held both the 1954 federal statute nd the school district policy to violate

endorsement of religious belief because it aims to inculcate in students respect for the ideals set forth in the pledge12 the act and the policy also violate the coercion test the majority stated both it stated place students in the untenable position of choosing betw een participating in an exer cise with religious content or protesting and that it held is constitutionally impermissible the coercive effect was exacerbated it said given the age and impre ssionability of eleme ntary schoolchildren and their understanding that they are required to adhere to the norms set by their school their teacher and their fellow students13 finally the court found the fe deral statute to violate th secular purpose criterion and the school policy to violate the primary effect criterion of the lemon test the legislative history of the federal statute the majority asserted reveals that the acts sole purpose was to advance religion in order to differe ntiate the united states from nations under communist rule the act was intended th court stated to take position on the question of theism namely to support the existence and moral authority of god while denying atheistic and materi alistic concepts such religious purpose the court concluded runs counter to the establishment clause14 the school policy regarding recitation of the pledge in c ontrast the court found to have been adopted for the secular purpose of fostering patriotism but it failed the lemon tests prohibition on governmental advancement of religion the c ourt stated because it was highly likely to convey an impermissible message of endorsement to some and disapproval to others of their beliefs regarding the ex istence of monotheistic god15 reaction in the 107th congress the ninth circuits decision

on the latter petition 10 of the courts 24 judges voted to re hear the decision but that fell three short of the necessary majority however these 10 joined in two separate dissents setting forth their arguments in support of rehearing judg oscannlain joined by five other judges termed the panels decision in newdow i an exercise in judicial legerdemain and said it was wrong very wrong wrong because r eciting the pledge of allegiance is simply not religious act as the twojudge majority asserts wrong as matter of supreme court precedent properly understood wrong becau it set up direct conflict with the law of another circuit and wrong as matter of common sense public and political reaction have made clear he asserted that rec itation of the pledge is not religious act it is essentially patriotic act he stat ed and inclusion of re ligious reference does not change the nature of the act itself fo r that reason he said it is different from the formal religious exercises that the supreme court has struck down as unconstitutional in addition he claimed the panels decision contradict s our 200year history and tradition of patriotic refere nces to god and belies as well numerous statements by supreme court justices that the pledge is constitutional moreover he stated the panels expansive application of the coercion test is illsuited to society as diverse as ours since almost every cultural practice is bound to offend someones sensibilities although admitting that the panels reasoning does have some plausible basis in the case law of the supreme court he charge d that its decision adopts s tilted indifference to our past and present realities as predominantly religious people indeed he asserted it confers favored status on atheism in our public life revision of the

revision deleted the part that had held that the 1954 statute that added under god to the pledge was unconstitutional it reta ined only the part that held that the school district policy that mandate d daily teacherled recitation of the pledge violates the establishment clause the revi sion based the latter holding exclusively on the coercion test and eliminated the earlier decisions reliance on the lemon and endorsement tests the revisi on also asserted that the ruling is not inconsistent with supreme court dicta on the matter and that recitation of the pledge is different from reciting the declaration of independence or singing the national anthem both of which contain religious references the pledge the revision contende d is not merely reflection of the authors prof ession of faith but by desig n an affirmation of the person reciting it the revision also argued that the contrary ruling by the seventh circuit in sherman v community consolidated school district 2124 was flawed because it applied neither the lemon test nor the coercion test the revision concluded that the school districts policy and practice of teacherled recitation of the pledge with the inclusion of the added words under god violates the establishment clause judge fernandez refiled his original dissent on march 4 2003 the ninth circuit stayed the effect of its revised decision pending appeal of th

critiqued the revised decision stated that the recitation of the pledge is patriotic act rather than religious one and urged the supreme court to correct this constituti onally infirm and historically

school district and the united states asked the supreme court to hear the case and the court granted certiorari in the school districts appeal the questions presented in elk grove unified sc hool district v newdow were 1 whether newdow had standing to bring the constitutional challenge and 2 whether public school policy that requires teachers to lead willing students in reciting the pledge of allegiance which in cludes the words under god violates the establishment clause of the first amendment as applicable through the fourteenth amendment28 supreme courts decision on june 14 2004 the supreme court reversed the ninth circuits revised decision29 the court did not reverse based on the merits of the case but held that newdow lacked standing to challenge the school districts policy in federal court the court f ound that because newdow lacked the ability to sue as his daughters next friend under state law his ab ility to claim standing in this case based upon his parental status was questi onable the court determined that it was improper for the federal courts to entertain claim by pl aintiff whose standing to sue is founded on family law rights that are in dispute when prosecution of the lawsuit may have an adverse effect on the person who is the source of the plaintiffs claimed standing30 three justices concurred in the judgment revers ing the ninth circuits decision but did so because they found that the phrase under god did not violate the establishment clause subsequent case following the supreme cour ts decision newdow and two other sets of parents filed new challenge to the constitutionality of the federal statutes including the phrase under god and to four california public school districts requiring students to recite the pledge the united states district court for the eastern district of california held that the ninth circuits prior decision which had held that the recitation of the pledge in public school classrooms vi olates the establishment clause was binding on the district court despite the supreme courts later reversal of that decision31 the court found that the circuit c ourts decision was binding b ecause it had not been vacated by the supreme court but had been revers ed on procedural rather than substantive grounds although the district court denied standing to newdow himself it determined that the other plaintiffs had standing on their childrens beha lf and that the recitation of the pledge in the classroom amounted to an unconstitutional violation of the childrens right to be free from coercive requireme nt to affirm god in violation of the establishment clause32 because the court was willing to enter restraining order against the recitation of the pledge it found that the cons titutionality of the federal statute was moot question the district courts decision is currently on appeal to the ninth circuit
