nhouse gas ghg em issions would likely impact different states differently understanding these differences may provide for more informed debate regarding potential policy approaches however multiple factors play role in determining impacts including alternative design elements of ghg emissions reduction program the availability and relative cost of mitigation options and the regulated entities abilities to pass compliance costs on to consumers three primary variables drive states humanrelated ghg emission levels population per capita income and the ghg emissions intensity ghg emissions intensity is performance measure in this report ghg intensity is measure of ghg emissions from sources within state compared with states economic output g ross state product gsp the ghg emissions intensity driver stands apart as the main target for climate change mitigation policy because public policy generally considers population and income growth to be socially positive the intensity of carbon dioxide co 2 emissions largely determines overall ghg intensity because co 2 emissions account for 85 of the ghg emissions in the united states as 98 of us co 2 emissions are energyrelated the primary factors that shape co 2 emissions intensity are states energy intensity and the carbon content of its energy use energy intensity measures the amount of energy state uses to generate its overall economic output measured by its gsp several underlying factors may impact states energy intensity states economic structure personal transportation use in state measured in vehicle miles traveled per person and public policies regarding energy efficiency the carbon content of energy use in state is determined by states portfolio of energy sources states that utilize high percentage of coal for example will have relatively high carbon content of energy use compared to states with lower dependence on coal an additional factor is whether state is net exporter or importer of electricity because co 2 emissions are attributed to electricityproducing states but the electricity is used and counted in the consuming state between 1990 and 2000 the united states reduced its ghg intensity by 16 annually assuming that population and per capita income continue to grow as expected the united states would need to reduce its ghg intensity at the rate of 3 per year in order to halt the annual growth in ghg emissions therefore achieving reductions or negative growth in ghg emissions would necessitate further declines in ghg intensity

agreement in the scientific community that the earths climate is changing and that the primary cause over the past few decades is an increasing concentration of greenhouse gases ghgs in the atmosphere most climate scientists have concluded that human activities eg fossil fuel combustion land clearing and industrial and agricultural operationshave played central role in climate change particularly in recent decades1 variety of efforts that seek to address climate change are currently underway or being developed on the international national and subnational level eg individual state actions or regional partnerships these efforts cover wide spectrum from research initiatives to ghg emission reduction regimes2 if congress establishes federal program to manage or reduce ghg emissions the emission requirements would likely impact different states differently however predicting the different impacts of policies is complicated task because multiple factors play role such factors include alternative design elements of ghg emissions reduction program the availability and relative cost of mitigation options and the regulated entities abilities to pass compliance costs on to consumers underlying climate change policy discussions are ghg emissions and the factors that determine their levels and growth one of the primary factors is ghg emissions intensity in this report ghg emissions intensity is measure of ghg emissions from state sources divided by the states overall economic output or gross state product3 because carbon dioxide co 2 is the primary ghg in the vast majority of states the report focuses on co 2 emissions intensity and its determining factors these factors vary significantly across state lines an analysis of these factors and how they compare among the states may contribute to more informed debate regarding potential policy approaches 1 this report does not address the debates associated with climate change science or the role of human activity in climate change for discussion of these issues see crs report rl33849 climate change science and policy implications by jane leggett 2 see crs report rl33826 climate change the kyoto protocol bali action plan

crs report rl33812 climate change action by states to address greenhouse gas emissions by jonathan l ramseur 3 ghg emissions intensity is performance measure when looking at emissions on an economywide scale gross domestic product gdp or gross state product gsp is typically used however other economic outputs such as tons of steel or cement may be used to analyze the emissions intensity of specific sources or economic sectors higher ghg intensity value compared to other states indicates that state generates more emissions per economic output ie gsp than other states

income and ghg emissions intensitythe most relevant in terms of climate change policy is ghg intensity decreases in population andor per capita income would contribute to lowering states ghg emissions however growth in population and personal income is generally considered positive social outcome and policies that would seek to directly limit these emissions drivers are essentially outside the bounds of public policy ghg intensity is simple measure of ghg emissions per unit of output although most ghg reduction regimes address actual emissions 5 the national target in the united statesas announced by the bush administrationaims to reduce the ghg emissions intensity of the national economy in 2002 the bush administration set voluntary target of reducing the ratio of us ghg emissions to the us gross domestic product gdp by 18 by 2012 according to the administration meeting this target would reduce intensity beyond that of intensity reductions expected under businessasusual scenario ba sed on data available in 2002 ghg emissions intensity was projected to decline by 14 under businessasusual scenario critics of the administrations intensity target have pointed out that 1 the intensity target is more precisely quantified at 175 6 and 2 more recent data indicate that the us intensity declined by 162 between 1990 and 2002 thus some observers have described the effect of the intensity target as negligible7 intensity targets are sometimes viewed with skepticism because the intensity target proponents may imprecisely describe or overstate how reductions in emissions intensity would affect actual emission levels8 for example the administration has stated that meeting the us emissions intensity target would lead to ghg emission reductions9 arguably such description can be misleading because the reductions would occur within the context of increasing us emissions in other words us emissions would continue to increase but if the intensity target is met the emissions increase would be less than businessasusual moreover there is some uncertainty as to whether the reductions will be achieved at all the administrations projected reductions are based on gdp forecasts if the gdp increases at higher than projected rates absolute emissions can increase beyond businessasusual scenario while still meeting the intensity target although some have questioned the environmental efficacy of intensity targets ie their ability to lower ghgs the effectiveness of an emissions target depends primarily on its stringency not 5 for example the european unions emissions trading scheme and the kyoto protocol require actual emission reductions reduction programs under development at the state level also require actual reductions eg california and the regional greenhouse gas initiative 6 although the administrations supporting document uses 18 the document also states that the goal is to reduce intensity from 183 to 151 metric tons of carbon equivalent per million dollars of gross domestic product 175 reduction 7 see herzog timothy et 2006 target intensity an analysis of greenhouse gas intensity targets wri report pp1516 8 see pew center on global climate change analysis of president bushs climate change plan at httpwwwpewclimateorgpolicy_centeranalysesresponse_bushpolicycfm 9 the executive summary describing the intensity target states the presidents commitment will achieve 100 million metric tons of reduced emissions in 2012 alone with more than 500 million metric tons in cumulative savings over the entire decade see

heating degree days hdds and cooling degree days cdds 25 in the united states hdds outnumber cdds by factor of five to one thus states in colder climates generally have the most degree days an

intensity26 many of the states with low energy intensitieseg new york connecticut and massachusettsare among the top 25 states in terms of degree days in addition many of the states with few degree days are among the top 25 states in terms of energy intensity the lack of an overall correlation between degree days and energy intensity does not rule out the influence of climate climate may pl ay

use the electricity sector produces substantial portion of co 2 emissions in many states and is the highest emitting sector in the united states accounting for approximately 40 of us co 2 emissions electricity can be generated from variety of energy sources which vary significantly by their ratio of co 2 emissions per unit of energy coalfired power plant emits almost twice as much co 2 per unit of energy as natural gasfired facility27 some energy sourceseg hydropower28 nuclear wind or solardo not directly release any co 2 emissions although the transportation sector contributes significant

another important factor that affects states carbon content of energy use is whether the state is net importer or exporter of electricity states consume fuels eg coal natural gas etc to generate electricity but the electricity may be exported to and used in another state the method for accounting for these exchanges influences the level of states carbon content of energy use in the above carbon content of energy data table 7 if one state uses an energy source eg coal to generate electricity and then sells the electricity to consumer in second state the co 2 emissions are attributed to the generating state but the energy use is attributed to the consuming state 31 table 9 lists the states in which electricity exports accounted for high percentages of energy use likewise the table lists the states in which imported electricity accounted for high percentages of energy use the importexport factor is especially prominent for states with high carbon content levels the top four states for carbon content of energy use in 2003west virginia wyoming north dakota and montanaexported substantial portions of electricity in that year of the five states with low carbon content levels the importexport factor appears most relevant in idaho where imported electricity accounted for 41 of its total energy use in 2003 t able 9 states with high p er centages of expor ted and impor ted

energy data s ystem httpwwweiadoe gov emeu states_sedshtml some may argue that this characteristic of the data artificially inflates the carbon content of energy use in exporting states while artificially lowering the measure in states that import significant amount of electricity consider wyoming and idaho two states at opposite extremes of the carbon contents of energy use range two coalfired power plants located in wyoming are partially owned by electricity providers that serve customers in idaho idaho customers are receiving some amount of coalfired electricity from wyoming and oregon and nevada 32 this electricity is counted as energy use in idaho while the co 2 emissions are attributed to wyoming or oregon or nevada from another perspective the example is less critique of the carbon content of energy measure and more highlight of how electricity generation and use is measured there is system in place to physically track electricity upon generation therefore it is impossible to precisely attribute imported electricity to its energy source33 moreover exported electricity may come from energy sources other than coal states may export electricity generated from low or zero carbon energy sources such as hydropower or nuclear this factor adds another layer of complexity to the accounting as the above wyomingidaho example demonstrates rough approximations might be established based on ownership data but it may be difficult if not impossible to precisely assign the co 2 emissions from an exporting state to the importing state thus states that appear to be using lowcarbon energy sources may be importing highcarbon energy in the form of electricity

intensity and related underlying variables if congress were to enact federal ghg emissions reduction program these differences may lead to wide range of impacts in the states the range of impacts would depend on the logistics of the emissions reduction program and the ability of regulated entities to spread compliance costs 32 idaho power which serves customers in idaho is partial owner of

program would assign directly or indirectly cost to emissions of carbon or carbonequivalents in the case of some ghgs the stringency scope and design of the reduction regime would play large role in determining costs and how the costs are distributed for instance congress could include specific provisionseg safetyvalve or revenue recyclingthat would control costs or ease the burden on particular groups34 regardless of how congress might design ghg reduction program mandatory ghg reduction regime would affect states differently in particular the states different energy intensities and carbon content of energy use indicate the states would experience different effects states with relatively high levels of carbon content in their energy use table 7 would likely see higher energy prices these states typically use hi gh percentage of coal to generate electricity thus electricity prices would likely increase in these states35 the consumers responses to these price increases would help determine impacts consumers may choose to conserve energy use or switch to alternative sources the carbon price imposed by the emission reduction regime would provide incentives to switch from highcarbon to lowcarbon fuel eg from coal to natural gas however such switch may be limited by the technology and infrastructure existing in state particularly in the electricity generation sector conventional coalfired power plants in operation today which account for approximately 50 of all electricity generation cannot simply switch to another fuel source the producers of coalfired electricity may be able to pass along the additional carbon costs to consumers but some state regulations may hinder companys ability to include the additional costs in electricity prices differences in the states regulatory structures may influence which groups ultimately pay for the additional carbon costs in states with tighter regulatory control over prices power companies may bear relatively higher cost in other states consumers of electricity may bear higher percentage of the costs where companies are less constrained in passing costs along to customers in the form of higher prices depending on particular design elements of th emissions reduction program some of these potential disproportionate effects might be alleviated for example if producers are expected to pay higher percentage of the additional carbon costs some of the emission allowances might be provided for free if consumers are anticipated to pay higher proportionate cost the allowances could be auctioned the auctions revenues could be returned to consumers particularly to low income households which would be especially impacted by higher electricity bills as discussed above states importexport ratio of electricity may influence its carbon content of energy use or fuel mix this component adds further layer of complexity when assessing the potential impacts of carbon price for example depending on how emission allowances might be distributed under federal capandtrade system states that are net energy providers may receive financial gains at least in the shortterm for instance if power plants can pass along the mitigation costs of carbon reduction in higher electricity prices and receive their emission allowances for free often referred to as grandfathering the companies may benefit 34 for

entities eg coalfired power plants have been described as windfall profits and have been recently observed in the european unions emission trading system37 the gains would be temporary because under most capand trade proposals the cap decreases over time thus regulated entities would receive fewer allowances as the program progresses if congress enacts an emissions reduction program states with high levels of energy intensity are likely to face higher costs than states with low energy intensity levels as table 4 shows the high and low energy intensity levels can differ by factor of four which suggests that the impacts between the states at the ends of the spectrum could vary dramatically energy intensity levels are shaped by multiple factors some of these factors may be based on behavior or actions these factors may be altered through public policy for example states could initiate policies or support programs that seek to change the driving behavior ie vmt of its citizens other factorsespecially states ratio of high and low carbon intensive industriesare more structural and thus more difficult if not impractical to alter through public policy in addition depending on the degree to which states energy intensity is influenced by its climate newlyimposed carbon price may have greater impact in these states the demand for energy may be less elastic ie responsive to price changes than other states because energy is more critical for daily life necessities such as home heating lowincome citizens may face disproportionate burden as share of income of price increases in states with substantial heating andor cooling needs states with high energy intensity may have high percentage of carbonintensive industries eg manufacturing these industries would likely see an increase in their operational costs due to the new carbon price but they may be able to include the additional carbon costs in the price of their products eg paper cement steel thus spreading the costs to consumers in other states however passing along the carbon price to consumers may not be financially viable for producers the ability of producers to pass along the carbon price would be determined by the competitiveness of the market and consumers willingness to pay higher prices or forego purchases for particular good consumers may seek out product substitutes or lower cost suppliers which could include foreign producers not subject to domestic carbon price from another perspective higher levels in emissions drivers particularly the energy intensity variable may suggest state has comparatively more low hanging fruit or lowercost options to meet emission reduction requirements as noted bove the states with high energy intensities were also ranked poorly by aceees energy efficiency scorecard although these states energy intensity levels are primarily due to economic structure there may be room for improvement via regrets energy efficiency policieswithin the framework of their economic structure along these lines states that currently use substantial percentage of highcarbon fuels for energy purposes particularly for electricity generation may have more options in carbon constrained regime than states that are already utilizing high percentage of lowcarbon energy 36 in marketbased system eg capandtrade emission allowances can be used to comply with an individual companys cap or sold to other parties subject to the cap as such allowances are form of currency and would provide an infusion of funds 37 the vast majority of emissions allowances were distributed for free under the european program see national commission on energy policy 2007 allocating allowances in greenhouse gas trading system p11

reduce current emissions by set percentage states using highcarbon fuels may seek lowcarbon fuel substitutes but states using lowcarbon fuels would be limited in this regard this comparison does not suggest that switching to lowcarbon fuels will be easy or inexpensive but these states may have more ways to find emission reductions moreover lowcarbon fuel substitutes may not be distributed evenly across the states some states that currently use large proportions of highcarbon energy sources may be in better positionsin terms of natural resource endowments and geographythan other states looking for lowcarbon substitutes for example there is more wind energy potential in the western and midwestern states than in states in the southeast38 the above comparison also highlights the importance of selecting baseline year for an emission reduction program if emissions caps are compared to 1990 levels it would reward states for reductions made during the 1990s if the reduction programs baseline is 2000 for example the reductions made before that year would not count and these states may have more difficulty finding lowercost options

establish nation wide ghg reduction program any emissions reduction regime would necessitate declines in ghg intensity the declines needed would depend on the level of absolute reductions mandated by
