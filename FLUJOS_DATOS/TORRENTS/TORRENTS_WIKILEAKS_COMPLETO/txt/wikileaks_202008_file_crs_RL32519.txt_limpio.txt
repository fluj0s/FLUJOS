the us government must attack terrorists and their organizations by identifying and prioritizing actual or potential sanctuaries for terrorists and have realistic strategy to keep possible terrorists insecure and on the run using all elements of national power the us should reach out listen to and work with other countries that can help in this regard the united states should be willing to make the difficult longterm commitment to the future of pakistan sustaining the current scale of aid to pakistan the united states should support pakistans government in its struggle against extremists with comprehensive effort that extends from military aid to support for better education so long as pakistans leaders remain willing to make difficult choices of their own the united states and the international community should make longterm commitment to secure and stable afghanistan in order to give the government reasonable opportunity to improve the life of the afghan people afghanistan must not again become sanctuary for international crime and terrorism the united states and the international community should help the afghan government extend its authority over the country with strategy and nationby nation commitments to achieve their objectives the problems in the ussaudi relationship must be confronted openly the united states and saudi arabia must determine if they can build relationship that political leaders on both sides are prepared to publicly defend relationship about more than oil it should include shared commitment to political and economic reform as saudis make common cause with the outside world it should include shared interest in greater tolerance and cultural respect translating into commitment to fight the violent extremists who foment hatred we should offer an example of moral leadership in the world committed to treat people humanely abide by the rule of law and be generous and caring to our neighbors america and muslim friends can agree on respect for human dignity and opportunity where muslin governments even those who are friends do not respect these principles the united states must stand for better future just as we did in the cold war we need to defend our ideals abroad vigorously america does stand up for its values the united states defended and still defends muslims against tyrants and criminals crs3 in somalia bosnia kosovo afghanistan and iraq if the united states does not act aggressively to define itself in the islamic world the extremists will gladly do the job for us the us government should offer to join with other nations in generously supporting new international youth opportunity fund funds will be spent directly for building and operating primary and secondary schools in those muslim states that commit to sensibly investing their own money in public education comprehensive us strategy to counter terrorism should include economic policies that encourage development more open societies and opportunities for people to improve the lives of their families and to enhance prospects for their childrens future the us should counter the continued growth of islamist terrorism by engaging other nations in developing comprehensive coalition strategy against islamist terrorism there are several multilateral institutions in which such issues should be addressed but the most important policies should be discussed and coordinated in flexible contact group of leading coalition governments the united states should engage its friends to develop common coalition approach toward the detention and humane treatment of captured terrorists new principles might draw upon article 3 of the geneva conventions on the law of armed conflict the us should make maximum effort to strengthen counter proliferation efforts against weapons of mass destruction by expanding the proliferation security initiative and the cooperative threat reduction program the us should engage in vigorous efforts to track terrorist financing this should be central part of us counterterrorism efforts key gilmore commission recommendations the president should develop national strategy for combating terrorism the united states should negotiate more comprehensive treaties and agreements for combating terrorism with canada and mexico key bremer commission recommendations the president should not make further concessions toward iran and should keep iran on the list of state sponsors of terrorism until crs4 tehran demonstrates it has stopped supporting terrorism and cooperates fully in the khobar towers investigation the president should actively seek support from us allies to compel iran to cooperate in the khobar towers bombing investigation the president should make clear to syria that it will remain on the list of state sponsors of terrorism until it shuts down training camps and other facilities in syria and the bekaa valley and prohibits the resupply of terrorist groups through syriancontrolled territory the secretary of state should designate afghanistan as sponsor of terrorism and impose all the sanctions that apply to state sponsor the president should make more effective use of authority to designate foreign governments as not cooperating fully with us counterterrorism efforts to deter all state support for terrorism specifically the president should direct the secretary of state to consider greece and pakistan among others as candidates for this designation review the current list of state sponsors and recommend that certain states be moved to the not cooperating fully designation after they have undertaken specified measures to cease sponsorship of terrorism increase publicity of the activities of state sponsors and countries designated as not cooperating fully through special reports making extensive use of the internet the secretary of state should ensure the list of foreign terrorist organizations fto designations is credible and frequently updated the secretary of state in concert with other departments and agencies should take the lead in developing an international convention aimed at harmonizing national laws sharing information providing early warning and establishing accepted procedures for conducting international investigations of cyber crime key recommendations of the joint inquiry of house and senate intelligence committees the national security council in conjunction with the director of national intelligence and in consultation with the secretary of the department of homeland security the secretary of state and secretary of defense should prepare for the presidents approval us governmentwide strategy for combating terrorism both at crs5 home and abroad including the growing terrorism threat posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and associated technologies this strategy should identify and fully engage those foreign policy economic military intelligence and law enforcement elements that are critical to comprehensive blueprint for success in the war against terrorism as part of that effort the director of national intelligence shall develop the intelligence community component of the strategy identifying specific programs and budgets an including plans to address the threats posed by osama bin nssg laden and qaida hezbollah hamas and other significant terrorist groups consistent with applicable law the strategy should effectively employ and integrate all capabilities available to the intelligence community against those threats and should encompass specific efforts to develop human sources to penetrate terrorist organizations and networks both overseas and within the united states fully utilize existing and future technologies to better exploit terrorist communications to improve and expand the use of data mining and other cutting edge analytical tools and to develop multilevel security capability to facilitate the timely and complete sharing of relevant intelligence information both within the intelligence community and with other appropriate federal state and local authorities maximize the effective use of covert action in counterterrorist efforts develop programs to deal with financial support for international terrorism facilitate the ability of cia paramilitary units and military special operations forces to conduct joint operations against terrorist targets the state department in consultation with the department of justice should review and report to the president and the congress by june 30 2003 on the extent to which revisions in bilateral and multilateral agreements including extradition and mutual assistance treaties would strengthen us counterterrorism efforts the review should address the degree to which current categories of extraditable offenses should be expanded to cover offenses such as visa and immigration fraud which may be particularly useful against terrorists and those who support them the intelligence community and particularly the fbi and the cia should aggressively address the possibility that foreign governments are providing support to or are involved in terrorist activity targeting the united states and us interests statesponsored terrorism substantially increases the likelihood of successful and more lethal attacks within the united states this issue must be addressed from national standpoint and should not be limited in focus by the crs6 geographical and factual boundaries of individual cases the fbi and cia should aggressively and thoroughly pursue related matters developed through this joint inquiry that have been referred to them for further investigation by these committees key hartrudman commission recommendations the president should develop comprehensive strategy to heighten americas ability to prevent and protect against all forms of attack on the homeland and to respond to such attacks if prevention and protection fail institutional steps to protect against and prepare for terrorist attacks key 911 commission recommendations the united states should combine terrorist travel intelligence operations and law enforcement in strategy to intercept terrorists find terrorist travel facilitators and constrain terrorist mobility the u s border security system should be integrated into larger network of screening points that includes our transportation system and access to vital facilities such as nuclear reactors the president should direct the department of homeland security dhs to lead the effort to design comprehensive screening system addressing common problems and setting common standards with systemwide goals in mind extending those standards among other governments could dramatically strengthen america and the worlds collective ability to intercept individuals who pose catastrophic threats the department of homeland security properly supported by the congress should complete as quickly as possible biometric entry exit screening system including single system for speeding qualified travelers it should be integrated with the system that provides benefits to foreigners seeking to stay in the united states linking biometric passports to good data systems and decision making is fundamental goal we should do more to exchange terrorist information with trusted allies and raise us and global border security standards for travel and border crossing over the medium and long term through extensive international cooperation secure identification should begin in the united states the federal government should set standards for the issuance of birth certificates and sources of identification such as drivers licenses crs7 the us government should identify and evaluate the transportation assets that need to be protected set riskbased priorities for defending them select the most practical and costeffective ways of doing so and then develop plan budget and funding to implement the effort the plan should assign roles and missions to the relevant authorities federal state regional and local and to private stakeholders improved use of nofly and automatic selectee lists should not be delayed while the argument about successor to capps continues this screening function should be performed by the tsa transportation security administration and it should utilize the larger set of watch lists maintained by the federal government air carriers should be required to supply the information needed to test and implement this new system the tsa and the congress must give priority attention to improving the ability of screening checkpoints to detect explosives on passengers as start each individual selected for special screening should be screened for explosives further the tsa should conduct human factors study method often used in the private sector to understand problems in screener performance and set attainable objectives for individual screeners and for the checkpoints where screening takes place as the president determines the guidelines for information sharing among government agencies and by those agencies with the private sector he should safeguard the privacy of individuals about whom information is shared the burden of proof for retaining particular governmental power should be on the executive to explain that the power actually materially enhances security and b that there is adequate supervision of the executives use of the powers to ensure protection of civil liberties if the power is granted there must be adequate guidelines and oversight to properly confine its use at this time of increased and consolidated government authority there should be board within the executive branch to oversee adherence to the guidelines we recommend and the commitment the government makes to defend our civil liberties homeland security assistance should be based strictly on an assessment of risks and vulnerabilities now in 2004 washington dc and new york city are certainly at the top of any such list we understand the contention that every state and city needs to have some minimum infrastructure for emergency response but federal homeland security assistance should not remain program for general revenue sharing it should supplement state and local crs8 resources based on the risks or vulnerabilities that merit additional support emergency response agencies nationwide should adopt the incident command system ics when multiple agencies or multiple jurisdictions are involved they should adopt unified command both are proven frameworks for emergency response we strongly support the decision that federal homeland security funding will be contingent as of october 12004 upon the adoption and regular use of ics and unified command procedures in the future the department of homeland security should consider making funding contingent on aggressive and realistic training in accordance with ics and unified command procedures congress should support pending legislation which provides for the expedited and increased assignment of radio spectrum for public safety purposes furthermore highrisk urban areas such as new york city and washington dc should establish signal corps units to ensure communications connectivity between and among civilian authorities local first responders and the national guard federal funding of such units should be given high priority by congress we endorse the american national standards institutes ansi recommended standard for private preparedness we were encouraged by secretary tom ridges praise of the standard and urge the department of homeland security to promote its adoption we also encourage the insurance and creditrating industries to look closely at companys compliance with the ansi standard in assessing its insurability and creditworthiness we believe that compliance with the standard should define the standard of care owed by company to its employees and the public for legal purposes we recommend the establishment of national counterterrorism center nctc built on the foundation of the existing terrorist threat integration center ttic breaking the older mold of national government organization this nctc should be center for joint operational planning and joint intelligence staffed by personnel from the various agencies the head of the nctc should have authority to evaluate the performance of the people assigned to the center key gilmore commission recommendations there should be national level strategy on combating terrorism that clearly delineates and distinguishes federal state and local roles and responsibilities and articulates clear direction for federal priorities and programs to support local responders and comprehensive parallel public education effort crs9 more needs to be done and can be done to obtain and share information on potential terrorist threats at all levels of government to provide more effective deterrence prevention interdiction or response using modern

clarify the fi foreign intelligence collection and foreign counterintelligence investigations guidelines for international terrorism investigations and the attorney general guidelines on crs17 general crimes racketeering enterprise and domestic securityterrorism investigations which govern domestic terrorism the attorney general and the director of the federal bureau of investigation should develop guidance to clarify the application of both sets of guidelines this guidance should specify what facts and circumstances merit the opening of preliminary inquiry or full investigation and should direct agents in the field to investigate terrorist activity vigorously using the full extent of their authority during the period leading up to the millennium the fisa foreign intelligence surveillance act application process was streamlined without lowering the fisa standards applications were submitted to the fisa court by doj promptly and with enough information to establish probable cause the attorney general should direct that the office of intelligence policy and review not require information in excess of that actually mandated by the probable cause standard in the foreign intelligence surveillance act statute to ensure timely review of the foreign intelligence surveillance act applications the attorney general should substantially expand the office of intelligence policy and review staff and direct it to cooperate with the federal bureau of investigation the director of the federal bureau of investigation should establish and equip dedicated staff of reports officers to develop terrorism and foreign intelligence information obtained at field offices and headquarters for prompt dissemination to other agencies especially those within the intelligence community while protecting privacy and pending criminal cases the attorney general should clarify what information can be shared and direct maximum dissemination of terroristrelated information to policymakers and intelligence analysts consistent with the law the president should direct the creation of joint task force consisting of all the agencies in the us government that possess information or authority relevant to terrorist fundraising the task force should develop and implement broad approach toward disrupting the financial activities of terrorists this approach should use all available criminal civil and administrative sanctions including those for money laundering tax and fraud violations or conspiracy charges the secretary of the treasury should create unit within the office of foreign assets control dedicated to the issue of terrorist fundraising crs18 the president and congress should work together to create an effective system for monitoring the status of foreign students nationwide the attorney general should direct the department of justice to pursue vigorously the criminal prosecution of terrorists in an open court whenever possible the attorney general should further direct that where national security requires the use of secret evidence in administrative immigration cases procedures for cleared counsel and unclassified summaries such as those provided in the alien terrorist removal court atrc should be used the president should require the director of the office of management and budget and the national counterterrorism coordinator to agree on all budget guidance to the agencies including the response to initial budget submissions and both officials should be involved in presenting agencies counterterrorism budget appeals to the president the president should direct the preparation of manual on the implementation of existing legal authority necessary to address effectively catastrophic terrorist threat or attack the manual should be distributed to the appropriate federal state and local officials and be used in training exercises and educational programs the president should determine whether any additional legal authority is needed to deal with catastrophic terrorism and make recommendations to congress if necessary the president should direct the assistant to the president for national security affairs in coordination with the secretary of defense and the attorney general to develop and adopt detailed contingency plans that would transfer lead federal agency authority to the department of defense if necessary during catastrophic terrorist attack or prior to an imminent attack the secretary of defense should establish unified command structure that would integrate all catastrophic terrorism capabilities and conduct detailed planning and exercises with relevant federal state and local authorities the president should direct 1 the exercise subgroup under the direction of the national coordinator for counterterrorism to exercise annually the governments response to catastrophic terrorism crisis including consequence management and 2 all relevant federal agencies to plan budget and participate in counterterrorism and consequence management exercises coordinated by the exercise crs19 subgroup and ensure senior officer level participation particularly in the annual exercises the president should establish comprehensive and coordinated longterm research and development program to counter catastrophic terrorism the secretary of health and human services should strengthen physical security standards applicable to the storage creation and transport of pathogens in research laboratories and other certified facilities in order to protect against theft or diversion these standards should be as rigorous as the physical protection and security measures applicable to critical nuclear materials the secretary of health and human services working with the department of state should develop an international monitoring program to provide early warning of infectious disease outbreaks and possible terrorist experimentation with biological substances key recommendations of the joint inquiry of house and senate intelligence committees enhance the depth and quality of domestic intelligence collection and analysis by for example modernizing current intelligence reporting formats through the use of existing information technology to emphasize the existence and the significance of links between new and previously acquired information congress and the administration should ensure the full development within the department of homeland security of an effective all source terrorism information fusion center that will dramatically improve the focus and quality of counterterrorism analysis and facilitate the timely dissemination of relevant intelligence information both within and beyond the boundaries of the intelligence community congress and the administration should ensure that this fusion center has all the authority and the resources needed to have full and timely access to all counterterrorismrelated intelligence information including raw supporting data as needed have the ability to participate fully in the existing requirements process for tasking the intelligence community to gather information on foreign individuals entities and threats integrate such information in order to identify and assess the nature and scope of terrorist threats to the united states in light of actual and potential vulnerabilities crs20 implement and

language training programs and establish and sustain effective channels for the exchange of counterterrorism related information with federal agencies outside the intelligence community as well as with state and local authorities given the fbis history of repeated shortcomings within its current responsibility for domestic intelligence and in the face of grave and immediate threats to our homeland the fbi should strengthen and improve its domestic capability as fully and expeditiously as possible by immediately instituting measures to strengthen counterterrorism as national fbi program by clearly designating national counterterrorism priorities and enforcing field office adherence to those priorities establish and sustain independent career tracks within the fbi that recognize and provide incentives for demonstrated skills and performance of counterterrorism agents and analysts significantly improve strategic analytical capabilities by assuring the qualification training and

counterterrorismrelated information between the fbi and other federal state and local agencies and finally solve the fbis persistent and incapacitating information technology problems the attorney general and the director of the fbi should take action necessary to ensure that the office of intelligence policy and review and other department of justice components provide indepth training to the fbi and other members of the intelligence community regarding the use of the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa to address terrorist threats to the united states the fbi disseminates results of searches and surveillances authorized under fisa to appropriate personnel within the fbi and the intelligence community on timely basis so they may be used for analysis and operations that address terrorist threats to the united states and the fbi develops and implements plan to use authorities provided by fisa to assess the threat of international terrorist groups within the united states fully including the extent to which such groups are funded or otherwise supported by foreign governments the president should review and consider amendments to the executive orders policies and procedures that govern the national security classification of intelligence information in an effort to expand access to relevant information for federal agencies outside the intelligence community for state and local authorities which are critical to the fight against terrorism and for the american public in addition the president and the heads of federal agencies should ensure that the policies and procedures to protect against the unauthorized disclosure of classified intelligence information are well understood fully implemented and vigorously enforced congress and the administration should ensure the full development of national watchlist center that will be responsible for coordinating and integrating all terrorist related watchlist systems promoting awareness and use of the center by all relevant government agencies and elements of the private sector and ensuring consistent and comprehensive flow of terrorist names into the center from all relevant points of collection key hartrudman commission recommendations the president should propose and congress should agree to create national homeland security agency nhsa with responsibility for planning coordinating and integrating various us government crs22 activities involved in homeland security the federal emergency management agency fema should be key building block in this effort the president should propose to congress the transfer of the customs service the border patrol and coast guard to the national homeland security agency while preserving them as distinct entities the president should propose to congress the establishment of an assistant secretary of defense for homeland security within the office of the secretary of defense reporting directly to the secretary the secretary

blend more easily in foreign cities ensuring seamless relationship between human source collection and signals collection at the operational level and f stressing better balance between unilateral and liaison operations lead responsibility for directing and executing paramilitary operations whether clandestine or covert should shift to the defense department there it should be consolidated with the capabilities for training direction and execution of such operations already being developed in the special operations command the overall amounts of money being appropriated for national intelligence and to its component agencies should longer be kept secret congress should pass separate appropriations act for intelligence defending the broad allocation of how these tens of billions of dollars have been assigned among the varieties of intelligence work information procedures should provide incentives for sharing to restore better balance between security and shared knowledge the president should lead the governmentwide effort to bring the major national security institutions into the information revolution he should coordinate the resolution of the legal policy and technical issues across agencies to create trusted information network specialized and integrated national security workforce should be established at the fbi consisting of agents analysts linguists and surveillance specialists who are recruited trained rewarded and retained to ensure the development of an institutional culture imbued with deep expertise in intelligence and national security key gilmore

requirements and robust dhs capability for combining threat and vulnerability information perform comprehensive national intelligence estimate on the threats to infrastructure perform national intelligence estimate on the threat to agriculture and food key bremer commission recommendations the director of central intelligence should make it clear to the central intelligence agency that the aggressive recruitment of human intelligence sources on terrorism is one of the intelligence communitys highest priorities the director of central intelligence should issue directive that the 1995 guidelines will longer apply to recruiting terrorist informants that directive should notify officers in the field that the preexisting process of assessing such informants will apply the president should direct the director of central intelligence the secretary of defense and the director of the federal bureau of investigation to work with congress to ensure that adequate resources are devoted to meet essential technology requirements of the national security agency and the federal bureau of investigation and to expand and accelerate the dcis counterterrorist centers activities the director of central intelligence should authorize the foreign language executive committee to develop larger pool of linguists and an interagency strategy for employing them including flexible approaches to reduce problems related to handling of classified material key recommendations of the joint inquiry of house and senate intelligence committees the national security act of 1947 should be amended to create and sufficiently staff statutory director of national intelligence who shall be the presidents principal advisor on intelligence and shall have the full range of management budgetary and personnel responsibilities needed to make the entire us intelligence community operate as coherent whole these responsibilities should include crs25 establishment and enforcement of consistent

development efforts review approval and coordination of relationships between the intelligence community agencies and foreign intelligence and law enforcement services and exercise of statutory authority to insure that intelligence community agencies and components fully comply with community wide policy management spending and administrative guidance and priorities the director of national intelligence should be cabinet level position appointed by the president and subject to senate confirmation congress and the president should also work to insure that the director of national intelligence effectively exercises these authorities to insure focused and consistent intelligence community leadership congress should require that person may simultaneously serve as both the director of national intelligence and the director of the central intelligence agency or as the director of any other specific intelligence agency current efforts by the national security council to examine and revamp existing intelligence priorities should be expedited given the immediate need for clear guidance in intelligence and counterterrorism efforts the president should take action to ensure that clear consistent and current priorities are established and enforced throughout the intelligence community once established these priorities should be reviewed and updated on at least an annual basis to ensure that the allocation of intelligence community resources reflects and effectively addresses the continually evolving threat environment the position of national intelligence officer for terrorism should be created on the national intelligence council and highly crs26 qualified individual appointed to prepare intelligence estimates on terrorism for the use of congress and policymakers in the executive branch and to assist the intelligence community in developing program for strategic analysis and assessments recognizing that the intelligence communitys employees remain its greatest resource the director of national intelligence should require that measures be implemented to greatly enhance the recruitment and development of workforce with the intelligence skills and expertise needed for success in counterterrorist efforts including the agencies of the intelligence community should act promptly to expand and improve counterterrorism training programs within the community insuring coverage of such critical areas as information sharing among law enforcement and intelligence personnel language capabilities the use of the foreign intelligence surveillance act and watchlisting the intelligence community should build on the provisions of the intelligence authorization act for fiscal year 2003 regarding the development of language capabilities including the acts requirement for report on the feasibility of establishing civilian linguist reserve corps and implement expeditiously measures to identify and recruit linguists outside the community whose abilities are relevant to the needs of counterterrorism the existing intelligence community reserve corps should be expanded to ensure the use of relevant personnel and expertise from outside the community as special needs arise the director of national intelligence should require more extensive use of joint tours for intelligence and appropriate law enforcement personnel to broaden their experience and help bridge existing organizational and cultural divides through service in other agencies these joint tours should include not only service at intelligence community agencies but also service in those agencies that are users or consumers of intelligence products serious incentives for joint service should be established throughout the intelligence community and personnel should be rewarded for joint service with career advancement credit at individual agencies the director of national intelligence should also require intelligence community agencies to participate in joint exercises the intelligence community should enhance recruitment of more ethnically and culturally diverse workforce and devise strategy to capitalize upon the unique cultural and linguistic capabilities of first generation americans strategy designed to utilize their skills to the greatest practical effect while recognizing the potential counterintelligence challenges such hiring decisions might pose crs27 steps should be taken to increase and ensure the greatest return on this nations substantial investment in intelligence including the president should submit budget recommendations and congress should enact budget authority for sustained longterm investment in counterterrorism capabilities that avoid dependence on repeated stopgap supplemental appropriations in making such budget recommendations the president should provide for the consideration of separate classified intelligence community budget longterm counterterrorism investment should be accompanied by sufficient flexibility subject to congressional oversight to enable the intelligence community to rapidly respond to altered or unanticipated needs the director of national intelligence should insure that intelligence community budgeting practices and procedures are revised to better identify the levels and nature of counterterrorism funding within the community counterterrorism funding should be allocated in accordance with the program requirements of the national counterterrorism strategy and due consideration should be given to directing an outside agency or entity to conduct thorough and rigorous costbenefit analysis of the resources spent on intelligence assured standards of accountability are critical to developing the personal responsibility urgency and diligence which our counterterrorism responsibility requires given the absence of any substantial efforts within the intelligence community to impose accountability in relation to the events of september 11 2001 the director of central intelligence and the heads of intelligence community agencies should require that measures designed to ensure accountability are implemented throughout the community to underscore the need for accountability the director of central intelligence should report to the house and senate intelligence committees later than june 30 2003 as to the steps taken to implement system of accountability throughout the intelligence community to include processes for identifying poor performance and affixing responsibility for it and for recognizing and rewarding excellence in performance as part of the confirmation process for intelligence community officials congress should require from those officials an affirmative commitment to the implementation and use of strong accountability mechanisms throughout the intelligence community crs28 the inspectors general at the central intelligence agency the department of defense the department of justice and the department of state should review the factual findings and the record of this inquiry and conduct investigations and reviews as necessary to determine whether and to what extent personnel at all levels should be held accountable for any omission commission or failure to meet professional standards in regard to the identification prevention or disruption of terrorist attacks including the events of september 11 2001 these reviews should also address those individuals who performed in stellar or exceptional manner and the degree to which the quality of their performance was rewarded or otherwise impacted their careers based on those investigations and reviews agency heads should take appropriate disciplinary and other action and the president and the house and senate intelligence committees should be advised of such action the administration should review and report to the house and senate intelligence committees by june 30 2003 regarding what progress has been made in reducing the inappropriate and obsolete barriers among intelligence and law enforcement agencies engaged in counterterrorism what remains to be done to reduce those barriers and what legislative actions may be advisable in that regard in particular this report should address what steps are being taken to insure that perceptions within the intelligence community about the scope and limits of current law and policy with respect to restrictions on collection and information sharing are in fact accurate and wellfounded key hartrudman commission recommendations the president should ensure that the national intelligence council include homeland security and asymmetric threats as an area of analysis assign that portfolio to national intelligence officer and produce national intelligence estimates on these threats the president should order the setting of national intelligence priorities through national security council guidance to the director of central intelligence the director of central intelligence should emphasize the recruitment of human intelligence sources on terrorism as one of the intelligence communitys highest priorities and ensure that operational guidelines are balanced between security needs and respect for american values and principles the intelligence community should place new emphasis on collection and analysis of economic and sciencetechnology security concerns and incorporate more open source intelligence into analytical products congress should support this new emphasis by crs29 increasing significantly the national foreign intelligence program nfip budget for collection and analysis congress and oversight issues key 911 commission recommendations congressional oversight for intelligence and counterterrorism is now dysfunctional congress should address this problem we have considered various alternatives joint committee on the old model of the joint committee on atomic energy is one single committee in each house of congress combining authorizing and appropriating authorities is another congress should create single principal point of oversight and review for homeland security congressional leaders are best able to judge what committee should have jurisdiction over this department and its duties but we believe that congress does have the obligation to choose one in the house and one in the senate and that this committee should be permanent standing committee with nonpartisan staff since catastrophic attack could occur with little or notice we should minimize as much as possible the disruption of national security policymaking during the change of administrations by accelerating the process for national security appointments we think the process could be improved significantly so transitions can work more effectively and allow new officials to assume their new responsibilities as quickly as possible the department of defense and its oversight committees should regularly assess the adequacy of northern commands strategies and planning to defend the united states against military threats to the homeland the department of homeland security and its oversight committees should regularly assess the types of threats the country faces to determine the adequacy of the governments plans and the progress against those plans to protect americas critical infrastructure and b the readiness of the government to respond to the threats that the united states might face key gilmore commission recommendations concentrate oversight of the nctc national counter terrorism center in the intelligence committee in each house establish separate congressional authorizing committee and appropriation subcommittee for homeland security crs30 key bremer commission recommendations congress should promptly ratify the international convention for the suppression of the financing of terrorism and pass any legislation necessary for full implementation congress should enact legislation to make countries designated as not cooperating fully ineligible for the visa waiver program congress should review the status of the foreign terrorist organizations fto statute within five years to determine whether changes are appropriate congress should develop mechanism for reviewing the presidents counterterrorism policy and budget as whole the executive branch should commit to full consultation with congress on counterterrorism issues house and senate appropriations committees should immediately direct fullcommittee staff to conduct crosssubcommittee review of counterterrorism budgets the congress should make possession of designated critical pathogens illegal for anyone who is not properly certified control domestic sale and transfer of equipment critical to the development or use of biological agents by certifying legitimate users of critical equipment and prohibiting sales of such equipment to non certified entities require tagging of critical equipment to enable law enforcement to identify its location by recent statute federal agencies must reimburse up to one half of the cost of personal liability insurance to law enforcement officers and managers or supervisors congress should amend the statute to mandate full reimbursement of the costs of personal liability insurance for federal bureau of investigation special agents and central intelligence agency officers in the field who are combating terrorism key recommendations of the joint inquiry of house and senate intelligence committees the establishment of intelligence community priorities and the justification for such priorities should be reported to both the house and senate intelligence committees on an annual basis crs31 the intelligence community should fully inform the house and senate intelligence committees of significant developments in these efforts through regular reports and additional communications as necessary and the committees should in turn exercise vigorous and continuing oversight of the communitys work in this critically important area congress and the administration should carefully consider how best to structure and manage us domestic intelligence responsibilities congress should review the scope of domestic intelligence authorities to determine their adequacy in pursuing counterterrorism at home and ensuring the protection of privacy and other rights guaranteed under the constitution this review should include for example such questions as whether the range of persons subject to searches and surveillances authorized under the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa should be expanded based on their oversight responsibilities the intelligence and judiciary committees of the congress as appropriate should consider promptly in consultation with the administration whether the fbi should continue to perform the domestic intelligence functions of the united states government or whether legislation is necessary to remedy this problem including the possibility of creating new agency to perform those functions congress should require that the new director of national intelligence the attorney general and the secretary of the department of homeland security report to the president and the congress on date certain concerning the fbis progress since september 11 2001 in implementing the reforms required to conduct an effective domestic intelligence program including the measures recommended above the experience of other democratic nations in organizing the conduct of domestic intelligence the specific manner in which new domestic intelligence service could be established in the united states recognizing the need to enhance national security while fully protecting civil liberties and their recommendations on how to best fulfill the nations need for an effective domestic intelligence capability including necessary legislation the house and senate intelligence and judiciary committees should continue to examine the foreign intelligence surveillance act and its implementation thoroughly particularly with respect to changes made as result of the usa patriot act and the subsequent decision of the united states foreign intelligence court of review to determine whether its provisions adequately address present and crs32 emerging terrorist threats to the united states legislation should be proposed by those committees to remedy any deficiencies identified as result of that review the director of the national security agency should present to the director of national intelligence and the secretary of defense by june 30 2003 and report to the house and senate intelligence committees detailed plan that describes solutions for the technological challenges for signals intelligence requires review on quarterly basis of the goals products to be delivered funding levels and schedules for every technology development program ensures strict accounting for program expenditures within their jurisdiction as established by current law makes nsa full collaborating partner with the central intelligence agency and the federal bureau of investigation in the war on terrorism including fully integrating the collection and analytic capabilities of nsa cia and the fbi and makes recommendations for legislation needed to facilitate these goals in evaluating the plan the committees should also consider issues pertaining to whether civilians should be appointed to the position of director of the national security agency and whether the term of service for the position should be longer than it has been in the recent past congress should consider enacting legislation modeled on the goldwaternichols act of 1986 to instill the concept of jointness throughout the intelligence community by emphasizing such things as joint education joint career specialty increased authority for regional commanders and joint exercises that act greatly enhanced the joint warfighting capabilities of the individual military services legislation to instill similar concepts throughout the intelligence community could help improve management of community resources and priorities and insure far more effective team effort by all the intelligence agencies congress should expand and improve existing educational grant programs focused on intelligencerelated fields similar to military scholarship programs and others that provide financial assistance in return for commitment to serve in the intelligence community recognizing the importance of intelligence in this nations struggle against terrorism congress should maintain vigorous informed and constructive oversight of the intelligence community to best achieve that goal the national commission on terrorist attacks crs33 upon the united states should study and make recommendations concerning how congress may improve its oversight of the intelligence community including consideration of such areas as changes in the budgetary process changes in the rules regarding membership on the oversight committees whether oversight responsibility should be vested in joint house senate committee or as currently exists in separate committees in each house the extent to which classification decisions impair congressional oversight and how congressional oversight can best contribute to the continuing need of the intelligence community to evolve and adapt to changes in the subject matter of intelligence and the needs of policy makers congress should also review the statutes policies and procedures that govern the national security classification of intelligence information and its protection from unauthorized disclosure among other matters congress should consider the degree to which excessive classification has been used in the past and the extent to which the emerging threat environment has greatly increased the need for realtime sharing of sensitive information the director of national intelligence in consultation with the secretary of defense the secretary of state the secretary of homeland security and the attorney general should review and report to the house and senate intelligence committees on proposals for new and more realistic approach to the processes and structures that have governed the designation of sensitive and classified information the report should include proposals to protect against the use of the classification process as shield to protect agency selfinterest the director of central intelligence should report to the house and senate intelligence committees later than june 30 2003 as to the steps taken to implement system of accountability throughout the intelligence community to include processes for identifying poor performance and affixing responsibility for it and for recognizing and rewarding excellence in performance as part of the confirmation process for intelligence community officials congress should require from those officials an affirmative commitment to the implementation and use of strong accountability mechanisms throughout the intelligence community crs34 key hartrudman commission recommendations congress should establish special body to deal with homeland security issues as has been done with intelligence oversight members should be chosen for their expertise in foreign policy defense intelligence law enforcement and appropriations this body should also include members of all relevant congressional committees as well as exofficio members from the leadership of both houses of congress congress should rationalize its current committee structure so that it best serves us national security objectives specifically it should merge the current authorizing committees with the relevant appropriations subcommittees the executive branch must ensure sustained focus on foreign policy and national security consultation with congress and devote resources to it for its part congress must make consultation higher priority and form permanent consultative group of congressional leaders as part of this effort the congressional leadership should conduct thorough bicameral bipartisan review of the legislative branch relationship to national security and foreign policy crs35
