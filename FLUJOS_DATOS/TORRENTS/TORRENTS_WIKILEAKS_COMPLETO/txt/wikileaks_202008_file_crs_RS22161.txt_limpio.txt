uzbekistan and crs issue brief ib93108 central asia updated regularly background according to the bush administration uzbekistan is key strategic partner in the global war on terror and one of the most influential countries in central asia but its poor record on human rights democracy and religious freedom complicates ties with the united states us assistance aims to enhance uzbekistans sovereignty territorial integrity and security diminish the appeal of extremism by strengthening civil society and respect for human rights bolster the development of natural resources such as oil and address humanitarian needs1 us policy aims to encourage the emergence of secular societal values in uzbekistan that will facilitate peaceful and stable political change however the government of president islam karimov has made little progress in democratization market reforms and respect for human rights according to the state departments country reports on human rights practices for 2004 and the international monetary funds imfs welfare improvement strategy for 20052010 us officials and others have raised concerns that this lack of progress could engender instability which might spread throughout the region and beyond threaten the status of the coalition airbase at karshi khanabad k2 that provides significant access to afghanistan and heighten the danger of the leakage

the government claimed were carried out by the islamic movement of uzbekistan imu terrorist group in 1999 and 2000 imu and other islamic extremists mostly based in afghanistan launched sorties against kyrgyzstan and uzbekistan the imu suffered major losses during usled coalition actions in afghanistan in 20012002 but appears to be regaining some strength in recent months an obscure islamic jihad group of uzbekistan ijg jamaat aljihad alislami composed of breakaway members of the imu claimed responsibility for another series of bombings and armed attacks in uzbekistan in marchjuly 2004 including bombings at the us and israeli embassies the uzbek government also claimed that hizb uttahrir ht an islamic fundamentalist movement ostensibly pledged to peace but banned in uzbekistan was involved several of those arrested testified that they had been trained at camps in kazakhstan and pakistan and that their leadership consorted with taliban head mohammad omar uighur extremist abu mohammad and osama bin laden on may 25 2005 the state department pointed to this testimony and other evidence in designating ijg as global terrorist group and on june 1 2005 the security council added ijg to its terrorism list for background see crs report rs21238 uzbekistan recent developments and us interests httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22161 recent developments the immediate cause of the unrest in andijon the third largest city in uzbekistan with population of about 300000 is linked to the arrests in mid2004 of twentythree prominent local businessmen who were charged with belonging to the akramiya islamic terrorist group and with involvement in the 1999 and 2004 bombings2 after the trial of the businessmen began in february 2005 over 100 witnesses testified that they were innocent groups of family members and others held vigil at the courthouse and the detainees began hunger strike on may 10 2005 hundreds protested at the courthouse families and friends maintained that the defendants creation of charity fund had brought them to the attention of local officials who feared their popularity and coveted their assets perhaps lending some credence to this view reported 200 businessmen in andijon had protested on april 1 against government corruption and other interference in private enterprise3 after police on may 12 reportedly beat up and arrested some family members who were picketing the courthouse several dozen people attacked police station and seized weaponry they then stormed prison and released the defendants and over 500 other inmates the government warned that imu terrorists were among those freed many of these inmates apparently joined others in occupying the local administration building the next day several thousand people gathered in the main square in andijon to hear 2 the akramiya movement was named after prominent local secondary school teacher akram yuldashev who had been convicted in 1999 of involvement in the 1999 bombing it is uncertain whether the movement is composed of active terrorists or loosely connected admirers of yulashevs advice on islamic worship and charity as contained in his pamphlet the path to faith his admirers maintain that the advice is pacifistic and nonpolitical karimov maintains that akramiya is an offshoot of ht 3 foreign broadcast information service fbis central eurasia daily report april 5

security operations to restore control over government facilities dozens of civilians reportedly were killed or wounded during this crackdown many of the deaths occurred after uzbek troops fired on demonstrators on the main square according to international reporters on the scene and other credible observers late in the day the government announced that it had restored order in the city the official death tally is 173 people including terrorists civilians killed by the terrorists and 36 police officers president karimov claimed on may 14 that government forces had not fired on unarmed civilians on may 18 the interior ministry announced that 100 civilians had been killed by the banditsand that another eight might have been killed by stray bullets numerous witnesses and human rights advocates have disputed the government accounts claiming that hundreds of civilians were killed by arbitrary gunfire by government forces the government reported in late may that it had detained or arrested 98 people and convicted 52 in connection with the unrest in andijon4 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22161 more people were killed over the next few days during riots in other towns or while attempting to flee across uzbek borders into kazakhstan or kyrgyzstan protesters in karasuu town straddling the border with kyrgyzstan burned government buildings on may 14 uzbek troops reentered the town on may 19 and arrested the unarmed members of purported islamic terrorist group that was keeping order in the town these townsmen reportedly denied that they were linked to ht or other terrorist groups but stated that they backed rule by islamic law shariah on may 20 several hundred demonstrators in karasuu called for the release of the townsmen implications for uzbekistan the uzbek government argued that armed terrorists and criminals including those released from the prison had attempted to take over andijon and that forceful government measures had been necessary to restore order on may 24 karimov asserted that these groups were financed and guided from abroad by ht and others who wanted to overthrow the constitutional and secular order in uzbekistan and the wider central asian region analyst martha olcott testified that among the people who attacked the prison there may well have been terrorists trained in afghanistan and linked to qaeda5 civil discontent has been increasing during recent months as economic conditions appear to worsen for many uzbekistanis some observers warn that this internal political and economic instability if not ameliorated could result in the country becoming failed state where lawlessness and abject poverty prevail whether or not karimov exits 4 fbis may 14 doc cep27134 may 18 doc cep27011 and may 27 2005 doc cep115 human

perhaps more alarming it reports that onefifth of the population is malnourished and that 64 of pregnant females are anemic7 among political divisions in uzbekistan are those between an urban and well educated secular group whether in government or opposition and islamic groups whether moderate or extremist some observers warn that popular revulsion against the small secular prokarimov elite could result in islamic interests coming to power since the secular opposition is in disarray or in exile8 mohammad solikh the exiled head of uzbekistans banned erk party has rejected such scenario stating that his party seeks peaceful transition to democracy and that the uzbekistanis do not want islamic rule perhaps indicating the rise of moderate secular opposition several prominent uzbek businessmen and others inspired by kyrgyzstans march 2005 tulip revolution have formed the sunshine uzbekistan movement which urges karimov to replace his ministers and toothless legislators with reformers9 on may 18 karimov rejected call by secretary general kofi annan for an httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22161 international inquiry into events in andijon instead karimov directed his legislature to conduct probe both china and russia have concurred with karimov that what happened in andijon is solely uzbekistans internal affair the government allegedly has attempted to seal off andijon from reporters and foreigners among other international assessments the external relations council of the eu on may 23 criticized the reported excessive disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force by the uzbek security forces and warned that if the uzbek government did not permit an international inquiry into the events in andijon it would consider further steps on may 31 natos parliamentary assembly more strongly condemned the disproportionate use of force by uzbek security forces against opposition protesters and civilians and recommended that if uzbekistan forbade an international inquiry its membership in the euroatlantic partnership council be reconsidered and nato country support to its military be reconsidered and eventually suspended disappointed that the international community had not already imposed sanctions the nongovernmental international crisis group in late may stated that the failed policies of muted criticism and tacit support of karimov must be abandoned10 reflecting concerns that deepening instability in uzbekistan could have regional repercussions all the states bordering uzbekistan hailed its reestablishment of law and order in andijon china and russia also praised karimovs antiterrorist actions new strains appeared in uzbekistans relations with kyrgyzstan karimov on may 17 asserted 6 international crisis group uzbekistan the andijon uprising may 25 2005

crs5 that the tulip revolution in kyrgyzstan had facilitated the flow of arms into uzbekistan for terrorism and condemned kyrgyzstan for harboring the fleeing terrorists kyrgyzstan was concerned that unrest might spread and increased its police patrols in the south of the country where many ethnic uzbeks and observant muslims live reportedly many kyrgyzstanis in both the south and the north perhaps remembering the civil disorder attending their tulip revolution tended to support the reestablishment of law and order in uzbekistan implications for us interests the us government withheld early judgments about the attacks in andijon but seemed to defer to uzbekistans view that international terrorists had threatened the peace the white house raised concerns that the terrorists who had broken out of the prison threatened us interests and also called for protesters to express their grievances peacefully on may 18 however the state department emphasized that its becoming apparent that very large numbers of civilians were killed by the indiscriminate use of force by uzbek forces and that acredible inquiry should be launched at the same time it stressed that nothing justified the violent protests nonetheless the state department httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22161 also argued that the united states had strategic interests in antiterrorism cooperation with uzbekistan and that continued engagement would be the best way to insist that uzbekistan democratize create free markets and respect human rights on may 31 president bush appeared to reiterate this cautious position when he announced that he had asked the international red cross to go to andijon to determine what went on11 the overseas basing commission in its may 2005 report suggested that us national security could be enhanced by establishing cooperative security locations csls military facilities with few or us personnel but which may contain pre positioned equipment in central asia however it added that the risks to such csls posed by islamic extremism must be carefully evaluated defense department spokesman bryon whitman has stressed that access to k2 is undeniably critical in supporting our combat operations in afghanistan evidence that such risks in uzbekistan are being reevaluated was provided by gen john p abizaid head of us central command when he stated that there might be potential change in the security situation following events in andijon and announced that operations at k2 would temporarily be scaled back12 such heightened risks were underlined by the state departments warning on may 28 that it had received information that terrorists might be planning to attack us interests in uzbekistan soon congressional concerns about human rights conditions in uzbekistan have been reflected in legislation and other action omnibus appropriations for fy2003 pl 108 7 forbade freedom support act assistance to the government of uzbekistan unless the secretary of state determined and reported that uzbekistan was making substantial progress in meeting its commitments to democratize and respect human rights the secretary reported in may 2003 that uzbekistan was making such progress

fy2004 the state department announced in july 2004 that despite some encouraging progress in respecting human rights some military and economic aid to uzbekistan would be withheld because of lack of progress on democratic reform and restrictions on ngos receiving us assistance in addition to freedom support act aid finding of lack of progress triggered similar aid conditions on international military education and training imet and foreign military financing fmf programs about 85 million was ultimately withheld decision is pending on withholding some fy2005 aid the cutoff of imet and fmf aid was criticized by the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gen richard myers during visit to uzbekistan on august 12 2004 as shortsighted and not productive since it reduced us military influence reportedly he announced boosted nonproliferation aid of 21 million and the transfer of fourteen patrol boats worth 29 million perhaps to reassure the uzbeks of us interest in their security in testimony to the helsinki commission on may 19 2005 michael cromartie of the us commission on international religious freedom pointed to these disparate aid decisions and urged unified us policy toward uzbekistan reportedly some us httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22161 trained uzbek troops may have been involved in human rights abuses in andijon spurring some calls for restricting bilateral military assistance13 among other legislative conditions on aid to uzbekistan the comprehensive threat reduction ctr act pl 103160 requires ctr recipients to observe internationally recognized human rights the national defense authorization act for fy2003 pl 107 314 sec 1306 however permits the president national security waiver on december 30 2003 for fy2004 and on december 14 2004 for fy2005 the president concluded that uzbekistan had committed human rights abuses but exercised his waiver authority to permit it to receive continued ctr aid at briefing of the helsinki commission on may 19 cochairman rep christopher smith denounced the uzbek government for the most lethal violence ever launched against protesters among countries belonging to the osce he also cautioned that if unrest spread throughout uzbekistan the united states would be forced to reconsider the bilateral strategic relationship cochairman sen sam brownback stressed that he had long endorsed the current us policy of engagement with uzbekistan which includes encouraging the government to slowly and steadily make reform progress but that such progress had not occurred nonetheless he urged the karimov government that it was not too late to salvage the situation of liberalization for human rights democracy and the economy among other congressional action senators john mccain lindsey graham and john sununu visited uzbekistan at the end of may and met with representatives of unregistered opposition parties uzbek government officials refused to meet them the members warned that usuzbek relations could be harmed if the government spurns an international inquiry into the events in andijon and sen sununu urged reforms since the current level of political and economic repression is unsustainable and it will only serve to stimulate discontent and unrest14 13 ap may 28 2005 14 ap may 30 2005 washington post june 6 2005
