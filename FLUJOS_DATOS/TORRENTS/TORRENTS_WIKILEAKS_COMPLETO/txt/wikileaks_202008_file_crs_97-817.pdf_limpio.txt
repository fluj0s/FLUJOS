agreements to congress for consideration under expedited pr ocedures many agricultural and food industry interests were among the exportoriented enterprises that supported tpa arguing that foreign trading partners would not seriously negotiate with an administration that lacked it however some farm groups argued that fast track ultimately will lead to new agreements that have adverse effects on us producers at least of some commodities this report will be update d if events warrant what is fast track trade promotion authority fast track or trade promotion authority tpa refers to legislation explicitly enabling the president to negotiate trade agr eements with foreign countries and then to submit implementing legislation to cong ress for approval under special expedited procedures first adopted in the trade act of 1974 this authority was used to negotiate and implement several bilateral and multilateral agreements including agreements in the tokyo round of multilateral tr ade negotiations the usc anada free trade agreement fta the north american free trade ag reement nafta and the uruguay round ur accords which included establishment of the world trade organization wto fast track authority which expired in 1994 is intended to strengthen the presidents negotiating authority and credibility by reassuring foreign trading partners that agreements will be considered promptly by congress and not subjected to changes that would force return to the bargaining table past fast track procedures have included requirements for advance notification of congress and consultations with relevant committees before an agreement could be concluded lawmakers in effect have used these consultative requirements as informal markups to address in advance the various policy issues that otherwise might be debated during the votes on the implementing legislati on for more information see crs issue brief ib10084 fasttrack authority for trade agreem ents trade promotion

has had positive overall effect on us agricultural trade of course factors other than trade liberalizationincluding popula tion and economic growth na tional agricultural policies exchange rates geographic proximity and weatheralso influence trade flows canada and mexico are respectively the second and third largest us agricultural export markets together accounting for about onefourth of the value of our farm exports worldwide total agricultural trade between the united states and its two nafta partners increased from 175 billion in 1993 the year just prior to naftas entry into force to an estimated 30 billion in 2001 th united states was exporting slightly more than it was importing from these two countries combined us agricultural exports to mexico reached 74 billion in fy2001 while mexicos exports to the united states were 53 billi on in fy1996 the us trade balance with canada turned from surplus to negative one for fy2001 us agricultural exports to canada were 8 billion nd canadas exports to the united states were 95 billion us commodity exports to mexico with substantial gains since nafta include coarse grains wheat cotton processed fruits nd vegetables and red meats mexico has made significant gains in tomatoes peppers onions cucumbers grapes and melons us commodity exports to canada that have grow n include soybeans corn poultry meat dairy and egg products fresh vegetables citrus co tton and wine and beer canadas export gains include cattle hogs red meats da iry products rapeseed oil and potatoes some us farmers contend that they ve been disadvantaged by nafta or that their concerns are not being addressed by the agreement often leading to lingering trade tensions andor formal actions to obtain import relief commodities that have been the focus of such frictions include imports of canadian wheat live animals potatoes and stuffed molasses sugarcontai ning product and of mexican cattle tomatoes and other winter vegetables and prospectively sugar often such complaints revolve around the contention that foreign products are unfairly subs idized or dumped he re at less than the cost of production moreover june 2001 repor t by public citizens global trade watch asserts that nafta has harmed individual farmers and consumers while benefitting only large agribusinesses down on the farm naftas sevenyears war on farmers and ranchers in the us canada and mexico meanwhile some usexported agricu ltural products have come under similar scrutiny by mexico and canada eg comp laints by mexico about us meat products and highfructose corn syrup and by ca about us corn among others uraawto fast track and free trade advocates also have been promoting the success of the uraa by citing usda estimates of its economic benefits for farmers for example usda has stated that the uraa and other wto agreements will increase us agricultural exports by projected 47 billion to 87 billion by 2005 and raise farm income by as much as 25 billion by the same year others challenge such assertions contending that it is difficult to separate the agreements effects from other factors that influence world trade and that the numbers are speculative and overly optimistic the office of the us trade representa tive ustr reports that most countries generally are in compliance with their market access and export subsidy reductionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97817crs4 1 for background see crs report rs20142 the european unions ban on hormonetreated meat december 19 2000commitments few however have not fulfilled their obligations for example since china joined the wto in december 2001 the ad ministration and private us agricultural interests have expresse d growing concerns that the country has not adhered to its market opening commitments has issued confusing and possibly protectionist rules affecting imports of geneticallymodified farm products like soybeans has effectively blocked meat imports and may be violating its wto commitment not to subsidize corn exports much attention has been paid by farmer s and agribusinesses to the wto dispute settlement processand its perceived weaknesses the united states has won most of the agricultural cases it has brought to the wto or reached favorable settlements before the cases were adjudicated by wto panels bu t concerns have arisen about the pace of implementation of pane l decisions in the uss favor prominent example is the european unions eus continuing reluctance to implement wto ruling against its ban on imports of meat produced with hormones1 however other agricultural interests contend that the economic be nefits of free trade agreem ents outweigh such problems congressional action previous fast track authority had expired in 1994 in the 107th congress president bush and congressional republican leaders ma restoration of tpa trade priority democrats who support trade reform also expr essed interest in tpa but warned that congress must address longstanding concer ns about trade agreements impacts on the environment and labor among other issues if measure were to win widespread bipartisan support on december 6 2001 the house narrowly pa ssed largely along party lines tpa bill hr 3005 that had been approved oct ober 9 2001 by its ways and means committee the senate finance committee clear ed its version of hr 3005 on december 18 2001 this version was folded as title xxi into much broader trade measure an expanded version of hr 3009 to extend th andean trade preference act that also includes expansion of trade adjustment assi stance taa legislation including section on taa for farmers potentially enabling those adversely affected by agricultural imports to receive up to 10000 in payments annually the full senate cleared this measure with more bipartisan support on may 23 2002 conference committee completed work in late july on compromise version of hr 3009 including language authorizing fa sttrack procedures for trade agreements reached by june 1 2005 with 2year extens ion possible the house and senate gave final approval to the confer ence report respectively on july 27 and august 1 2002 tpa enjoys support among much but not ll of us agriculture however key house members with agricultural constituencies had threatened earlier to withhold support if the administration continued to oppose in creases in us farm subsidies the administration had been criticizing the omnibus farm bill for its cost and potential for undermining trade however house agri culture committee leaders ultimately pledged their support for tpa after receiving assuran ces that the administration would agree tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97817crs5 2 the trade and development act of 2000 pl 106200 already contained list of explicit us objectives and consultation requirements for agriculture in wto negotiations the new spending in the bill the farm bill now estimated to add 52 billion in new spending over its 6 years was signed into law as pl 107171 on may 13 2002 agricultural provisions in part to shore up support for tpa among agricultural groups and to address their specific trade concerns proponents have in cluded extensive language on negotiating objectives and consultation re quirements for agriculture2 the measure also contains negotiating objectives for other economic sector s and issues the principal agricultural negotiating objective is to obtain compe titive opportunities for us agricultural commodities in foreign markets and to achieve fairer and more ope n conditions of trade in bulk specialty crop and valueadded commodities by among other things reducing or eliminating by date certain tariffs and other charges that decrease us export opportunities and re ducing tariffs to levels that are at or below us tariffs reducing or eliminating subsidies that harm us exports or unfairly distort markets allowing for the preservation of non tradedistorting programs that support family farms nd rural communities developing disciplines for domestic farm support so that production in excess of domestic food security need s is sold at world prices and eliminating policies that create pricedepressing surpluses eliminating when possible state trading enterprises stes strengthening dispute settlement m echanisms in or der to eliminate practices including ste activities unjustified labeling sanitary and other technical barriers to trade and restrictive administration of tariff rate quotas or trqs that imp air us market opportunities eliminating practices that adversely affect trade in perishable or cyclical products and addressing their trade problems and ensuring that import relief mechanisms for such products are as accessible and useful to us growers as they are to producers in other countries taking into account whether other count ries have not lived up to existing trade agreements and the impacts of such agreements on us agriculture maintaining bona fide food assistan ce programs and preserving us market development and export credit programs recognizing the effect that simultaneous sets of negotiations may have on us importsensitive commodities including those subject totrqs there also are provisions for extensive cons ultation with congress with respect to the agricultural and other sectoral negotiations for example the ustr is required in the course of negotiations to consult closely and on timely basis with and keep fully apprized of the negotiations all congressional committees with jurisdiction over affected laws as well as with the new congressi onal oversight group to include the chairmen and ranking members of the two agriculture committees this group must receive regular detailed briefings have access to pertinent negotiating documents and behttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97817crs6 accorded the closest practicab coordination throughout the negotiations the house and senate agriculture committees are singled out in the tpa law for close and timely consultations including immediately before an agreement is initialed by trade officials also to garner more support from agricu ltural members the bills sponsors added language limiting the presidents authority to proclaim without congressional approval modifications in tariffs on import sensitive products specifically in cluding those subject to minimum trqs importsensitive products are those subject to the minimum 15 reduction required under the uraa this pr ovision likely encompasses more than 200 specific items ranging from cheese and many other dairy products to various fresh fruits and vegetables sugar and other sweeteners beef and lamb oilseeds wine tobaccos cotton wool and chocolate some analysts note that several negotiating objectives in the measure along with the extensive new subsidies in the us farm bill could make it more not less difficult for the president to achieve desirable results for agriculture in particular these analysts say the requirement to consult in advance with congress before negotiating cuts in tariffs on importsensitive products make negotiating ta riff reductions more difficult and prevent negotiations of tradeoffs between sectors similarly making preservation of us export credit programs principal negotiating objective may render negotiations on export subsidy reduction or elimination more difficult the administration has countered that while the bills pose additional hurdles for lowering tariffs on im portsensitive products tpa in the longrun will overall provide better basis for negotiations potential uses of the new authority even before tpa passage us officials were active in various trade negotiations officials contend that tpa will expedite the negotiations among them wto at the wto fourth ministerial conf erence in doha qatar november 914 2001 trade ministers agreed on declaration to begin new round of multilateral trade negotiations including on agriculture th doha declaration gives new impetus to sectoral negotiations on agriculture wh ich had been underway since early 2000 by effectively incorporating them into comp rehensive trade round and by setting an agreed negotiating mandate for
