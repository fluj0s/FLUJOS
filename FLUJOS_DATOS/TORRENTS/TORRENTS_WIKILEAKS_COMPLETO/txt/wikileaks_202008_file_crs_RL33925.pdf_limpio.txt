to assess the current system for evaluating and ensuring drug safety and to make recommendations to improve risk assessment surveillance and the safe use of drugs iom released the future of drug safety promoting and protecting the health of the public in september 2006 and fda issued its response in january 2007 the following drug safety bills have been introduced in the 110th congress s 468 hr 788 s 484 and hr 1165 although the legislation and the iom re port address many of the same drug safety issues the bills differ in their treatment of fda authority to require action and to enforce compliance comparative eff ectiveness studies and how to fund any additional agency activities for example s 468 hr 788 would strengthen fdas postapproval drug safety activities by creating new center for postmarket evaluation and research for drugs and biologics the other bills would leave these activities where they currently reside in the center for drug evaluation and research all the bills would allow the fda to penalize through civil fines injunctions or withdrawal of marketing approval or licensure drug manufacturers who did not conduct required postmarket studies or who failed to report study results the iom committee recommended that congress provide substantially increased resources to fda to bolster its drug safety activities s 468 hr 788 would authorize appropriations to

release of safety data and whether the agency has the authority nd resources to ensure adequate research over the marketing life of the pha rmaceutical products it regulates in 2004 the regulatory medical and i ndustry debate became very public with reports of cardiovascular hazards posed by the pain medicine vi oxx one of several cox2 nonsteroidal antiflammatory drugs then on the market and of children facing increased risk of suicidal thoughts and ac tions when taking certain antidepressants such as the selective serot onin reuptake inhibitors paxil and zoloft not only was congress asking whether the manufacturers knew of these risks while continuing to market the drug but also whether f da should have known of the risks and done more to protect the public at the height of public and
