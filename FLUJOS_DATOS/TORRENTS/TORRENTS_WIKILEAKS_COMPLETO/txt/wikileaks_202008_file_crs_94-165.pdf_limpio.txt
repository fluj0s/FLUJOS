1httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94165trade and environment gatt and nafta introduction environmental concerns in trade negotiations have received extensive attention by policymakers both with regard to th general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt and to the north american fr ee trade agreement nafta during 1990 as the multilateral trade negotiations in the uruguay round of the gatt entered what was expected to be their final year environmental concerns were increasingly raised environmental issues were brought up in connection with bilate ral and other trade discussions as well at the conclusion of the nafta envir onmental concerns we re addressed both within the agreement and in side agreements that were critical to passage of nafta implementing legislation in the united states similarly although not initially expected to address environment the gatt uruguay round agreement contains number of provisions addressi ng concerns of environmental groups and decision was taken by gatt negotiators to establish committee on trade and environment within the newly established world trad organization wto and to outline an environmental work program to examine major tradeenvironment issues background number of basic concerns have been raised during the debates on trade and the environment differences in environmental regulations may affect competitiveness raising the question of whether and how to harmonize or achieve some internationally accepted convergence of environmental standards in the absence of similar environmental regulations lower standards in exporting countries may be considered to be hidden subsidy by importing countries whose competing industries have to co mply with stronger environmental regulations if countries are not allowed to contro l or restrict exports they may lose major tool for conserving resources that are overharvested for trade markets concern for example with tropical timber trade measures or sanctions have been increasingly invoked as enforcement mechanisms in environmental agreements eg the montreal protocol fisheries treaties the individual and cumulative impacts of the use of such measures need to be studied and understood as well as how to make them compatible with trade ruleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94165crs2 if country acts unilaterally to impos trade measures eg an import ban in order to enforce its own laws ag ainst certain practices affecting the global commons this may be interpreted by current trade regulations as restriction on fair and free trade as happened in the usmexico dispute over the use of trade measures by the united states to protest mexican tuna fishing practices that killed excessive numbers of dolphins environmental regulations especia lly those that impose requirements on imported goods in some cases may be c onsidered restraints on trade an important underlying issue is the ex tent to which environmental issues can or should be negotiated and resolved w ithin the context of trade agreements environmental groups have argued that envi ronmental issues are directly affected by trade and that some environmental concerns need to be addressed in trade agreements however trade officials express concern that trade agreements are not the appropriate place to addr ess most environmental probl ems and that these should be resolved through multilateral environm ental agreements with trade agreements incorporating ways to accommodate such treaties environment in the gatt environmental issues were raised repeatedly during the last three years of the uruguay round in the final agreement m odifications were ma in key language on technical barriers to trade tbts sanitary and phytosanitary standards sps and dispute settlement and by inserting protection of the environment and sustainable development to the priorities in the preamble and by allowing limited environmental subsidies to addre ss major environmental concerns gatt negotiators agreed that an environmental work program was needed and the december 15 1993 decision required that it be formulated by april 15 1994 for implementation in the post uruguay period on marc h 23 1994 negotiators issued decision that trade and environmen t committee should be tablished in the wto with broad work program as its mandate however bate continued over whether the language modifications and the future work program will satisfy demands of environmental interests that the interna tional trading system should accommodate appropriate environmental protection while not violating the goals of gatt to protect and promote free and open trade historically within the gatt structure working parties ad hoc committees have customarily been established to study the issues on which members may wish to make decisions in the future in 1971 the gatt parties established working group on environmental measures and interna tional trade it was noted at the time that environmental policies vary among c ountries and trade disputes may result from these differences however this working group did not meet until 1991 when increasing concerns raised by environmental groups put pre ssure on the gatt to respond the group was activated in october 1991 and had its first m eeting in november of that year it held six substantive meetings in 1992 its agenda included three items httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94165crs3 trade provisions of existing multilateral environmental agreements such as the montreal protocol on ozone depletion or the basel c onvention on waste trade the transparency of traderelated environmental measures possible trade effects of packaging and labelling requirements major environmentalresource manageme nt issue was hotly debated in gatt in mid1991 and further raised environmen tal sensitivities pu rsuant to provisions of the marine mammal protection act th united states banned tuna imports from mexico to protest fishing methods that killed substantial numbers of dolphins in february 1991 mexico requested gatt ruling against the united states for restraint of trade and in august the di spute panel concluded that gatt prohibits its members from imposing import restrictions based on extraterritorial concerns or from taking action to dictate how othe r nations produce their export goods the implications of this report would be significant if adopted by gatt recommendation to the full gatt was made by the dispute panel limiting trade measures that might be deployed for othe r environmental goals and representing an example of the concerns expressed by us environmental groups that gatt procedures and decisions could undermine u s laws aimed at protecting the global environment following extensive reaction to these implications mexico indicated that it would not seek final gatt ruling on its complaint for more information see crs report 91666 enr tuna and the gatt environmental protection objectives were not originally identified as us negotiating objectives for the urugua round in the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 whic h spelled out us goals however sense of the congress resolution was passed in the 102nd congress that stated the president in trade negotiations should seek inter alia to addr ess environmental issues related to the negotiations and to modify gatt articles to take into consideration the national environmental laws of the gatt contracting parties and international environmental treaties until the last phase of the negotiations it had appeared that environmental issues would not be taken up directly in the uruguay round but would be deferred as one of the high priority issues to be taken up by gatt af ter conclusion of the uruguay round talks in the last days of the negotiations however led by us positions in some cases environmental pr ovisions were included in the agreement or in related decisions by the negotiators provisions of the multinational trade ne gotiations final act mtnfa of the uruguay round signed by negotia tors on december 15 1993 addressing environmental concerns include the following the preamble to the agreement establishing the world trade organization wto recognizes among other thin gs the objective of sustainable development including seeking to pr otect and preserve the environment mtnfa iihttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94165crs4 subsidy to industries to promote adaptation of existing facilities to new environmental requirements would under limited and specified circumstances be nonactionable couldnt be challengedmtnfa ii 13 section 82 c this provision is one of severa l nonactionable subsidies that are regarded as problematic by some us industry representatives who feel this may pr ovide general opening to countries that wish to subsidize exporting industries thereby providing competitive advantage to their firms us business interests are urging that the united states seek ways to assure that unwarranted subsidies are not allowed to their competitors language was adopted to protect national standards from being lowered in the areas of both sanitary and phytosanitary standards sps egfood safety standards and technical ba rriers to trade tbt egdomestic legislation such as fuel efficiency or clean air standards that would require imports to meet such standards adjustments were made in these areas to meet concerns over whethe r environmental standard s of one country could be lowered through harmoniza tion and how disputes over environmentally related trade conflicts might be handled in both cases environmental groups welcomed the language that seeks to ensure countrys standa rds will not be lowered by trade requirements but they see continued problems in that challenges to countrys environmental rulings coul d be allowed thr ough the requirement that environmental objectives be met through least trade restrictive methods conversely business intere sts fear that this language is sufficiently ambiguous that more trade restrictive practices might not be challenged both environmental and business interests are seeking clarifications of the language in the sps and tbt sections the mtnfa recommends the establishment of working party on trade in services and the environment mtnfa iii7 c to examine whether additional changes are needed in the general agreement on trade and services gats other language of concern to environm ental groups in the final act of the uruguay round agreement is that on disput resolution they raise concerns about transparency in terms of inadequate public participation and availability of gatt documents they argue that although some changes to allow expert testimony before gatt panels on scientif ic and technical issues in trade disputes are beneficial the gatt system still allows for challenges to us laws that could result in pressure to lower environmental standards because th ey have been ruled barriers to trade committee on trade and environment at the conclusion of the decembe r 15 uruguay round agreement the negotiating committee reached separate decisi on to establish future work program on environment to deal with unresolve d environment and trade issues the december decision noted that there should be contradiction between environmental protection and an open trading system it spelled out the need forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94165crs5 rules to enhance positive interaction between trade and environmental measures for promotion of sustainable development ting the need for special consideration to needs of developing countries the decisi on also responded to tr aderelated concerns by stating the need to avoid protectionist trade measures and to adhere to multilateral disciplines to ensure responsiveness of the trading system to environmental objectives major objective of environmental intere sts and one advocated by the clinton administration had been commitment to environmental negotiations in green round following the uruguay agreement and the establishment of environment committee in the newly created world trad organization in the end the gatt negotiators declined to include wto environment committee in the d ecember agreement and related decisions instead they agreed that program of work on environment should be drawn up in time for endorsement by the ministerial conference on april 15 1994 this work prog ram negotiators agreed was to spell out the issues to be taken up by gatt related to environment in effect this deferred decisions on some of the most difficult tradeenvironment issues until the post uruguay work program could deal with them some environmental groups accepted this objective and focused their efforts on assuring that what they considered to be appropriate elements were incorporated in the work plan other groups opposed th december 15 decisions they felt that work plan andor environment committee would lead to drawnout and inadequate response they argued that full green round of negotiations is needed and they urged forcing mechanism such as moratorium on all environmental challenges until completion of the round over 75 members of congre ss have written to president clinton urging imposition of such moratorium on challenges to environmental measures such as thos taken in the tunadolphin case until negotiations are undertaken and complete d within gatt to address the full complexity of these issues such moratorium would require agreement from all gatt parties that if trade rest rictions were imposed by country in order to enforce environmental goals and objec tives challenges to these trade restrictions would be posed in the gatt system however some observers argue that such moratorium could not obtain approval fro m gatt participants unless reciprocal moratorium on the imposition of trade rest rictions for environmental purposes were also put into effect on march 23 1994 gatt negotiators announced decision on trade and environment that directs the first mee ting of the general council of the wto to establish committee on trade and environment open to all members of the wto the committee is to report to the first biennial meeting of the ministerial conference after the wto enters into force when the work and terms of reference of the committee will be reviewed along with the committees recommendations the march decision document reiterates the elements of the work plan outlined in the december 15 decision as the committee s terms of reference the program of work will include identification of the relationship between trade measures and environmental measures in order to prom ote sustainable deve lopment and would cover the issue of how gatt will respond to environmental agr eements and treaties it will also make appropriate recommendations on whether modifications of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94165crs6 provisions of the multilateral trading system are requiredcompatible with open equitable and nondiscriminator trade the negotiators left open the option that the committee could address any relevant issues in relation to several broad concerns including among others the relationship between the provisions of the multilateral trading system and trade measures for environmental purposes the relationships between environmental policies relevant to trade or with significant trade effects and the provisions of the multilateral trading system the relationship between the multilateral trading system and charges and taxes for environmental purposes and other requirements for environmental purposes such as t hose for standards packaging or labelling relationships between dispute settlement mechanisms in the trading system and those in environmental agreements pending the first meeting of the wto wh ich is expected in 1995 at the earliest the work of the committee on trade and environment is to begin under sub committee of the preparatory committee of the world trade organization among the most difficult and key issues the committees environmental work program is likely address incl ude the question of the unila teral use of trade measures to enforce countrys environmental prio rities or laws closely linked issue is that of processes and production methods ppmsthe extent to which it is legitimate for an importing country to refu to accept imports that involve what it considers unacceptable environmental cons equences in their production processes even though the product may not cause nvironmental damage to the importing country itself gatt rules to date genera lly do not permit country to impose trade restrictions unilaterally in response to policy choices of other countries this was at issue for example in the tunadolphi n dispute between mexico and the united states in which the united states refuse d to import tuna caught with methods that killed or harmed excessive numbers of dolphins another example could be concerns over global deforestation that have led to calls for reduc ing or refusing imports of wood harvested by unsustainable methods given the difficulty and complexity of many of the traderelated environmental issues it is unclear exactly what the committees final work program will contain environmental interests ve expressed the need for full examination of environmental priorities in the work program in order to assure that strong environmental protection is not jeopard ized by free trade objectivesthrough downward harmonization of environm ental standards for example however there have also been strong opponents to various aspects of possible environmental agenda among these oppone nts are some from developing countries who fear threats to their sovereignty and the possibility that environmental standards may be used to justify trade restrictions that will damage thei r economies anotherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94165crs7 concern is that environmental trade rest rictions might be used by countries to disguise protectionist policies or practices oecd trade and environment agenda the organization for economic coopera tion and development oecd has work underway on an extensive agenda of trade and environment issues which may reflect an agenda that includes many of the issues considered for gatt environmental work program the oecd consisting of the major industrialized nations plays an active role on variety of issues allowing regional debates of international issues included in the very extensive oecd work program are the following effects of trade liberalization on the environment including sector studies in such areas as forestry fisheries etc processes and production methods ppms including identification of the domestic transboundary and global nvironmental and trade implications of various processes and production methods use of trade measures for environm ental purposes both within the context of international agreem ents and outside them packaging and ecolabelling including attention to lifecycle analysis of environmental implications of all stages of products development harmonization of national environmenta l standards including review of procedures for establishing international standards development of trade and envir onmental principles and concepts dispute settlement including comparison of compliance and dispute settlement provisions and procedures in existing environmental and trade agreements current us objectives on february 3 1994 state department counselor timothy wirth outlined current thinking behind development of us positions on trade and environment in testimony before subcommittee of the senate committee on commerce science and transportation he indicated envir onmental objectives include protecting biodiversity and endangered or threatened species protecting the oceans and their resources protecting the atmosphere and addressing climate change and protecting the environment and resources that are with in or partially with in us jurisdiction counselor wirth indicated that us trade policy objectives include among others constructing marketoriented rulesbased system for international trade in goods services and investments incr easing market access for us goods and services and building confidence in the international trading system by promotinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94165crs8 policies that conform to ob ligations under the gatt and other international trade agreements the us framework to be used in veloping position on when consideration of the use of trade measures might be appr opriate to protect th environment include when trade measures are required by an international environmental agreement to which the united states is party assuming non discriminatory treatme nt of nonparties when the environmental effect of an activity is partially within us jurisdiction and there is reasonabl scientific basis for concern when plant or animal species wherever located is endangered or threatened or where particular practice would likely cause species to become threatened assuming there is reasonable scientific basis for concern where the effectiveness of scientifically based international environmental or conservation standard is being diminished provided that the standard is specific enough that th judgment as to whether it has been diminished can be made objectively environment in nafta negotiation of the north american free trade agreement nafta signed december 17 1992 involved unprecedented cons ideration of environmental issues in the context of trade agreement in the final text negotiators included several environmentrelated provisions includi ng language to generally preserve participating countries laws and regulations on environm ent health and safety upon assuming office president clinton pledged he would not send nafta and its implementing legislation to congress until he had negotiated side agreements addressing additional environmental and labor issues trade officials from canada mexico and the united states began nego tiations in march 1993 on september 14 1993 the three countries concluded negotiations on environmental and labor side accords that include provisions to address problems with enforcement of environmental nd labor laws in separate negotiations the united states and mexico agreed to establish border environmental cooperation co mmission becc and north american development bank nadbank to provide financing for environmental investments nafta implementing legisl ation passed congress in november 1993 and the agreement entered into force on january 1 1994httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94165crs9 background environmental issues emerged early in nafta negotiations particularly in the context of liberalizing trade and investment rules between the united states and mexico one question concerned how naf ta might affect one countrys more stringent environmental standards and wh ether these standards could be challenged successfully as nontariff trade barriers coul d us health safety and environmental product standards if stricter than other parties standards be weakened if nafta obliged parties to harmonize and adopt in ternational standards conversely the question asked was whether one countrys weaker environmental protection measures or their ineffective enforcement constitute d an implicit subsidy thus providing an added incentive for businesses to relocate production to the less regulated country many in congress have ex pressed concern that while mexican environmental regulations are becoming more like us regulations mexico currently has many fewer requirements and historica lly has had lax enforcement nafta proponents and opponents generally have agreed that further economic development in mexico could in the long run enable that country to increase investments in environmenta l protection lthough many agree that liberalizing trade and investment with mexico would require that some environmental precautions be taken they disagree as to whether the trade negotiations were the appropriate forum trade officials argued that environment is not traditional trade issu and that nafta talks were not the appropriate mode for resolv ing substantive environmenta l issues they contended that environmental concerns would be more appropriately addressed in multilateral agreements on specific issues however the level of concern raised by congress during nafta negotiations required that th bush administration respond to those concerns with some specificity the final nafta text includes numbe r of environment related provisions including several that are unprecedented for trade agreements briefly nafta contains provisions that conditionally pr otect stricter environmental laws and standards provided that among other things such measures are scientifically based encourage upward harmonization of standards place the burden of proof that an environmental measure is inconsistent with nafta on the party challenging the measure in nafta dispute proceeding and take some steps toward integrating environmental protection and sustainabl development into economic decision making the agreement does not directly affect countrys ability to determine its own levels of protection fo r process standards eg emission controls and waste management rules nafta also identifies three traderelated international environmental agreements that would generally take precedence over nafta and provides that the parties can agree to add other agreements the specified agreements are the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer the basel convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal and the convention on inte rnational trade in endangered species cites the usmexico and uscanad bilateral agreements on waste trade are also included httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94165crs10 notwithstanding the inclusion of thes and other environmental provisions in nafta some remain concerned that naftas ultimate effect on specific standardsrelated measures may not be predictable nafta comprises mix of rights obligations and disciplines and to the extent that the language may be ambiguous or conflicting there is room for debate and uncertainty as to which provisions would prevail in pa rticular instances administration officials however have stated that us environmental measures generally should withstand any challenges under nafta side agreement on environment many in congress concurred with the president on the need for an environmental side agreement key concern was that nafta contained provisions to address lax enforcement of domestic environmenta l laws and that if nafta were implemented border pollution could wors second unresolved issue involved identifying ways to finan ce environmental infrastructure and cleanup in the usmexico border area some members also expressed concern about specific environmentrelated provisions contained in nafta however the president stated he would not reopen the text in supplemental negotiations the three nafta governments completed the north american agreement on environmental cooperation naaec on september 14 1993 followi ng is synopsis of this agreement commission on environmental cooperation the side agreement or naaec creates commission on environmen tal cooperation cec to be headed by council comprised of each countrys t op environmental official the cec also includes an independent secr etariat under the direction of an executive director and joint advisory committee comprised of nongovernmental organizations from the three countries to advise the council th commissions major goal is to broaden cooperation among the parties it will so serve as point of inquiry for public concerns about naftas environmental ffects and as an avenue for dispute settlement panels to obtain environmental expertise the council is given key responsibilities regarding the side accord s dispute settlement provisions involving persistent patterns of nonenfor cement of environmental laws enforcement of domestic environmental laws the most contentious environmental issue throughout negotiations involved whet her or how to address partys persistent lax enforcement of domestic environmental laws the united states proposed authorizing the use of trade sanctions to address patterns of nonenforcement of environmental laws this concept met considerable resistance from canada and mexico ultimately the nafta countri agreed to dispute settlement process that includes sanctions as last resort briefly dispute resolution in these cas would involve multistep process beginning with consultation moving to recommendation of an action plan to correct nonenforcement and if necessa ry proceeding to the imposition of monetary enforcement assessment if party failed to pay the assessment or continued to fail to enforce its laws the party would be liable to ongoing enforcement actions in the case of canada the commission would collect the assessment and would enforce an action plan in summary proceedings before ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94165crs11 canadian court in the case of mexico or the united states the complaining partyies could suspend naf ta benefits based on the amount of the assessment to invoke the dispute settlement process under the side agreement complaint must concern the failure of party to effectively enforce its environmental laws and the alleged failure must be tr aderelated or involve compe ting goods or services the naaec authorizes the secretariat to consider submission from any nongovernmental organization or person asserting that part is failing to effectively enforce its environmental law however only nafta partiesthe united states canada or mexicocould in itiate dispute settlement proceeding under the side agreement usmexico agreement on environmental funding the need for funding to finance envir onmental improvements in the border area was theme voiced throug hout the nafta bate by those concerned about environmental impacts of the agreement the administration estimated that approximately 8 billion over the next decad would be required just to address needs for drinking water sewage treatme nt and solid waste in frastructure projects along the border the united states and mexico entered in to separate negotia tions on this issue and in october 1993 the two governments reached agreement on new institutional structure to provide financing rth american development bank nadbank is being established to fund infrastructur projects initially in three areas clean water wastewater treatment and solid waste the nadbank will work in concert with the newly established border nvironmental cooperation commission becc which will assist border states and local communities to plan and finance environmental infrastructure projects w ith crossborder impact the nadbank will function as purely financial institu tion and the becc will play the major substantive role with regard to site approval design nd environmental impact assessment all projects funded by the nadbank must be appr oved and certified by the becc also ten percent of the resources of the nadbank may be made available for community adjustment and inve stment which need not be in the border area the becc will have 10 commissioners five each from mexico and the united states each country will contribute 225 million over four years leveraging 3 billion loan capitalization projects funde d by the nadbank will be on both sides of the border and will be selected using an ecosystems approach the negotiation of this border infrastru cture financing strategy was separate from nafta and nafta side agreement negotiations however it was considered fundamental to the administrations effo rt to garner congressional support for nafta the president included provisions authorizing the establishment of the becc and the nadbank in the nafta implementing package submitted to congress for approval
