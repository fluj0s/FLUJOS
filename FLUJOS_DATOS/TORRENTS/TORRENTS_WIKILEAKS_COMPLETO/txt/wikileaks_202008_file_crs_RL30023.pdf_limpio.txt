employees are provided mainly through two programs the civil service retirement system csrs and the federal employees retirement system fers both of these pension systems are financed through combination of employee contributions and payments made by the federal government to the civil service retirement and disability fund csrdf the federal government makes supplemental payments into the trust fund on behalf of employees covered by csrs because employee and agency contributions do not meet the full cost of the benefits earned by employees covered by that system civil service retirement annuities are paid from the same trust fund regardless of whether the benefits were accrued under csrs or fers fers pension benefits are fully funded as they are earned and the full cost of funding retirement benefits under fers is recognized in each government agencys annual budget csrs is not fully funded and the full costs of pension benefits earned by workers under csrs are not accounted for in the budgets of individual federal agencies although the two programs are financed differently the ultimate source of the money from which benefits are paid is the same for both programs revenue collected by the government through taxes and by borrowing from the public the office of management and budget estimates that in fy2007 expenditures from the csrdf will total 845 billion including onetime payment of 23 billion to new fund for postal service retiree health benefits this amount consists of the pension savings provided to the postal service by the postal civil service retirement system funding reform act of 2003 pl 10818 in recognition of past overpayments by the postal service to the csrdf other outlays consist mostly of annuity payments to retirees and survivors outlays for annuity payments are estimated to be 614 billion in fy2007 an increase of 62 over the 578 billion in annuity payments from the fund in fy2006 by law benefits under fers must be prefunde d according to their full actuarial cost csrs benefits in contrast are not fully prefunded fully funding the csrs would require increased contributions by the federal government by employees or both if agencies fully funded the costs of the csrs through increased contributions they could be required to do so from their currentlaw appropriations or they could be granted dditional appropriations by congress however because these funds would be used by the csrdf to purchase treasury bonds which is an intragovernmental transfer of funds additional outlays would occur and there would be effect on the budget deficit prefunding the full costs of the csrs without giving agencies additional appropriations would reduce the federal budget deficit or increase the budget surplus because the outlays of federal agencies would have to be reduced by the amount of their additional contributions to the csrdf

civilian federal employees are provided through two programs the civil service retirement system csrs and the federal em ployees retirement system fers csrs was authorized by the civil service retirement act of 1920 pl 66215 and fers was established by the federal employees retirement system act of 1986 pl 99335 under both csrs and fers employees and their employing agencies make contributions to the civil service retirement and disability fund csrdf from whic h pension benefits are paid to retirees and their surviving dependents retirement and disability benefits under fers are fully funded by these contributions and the interest earned by the bonds in which the contributions are invested the cost of the retirement and disability benefits earned by employees covered by csrs on the other hand are not fully funded by agency and employee contributions and interest income the federal government therefore makes supplemental payments each year into the civil service trust fund on behalf of employees covered by csrs ev with these additiona l payments into the trust fund however csrs pens ions are not fully prefunded prior to 1984 federal employees did not pay social security payroll taxes and they were not eligible for social security benefits the social security amendments of 1983 pl 9821 mandated social security coverage for civilian federal employees hired on or after january 1 1984 this change was made in part because the social security system needed additional cash contributions to remain solvent enrolling fede ral workers in both csrs and social security however would have resulted in duplication of so benefits and would have required employee contributions equal to more than 13 of workers salaries consequently congress directed the development of the fers with social security as the cornerstone the fers is composed of three elements 1 social security 2 defined benefit plan the fers basic retirement annuity and 3 defined contribution plan the thrift savings plan 1 all permanent federal employees initially hired on or after january 1 1984 are enrolled in fers as are employees who voluntarily switched from csrs to fers during open seasons held in 1987 and 1998 g8g158g151g141g138g150g142g151g157g138g149g156g561g152g143g561g18g142g151g156g146g152g151g561g18g149g138g151g561g8g146g151g138g151g140g146g151g144g561 retirement programs are classified as either defined benefit db plans or defined contribution dc plans in defined benefit plan the retirement benefit typically is based on salary and years of service and is usually paid as life annuity defined contribution plan is much like savings account maintained by the employer on behalf of each participating employee the employer contributes specific dollar amount or percentage of pay into the account which then is invested in assets such as stocks and bonds in some plans the amount of the employer contribution depends on how much the employee contributes from his or her pay when the worker retires he or she receives the balance in the account which is the sum of all the contributions that have been made plus interest dividends and capital gains or losses this is usually paid as lumpsum but the employee sometimes has the option to receive benefits as series of fixed payments over period of years or as life annuity2 1 this report

contribution plans is that the employer bears the financial risk in defined benefit plan whereas the employee bears the financial risk in defined contribution plan in db plan the employer promises to provide retirement benefits equal to certain dollar amount or specific percentage of the employees pay under federal law employers in the private sector are required to prefund these benefits by setting aside money in trust fund which is typically invested in stocks bonds and other assets the employer is at risk for the full amount of retirement benefits it has promised to its employees and their survivors if the value of the assets held in the pension plans trust fund falls below the present value of the benefits that have been accrued under the plan the employer is required by law to make up this deficitcalled an unfunded liabilitythrough additional contributions over period of years in dc plan the employer bears risk beyond its obligation to make contributions to each employees retirement account it is the employee who bears the risk that markets will decline market risk or that the specific investments he or she chooses will fall in value investment risk if the contributions to the account are inadequate or if the securities in which the account is invested lose value or increase in value too slowly the employee risks having an income in retirement that is too small to maintain his or her desired standard of living if this situation occurs the worker might find it necessary to delay retirement both kinds of retirement plan are eligible for favorable treatment under the internal revenue code provided that they meet the statutory requi rements plans that meet these requirements are called taxqualified plans employers are permitted to deduct contributions to qualified plan from the firms income contributions and investme nt earnings are not counted as taxable income to the employee until they are distributed during retirement

privatesector employers are not required to pr ovide retirement plans for their employees but those that do must comply with the employee retirement income security act of 1974 pl 93 406 popularly known as erisa3 erisa sets standards that plans must meet with respect to reporting and disclosure employee participation participant vesting plan funding and fiduciary standards the administration of erisa is divided among the us department of labor dol the department of the treasurys internal revenue service irs and the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc title i of erisa contains rules for reporting and disclosure vesting participation funding fiduciary conduct and civil enforcement title ii of erisa amended the internal revenue code to parallel many of the title i rules title iii of erisa is concerned with jurisdictional matters and with coordination of enforcement and regulatory activities by the dol and the irs title iv covers the insurance of defined benefit pension plans and is administered by the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc dol has primary responsibility for reporting disclosure and fiduciary requirements and the irs has primary responsibility for participation continued the retired workers death because it is guaranteed for the lifetimes of both spouses it pays lower monthly benefit than singlelife annuity 3 neither federal nor state and local

intervene in any matters that materially affect the rights of participants regardless of which federal agency has primary responsibility because employers cannot be certain that their revenues in future years will be sufficient to pay the pension benefits they owe to retired workers erisa requires these benefits to be prefunded prefunding of benefits protects employees who have earned the right to receive pension payments in the event that the firm goes out of business employers in the private sector prefund their pension liabilities by establishing pension trusts which are invested in assets such as corporate stocks and bonds and us treasury bonds erisa also established the pension benefit guaranty corporation which pays pension benefits up to limits set in law in the event that company goes out of business with an underfunded pension plan the pbgc is funded by premiums paid by employers that sponsor pension plans it insures only defined benefit pension plans prefunding pension benefits is consistent with the principle of accrual accounting in which firms assets and liabilities are recognized in its financial records as they accrue as opposed to waiting until cash is received or paid out by providing for future pension liabilities as they are incurred the firm is recognizing that the pension benefits that it must pay in the future are part of the cost of doing business today when an employer fails to set aside enough money each year to pay the retirement benefits accrued by its workers that year it accumulates an unfunded liability an employer that develops an unfunded liability in its pension plan must make additional contributions over period of years until the pension plans assets equal the present value of its liabilities

when the civil service retirement system was established in 1920 it was not prefunded benefits paid to retirees and their surviving dependents were paid from current contributions to the plan this method of financing retirement benefits called payasyougo also has been used to finance the social security system for most of its history because the federal government is not likely to go out of business it could have continued to fund the pensions earned by federal employees on payasyougo basis nevertheless when congress established the federal employees retirement system in 1986 it required all pension benefits earned under fers to be fully prefunded by the sum of employer and empl oyee contributions and the interest earned by the us treasury bonds in which these contributions are required by law to be invested in establishing fers congress decided to requ ire prefunding of federal employee retirement benefits for reasons of equity and efficiency many employers would have regarded it as inequitable for congress to have required pref unding by privatesector pension plans while not requiring it for federal employees retirement benefits under fers moreover prefunding promotes more efficient allocation of resources between personnel costs and other expenses because it forces federal agencies to recognize th full cost of funding retirement benefits when they prepare their annual budget requests efficient allocation of resources between labor and other inputs can occur only when the price paid for each resource reflects its full marginal cost the cost of one more unit of each resour ce prefunding employee pensions under fers promotes efficient allocation of resources by requiring the full marginal cost of employee compensation to be recognized in each agencys budget

that guarantee that future obligations can be met as they come due the civil service retirement and disability trust fund however is not store of wealth in the same way as the pension funds of privatesector firms and state and local governments the civil service trust fund is required by law to invest exclusively in us treasury bonds these bonds can be converted to cash by the government only by collecting taxes from the public or by issuing more treasury bonds which merely delays the time at which taxes must be collected in short prefunding federal employee retirement benefits with us treasury bonds will not obviate the need to raise revenue from the public to pay civil service retirement benefits as those benefits come due 4 the bonds held by the civil service trust fund assure that the fund has the legal authority to issue pension checks drawn on the treasury but they do not reduce future claims against the ultimate guarantor of federal employee pensions which is the taxpaying public if the civil service retirement and disability fund held assets that earned higher average rate of return than us treasury bonds some of the future cost of civil service retirement annuities could be paid from these higher investment returns however in the short run allowing the civil service retirement trust fund to invest in privatesector securities such as corporate stocks and bonds would result in higher federal expenditures the trust funds two main sources of income are employee contributions and contributions from federal agencies on behalf of their employees employee contributions are income both to the federal government and to the trust fund agency contributions however although they are income to the trust fund are not income to the federal government agency contributions to the trust fund are intragovernmental transfers that have effect on the size of the governments annual budget deficit or surplus outlays from the trust fund occur mainly as benefit payments to annuitants and payment of the administrative expenses of the fund if the trust fund were to purchase privatesector assets such as corporate stocks and bonds rather than us treasury bonds an outlay from the trust fund would be required to purchase the assets this outlay would consist partly of the employee contributions that are income to both the trust fund and the treasury and partly of the agency contributions that are income to the trust fund but are not income to the treasury if employee contributions were used to purchase privatesector assets they would longer be income to th treasury and they would increase the federal budget deficit by the amount diverted to purchase privatesector assets agency contributions currently an intragovernmental transferwould instead be used to purchase privatesector assets and would be new outlay of funds from the treasury over the long run however purchasing private sector assets would not increase the budget deficit and could reduce it outlays would be moved from the futurewhere they would have occurred as benefit paymentsto the present where they would occur to purchase assets if the net rate of return on privatesector securities exceeded the rate of return on treasury bonds the extra investment income earned by the trust fund would reduce the amount of tax revenue that would have to be raised from the public in the future to pay pension benefits under csrs and fers this would also be true for any other fede ral trust fundsuch as the social security trust fundif it were to purchase higheryielding privatesector

contributions and borrowing from the public5 federal agencies prefund their pension liabilities by deferring some of their budget authority which represents legal permission to spend money from the treasury until it is needed to pay pensions to retired workers federal agencies defer this budget authority by transferring it to the civil service retirement and disability trust fund the treasury credits the fund with the appropriate amount of budget authority in the form of special issue bonds that earn interest equal to the average rate on the treasurys outstanding longterm debt in the future when annual outlays for retirement and disability benefits are projected to exceed the annual income to the trust fund from employee and agency contributions the civil service retirement and disability trust fund will redeem bonds in the amount of the additional budget authority it requires to make benefit payments in that year

accrue benefits equal to 15 of pay for their first five years of service 175 for the next five years and 20 of pay for each year beyond the tenth employees covered by fers accrue benefits equal to 10

the amount of the contribution differs between csrs and fers for employees with the same basic pay federal law requires that agency contributions to fers must be equal to the full cost of fers minus employee contributions the percentage of basic pay contributed by federal employees is set in law at the difference between the csrs contribution rate 70 and the social security payroll tax rate 62 the cost of retirement and disability benefits accrued each year under fers is currently estimated by the office of personnel management opm to be equal to 12 of payroll thus federal agencies contribute an amount equal to 112 of their total payro ll to the csrdf for employees covered by fers 9 together the employee and employer contributions to the csrdf for employees enrolled in fers plus the interest that accrues on those contributions fully fund the pension benefits earned each year by employees covered by fers unlike fers which by law must be fully prefunded the retirement benefits accrued by employees covered by csrs contributions are not fully prefunded by employee and agency contributions and interest earnings as result retirement and disability benefits under csrs are paid for in part from the general revenues of the us treasury each year the treasury credits the civil service retirement trust fund with additional budget authority for this purpose in fy2007 this transfer will amount to 321 billion see table 1

ons from current employees and their employing agencies interest on the securities held by the fund interest on previous service for which benefits have been accrued but for which budget authority has not yet been provided and transfer from the general revenues of the treasury only small part of this income to the fund 9 because the cost of retirement and disability benefits can vary from year to year based on the age and experience profile of the federal work force the percentage of pay contributed to fers by federal agencies on behalf of their employees also can change from year to year the full cost of the fers to the federal government also includes the employer share of social security taxes and the employer match on employee contributions to the thrift saving plan these costs are in addition to the 112 of payroll contributed for to the civil service trust fund to finance the fers basic retirement annuity

both the trust fund and to the government as whole the remainder of these transactions are intragovernmental transfers in which budget authority is transferred from federal agencies to the trust fund these intragovernmental transfers have effect on the size of the governments annual budget deficit or surplus in the year that they occur10 the largest sources of income to the trust fund are agency and employee contributions contributions from the us postal service interest earned by the securities held by the fund and transfer of general revenues from the treasury the transfers from the treasury pay part of the actuarial costs of csrs that are not met by contributions from employees and their employing agencies11 the full actuarial cost of the csrs has been estimated by the office of personnel management to be 25 of payroll workers covered by csrs and their employing agencies each contribute an amount equal to 70 of payroll to the civil service trust fund the civil service trust fund is similar to the social security trust fund in that by law 100 of its assets are invested in specialissue us treasury bonds or other bonds backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government when the trust fund needs cash to pay retirement benefits it redeems the bonds and the treasury disburses an equivalent dollar value of payments to civil service annuitants because the bonds held by the trust fund are claim on the us treasury they ultimately are paid for by the american taxpayer according to the us office of management and budget omb balances in the trust fund are available to finance future benefit payments and other trust fund expendituresbut only in bookkeeping sense the holdings of the trust funds are not assets of the government as whole that can be drawn down in the future to fund benefits instead they are claims on the treasury when trust fund holdings are redeemed to pay benefits treasury will have to finance the expenditure in the same way as any other federal expenditure out of current receipts by borrowing from the public or by reducing benefits or other expenditures the existence of large trust fund balances therefore does not by itself increase the governments ability to pay benefits from an economic standpoint the government is able to prefund benefits only by increasing saving and investment in the economy as whole 12

additional cash contributions made by federal workers such as former federal employees who return to government service and repay retirement contributions they had previously withdrawn the largest payments to the csrdf are those it receives from federal agencies and the postal service on behalf of their employees interest payments from the us treasury on the bonds held by the fund and payment from the general fund of the treasury to make up for the insufficient funding of benefits accrued under csrs 13 these payments are not cash transactions they are intragovernmental transfers that result in an increase in the funds budget authority as recorded in the accounts of the us treasury the fund receives treasury bonds as record of this budget authority which it redeems periodically as annuity payments come due in recent years aggregate employee contributions have declined whereas agency contributions have increased the main reason for this trend is the continuing transition in

from 55 billion in 2005 to 116 billion in 2025 and to an estimated 352 billion in 2070 consequently the assets held by the csrdf also are projected to increase steadily rising from 661 billion in 2005 to more than 12 trillion in 2025 and to 81 trillion in 2070 according to the estimates prepared by opm the unfunded actuarial liability of the csrs will continue to rise until about the year 2030 when it will peak at 733 billion from that point onward as the number of annuitants covered by csrs steadily declines the unfunded liability will fall reaching projected level of 87 billion in the year 2070 in fy2005 55 billion was expended from the csrdf composed mainly of annuity payments to retirees and survivors the federal governments payroll expense for covered employees in 2005 was approximately 149 billion therefore pension expenditures to former employees and their surviving dependents were equal to about 37 of the amount paid as salary and wages to federal employees pension expenditures are projected to increase relative to payroll expenditures over the next several years peaking in 2015 at an amount equal to 42 of the governments salary and wage expenses for its employees from that poi nt onward the expenditures of the csrdf are projected to fall in comparison with payroll expenses by 2070 the amount paid to retired workers and their survivors is estimated to be 21 as large as the governments wage and salary payments to its employees annuity payments to retired workers and their survivors are not part of the governments current payroll expenses they are separate additional category of the governments personnel costs however expressing csrdf expenditures as percentage of payroll is useful measure of the relative size of pension expenses because of the assumptions underlying opms estimates of total payroll expenditures opm estimates the governments annual payroll expense under the assumption of constant number of federal work ers from year to year the ratio of pension outlays to payroll expense provides measure of the cost of annuities paid to retirees and survivors relative to payroll expenditures for workforce of constant size most of the increase in this ratio through the year 2015 can be attributed to an increase in the number of annuitants relative to the number of currently employed workers the decline in the ratio of pension outlays to current pay that is projected to occur after 2015 however does not indicate declining ratio of annuitants to employees but rather will occur mainly because more retirees then will be receiving smaller pension benefits under fers than they would have received under csrs economists often compare the federal budget to the size of the economy the gdp to evaluate whether federal spending is absorbing more or less of the nations resources over time individual components of the budget too can be compared to gdp to evaluate the proportion of the nations total economic resources that they consume each year the final column of table 2 shows federal outlays for civil service pensions as percentage of gdp relative to the total economic resources of the economy the expenditures of the csrdf fell throughout the 1990s and are expected to remain steady for the next 10 years before declining substantially from 2020 to 2070 federal expenditures for civil service retirement annuities were estimated to equal 045 of gdp in 2005 down from high of 055 in 1991 between 2005 and 2015 the annual expenditures of the csrdf are projected to remain at about 043 to 045 of gdp each year from that point on outlays from the csrdf will fall steadily to less than 020 of gdp by 2060 csrdf expenditures will fall relative to gdp mainly as result of the decline in the proportion of civil service annuitants who are covered by csrs and the increase in the number who are covered by fers the fers basic annuity was designed to be smaller relative to high3 average pay than csrs annuity because fers annuitants also receive benefits from social security and

the postal civil service retirement system funding reform act of 2003 pl 10818 april 23 2003 lowered the postal services annual payment for csrs pensions by more than 25 billion beginning in fy2003 the legislation was enacted after study was conducted by opm of the postal services estimated remaining financial obligation to the trust fund for service performed by postal service employees covered under csrs the opm study concluded that because past postal service contributions had earned interest at rates higher than the 5 rate assumed in statute the postal services remaining obligation to the civil service trust fund for past service performed by employees covered under csrs was approximately 5 billion rather than the 30 billion that had been estimated previously pl 10818 reduced the

billion including onetime payment of 23 billion to the postal service retiree health benefits fund the data displayed in table 1 show that only small part of the revenues to the fund 41 billion this year will be cash receipts the remainder consist of budget authority transferred from other federal agencies17 the cash receipts of the fund come primarily from the contributions of federal and postal service employees toward their future retirement benefits other cash income to the fund comes from payments made by the district of columbia on behalf of its employees covered by csrs or fers and small amount of supplemental contributions made by federal employees all of the cash payments into the csrdf are income to both the us government and to the trust fund these cash receipts reduce the governments budget deficit or increase its surplus benefit payments to retirees and survivors are cash outlays of the federal government most of the payments into the csrdf92 bil lion in 2007are intragovernmental transfers these transactions are income to the fund but they are not income to the us government agencies of the federal government do business not only with the public but also with each other these intragovernmental transactions rarely involve cash and they do not affect the governments budget deficit or surplus because funds either come into or go out of the government cash is rarely involved in intragovernmental transfers because individual government agencies in general have cash to spend18 what the congress appropriates to federal agencies each year is not cash but budget authority budget authority is legal permission for an agency to spend money from the accounts of the us treasury the treasury takes in money from the public by collecting taxes and by borrowing issuing bonds and in most cases it is only the treasury that disburses cash only transactions in which the government either collects money from the public or pays money to the public affect the federal budget surplus or deficit the public includes federal 17 cash in this context refers to money deposited in bank not just notes and coins 18 some federal agencies collect user fees or other payments from the public but the cash receipts of federal agencies are trivial in comparison to the size of the federal budget the majority of the governments cash transactions with the publiccollecting taxes purchasing goods and services paying federal employee salaries and disbursing social security benefits government pensions and cash welfareare conducted by the treasury

contributions to the civil service trust fund intragovernmental transfers merely move budget authority from one agencys account with the treasury to the account of another agency income to the trust fund that comes from the public also is income to the government income to the trust fund that is transferred from another government agency is income only to the trus t fund and not to the government agencies pre fund their employees pension benefits by transferring budget authority to the civil service trust fund when the income of the trust fund exceeds the amount it needs to pay benefits it saves this budget authority for the future by purchas ing bonds from the us treasury the csrdf can pay retirement benefits up to the amount of budget authority it holds in its account at the treasury it has been suggested from time to time that the civil service retirement and disability fund should be taken off budget as has already been done with the social security trust fund some observers have noted that congress has on occa sion sought budgetary savings from csrs and fers that were not sought from social security 19 of course it cannot be known with certainty whether any special consideration that might have been given to social security in the congresss annual budget deliberations was due to its being off budget or to the much larger number of beneficiaries who would be affected whether taking the civil service retirement programs off budget would protect them from future budget cuts is uncertain taking an account off budget means that its income outgo and yearend balance are not included in calculations of the governments annual budget surplus or deficit offbudget accounts are portrayed separately in the budget documents prepared by the office of management and budget and the congressional budget offi ce cbo however both omb and cbo also publish unified budget accounts that include social security and other programs that are off budget this is done because taking an account off budget does not end the activity or remove its effects from the us economy whether social securityor civil service retirementis on budget or offbudget it still collects revenues from the public pays benefits to the public and affects the nations financial markets by influencing the amount of private capital that is absorbed by government borrowing taking the civil service trust fund offbudget would not affect the governments revenues or outlays in the unified budget accounts but it would affect the size of the budget deficit or surplus as portrayed in any budget documents that excluded the csrdf for example employee contributions to csrs and fers that are now co unted as revenue to the treasury would not be treated as revenue if they were paid to an ffbudget csrdf the money that federal agencies now send to the trust fund in the form of intragovernmental transfers would instead be recorded as outlays and would therefore increase the governments reported budget deficit or reduce the budget surplus in the year that the transfer occurs rather than in the future when benefits are paid the outlays made by the fund to pay civil service annuitants would not appear at all in the federal budget the net effect of these changes if the csrdf had been offbudget in 2006 would have been an increase of 29 billion in the governments reported budget deficit even though the amount of money collected from the public and the amount of money paid to civil service annuitants would have been different than under current law 19 for example in 1994 1995 and 1996 costofliving adjustments colas for csrs and fers were delayed from jan to apr but social security colas were not delayed

governments revenues and outlays are in balance or out of balance therefore taking any account offbudget distorts the picture of the governments fiscal condition it is for this reason that financial analysts and economists focus almost exclusively on the unified budget totals when evaluating the effect of the federal budget on the nations financial markets and the economy if outlays were to include amounts not actually paid from the treasury in the current year as would be the case if the csrdf were offbudget then revenue from the public would be needed in that year to pay for them in years of budget deficits some of the deficit would require borrowing from the public and some of it would not in years of modest budget surplus there might appear to be deficit because transfers to an off budget account would be recorded as outlays even though they do not involve payments from the treasury to the public for these reasons taking the csrdf offbudget might lead to greater confusion about the size of the real budget deficit or surplus as has been the case with the off budget status of social security 20

concept called normal cost to estimate the amount of money that must be set aside each year from employer and employee cont ributions to prefund pension benefits normal cost is usually expressed as percentage of payroll there are two measures of normal cost static and dynamic static normal cost is the amount expressed as percentage of payroll that must be set aside each year to fund pension benefits based on current employee pay with future pay increases future colas for retiree annuities and fixed rate of interest dynamic normal cost is the amount expressed as percentage of payroll that must be set aside each year to fully fund pension benefits for workers who will continue to accrue new benefits including the effects of employee pay raises postretirement colas and changes in the rate of interest 21 by law the fers basic retirement annuity must be prefunded according to its dynamic normal cost every year opm estimates the dynamic normal cost of the fers basic retirement annuity for employees entering the federal work force that year of course some employees will never collect fers annuity so for each group of new employees opm must estimate average job tenure turnover careerlong salaries age at retirement rates of disability death rates and the number of annuitants who will leave surviving dependents opm periodically reestimates the 20 for further discussion see crs report 98422 social security and the federal budget what does social securitys being off budget mean by david s koitz 21 interest rates must be projected because the normal cost is computed as present value expressed in absolute terms rather than as percentage of payroll the normal cost of pension plan is the amount of money that would have to be invested at given rate of return to pay future pe nsion obligations including increases in pension costs that will result from employee pay raises and retiree costofliving adjustments colas

interest rates inflation and employee and retiree demographic characteristics opm has estimated the normal cost of the fers basic retirement annuity at 12 of payroll employee contributions were set in law at 08 of pay so the contributions of federal agencies are equal to 112 of basic pay if the assumptions underlying these cost estimates prove to be accurate fers will be fully funded22 opm has estimated the dynamic normal cost of csrs using the same economic assumptions used in fers at 25 of payroll the financing of csrs has at times been topic of controversy however because it is not funded according to its dynamic normal cost csrs is funded throug h combination of employee and agency contributions that together are equal to the static normal cost of csrs along with contributions from the general fund of the us treasury that make up some of the difference between the static normal cost of csrs and its dynamic normal cost

at the time that congress established the csrs in 1920 it set up trust fund from which benefits would be paid from the beginning however csrs was funded on payasyougo basis the trust fund was used to pay benefits to alreadyretired workers rather than to prefund the pension benefits of current workers initially only employees made regular payroll contributions to the fund regularly scheduled agency contributions were not mandated until the 1950s for many years there were so few retirees that the fund was able to meet its financial obligations to beneficiaries from employee contributions alone in 1956 congress passed pl 84854 which required federal agencies to make contributions to the civil service retirement trust fund on behalf of their eligible employees the contributions made by federal agencies were equal in amount to the money paid into the fund by their employees and were made from appropriations that agencies received specifically for this purpose even with regular contributions from the employing agencies however the csrs was still being funded on payasyougo basis contributions to the fund were sufficient to meet current benefit obligations but not to prefund the future retirement benefits of federal employees as the federal civil service pension system matured that is as the ratio of annuitants to workers began to rise it became necessary to establish formal system of accounting for the pension obligations that had been incurred by the federal government but for which funds had not yet been set aside in response to this need congress enacted pl 9193 in 1969 this law set the employee contribution to csrs at 70 of pay nd required an equal amount to be contributed from funds appropriated to federal agencies this amount equal to 140 of payroll represented the total contribution required in 1969 to pay the costs of pension liabilities accrued by federal employees using static assumptions future pay increases colas and 50 annual rate of return on the securities in the civil service retirement and disability fund agency and employee contributions under csrs have remained at the same percentage of payroll since this law was passed 22 if the amount set aside each year proves to be insufficient due to inaccurate assumptions about pay raises interest rates the rate of inflation or other variables the shortfall would be made up from the general revenues of the us treasury see 5 usc 8423a4

annually from the general revenues of the us treasury into the csrdf these payments which are made by the treasury each year are the amount necessary to amortize pay off with interest over 30year period any increase in pension liability that results from pay increases but not retiree colas or from bringing newly covere d groups of workers into the csrs the amount of the employers share of the cost of benefits attributable to military service and interest fixed at rate of 5 on the estimated amount of the previously accrued liabilities of the csrs for which contributions have not yet been made to the fund 23 thus while the static costs of the csrs were shared equally between federal employees and their employing agencies the government assumed the full responsibility for pension liabilities that are not part of the pension systems static normal co sts by including the 30year amortized cost of pay raises in the annual transfer from the general fund the treasury assumed the additional pension expenses that result from pay raises24 all costs of the csrs that are not paid by employee and agency contributions or through the transfers to the csrdf mandated by pl 91 93 ultimately will be paid from the general revenues of the treasury the costs of retiree colas which also are not part of the static normal cost of the csrs are not included in the annual transfer from the treasury to the csrdf and ultimately will be paid from the general fund of the treasury employee and government contributions under both csrs and fers are paid into the csrdf and pension benefits are paid to annuitants under both programs from this fund because the full costs of csrs are not met by the combined total of employee contributions agency contributions and the supplemental payments from the treasury some future csrs benefits will of necessity be paid from contributions that were made to the fund on behalf of employees who are covered by fers this will create an unfunded liability for fers this liability will be paid off through new series of 30year amortization payments from the general fund of the treasury to the csrdf as stated by opm in this projection the csrs assets attrib utable to nonpostal employees are depleted by the year 2022 since the csrs benefits continue to be paid from the assets of the csrdf the assets attributable to nonpostal fers employees will be reduced each year by the amount that the nonpostal csrs benefits exceed the nonpostal csrs contributions this will cause an increase in the supplemental liability under fers each year which must then be amortized by new series of 30year payments under fers to be made by the treasury 25 23 although this law mandated interest payments on the accrued csrs liability to be made from the treasury to the csrdf at the fixed rate of 5 it did not provide for amortizing paying off the accumulated liability 24 pay raises affect pension costs because the csrs annuity is based on workers high3 average pay the effect of pay raises on future csrs pension costs is met by amortizing them over 30year period with payments to the from the us treasury because the cost of colas is not acc ounted for in the payments to the trust fund mandated by the 1969 law the csrs continues to accumulate an unfunded liability attributable to retiree colas 25 us office of personnel management civil

actuarial estimates indicate that the unfunded liability of the csrs does not pose threat to the solvency of the civil service retirement and disability trust fund in its annual report opm has stated that the total assets of the csrdf in cluding both csrs and fers continue to grow throughout the term of the projection and ultimately reach level of about 48 times payroll or 23 times the level of annual benefit outlays 26 nevertheless the current method of funding the csrs has in recent years been source of debate for at least two reasons 1 because employee and government contributions do not account for the full actuarial cost of csrs pension obligations as they accrue each year the csrs continues to accumulate additional unfunded liabilities consequently some of the pension costs that are incurred each year will not be reflected in the governments budget until those benefits are paid at some time in the future some budget experts argue that these costs should be accounted for in each agencys budget as they accrue just as is done in the fers program 2 the supplemental payments to the trust fund that are required by the 1969 law come from the general revenues of the treasury rather from the budgets of the various federal agencies where these costs are incurred as result the amount of employee compensation for which agencies must account in their budgets each year understates the full costs of employment 27 critics say that this contributes to an inefficient allocation of resources in the federal government by making labor costs appear lower than they really are if federal law were amended so that agencies were required to fully fund the current and future costs of the csrs through increased contributions agencies could do so from their currentlaw appropriations or they could be granted additio nal budget authority for this purpose the two approaches would have different effects on the federal budget for agencies to be held harmless for the increased contributions they would have to receive additional appropriations to their salary and expense accounts28 because agencies would transfer the appropriated funds to the csrdf which would in turn use them to purchase treasury bonds additional outlays would occur as result of these appropriations and they would not effect the federal budget deficit or surplus the outlays would occur in the future when retired employees collect their csrs annuities just as under current law an alternative means of fully financing the normal cost of the csrs would be to require agencies to increase their contributions to the csrdf without receiving any additional appropriations to their salary and expense accounts29 prefunding the full costs of the csrs in this way would reduce the federal budget deficit or increase the surplus because the outlays of each agency 26 us office of personnel management civil service retirement and disability fund report for the fiscal year ended september 30 2004

transfers to the csrdf outlays to csrs annuitants would of course still occur in the future just as under current law however these future outlays would be offset by reduction in current outlays so that the future payments to csrs annuitants could be fully prefunded the reduction in resources available for current spending however could force some agencies to cut back on the services they provide to the public or possibly to reduce the number of people they employ paying the full normal cost of csrs through employee and agency contributions would prevent the system from accruing additional unfunded liabi lities but it would not reduce the previously accumulated liability of the csrs under current law this liability will be paid off eventually through series of 30year amortization payments from the general fund of the treasury to the csrdf some observers favor starting these amortization payments sooner they note that privatesector employers are required by erisa to begin paying down accumulated liabilities when they occur others advocate paying down the liability now as way to forestall proposals calling for reduced pension benefits or increased employee contributions in the future the budget of the united states for fy1997 included proposal to reduce previously accumulated csrs liabilities through series of amortization payments from the treasury to the csrdf30 in this proposal which was not enacted by congress the three payments to the csrdf required by pl 9193 would be replaced with single slightly larger annual payment over period of 40 years the payment would have been classified by omb as mandatory spending and therefore would not have required an increase in any limits placed on discretionary spending the payments to the csrdf would have been an int ragovernmental transfer which would not have resulted in additional outlays and therefore would not have increased the governments budget deficit or reduced the surplus for the same reason however reducing the accumulated liability of the csrdf would not reduce the governments future outlays for csrs annuities g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 congressional interest in the civil service retirement programs in recent years has tended to focus on the underfunding of retirement annuities in csrs proposals to prefund csrs in the same manner as required under fers have foundered either on the question of whether additional budget authority should be granted to federal agencies or whether they should make higher contributions from their current budget authority finding the means to accelerate paying off the accumulated liability under csrs under current budget rules also has contributed to the difficulty in resolving the underfunded status of csrs recently however another issue has been introduced into the debate some observers have suggested that investing the civil service trust fund entirely in us treasury bonds does not represent true prefunding because these bonds are merely claim held by the government against its own future revenues they suggest that at least part of the trust funds assets should be invested in privatesector stocks and bonds where they could earn higher rate of return than is available from us treasury securities albeit at greater risk in addition to issues of risk and investment policies however this proposal faces another significant obstacle in the budgetary scoring rules that would count the purchase of privatesector assets as an outlay of federal f unds which would raise the budget deficit or lower the budget surplus 30 the accumulated csrs liability also could be f unded by payments from individual agency budgets the allocation of fixed costs however is always somewhat arbitrary

retirement annuities would lead to improved accounting of personnel costs among federal agencies however csrs has been closed to new enrollment since 1984 and the percentage of federal employees enrolled in csrs is declining rapidly as these workers retire in 2007 fewer than onefourth of federal employees are enrolled in csrs there also has been some interest in recent years in the possibility of investing some of the assets of the civil service retirement and disability fund in privatesector stocks and bonds obstacles to these proposed changes include differing political philosophies about the role of government in private financial markets the effect of such changes on the budgetary resources of federal agencies and on the federal budget deficit or surplus and the continued preference of some policymakers for financing federal employee retirement benefits on payas yougo basis at present there is looming financial crisis facing either csrs or fers according to the actuaries of the office of personnel management both programs will have sufficient budget authority to meet their obligations for the indefinite future this will provide congress with adequate time to fully consider th benefits and drawbacks that could arise under various reform proposals g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561
