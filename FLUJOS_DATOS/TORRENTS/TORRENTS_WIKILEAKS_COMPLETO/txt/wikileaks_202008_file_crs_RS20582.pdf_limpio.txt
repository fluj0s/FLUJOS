whereby china upon its wto accession would reduce or eliminate barriers to trade in agriculture industrial products and services before the full wto membership can vote on its wto entry china must complete bilateral negotiations with other key wto members and the wto working party in addition to assure that the wto agreements would fully apply congress would have to pass legislation granting permanent normal trade relations pntr status to china status currently renewed on an annual basis source us library of congress congressional research service china and the world trade organization by

membership in the world trade organization wto raises issues among some us workers and organized labor about job and wage security many labor groups argue that mexicos threat to us jobs and wages since the north american free trade agreement nafta could be dwarfed by chinas threat as result of closer economic ties chinas average manufacturing wages at about 025 per hour are about onefifth as great as mexicos and about onefiftieth as much as total compensation for manufacturing workers in the united states chinas labor force is 18 times that of mexico and five times that of the united states most business groups argue that us businesses in china pay much higher than average wages that free trade creates both winners and losers and that chinas wto accession will greatly expand us exports and jobs on may 24 2000 the house passed hr 4444 granting permanent normal trade relations pntr with china it would also set up congressionalexecutive commission to monitor beijings human rights compliance and codify antisurge protection measures contained in the uschina bilateral agreement related legislation includes proposals for an expanded adjustment assistance program for workers displaced from their jobs by possible increased trade with china the senate is not likely to vote on its version of pntr legislation s 2277 until september china is the worlds most populous nation it has labor force of about 700 million five times that of the united states at about 130 million chinas imminent membership in the world trade organization wto1 has crystalized concerns of some us workershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20582crs2 1 continued assistance in preparing this report 2 the flagstaff institute wepza international directory of export processing zones free trade zones may 1997 3 economists like to point out that in an economy operating at full employment jobs are not lost but merely shifted typically from declining industry to growing one about their welfare in the new world economic order the global economy as one result of globalization goods such as autos may be assembled from components produced in dozen or more countries at the same time some services eg processing of information may be performed in localities far from where the service is received some labor groups have expressed concern that with chinas entry into the wto increasingly fewer manufacturing and service jobs may be performed by workers in the united states chinas economic power has grown substantially in the past decade its roughly 125 export processing zones2 huge industrial parks located at or near ports have provided an engine for economic growth and an increasingly sophisticated training ground for workers total uschina trade rose from 18 billion in 1989 to 95 billion in 1999 while china climbed from tenth to fourth position among us trading partners although its eager and massive working population has quickly made china top world economic player enforcement of worker rights protections and social policies are still lagging behind those of more developed countries debate over the effects of chinas economic growth some key concerns of some us workers about the global economy and chinas growing role in it together with responses of business groups and some economists are job loss labor economists note that many lowskill production jobs have been lost3 as us firms have shifted production to developing countries leaving behind predominance of lowskill service jobs and highskill production and service jobs labor unions argue that china has the potential to absorb large proportion of remaining us moderates kill production jobs including textile and auto production jobs business groups counter that the united states is already at full employment and the opening of chinas markets will force workers in both countries into more productive jobs this will reduce prices on goods that are imported rather than produced at home thus cheap imports both raise living standards and increase demand for other products wage loss among lowskilled workers in business weekharris poll 68 were of the opinion that trade agreements with lowwage countries drive down us wages anecdotal evidence documents stories of workers who accepted wage cuts to keep their company from relocating abroad economists have found that wages in developed countries have become steadily skewed in favor of highskilled workers relative to lowskilled workers moreover three sets of data show that real us wage and compensation averages adjusted for inflation have declined between 1978 and 1999

by roughly 305 historically until recently real wage growth has tended to track productivity growth economists are uncertain about the cause of poor wage performance and the wageproductivity spit but most researchers have concluded that trades impact on wages may be 1520 or less with the remainder attributed largely to technology6 loss of leverage on worker rights despite some worker rights protections in chinese law chinas workers are not permitted to organize freely and forced labor in penal institutions is problem7 in addition when plant opens an operation abroad worker protections mandated by us law may not convey to workers in developing country unless business voluntarily adheres to professional code of conduct on the other hand businesses argue when operations are transferred abroad the combination of us management and transferred machinery typically introduces into the developing country greater worker rights and safety protections and higher wages us firms report that in china for instance the average hourly uspaid manufacturing wage is 386 versus chinas national average of 025 8 some labor unions counter that even with embedded protections multinational firms can still exploit workers overseas by paying low wages and can then potentially harm workers at home by exporting the goods back to the united states threatening us jobs where labor rights exist loss of leverage on human rights for some members of congress the annual renewal of chinas ntr status provides an effective tool for influencing us policy toward china on variety of issues including human rights united auto worker president stephen p yokich concurs arguing that the wto accession agreement is fatally flawed because china has horrendous record of religious persecution and oppressing the freedom of its citizens to speak and assemble freely9 john j sweeney president of the aflcio agrees the aflcio fervently believes that the rules of the global economy

estimated us job gains and losses by state over 5 ½ years by mary jane bolle crs report 98782 einform these trade agreements10 business groups counter that granting china pntr opening it to greater us influence and to higher standard of living will encourage greater respect for human rights as has occurred in other nations moving from developing to industrialized status possible lessons from nafta some lessons from the north american free trade agreement nafta with mexico and canada which went into effect january 1 1994 may be applicable to the new uschina wto relationship for instance with or without nafta trade with mexico developing country like china was growing and would have continued to do so after nafta it accelerated second on balance about two us jobs have been gained for every us job lost to increased trade with mexico since nafta11 however some lessons from nafta might not transfer exactly to the uschina experience first nafta as free trade agreement and pntr as designation of trade status provide very different forms of economic integration second mexicos geographic proximity to the united states has encouraged unique symbiotic relationship us components are often assembled in mexico and sent back to the united states with china suppliers are more likely to be located in asia third whereas mexico is final assembler of us components china among other things is also producer of components eg computer components assembled in the united states fourth us exports appear to have more growth potential with china than with mexico under nafta both mexico and the united states reduced trade barriers under the uschina bilateral agreement only china is liberalizing its trade with its huge population and low economic base china holds greater potential for absorbing large volumes of us exports finally usmexico and uschina trade involve some different industries the largest us export to china is airplanes and parts beyond the primary imports from both mexico and china electronics computers apparel the united states also imports large volume of furniture and housewares from china legislative issues the vote on pntr status yes vote in congress on pntr would seal the us china wto relationship if china wins wto membership which requires other similar bilateral agreements chinas wto membership according to business interests could widen the doors for greater us exports to china and provide greater balance to the 82to13 billion 1999 importtoex port ratio to protect us industries and workers against job loss from increased imports the bilateral trade agreement with china includes several specific provisions 1 antidumping provisions to prevent chinese goods from being sold in the us market below cost 2 productspecific safeguards which allow the united states to target rapidly increasing chinese imports if they arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20582crs5 disrupting or threatening to disrupt the us market and 3 special safeguards for us textiles which will be available until the end of 2008 business interests argue that vote in congress on pntr could diminish future uschina trade and investment relations the united states might not get all the benefits of chinas wto accession since china would have obligation to grant them under the wto in addition the united states would not be able to use the wto dispute resolution process if china uses trade barriers to unfairly discriminate against the united states on the other hand labor interests argue vote could slow economic integration that might accelerate plant relocation and also add more leverage to the annual ntr review process permitting closer scrutiny of chinas human rights treatment amendment to pntr on may 25 the senate finance committee passed s 2277 simply granting china pntr status upon its accession to the wto one day earlier on may 24 2000 the house passed hr 4444 granting china pntr status but adding several provisions that were proposed by rep sander levin and rep douglas bereuter including helsinkitype congressionalexecutive commission to monitor beijings human rights compliance and codifying antiimport surge protection measures contained in the uschina bilateral agreement hr 4444 provides that the commission shall 1 monitor acts of china which reflect compliance with or violation of certain human rights 2compile lists of persons believed to be imprisoned detained placed under house arrest tortured or otherwise persecuted by the china government due to their pursuit of human rights 3 monitor the development of the rule of law in china 4 monitor and encourage programs of the us government and private organizations that increase enforcement of human rights and develop the rule of law in china and 5 issue annual reports and require congressional hearings on the reports other provisions offer further monitoring and enforcement activities these include 1 an annual review within the wto of chinas compliance with its terms of accession 2 authorization of appropriations for three us government entities the departments of commerce and agriculture and the office of the us trade representative to expand us monitoring and enforcement of us trade agreements and trade laws with respect to china and 3 monitoring of us importation of products of forced or prison labor through task force which would work closely with the us customs service the bill also authorizes funds for programs to support china in its development the secretary of commerce in consultation with the secretary of state is authorized to create program to conduct rule of law training and technical assistance for commercial activities in china an expanded trade adjustment assistance program it is clear that the ongoing expansion of trade with china and other countries while supporting many jobs also involves disruption for many us workers two federal programs the trade adjustment assistance program taa and the naftatransitional adjustment assistance program naftataap support workers adversely affected by imports under both programs workers may receive cash payments job training and training allowances the difference between the taa and naftataap programs is that while both offer benefits to workers dislocated by increased imports only naftataap offers benefits to workers who lose their jobs because their plant relocates abroad most job losers under nafta are eligible for both programs of these 55 typically lose their job because their planthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20582crs6 12 workers dislocated because of either increased imports from or plant relocations to mexico or canada under nafta are eligible for benefits 13 bls finds risk of displacement higher even as job losses ease in 199597 period bna daily labor report august 20 1998 p d5 d13 14 see crs report 93355 plant closings mass layoffs and worker dislocations data issues by mary jane bolle 15 see crs issue brief ib98023 trade adjustment assistance for workers proposals for renewal and reform by james r storeyrelocates and for 85 of these the plant relocates to mexico authorization for both programs was extended through fy 2001 by the consolidated appropriations act pl 106113 for 1999 total funding for both the taa and naftataa programs including income support was 252 million serving total of 38000 for an average of 6613 per recipient critics of the taa program the only program which covers job loss as result of trade with china point out that it does not cover workers whose plants relocate to china only those who lose jobs to increased imports from china12 hr 4649 kaptur would rectify this by establishing transitional adjustment assistance program for trade with china similar to the naftataa program some critics argue additionally that the taa program is inadequate in helping workers transitio n into higherskilled jobs the department of labor found that only 29 of displaced fulltime wage and salary workers with reference to which had access to the taa program were able to gain re employment at the same or greater salary level one to three years later13 third criticism of the taa program is that it does not provide for the collection of specific data on us job loss to various countries for years congress tried unsuccessfully to get the department of labor to document such job loss14 under the naftataap program reporting requirements led to the collection of data on job loss to mexico and canada separated into nine reasons for job loss hr 4649 if passed could likely lead to the reporting of this data for trade with china in addition hr 1491 matsui s 220 moynihan and president clintons fy 2001 budget proposal would raise the training funding cap for the combined programs from 110 to 150 million and extend taa benefits to all workers who lose their job either to increased imports or the relocation of their plant abroad such provision could provide vehicle for collecting data on all plant relocations abroad15 conclusions with or without yes vote on pntr us trade with china will likely continue to grow and accelerate as us trade is growing with other developing countries such trade will continue to have winners and losers as us workers shift from declining import competing to growing export industries this suggests continuing need to consider assisting dislocated workers in ways that maintain their quality of life and help the us economy continue to grow
