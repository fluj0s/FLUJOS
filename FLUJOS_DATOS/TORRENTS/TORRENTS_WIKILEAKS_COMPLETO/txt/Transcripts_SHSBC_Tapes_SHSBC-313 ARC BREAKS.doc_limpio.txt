arc breaks lecture given on 11 july 1963 all right this is 11 july and ad 13 saint hill special briefing course havent thing to talk to you about you know everything there is to know and that would be all right except you know some things also that arent true my mission is trying to point out the essentials all right lot of things i could talk to you about but the thing youre going to have the most trouble with is arc breaks so i better start telling you something about arc breaks you have just received an hcob concerning assessment for arc break and frankly thats rather marvelous piece of stuff you get so you can wheel and deal with those arc break lists why youre right in there kicking the only difficulties with these arc break liststhe only real difficulties with themis the fact theyre always assessed on dirty needle and although you want clean needle for all listing and assessment the auditor should be banished to siberia or the american psychiatric association who tries to clean up the needle before he gets the arc break straightened out i can see it now somebodys going to do this i just know somebodys going to do this theyre going totheyre going to see that the needle is dirty and theyre going to have their arc break assessment list in front of them and theyre going to say how in the name of common sense can i possibly assess this because the needle is dirty and then spend the next ten or fifteen minutes trying to clean up the needle so they can do the arc break assessment now i know that is very sarcastic of and very unbelieving of and all that sort of thing but the truth of the matter is they would be missing this interesting point all dirty needles are arc breaks and the only thing that will clean up an arc break is the list so what youre doing there youre faced with the problemyoure faced with the problem of having to shoot down this bird in flight this arc break this black crow with gun thats got four ripples in the barrel you see its difficult and thats what is difficult about arc break assessments there really isnt anything else is difficult about it but even this isnt difficult if you very very sharply and definitely follow the rule of instant read and that will save you lot of eyestrain and myopia and worry now this makes an auditor who can do an arc break assessment accurately every time paragon amongst auditors and that is why its the most marvelous training process there could possibly be we saywe got aill give youill give you an idea see we got nice clean needle there it is flowing cleanly flowing cleanly we say recall an arc break and it goes bzzztbzzzbzzzdzztdzztbzzbbzzbzz it starts to fall the other way bzzz bzzzbbzzzz see weve said in essence turn on dirty needle there is reason for you to worry about it because thats in essence what youve said lets put it this way this is metaphorical but nevertheless might stay in your minds little bit better its what makes life rough see its arc breaks if you didnt have any arc breaks anyplace why life would be very smooth wouldnt it well the way to not have arc breaks by the way is to be in total coma or be able to handle the environment now therefore the whole idea of running arc breaks is smoothing out rough needles got the idea if you got rid of somebodys arc breaks you would have smooth needle let put it this wayyou understand it much better now if there were arc breaks on the persons track then button going out would not cause dirty needle so there is another echelon shallower on the subject of lists than lists and thats buttons lets take look at suppress how come you can get kick out of the button suppress well it is sitting on series of arc breaks chain of engrams is actually chain of arc breaks see theres the combinations of matter energy space time and thought the combinations of these and thetans reaction to them in their combinations his reaction to one or another combination of matter energy space time and significance see and then you have the matter energy space time and significance lets divide that up very sharply there are two things at work here one which well carelessly call the thetans reaction and the other which we will group as whole class of its own matter energy space time and significance now you see you could have matter energy spacei think who was it i dont knowdelacroix hes painter deschamps hes prize fighter whowho was it that invented that descartes yes yes yes i can remember some of the people on this planet hehheh yeah hehe had bunch of junk going excuse it was some wlosophical rendition where if tree fell in the forest and there was nobody theremaybe this was locke or humethe tree fell in the forest and nobody heard it would it have made sound well thisthis is bunch of nonsense you see in other words this is an entirely different school of thought this is school of thought of is existence see is existence and if youre not there does it exist i wrote story one time maybe you read it named fear and as the guy walks down the street he knows theyre taking the scenery down behind him and putting it up in front of him and he knows there is other scenery except the scenery which exists for him well im afraid thats that philosophy is the same order of magnitude see if tree falls in the forest and nobody is there does it make sound well in other words something has to be observed in order to be well that isnt true at all nothing has to be observed in order to beyou can just forget about that for all practical purposes if you ever get entangled in on iti probably shouldnt ever have mentioned it i might now have tangled you in something you might not otherwise have ever confronted but its basis of this if theres some matter energy space and time lying out on the lawn out there then it is simply there isnt it and youre here and its there all right thats fine thats fine thats two different orders of action youre not looking on it or otherwise now for reaction to exist you have to look at it know about it hear about it confront or not confront it in some gradient of some kind or another see now thats what i mean when i say your reaction to matter energy space time thetans reaction to matter energy space time and significance see so youve got the reaction here and youve got the matter energy space time and significance over here and we dontwere not even slightly involved with the question of whether or not it doesnt exist if we dont look at it and all of this sort of stuff you get into the goal to experience in order to experience it it has to be there the truth of the matter is do you know that you cantit can be that you just dont know about something and it goes to pieces and you still dont know about it and you see youve never seen it never had any experience with it never confronted it or anything else and you then dont have any reaction to it you neither have notknowing reaction or knowing reaction to it you dont have any reaction to it at all because as far as you were concerned it didnt exist so the relationship between the thetans reaction and matter energy space time and significance as package you see is communication and to be affected by something one must communicate with it or not communicate with it knowingly you can actually shed tremendous amount of philosophic balderdash if you just lay it out along those crude lines theres an automobile accident taking place four miles from here let us say at this moment if we dont communicate with it we dont see the remains of the accident we dont know the people involved in it we dont know that it has occurred we dont even read about it in the paper see there is interaction we are not in some esoteric fashion influenced by this automobile accident it requires communication to be influenced by the automobile accident but but remember if we knew the automobile accident was going to take place and we carefully didnt know it was going to take place that matter how obliquely or how well forgotten is still communication its this type of communication that gets thetan in trouble you see hes been there and he didnt communicate andcarefully and he made picture of it or put up wall against it or protested it or something like that and hes got this picture and then doesnt want to confront the picture either because itsthe significance in the picture now has been added to by his reaction and his reaction was that he didnt want to communicate with it so thetans reaction becomes part of all observed or carefully not observed matter energy space time and significance in other words the reaction factor adds to the matter energy space time and significance and this then with the new significance of the thetans reaction time made into mental image picture becomes the time track so the matter energy space time and significance has added into it the thetans reaction see so past is different than present in that the picture of the past has had added into it the thetans reaction to it you follow that so you see past is different than present time now in the future we add hope or hopelessness so therefore the future also has in it reaction to it but in view of the fact that its not often made up into pictures although sometimes it is theyre just wholecloth dreamups you see theyre not pressures against the physical universe or actual pictures but you know you canyou can cause somebody to run future track you want to horrify some pc sometime scatter him out of gpm see gpms tend to remain as present time you know thats their best forte they get you all mixed up because they seem to be in present time and you see the dichotomy has destroyed their time factor and made an instantaneousness and made them drift on the time track instead of staying anchored down where they should be on the time track you see and of course thetan thinks its right there and you cant get date on something i dont advise you to do this because its upsetting to the pc but im just telling you phenomenon this is not practical or workable thing perhaps but you might like to do something with it just to give you an interesting thing you cant get read on this facsimile and you know doggone well its there ask if it was tomorrow or yesterday it shakes it out of present time and you all of sudden get read on it in spite of the fact the pc usually arc breaks now that of course is past which seems to be the present and requires reaction to it in the present but has already got reaction in it so thetan takes his reaction out of this and wears it in present time and you have the factor of restimulation of reaction you got restimulation then of what he has already reacted to so his reactions of the past become his reactions of the present if you want to have time sometime i wont take up your time right now but maybeand box this thing around one way or the other because of course it becomes very complicated when you have audited an engram the reaction to the engram in the session becomes part of the session time track even though the facsimile itself has been erased off the main time track and you still have little tiny crossreaction it hasnt got any teeth in it to amount to anything but youve got this little tiny shadow of an incident riding in pt at that session moment and i use this occasionally by trying to find out what was the needle reaction at certain period of an auditing session all i have to do is momentarily return the pc to that exact instant of the auditing session and theres just enough needle reaction left to give one kick it will give one small kick it doesnt really represent charge all it represents is the action pattern of the observed present you might even be able to get another rocket read out of helatrobus implant series out of pt but boy would you have to sweat at it and it wouldnt have the force or power you see of the original rocket read at all but you could actually get it to react on the meter if you really worked it over and got the pc at that exact moment when the meter is reacting in other words at any given instant of the time track you can rekindle any given instantor any given reaction the time track has reaction added to it as making it different then than present time present time really doesnt have reaction in it except as it borrows it off the time track or it is added to present time by the thetan lets take the luckless fellow who is looking for happiness and never puts any happiness into his reaction to present time heh look that one over for moment see now the only reactions to matter energy space time and significance that exists on the whole track is the thetans reaction to added to the matter energy space time and significance as mental image picture so now he goes back on the track trying to be happy about something but if he of course did not have the reaction of happiness to the matter energy space time and significance at the time it occurred he will then have only an unhappy reaction this is quitethis is quite horrible you could actually very funny very funny experiment with the mind see you could lay out twenty four hours or twelve hours or eight hours or something in which you are going to put happy reaction into everything and you go out and see the garbage pail and you say oh how happy i am you see about the garbage pail rains coming down oh beautiful rain i mean justjust with malice aforethought you know bark your shins oh wonderful pain you know just rack yourself up few hours of this see and then as the few days go by why get somebody to audit you through it you see and youll have the most idiotic feeling of happiness you see how happy i was certainly happy that day quite remarkable now weve agreed that certain things should be reacted to in certain ways theres certain things we are supposed to be horrified about were supposed to be happy about and one of the things that almost breaks your back sometimes trying to live and exist and be cheerful in present time is things youre supposed to be happy about is pushed in your lap see by your fellows or life only you dont happen to be happy about these things and you never have been happy about this but youre supposed to be happy about this thing you see and actually your reaction is quite horrible do you see and you know birthday present or something like this when youresomething and oh thank you you know youre building up ridge between your past reaction to the clown that they gave you for your birthday present you see or birthdays in general or the fact that youre really getting on and you dont like to think about it various things of that character you see and you build up ridge between your present forced reaction for social purposes you see and your past reaction to such things and it makes you feel wog grog what whats whats going on so this can become very involved the thetans reaction to matter energy space time and significance then enters into upperechelon complications which are simply the back and forth interplay of favorable and unfavorable reactions dont you see all complicated by the nowim supposedto reactions this gets quite confusing after while and the reality of the situation goes by the boards it just gets to be too strenuous to get this many reactions through your noggin so you just say well its all unreal and you put it behind you and you want nothing more to do with it and then it can chew on the back of your neck without any interruption from there on well you say well i would feel all right if we just didnt keep stirring up these engrams and so forth well i dont know that you would or wouldnt because theyre all there ready to be stirred up and if youre not going to stir them up lifes going to and what do you want to do leave it on total automatic so you can square away these things and take care of them and you can handle this various situation but sometimes these reactions rather get in your hair and the only errors that can be made in an auditing session which are upsetting at all actually are wrong date wrong duration those are very upsetting very upsetting they tend to louse case up i dont know anything else that louses case up well now lets talk about this smooth needle none ofnone of the immediate past is in restimulation see needles smooth so forth talking about 2h now see nothing nothings in restimulation theres miscommunication going on here theres reaction to the reality you see of the matter energy space time and significance contained and recorded in the bank you see and this needles sweeping beautifully everythings going along and you say recall an arc break well youre asking for moment of miscommunication of some kind or another by definition an arc break is affinity reality and communication gone wog so of course that expresses itself in dirty needle well it normally became an arc break because it bypassed some charge which was restimulated it restimulated some charge and this became unknown to the individual and he attributed the reasons for the arc break to something else and introduced lie into the situation and then went on feeling bad about it because the lie gave it persistence the only way you get persistence is with lie unless you just postulate it will persist all right lets look at this phenomena again here now the reaction of the thetan can be phrased as his concept of affinity with regard to something whether his imsupposedtobe or natively postulated right on the spot his reactionhis reaction on the subject of reality and his reaction is of course form of communication and the reaction is about you see is about reality and results in feeling of affinity or misaffinity of some kind or another theres how you get the bridge between thetan at point and matter energy space time and significance over here at point b and the reaction which takes place between these two things is expressed in terms of affinity reality and communication concerning the matter energy space time and significance which he is confronting monitored by past affinity reality and communication concerning similar matter energy space time and significances of the past you got that complex actually very simple its simple as long as you can retain somewhat detached outlook you get involved in the middle of the battle and theres so many swords clashing against so many shields and helmets theres so many hoofs belonging to so many different horses involved in all this and arrows intended for elsewhere landing nowheres or in you and so forth you dont have time to retain detached attitude you tend to put it on total reaction total reaction but that is caused by condensation of time so that what we really get the brunt of in this universe is an insufficiency of time now you get an insufficiency of time by staying on the time track you think thats an idiotic statement its just very very factual you start protesting time somebody incarcerates you and gives you couple of hundred years in the jug and youre sitting there jog jog and instead of using it to clean up your engrams or something like this why there you are with too much time on your hands oooh thats your consideration your reaction to the time in the jug is actually unwanted location you dont want that location and you blame it on time and you confuse location and time and blame time so the basic lie on the track is of course to confuse time and location and curse location because of time or time because of location and you get these two things mixed up and youve had it now the truth of the matter is very few years ago actually practically yesterdaya few trillion trillion years ago in actual factyou probably didnt stick on the time track now the further back you go the less accurate you were with positioning yourself in present time now i shouldnt use the word accurate the lessthe less you were fixed into present time you were slippery on the subject you would slide around without thinking about it and you could at will go yesterday and go tomorrow see time is very artificial consideration we see this sometimes in science fiction where somebody has mastered time machine there arent any time machines except an ot hes time machine and he actually cant carry stuff back into the past or restore it in the future without simply creating it again in the past and creating it in the future of course i dont know that the past isnt there in some instances if its been fixed to stay there but this is very interesting consideration you didnt necessarily find yourself totally surrounded by the environment of present time you could went yesterday and that of course was very short jump more likely it was hundred years you go back hundred years for short nap this was very useful this was very useful you could slip around all over the place you wouldnt necessarily find mest there but you began to be cursed and to curse this proposition because nobody was sufficiently fixed and you couldnt stay in communication with people very easily who kept sliding hundred years ago and certain impatience would generate one way or the other but that impatience was not destructive and ordinary living was not destructive it had to be quite cataclysmic somebody had to louse up time and louse up location before living became unbearable you know there had to be such things as jails and protested time and couldnt getoutofs and miserable circumstances and all of this sort of thing before you started getting wound up in circle and the only thing that was capable of doing this by the way was implants gpm implantsabout the only thing that could louse this thing up you would probably be like that today if you didnt have few of these implants all right now the point i mean you would have lasted through processing or processing this can get into disrepute very easily you go yesterday you see you see them building new courthouse see so you throw yourself back down the time track one way or the other and choose the location where theyre going to build courthouse dig hole in the ground and roof it over with very thin coat of shale they build so much weight in the future on this spotyou see they build just so much weight in that courthouse and it eventually falls in youre not even there the day it falls in you got an alibi well nonsense of this sort of thing proposes itself but in actual factin actual fact you didnt have too much trouble with time and you could slip around on the subject of time very easily if you have fixed time you get fixed reaction you get presence of self and the matter energy space and time which necessitates reaction youve got to have reaction now this is an enforced reaction youthere is way of escaping reaction you cant drift back thousand years just sit this one out now you slip back thousand years because you dare not confront something you find yourself popping up those thousand years in hurry because you got reason why you got noconfront going of some kind or another but anyway to be very uninvolved about the situation here you are with very thin fixed present time and of course you have very little time and it is the absence of time or the presence of timethats the unwanted absence unwanted presence of timewhich gives problems the source of all problems is time if you want to take apart somebodys problems on very esoteric level you just start scouting time down you start taking his time apart on the subject of his problems this is quite amusing you say tell problem you have had see well so and so and so and so and so and so and you say all right now what time was awry there where was there too much time where was there too little time andnow dont mistake this is not oneway road to glory because it has tendency to become little bit limited and is slightly esoteric and its the quality of reaction you see is arc but im just showing you here that you could just choose one of these points the most important one of matter energy space and time and significance and you can just change that time reactions to that time as pointwhich you normally wouldnt wouldnt explore at all on the single subject of problems you know tell problem youve had so and so all right how was the time awry what was the matter with time at that point well i didnt have enough time or i had too much time this is the normal reaction you could do some shredding of the bank you could knock the guy around in the bank you would tend to move him on the time track you could do some interesting things and he sure wouldnt have the problems that he had you see and one of the problems you have with study for instance is insufficient time one of the problems i have with teaching you is insufficient time time is made insufficient by the economic status of the thing or the dear loved ones who keep pestering you and youwe wouldnt have any problem at all with any student you see if it just werent for these two factors theyre very simple factors the factors of economics and the factor of familial or organizational relationships you see these factors kicked out would only then be monitored by the factor well you can get old you know sitting around in body i didnt mean any particular student but the pointthe point im making here is that problems the peculiar thing called problem is quite different than reaction and the peculiar thing called problem is adjusted by simply an adjustment of just this one little part of matter energy space time and significance just adjust the time and you do something now oddly enough you can also adjust problems by location less effectively but you can still adjust them by location location is part of matter energy space and time because by space and energy or mass we of course have it understood that it is someplace or is going through certain location in space so we say you could adjust that by that well spotting spots in spacejust that all by itself produces some remarkable reactions because its handling just this one little thing called location and that of course will handle some of these problems now if somebody goes out here and runs into tree with car about your fastest processnot necessarily the best process but the process which would go all the way down and fit his case level at the moment which could be quite lowwould just run reach and withdraw on the tree go out and find the actual tree see that spot in space see and go reach and withdraw on the tree and then go find the car wherever it is and run reach and withdraw on the car and reach and withdraw on the tree and reach and withdraw on the car i dont care if the car is up in the garage someplace flatten it with the car you see flatten it with the tree touch all the ground around there and so forth and then you say well whats the time factors involved well if we hadnt been going so fast we wouldnt have hit so hard thats the obvious factor all impact is based on scarcity of time theres too much happening in too little time now every time you as thetan have rendered some horrendous and damaging impact you of course have scrunched these things up thats not necessarily aberrative in its theres nothing you do by the way that is very aberrative over period of time youve committed overts and damaged people and youll commit overts against the greater good of the greater number of dynamics and then you will consider that you dont deserve to go anyplace or be up but thats holding yourself in the ownin your own trap in just the normal course of well theres war and you shot some soldiers and you got shot at you lost couple of buddies and your wife turned into barfly something like this you know normal course of existence of the war and so forth thats about as aberrative as blowing your nose see thats nothing see nothing you lose three or four boyfriends and that sort of thing thats nothing see not on the long line of aberration because none of that is sufficient to stand forever in space or completely shut off the whole line you see you have to get some very interestingly complicated mechanisms making these facsimiles of people stay in present time bothering them all the time with them reacting against them all the time to build up tremendous lot of reactions which then becomes the personality of the individual see that trick had to be introduced to it theres only that trick by the way thats why you can run engrams today and why you suddenly got engrams today because thats the chief engram thats what makes engrams unrunnable thats why we couldnt run engrams you see well we can handle that why we can run engrams and we can clear up the track all right now lets get back to this thing called reaction your reaction to matter energy space and time is couched in numerous ways but where those reactions tend to not communicate or tend to obsessively communicate you rough up energy energy gets roughed up and then it stays in the picture and so forth in other words the energy is flowing at one foot per second and you get in hurry and you make it flow at three feet per second but it isnt really flowing that way or you prevent it from flowing at one foot per second and make it flow one inch per second in other words the normal course of flows is interrupted because of the existence of problem or an obsession to be at it or feeling youve got to get away from it or you know its bad or its this or its that and all of these things result in the fact that you bypass charge charge is there so you go into this thing crunch and you restimulate some charge or you try to get away fromzzrrmmm and so forth well whats dictating this its former reactions what gets kindled there is former reaction of some kind or another and that former reaction throws into restimulation some earlier engrams some earlier arc breaks some earlier this some earlier that see you get how thishow this works in other words you confront matter energy space time and significance in certain way and there will be picture of similar matter energy space time and significance confronted in certain way which is reactivated by your reaction to the present matter energy space time and significance in other words you take package b and you react towell youone of you girls sees mouse on the floor see heres one of the things drives women mad thats because its an imsupposedto see and you see mouse on the floor and reaction to the mouse is yaaoww see all right now the last mouse you saw before this you see your reaction was duplicate you went yaaoww and with the mouse before that that you saw see your reaction to that was yaaoww so youve got three yaaowws now those former onesthose former ones you understand are in picture form and the present one is in matter energy space and time form see but the others are copies of this same thing so your reaction here rekindles the reaction then so you get that picture pulled in now that reaction intensifies this reaction its like hooking two locomotives up to where one was only pulling before see now because you never scented the second locomotive you wonder why did i yaaoww so hard here becomes inexplicable its missed charge see that now the auditor comes along and he says the reason why you went yaaoww here is because formerly you went yaaoww and the person says oh oh yes yes of course wewe dont even really have to spot when we formerly went yaaoww because what weve done is just kick off not the facsimile we handled the reaction factor of the facsimile got it we just handled one little piece of this we handled that piece most intimate to the thetan which was his reaction his arc so when we handle that that asises fast so the other charge drops out and you cease to have bypassed charge follow this you beyou better get good grip on this i can see some of you little floundering on this ive given you lot of data here all of sudden now the only thingthe only thing that caused restimulation of yesterdays charge was the fact that you reacted the same way today that you reacted yesterday the devil with the situation the reaction was the same so when the reaction was the same you pulled in yesterdays situation unwittingly pulled in yesterdays situation and didnt even know it its because the reaction was the same youre not even vaguely interested in running out yesterdays association as facsimile youre just interested in clipping out of it tsk this one little piece of it which is reaction you just want to do reactionectomy because your reaction today restimulated your reaction in the yesterday incident see now you say to the guy well the reason you reacted to mouse today was because you reacted to mouse same way yesterday oh similar incident yesterday oh yes of course he doesnt even know about it all of sudden he feels all right its very strange phenomenon unless you understand what youre kicking out all youre doing is youre saying reaction todayreaction yesterday youve actually matched terminals two things and they go bzzt see youre handling reactions now this is quite different than handling the facsimile now lets go back and go all over this thing again very short sweet simple you got thetan at point and you got matter energy space time and significance at point b and the reaction or the interaction between these two things i should say is the thetans reaction to the matter energy space time and significance at point b see you understand the reaction to it and that reaction to it is expressed in our language in arc his arc with regard to it eightynine cars pile up in horrendous pier on the freeway see i think its the real reason they have freewaysthey can pile up more cars on them more suddenly and here you have facsimile of eightynine cars piled up on each other now boy there istheres matter energy space time and significance eightynine cars piled up on the freeway crunch see now theres another thing here and that is thetans reaction to this didnt matter whether he was part of it or observed it or read it in the paper or something like this you understand his reaction is different thing now youryour quarrel with many things that are wrong in the world and my quarrel with many things that are wrong with the world is because our reactions are quite different to the other peoples reactions to the same thing now you understand its just eightynine cars piled up on the freeway now that in present time is and as it becomes yesterday is facsimile of what had been you see now that is thing thats facsimile now were not talking about taking apartthis is running engrams see were not talking about taking apart these eightynine cars piled up on the freeway thats not what were talking about see were just talking about the guys reaction to it and thats all you handle on an arc break you get yourself so involved with these eightynine cars piled up on the freeway as matter energy space time and significance that you never can sort out the guys reaction to it you say oh well youve got an arc break because you were driving down the street and you saw two cars almost hit and you started cursing the police department or the highway department or drivers oh yes now is thatdid that restimulate an earliersimilar incident and he says dont know but your meter says tsk earliersimilar incident you say it restimulated an earlier similar incident and he says oh all of sudden he doesnt have an arc break he doesnt quite understand why or how or anything else see pure magic all right now if you didnt understand that you were just supposed to handle his reaction youre liable to be doing this well lets see similar incident huh earliersimilar incidentwhen was this earlier similar incident lets handle the time of the earliersimilar incident ohhhh all right when was this earliersimilar incident huh nineteen fortyeight oh in 1948 well what was it that happened in 1948 oh eightynine cars on the freeway piled up which car were you in youre running mr man it isnt that you cant run it but youre now in for long arduous job because this is basic on automobile accidents for this thetan nineteen fortyeight ohahhahaha i can see it now on that monocycle eightynine trillion years ago engaged on his eight billionth personal private accident you got long chain see and youre going to cut into it at the end and cure an arc break youre not going to do anything at all what you want to handle is his reaction heres the way to handle it see you say oh youre down the street and you had an arc break with other drivers and you had an awful argument is that right all right was it this was it that was it this was it that was you know youre trying to sort out in the incident itself was anything missed you see was itany affinity in the incident missed any reality communication so on and so on and earlier communication break an earlier incident restimulated pang you say well its always an earlier incident restimulated well it doesnt always show up that way see and you say well it was an earlier incident restimulated you had an earlier incident of similar kind restimulated there on the street when you had that upset huh huh oh what do you know its all right with him the needle quiets out sometimes the eager beaver says what was it what was it perfectly all right let him do it what was it what was it let him do it dont help him out he says oh lets see earlier incident earlier incident earlier oh he says its that eiahtvninecar pileup on the freeway yeeaass oh yeah i was upset the same way and you say thank you very much recall an arc break because if you do another thing youre walkingnot on eggsmuch thinner and crisper than that all you have to do is direct his attention direct his interest and he passes over from point and now straight over to b and jumps in without the benefit of swimming trunks or anything else hes just in and gone you understand the way to get somebody in an incidentyou dont use this technique anymoreis just ask him for the largest object in the incident pcs mentioned house recently you say all right the house what kind of house was it there he is hes right in the incident you can push him over there using matter energy space time and significance well actually you can peel these things off by doing reactionectomy with arc you understand those mechanics youll see them work out youll see them work out in yourself youll recognize eventually that the only time you fail to put your finger on it is when you didnt have the requisite item on your arc break list your arc break list is insufficiently complete lets do some arc breaks in auditing all right recall an auditing arc break in the last month all right youve got what how many processes how many process might have been done lets look them over how many lists would you have to run on this arc break or youd have to say all right what process were you doing in that arc break you just recalled what process were you doing what was being done on you as process all right very good your itemor the reason for the arc breakis on that list see because youve got listing arc break you got session arc break listing arc breaks engram running arc breaks you see and implant arc break lists youve got all these lists because theres number of combinations that can causeand these are empirically worked out not just intellectually see and you normally will find these things the only thing i would add to both 3n and r3r because auditors are switching between them unintelligibly some daytimes is on each one wrong date wrong duration earlier wrong date earlier wrong duration and i put those four questions on both the 3n and the r3r arc break lists thats correction of the lists i put those on just to make awful sure because people do an awful lot of illegal dating im beginning to find out and durationing and so forth while running 3n they do an awful lot of it see it isnt necessary at all and yet they do it and so they make mistake in it and then everything goes blooey on it and then they do 3n arc break assessment form and of course the wrong date wrong duration are on the r3r assessment form so they dont find the cause for the arc break now all arc breaks become because ofive left you adrift here some way or another you recognize that any pat procedure would have its arc break list which would give all types of charge that might get bypassed because these are just lists of charge that might get bypassed possibly its bypassable charge and thats all an arc break list is and when you go and make one up as you may well do one fine day you make up an arc break listall youll have to doyou find yourself sitting someplace without any materials you see you havent got any lists with you and so forth you can sit down and make them up by just figuring out well whats all the kinds of charge i might bypass in this particular procedure or what are all the types of charge i might bypass in session and then of course we remember that its theits current in the session or earlier in some other session or earlier someplace else so we always sayweve got the item that might get bypassed and then weve got the same item with earlier in front of it see see its always double see the wrong date we always of course then follow it up by saying was an earlier wrong date found you see because we might have just kicked in yesterdays session and unwittingly had wrong date in yesterdays sessionnot suspected it until today now the trouble with arc breaks is they never rekindle until theyre keyed in and an arc break is always keyin it is never the fact it is always the followup from the fact so you would almost always get missed withhold to read on an arc break list inevitably missed withhold is going to read because thats of course the common denominator of all arc breaks and it requires missed withhold to key in the arc break so you sometimes find grandly and gorgeously missed withhold and tell the pc its missed withhold and the arc break doesnt diminish the missed withhold you see just keyed in the thing and if i had my way about it in actual fact i would omit missed withhold because it might be trap it requires missed withhold and youre liable to find the missed withhold and tell the pc its it while having date trillion years wrong in an incident see the missed withhold keyed it therefore hes so fixated on the keyin that he doesyou dont get the other on the list and you say well is there wrong date in this session and its null everythings null do you have missed withhold see bang yes oh yes i so on and so onyou said soandso and you did in you dog see and thats funny reaction to an arc break that isnt the curative reaction youll very often say well we found wrong goal youll say very innocently solving your arc break you see we found wrong goal goddammit i told you that goal was you didnt find it tsk tsk tsk not the right bypassed charge you found the keyin and you very often find the keyin which just simply keys the bypassed charge in again you sometimes will see this happen you give this list right on out down the line and you say well ive got we found wrong goal on you see found wrong goal ohhh yes i said that goal was wrong goddamn yaaayaaayaa dont be upset you didnt do wrong assessment youve just found the keyin now lets go back and do another assessment and find the bypassed charge first thing you do with something like that is to find out lets see am i assessing the right list thats an awful good thing to ask yourself because youre liable to get kind of rattled in the middle of an arc break as an auditor see you all of sudden find with horror youre not you thought you were doing 3n but you just remembered that early in the session you dated and durationed an engram you dated and durationed something early in the session oh thatsyouve run some r3r ah lets get that r3r list out dont do the 3n one again and work yourself to death you already did that have some confidence in your own assessing nothing read so it isnt on it get another list get another list and you go down the line well we restimulated finding wrong goal in an earlier session on you oh hmmmm kidding thats why i was so arc broke last month yeah thats why i was mad at charlie yeah that thats the wrong goal to be titwillow thats the wrong goal you didnt even tell him what one it is and he brightens up all the way along the line and he goes along just fine you see everything is fine now get the idea you understand the mechanics of the thing you can handle it there are various types of charge that you can bypass what do you mean by bypass charge well kick it without revealing it set up reaction between point and b without disclosing it to the pc or yourself and when violent reaction exists between point and point b in session which is totally unknown to both the auditor and the pc it will continue to be violent reaction until the reaction is spotted you dont have to spot the incident you have to spot the reaction now what you want to do is get rid of that reaction just by assessing it out and indicating it you dont have to be fancy about it now one of the things which you make mistake on on arc breaks is this its very short and very simple and something i hope youll remember it only requires that you locate and indicate the bypassed charge and if you are called upon because the arc break didnt clear up to go further into it and date the incident and get the pc to remember it and some straightwire and get it all patched up and get it all glued together somehow or another and go to lot of work after that assessment you didnt find the bypassed charge you got that and any time youre sitting there and say well the pc said well i didnt see itdid you say its the wrong goaldo you suppose its this goal were working on right now i dont think its this goal were working on right now doesnt seem to be this goal were working on i just suppose suppose well it maymay be an earlier goal and so forth well whatwhawhats thewhats the date of this bypassed goal whawhats whats the date of this goal that weve missed whatswhats thewhats the date wha wha whats the date of this goal weve missed you say well aaawuuwawuuuwaall right i try to find thefind the goal i mean uhhhto find the date of the knock it off man the pc that the pc has to do something else now means you didnt find the bypassed charge maybe it isnt on the list youre using ever think of that you see youll be doing 3n and you get session arc break and you do 3n assessment thinking the error is totally in 3nas it usually isbut you say well theres little tick here on uh missed withhold you had missed withhold well whwhawhat was the missed withhold when did we miss this with withhold what what what where where say waitwhatwhoa uh what what missed withhold well why didnt you catch it earlier in the session i dont have any you keep nagging nagging and nagging with these mid ruds butwhawhy and so well why spend any time on it lets getlets get another sheet and assess it lets add to our list lets do something because this is invariably wrong in the presence of that reaction is you have not identified the bypassed charge thats all if you dont know that youll discard this system because youll get loses youll say well it cures up most arc breaks it cures all arc breaks providing you can identify the bypassed charge if it didnt cure the arc break either it isnt comprehensibly on the listsee the pc didnt understand it when it was reador it isnt on the list which you are using now ive seen two instances of this very recently very skilled auditing and the arc break was not cured but was totally available simply because it was forgotten the little piece of another thing was run in this session besides what was being run in this session but the arc break assessment was made on the main thing being run in the session but the arc break bypassed charge was on those three minutes of other process which both auditor and pc had completely forgotten you feel like perfect jackass sometimes on this because three or four days after youve hadrough three or four days and you accidentally pick up the right sheet or you add something to your list and youre doing another assessment on the same pc and you all of sudden find ever since tuesday we have had wrong goal but were not running goals how could we have had wrong goal since tuesday were not running anything but engrams how could it be yet there it is go into it sometime session goal i know it doesnt sound very strenuous but he set session goal to not be afraid that was all it took hehheh yet you havent been running 3n but there was goal these things are sometimes very wild youre not running r3r youre running 3n and youre not dating anything and youre notyou can date but you werent dating anything and youd just been going on and everythings been perfectly happy and pc nattery and nothing getting done and the rr disappearing and accidentally you trigger something and you decide that you better do this 3r3 assessment form and you find out youve had wrong duration youve had wrong duration and the wrong duration has been sitting right there but whats the wrong duration oh well the week beforethe week before in the very area youre running you tried to find how long this implant series had required and youd gotten four hundred and sixtyseven trillion trillion years and it was wrong duration since it only happened particularly fortythree trillion years ago you see and you said well we just kind of cant make it out you said to yourself but you kind of never bothered to tell the pc and so forth well this might lay doggo for whole week the pc felt fine and everything was going along fine and then all of sudden bbrowww see some session arc break missed withhold in the session keyed this other one and there that other one was lying around your neck like casket see you feel like perfect blithering idiot sometimes on these things sessions later you suddenly collide with one you know and its been there all the time pcs been hard to audit youve industriously assessed everything you could think of you did your very very best and itll have some weird little curve on it of some kind or another that really isnt curve at all its staring you right in the face and it should have been right there all the time you should have recognized it the pc should have recognized it everybody should have seen it but you didnt theyre sneakers some of these things real sneakers and it cuts right down to the wrong date wrong duration wrong incident you find out much to your horror that youve been running five implant serieses simultaneously five implant serieses simultaneously the poor pc has been going the first two items out of implant three series you see and the next two items out of implant five and the next two items out of implant one and of course this makes the other items restimulated in each one of the other implants makes you feel kind of green sometimes you look at it and yet it was apparently all running all right and you said all right is this just one series and he coughed at the moment or something you know and you never worried about it when you went over it and then all of sudden youreor youre running series which is misdated by god knows how long youve got whole gpm and it took place hundred years ago and you say how the hell did it get up this close to present time what the hells this all about well some wildcat area someplace or another and they just never got the word that its passed you use psychiatry now and theyre still at it eager beaver and theyre putting in to be dead do you know to be dead to be dead to be dead you know and so forthand you said oh look at this look at this boy to be dead pow man man hes right there at the beginning of the helatrobus implants says all right lets get this lets get this all right to be dead all right thats fine now lets get dead nix dead well nix dead doesnt fire well lets random list on this lets random list dead not deadfires oh well all right nix dead doesnt fire oh you sweat yourself green try to get in there you see all right well you finally manage to persuade him to get nix dead to fire youve said it often enough or some such and you say all right now lets get absolutably dead absolutably dead theres your line plot right there there it is there it is absolutably deaddoesnt fire doesnt fire nix absolutably dead that doesnt fire aw i guess he cant run gpms well lets come off of this goal lets get onto some other things here lets try you out on assessment r3r halfway through your assessment on r3r all of sudden puts death down on the line or something like that and blows his head off see volcano never erupted as fast or as furiously or as inexplicably and you say what the hell happened and you get out listingbecause youre listing see and you get out listing arc break list and you say all right all right i chopped communication of yours in the session all right all right but you shouldnt do it he says i guess arc break assessing doesnt work the arc break was when you were doing 3n its on another list heh and like one day youre plowing along you suddenly have occasion to do 3n assessment and you find wrong goal find wrong date 3n wrong date what the hell could it be wrong date you just keep missing and all of sudden he says i get the idea its had something to do with death and you said to be dead well whatis it the wrong date of that is that it youre trying to follow through and understand this thing well what is the date of that eighteen sixtytwo wasnt gpm it was doctor and hospital corpsman in the civil war arguing over the top of the corpse and you thought you were running gpm they rocket read so that was it that gives you some idea now theres where you tangle up you just dont use the right list for the right action but if you do find the bypassed charge youve got it and its onthe bulk of them are on lists and you can locate them and so forth and if they dont take care of the whole arc break right now you havent found what it is now thats the one thing i want to impress you with because otherwise youre just going to tear yourselves wrong side out tryingbecause the pc now will want to remember and the pc will want this and the pc will want that and the pc will want it dated and so forth well whats all this reaction its just you havent found the bypassed charge thats all and youve found some cousin to it someplace or another and youve just keyed in something else follow it arc breaks consist of bypassed charge they always go out of line the moment you get the reaction which the reaction of course is the pcs regard toward an incident or his reaction to an incident when you get that spotted when you get what kind of reaction it was in general classification to what your arc break blows up if your arc break doesnt blow up you havent found the bypassed charge and the reaction between and b therefore is not explained okay well i wish you lots of luck with it thank you
