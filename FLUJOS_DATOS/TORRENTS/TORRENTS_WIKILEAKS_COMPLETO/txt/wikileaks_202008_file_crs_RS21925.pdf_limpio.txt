was stated to have affected adversely american foreign policy damaged abroad the image of american democracy and impaired public confidence in the financial integrity of american corporations1 congress responded with the passage of the foreign co rrupt practices act of 19772 the principal purpose of the 1977 act was to preven t corporate bribery of foreign officials it has three major provisions to attempt to accomplish this purpose the first major provision amended section 13b3 of the securities exchange act of 19344 to require issuers which must register their securities with the sec to keep detailed books records and accounts which accurately record corporate payments and transactions the second major provision required sec regist ered issuers to in stitute and maintain an internal accounting control system to assure managements control authority and responsibility over the firms assets5 the third major provision of the origin 1977 foreign corrupt practices act prohibited domestic corporations whether or not registered with the sec from corruptly bribing foreign official foreign political party party official or candidate for the purpose of obtaining or maintaining bus iness two provisions of the 1977 act6 make it crime for any american business to use the mails or interstate commerce to offer or pay money or anything of value to foreign official or to foreign political party party official or candidate for foreign political office in order to influence the person in his decisionmaking or to use his influence to assist the firm in obtaining or retaining business the 1977 act also prohibits the payment of money to any person by business if the business knew or had reason to know that the pa yment was to be used to bribe foreign official for his influence in obtaining or retaining business congressional intent appears to place an affirmative res ponsib ility on the corporation to exercise control over itshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21925crs3

payments made to them to bribe foreign officials7 under the 1977 act not all payments to employees of foreign governments were intended by congress to be considered illegal bribes for example the definition of foreign official excluded employees of foreign government whose duties are essentially ministerial or clerical also the legislative history of the act specifically stated that it was not intended to cover grease payments to foreign officials explained as payments for expediting shipments through customs or placing transatlantic telephone call securing requi red permits or obtaining adequate police protection transactions which may involve ev the proper performance of duties8 the legislative history also suggested that extortions of m oney by foreign officials may be used as defense against bribery charges by business if its property or lives of its employees have been threatened an example used to illu strate acceptable payments was the payment to foreign official to prevent the dynamiting of an oil rig9 almost since passage of the 1977 act fre quent criticism of the operation of the act occurred opponents argued that the act had chilling effect upon united states export trade and that many companie s ceased foreign operations rath er than face the uncertainties and the burdens of the act critics of the 1977 act also argued for removal of the reason to knowstandard concerning liability for actions of firms agent in foreign country this would eliminate the legal responsibility of the ma nagement of domestic firm over the unauthorized and undirected actions of an ag ent without the necessity of managements also showing that it had reason to know that the agent was using corporate funds payments or commissions to bribe foreign officials these critics argued that american firms should not have to bear the respons ibility of playing detective concerning the independent actions of persons that they retained as agents in foreign countries critics also contended that the internal accounting controls required by the 1977 act were too costly and burdensome upon domestic firms especially when potential criminal penalties within the act for failure to institute adequate controls arguably made officials of firms overly and unnecessarily cautious in implementing costly accounting controls the public recordkeeping requirements we re also criticized as unduly burdensome critics of the act argued for materiality st andard for public recordkeeping in which firm would be required to report only expend itures and outlays deemed material to the profits and revenues of the firm another frequent criticism of the 1977 ac t was that the united states was more interested in exporting its cultural biases than its products it was argued that in nations in which acceptance of fee or payment by government official from one doing business with the government is customary and not unlawful under the laws of that nation violation of united states law should occur critics also argued that an internationalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21925crs4 10 pl 100418 title v 102 stat 1107 1988 11 hr ept 100576 at 916917 1988 12 hr ept 100576 at 917 1988agreement among the worlds industrialized nations prohib iting businesses of all those countries from bribing foreign officials wa s necessary to preven t businesses of other countries from gaining an unfair and harm ful competitive advantage over american businesses in response to these criticisms congress fo r number of years considered amending the 1977 foreign corrupt practices act after considerable debate th rough at least three congresses the foreign corrupt practices ac t amendments of 1988 were signed into law as title v of the omnibus trad and competitiveness act of 198810 on august 23 1988 although the amendments maintained the th ree major parts of the 1977 act discussed above the accounting standards the requirements of sec regist ered issuers and the anti bribery provisions the 1988 amendments made some significant changes to the 1977 act section 5002 of the trade act amended secti on 13b of the securities exchange act to provide that criminal liability shall be imposed for violation of the accounting standards unless person knowingly circumve nts or knowingly fails to implement system of accurate and reasonable accounting controls according to the legislative history this provision was intended to ensure that criminal penalties would be imposed where acts of commission or omission in keeping books or records or administering accounting controls have the purpose of fa lsifying books records or accounts or of circumventing accounting controls this was also intended to include the deliberate falsification of books and records and othe r conduct calcula ted to evade the internal accounting controls requirement11 section 5002 of the trade act also added to section 13b of the securities exchange act provision that an issuer which holds 50 or less of the voting power of domestic or foreign firm is required to use its influe nce only in good faith to cause the domestic or foreign firm to devise and maintain system of acceptable accounting controls the house report stated that this amendment was intended to recognize that it was unrealistic to expect minority owner to exert di sproportionate degree of influence over the accounting practices of subsidiary12 for purposes of the accounting standards reasonable assurances and reasonable detail mean such level of detail and degree of assurance as would sa tisfy prudent officials in the conduct of their own affairs thus the prudent man qualif ication was adopted to clarify that the current standard does not require an unrealistic degree of exactitude or precision section 5003 of the trade act amended the provisions of the foreign corrupt practices act concerning the antibribery pr ohibitions by issuers and domestic concerns the foreign corrupt practices act continued to prohibit an issuer having class of securities registered with the sec or any offi cer director employee or agent of the issuer or any stockholder acting on beha lf of the issuer or any united states concern to offer pay promise to give or authorize the giving of anything of value to foreign official ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21925crs5 13 hr ept 100576 at 918 1988 14 hr ept 100576 at 920foreign political party party official candidate or any person for the purpose of obtaining or maintaining business s ection 5003 amended the 1977 act to prohibit payments to any foreign official for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of such foreign official in his official capacity or inducing such fo reign official to do or omit to do any act in violation of the lawful duty of such official this language was inserted so that the foreign bribery standard woul d conform to the domestic br ibery standard found in 18 usc section 20113 the knowing requirement was retained and the recklessly disregarding standard was abandoned in conference however the knowing require ment was intended to encompass the conscious disregard and w illful blindness standards including conscious purpose to avoid learning the truth the conferees agreed that simple neg ligence or mere foolishness should not be the basis for liability however the conferees also agreed that the socalled headin thesand problem variously described in the pertinent authorities as conscious disregard willful blindness or deliber ate ignorance should be covered so that management officials could not take refu ge from the acts prohibitions by their unwarranted obliviousness to any action or inaction language or other signalling device that should reasonably alert them of the high probability of an fcpa violation14 the major changes which section 5003 of the trade act made in the 1977 foreign corrupt practices act had to do with when the bribery provisions apply to an american business or person acting on behalf of an am erican business for example the anti bribery provisions under the 1988 amendmen ts did not apply to any facilitating or expediting payment to foreign official political party or party official further an american business or indi vidual may use one of the affirmative defenses in urging that violation of the fcpa occurred the first of these enumerated affirmative defenses is that the payment gift offer or promise of anything of value that was made was lawful under the written laws and regulations of the foreig n officials political partys party official s or candidates country another affirmative defense is that the payment gift offer or promise of anything of value that was made was reasonable and bona fide expenditure such as travel and lodging expenses which were incurred by or on behalf of foreign official party party official or candidate and was directly related to the prom otion demonstration or explan ation of products or services or the execution or performance of contract with foreign government or agency this defense does not apply however if payment or gift is corruptly made in return for an official act or omission because it is then not considered bona fide good faith payment in the definitional sections of the 1988 amendments the terms knowing and routine governmental action are especia lly important persons state of mind is knowing
