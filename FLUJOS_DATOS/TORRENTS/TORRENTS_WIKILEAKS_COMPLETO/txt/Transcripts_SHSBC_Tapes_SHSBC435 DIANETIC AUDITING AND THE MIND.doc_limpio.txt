dianetic auditing and the mind lecture given on 28 july 1966 thank you thank you good you made smile now now this is the what of the which i get these planets mixed up its 28 july ad 16 saint hill special briefing course and lecture on dianetic auditing now needless to say had you listened carefully to the first lecture you wouldnt need this lecture i hate to have tohave to point these things out but thats the truth now let ask question here what are you handling when you are running dianetic secondaries and engrams what are you handling well boy you should sure know this you are handling the human mind that is all there is to it if we add to that then as another picture valence and as we add to that another thing called machine then youve got the lot thats the human mind you are actually getting your hands all dirty with the human mind that is the human mind it isnt anything else and there is nothing else in the human mind now that was basic discovery in dianetics now what the mind was coating was the discovery of scientology it was coating you know paint coats globs of glupf coat it is coating thetan and thetan is life unit capable of many things as described in the axioms but most familiar to one and all as you so you thetanand if you dont believe you are thetan ill give you little exercise look around you what do you see you see the physical universe correct all right and look at another person next to you you see body correct all right very good now look at picture of cat make picture of cat those who are too black to do so why just skip that exercise make picture of cat all right now that picture although it is synthetic and creation at the moment youre making it up and so forth thats the mind and whats looking at the cat you are and those of you now who couldnt get picture of cat whatever you got look at it now whats looking at it you are now this is the entiretythe entirety of the human mind now you say well if we created picture of cat oh well that wasnt part of the mind it was part of my crea who the hell do you think is mocking that thing up called the mind you are now that was the great discovery of scientology that was discovered after dianetic days what is the source of this thing engram originally meant trace on cell i know its fashionable for the newspapers to say i never went to college and there are several colleges at this particular time that are wishing that i hadnt gone there but i can also assure you that you give them another decade or so those colleges i havent even done more than go to prom at will have some plates on em you know man is silly you see anyway in college we were taking atomic and molecular phenomena which is very interesting subject and they should have left it there as toy subject and shouldnt have gone any further with it because out of that subject came the atomic bomb now its originally called atomic and molecular phenomena well they narrowed the subject down and made it very compressed and highly specialized and called it nuclear physics and today why people get degrees in nuclear physics and go out with aplomb to blow human beings all to pieces because politicians dont know how to handle governments now the whole subject of the human mind was so unknown so bedazzled and mucked aboutpeople hardly even knew there was mind you find mary baker eddy saying all is mind infinite mind well were into problem in semantics meaning the meaning of words she was using mind in some other connotation and so on she wasshe thought the universe was big think fortunately its not were here lot of think but theres also us now whenno criticism of hershe was trying like everybody else so this thing called the engram came from theory i developed while i was in george washington university and it was an interesting theory because man had explanation for the storage of thought but if you considernow hold your hat because this isthis is typical scientific think see some theory to embrace the phenomena now if memory is contained in molecule there are ten to the twentyfirst power binary digits of molecules in the brainin the neuron systemyes ten to the twentyfirst power binary digits now what binary digit is ive forgotten you know as well as i do i knew once but i dont know anymore binaries to meyou see ive been in navigation sinceand theyre the two suns that go around each other and make dumbbell sort of star you see i dont know what it is well anyhow i know its long figure and if there were hundred holes in each moleculesee this figure is something you just go on writing for day or two you see or weeksand if there were hundred holes in each one of these molecules and there was one memory in each hole why manby calculation then of the number of things observed and remembered and by actual inspection of mans memoryman had enough memory storage to last him three months and although this may not be true of psychologists psychiatrists or many professors there are those who can remember further back than three months so i wrote this up as proof that this wasnt how man remembered in i think 19oh i dont know when it was1936 some five six years later something like that this was issued in austria from vienna where else as the way man remembered so man is so scarce on data that he will even buy ways people have proved man doesnt remember in order to explain the mind and memory now theres mirror theory that is even more ridiculous than that one whereby one perceives by having mirror which reflects the perceptions and concentrates it now dont ask the questionby the way that was in the 50s and so forth that was the psychological school of thought explanation now dont ask what looks at the mirror because theyll tell you another mirror and we sort of get into an infiniteone of these german periscopes you know where the submarine captain lays in his bunk and looks atlooks at berlins nightclubs or something i mean they never followed the thought all the way through something had to look at the mirror its the same idea they have about computers they talk about the wonders of computers you see marvelous computers boy can ican i think you know great great can i think every once in while im standing around when i see some of my friends and itheyre in there with the eniacs and unwacs and mucklucks or whatever these things are called these days and theyre doing this gorgeous stunt of praising the computer and saying how much better it is than human being and i shatter their comparisons by saying who asks the computer questions and they say well of course we do because were so stupid and i say who then does it answer questions for oh theyve sort of got the idea that computer answers questions for other computers that asks questions for other computers you see but the truth of the matter is any time you go near one of these unwacs or eniacs or mucklucks or something you see some guy there feeding itfeeding it cards and feeding it questions and thereswhatever slots they have on the things and so forth youll also see somebody come over and take out long tape and then read it and it didnt mean thing until somebody read it do you see so mansall im trying to give you is mans approach to this was so childish as to be silly thehiswhat data he had about the mind he couldnt even think about but now its very difficult to think about the mind and dont blame him too much because the mind essentially if all there was was mind the psychiatrist thinks the mind is the brain hes got it moved over sideways thats why he keeps sawing up brains and drilling holes in them and so forth he thinks hes getting something you cant drill hole in mind its not possible he would if he could but this thingthis thing called the mind you see is being asked to think about something called the mind an eniac or unwac names of the big electronic computers are not able actually to think about computers see theyre not able to design themselves but fortunatelyfortunately why the mind doesnt have to understand the mind because theres somebody there to understand it and fortunately for us and unfortunately for lot of otherisms and ologies and so forth i for one was there to understand it do you see so this thing called the mind is probably the least understood the most mysterious object that anybody ever heard of you would have to know that an individual was quite capable of making pictures of creating mass energy space and time before you could understand what the mind was that would require then that you understood there was such thing as an individual and an individual isnt something walking around in frock coat or with pincenez glasses or something like that an individual is static and this static is thatwell now static is something thats motionless but actually static by definition in scientology is simply the ultimate in what is it now there is reason to try to explain thetan or say where it came from because it didnt come from any place it is and we have to understand now the scientology idea of what is reality and this really baffles people because this is the biggest philosophic conundrum of the ages what is reality now people tell you to face reality and so forth but you could say with philosophic quip ill be glad to face it if you will explain it and that would of course stop them cold because they cant explain reality reality totally lacks philosophic definitions and we got into such weirditiesweird things as if the tree fell in the forest and there was nobody there to hear it fall then would it have made sound i think thats marvelous you know i mean the jokersand they couldnt have all been serioushume locke the rest of these birds and some of the french philosophers and so onthese fellowsthese fellows really dreamed some up you want to have ball sometime read some of these old timers of two three four five hundred years ago and get their definitions for some of these commodities which you have to know about in order to be free and reality is one of them well reality in scientology is what is and people who cant see very much of course dont have much reality and you say is the emeter real well the emeter is real because it is and honest you dont have to go beyond that as definition you dont have to go into why is it there and who made it and who put it there and how come its running along in time with us these are other questions well for heavens sakes break them all down to their proper tiny components not one of these questions of course is simply what is reality reality is what is and you can experience reality so easily that i wonder little bit at anybody having any trouble with it you can stamp and it is so there it is its real yes they say but lot of people have an awful lot of delusions you say okay whats delusion that would probably stop them we could answer it easily delusion is what one person thinks is but others dont necessarily you might say thats reality for one person out of agreement with others and id hate to have mental practitionerid hate to have mental practitioner who himself had very low level of reality you see because hed be out of agreement with everybody elses so that everything to him would be delusion just the fact that somebody said it was real would be enough for him to then state that it was delusion now one of the ways to handle such personand i say this in all kindness because dont cheer boys the poor devils are dying you knowis just get him to feel the table you know dont be amazed if he experiences fantastic case gain in just that instant but just get him to feel the table and youand let him in on something you feel the table and you say i can feel it too and it will be such relief to him because for long time he thought only he could now out of these things of what is reality what is being and what is mind and so on we can walk we can map path with great security and find out what it is that has man trapped why man acts as he does why he reacts as he does and all this is very elementary once you know the basic definitions but i dont think you would have very good luck in auditing dianetic engrams engram definition today is just something thatan experiencea mental image picture of an experience which contained pain and unconsciousness and of course it still contains pain and unconsciousness secondary isis an experiencea mental image picture of an experience which contains loss and is therefore misemotional now thats all there is to that now in dianetic processing then you have to know what the mind is and in the process of being processed and in processing it you are running headon into what this thing called the mind is and it isnt anything more complicated than what i have told you now how it got made well thetan is compulsive mockerupper by mockup we mean mental image creation ordinarily and hes able to create just like that so bullet hits him so he makes full picture of him being hit by the bullet he is so overwhelmed by it that he thinks the obvious thing for him to do is to make picture of it he is stupid man and that is the flaw which makes him aberrated and that is the one flaw in thetan now if you can get him over doing this so that he can recover from this mad obsession to make picture of everything that happens to him and then hide it from himself and then fix it up so it can impinge itself upon his existence you can get him out of the cage and the funny part with all this you say well he didnt have enough experience he didnt have enough pictures so therefore you can rationalize all you want to the case happens to be that the individual is trapped by his own creations now he dramatizes these pictures or they enforce computations on him he will go through being shot because he has an engram of being shot now the way he does this is get dislocated in time now each of these picturesyou want to know about precision man the precision with which thetan mocks these things up as they happen and then puts them on the time track with the exact time on them is amazing you talk about the inaccuracy of human being boy that is accuracy to end all accuracy it is correct within seconds it is an amazing feat if it happened four years two months one day and three hours seven minutes and two seconds ago that is the exact thing that will fall on the meter now he can also turn time around you see to how long ago it was you can run it from the beginning but you better not because there are some booby traps at the beginning but you run it from pt back and youll find thatthis amazing ability to spot in time these mental image pictures of the things which have happened to himare absolutely gorgeous it is so great that sometimes all you have to do is date how long ago the incident occurred to have it blow an individual has to be in pretty good shape however before you can do that now this then in essence is the mind is those pictures which have been made of experiences and plotted against time and preserved in energy and mass in the vicinity of the being and which when restimulated are re created without his analytical awareness that is the mind thats the mind youre working with that is the mind youre trying to get out of now you say this were trying to get this individual out of body you wont get anybody out of body worth nickel so that hell stay out of body and so forth because he is so weakened by his mind that he cannot control or handle himself in relationship to his body now the trick of all of thisthe trick of all of this is that you cannot make postulate or an intention through this mass called the mind and whenever you do the mind restimulates so thetan is not able to make or handle things by postulates he sayshe says you will be all right you know he has this impulse to say you will be all right you talk about spot healing you know or something like miracle healing you know saint pete or somebody walks along and sees somebody and he wants to heal him up so he saysthe thoughtthe intention is there to make the fellow all right his intention goes just so far collides with whatever engrams are in restimulation and goes splat so he says i guess thats not good thing to do whereas his intention is actually terrifically powerful so thetans thought cant go through his own barricade of his mockups so obviously the less experiencecreations of experiencesthe less creations of experiences an individual has around him and the less that he has to restimulate why the more he can think or project his thoughts or the bigger he gets do you follow now you can delete these experiences and dianetic auditing is that activity by which these experiences can be erased now if an individual is always going around like thishes always going around like this youre fairly surethis isim now talking from dianetic viewpoint of course there may be dozens of reasons hes going around like this all contained in the mind on the same thing but i will give you simplified action of it hes going around like this you can be absolutely sure hes got mental image picture where something made him go like this so much so that you could even and you better not do this with any case that is having any trouble at all but somebody who is pretty well uptone and is doing fine you can actually ask him things like that but the trouble is if theyre uptone they arent obeying their engrams to that degree but theoretically you could see this fellow bent over like this and you could say all right the incident in which you are bent over like this will now appear and he would get the incident if he didnt get it and it remained black you could then get the duration of the incidentyou couthe date of the incident you date ithow many years and so forth ago and then you would date the duration of the incidenthow long did it last and he would get the picture of it and there he isthere he is dangling from tree or something like that with rope under him having been shot with fiftyfour arrows you see after being flogged or some mild minor experience of this character now thethere are various ramifications to all of this there are various complications you might say this individual is all messedup because hes trying not to dramatize the engram in which he is stuck you see hes trying not to dramatize it because the tendency of the individual in dramatization is to repeat in action what has happened to one in experience thats basic definition of it but much more important its replay now of something that happened then its just being replayed out of its time and period so this individual who is dramatizing is actually either totally unrestrained and therefore totally dramatizing at which moment we consider hes mad or he has the impulse to dramatize it but he knows he better not and fellow will tie himself down like gulliver in lilliputia you know with all those strings just tied down and tied down and tied down and he will hold himself back and so forth hes trying to keep from dramatizing some incident so you get double action here you get the impulse to dramatize and the effect of the incident on the individual and you get as well the individuals analytical awareness that its not bright thing to do to pick up rockswhenever one sees rock to pick up the rock and hit somebody with it hell think hes rather odd he doesnt know where this comes from so he begins to lose confidence in himself every time he sees rock why he has an impulse to go over and to pick up the rock and bash somebodys head in with it and he knows that that is not nice thing to do it isnt because hes afraid of the police its because hes basically good he doesnt want to do those things but theres the rock and theres head and hed sort of start holding things up so that he cant look at rocks and then the next thing you know he walks around like this all the time you see so he wont see any rocks you get it and hes dramatizing an incident where somebody else picked up rock and hit him over the head with it and then he went into their valence do you see he became them because they were the winner so thisthis is the way all of this stacks up theres tremendous amount of interesting phenomena and bricabrac and so forth youre dealing with the basic mind because what is the core of the reactive bank also has this same character but it is so outrageous and so different and is so overwhelming that youre not about to touch that unless youve got the exact map and even when youve got the exact map you occasionally knock your block off but youre going in this lightly lightlydealing with this lifetime the last year or two probably and some people have probably not penetrated any deeper than this mornings breakfast but the existence is all mapped now in view of the fact that he didnt know what happened occasionally he tells himself what happened and so he will sometimes have his actual experience overlaid with another experience this is the way you get too many julius caesars you can get an almost infinite supply of julius caesars the man was mad heterosexual homosexual nut who had very nasty personal habits and whose ideas of conquest were so laughable as to be nonsense he conquered such countries as england which were ready to welcome the britonthe romans at that time they were all ready to practically bring them ashore and shake them by the hand and say hey what do you know and weve been using your stuff for long time boys come on in and sell us some more and so forth so he lands with chariots and spears so he can conquer everybody you know loony he cut off the right hand of fifty thousand gaulsthe act of madman now this is pretty suppressive punk isnt it huh well this made him the winning valence so id say that lot of people who served with him on his side and lot of people on the other side and so forth would register loud and long as julius caesar now whenever you have personalitywhenever you have personality that has been either terrifically successful only thats less so or personality who has been terribly overwhelming vicious and oppressive you get lot of people in that time in that valence because theres lot of mental image pictures of it see so dont get too baffled about past lives every once in while past lives get so invalidated to people that they dont want to have anything to do with them because theyve seen too many julius caesars and it tends to suppress one saying that you know i was cassius you know and youits the invidious comparison get the chap whos walking along and hes got plan that is going to help the british empire you see and hes perfectly valid statesman hes going along hes doing all right hes perfectly capable of doing so some bird walks up to him who is complete frothing idiot see and he tells him that he used to be disraeli and he has plan to save the british empire at that moment the fellow who is the sane boy has tendency to feel that he must be crazy because he has plan to save the british empire do you follow and by invidious comparison you say to yourself i couldnt have lived before because look at those nuts talking aboutthere are three julius caesars over there and two napoleons you know so sometime if pc is being too doubtful about all this and hes had hard time on it just run invalidationsrun your suppress and invalidate and so on on the subject of have you lived before youll get some very interesting results of it it is fashionable simply because thetansmeshed in to the degree that they are smashed down by mass and the mind and so forthit is very hard to remember its very hard for thetan to remember more than few years when he has totally smashedin mind complete and one of the reasons isis his effort to remember gets painful so hed rather not remember now when youve just been blown to pieces with cannonballyoure twenty one years old and twentyone years ago you were blown to pieces with cannonballtrying to coax anybody to remember any earlier than twenty years ago or better still eighteen or more comfortably sixteen years ago it becomes very hard unless person knows what hes up against he tries to handle this he has methods of handling this bank and one of his favorite methods of handling the bank is almost as nutty as making it in the first place his method of handling it is to forget about it how crazy can you get of course you have to be up in the vicinity of clear before it really starts to look hilariously funny because you take grade veven as high as grade v certainly as high as grade iv you find people still trying to figure out how that bankyou know how thethe bank mind interchangeable wordshow this mind of his is valuable of course this is an excuse not to confront it you know i better not confront it and do anything about it because its so valuable well of course his effort to confront it is an effort to confront very very painful experiences and he doesnt want to confront those painful experiences and so he said there must be some virtue in it id better leave it there another method he uses in fooling himself concerning it and theres whole cult that follows thisa real cult not what they call us you seecalled psychologists and this cult actually follows and subscribes to the theory that you had better be glad youre neurotic but that is merely schools expression of something that beings kind of want to think anyhow see if you cant cure neurosis and you dont know what the mind is all about anyhow then you could excuse all that by simply saying well you really dont want anything done about your mind because you see its good thing youre neurotic you see all great artists are nuts you see thats obvious look at them i dont know i also look at their artwork now therefore the mind is complex mechanism which influences the individual and which hes better off without and you really wont believe all the way that youd be better off without it until you finally get rid of it and then you say ive sure had lot of weird reasons while i was hanging on to all this coal tar you say to yourself i must have been nuts thats right now every now and thenevery now and then somebodys got valencesome genius valence of some kind or another and this genius valence is all rigged up to answer questions and hes got computer see so he says how big should i build this building and he gets 562½ feet high so he puts it down on the drawing he wouldnt know what to do without that thing it never occurs to him that he himself has to go around here and to work out the answer and then come back here and hear it and he will become sad about losing his mind he will come very sad about losing his mind if he getsif he gets one of these things halfdesensitized its halfgone its still there but it doesnt work anymore and he hasnt taken back the ability see he hasnt taken back and owned the ability to do it and yet it is erased to point where it doesnt work and at this point he will be rather regretful of having done something about it because he says how big should the building be dead silence and then he goes along little further and he gets little bit better and all of sudden of course he says the building ought to be 819 feet and half onlyany fool could see that he can see that now you see what he did was attribute the ability to circuit put it on an automaticresponse basis but he was in actual fact using valence now every once in while youll see child come along and they can play piano or violinoh my god they just sit down and brrroom bang you see and theyre only six years old or something like this and wow theyre playing with symphony orchestras and all of sudden they get to be ten twelve and they one day look at piano and they dont know what it is that same mechanism occurred except theyve been working on circuitry of some kind or another and in the circuitry they have somehow or another erased part of the circuitry or done something about it they never get up to point of realization now in one lifetime you can almost erase your own skills if youve put them all on picture form which is quite remarkable so fellow starts outboy he just starts out great guns and the next thing you know why hes blah well the best way to do that is to stick yourself in college get nice valence of youof you the expert nice valence you knownice circuit out here valence beingnesswhich is the expert and then always consult the expert never think it out for yourself see and then one day accidentally abandon this thing mislay it or move on the time track so that youre not near it anymore and then be totally lost and not have the skill but who has the skill in the first place the individual himself do you follow now thetan once having started this idiocy of mocking things up and mocking up and holding on to all of his personal experiences then began to find virtues for it and he made little machines and he did all kinds of things now when you start reversing this procedure he goes slightly mad because halfway through any action why he will have lost the benefit of it without having regained it himself do you follow this does not respond however on the iq graphs any processing increases iq its almost impossible to lower iq so the individual is getting brighter and thats the final test of it great many things have worked out of course about dianetic auditing since we have begun to make clears and man is basically good and the more mind you get rid of the brighter you get until you get rid of all of ityoure very bright all of thisall of these things you see have borne out and are perfectly true now when i talk to you about dianetic auditing when i talk to you about erasing the automobile accident youve been in or losing aunt mamie your favorite ally when you were little boy or something like this you realize im talking to you about play as far as auditing is concerned this is play the amount of benefit to be regained from running half dozen engrams exceeds anything that man has ever been able to do for anybody in the history of the human race and compares to scientology processing the straight way at about one onemillionth of the potential gain do you understand so im talking to you about play today but you as an auditor had better know about it and you better look at it and you better get familiar with it because that is the mind you are studying the cage thems the bars thats whats got you under arrest its these tricks and vagaries and the technology which it requires to vanquish this thing was actually in excess of the simple erasure of pictures you had to know an awful lot now that doesnt mean it wasnt still simple problem and that the definitions of the mind didnt hold but it meant that the mind was more complex and the experiences had been far more complex than anybody had ever imagined you see and it was much harder for somebody to confront now theres question of time if picture by picture you undertook to erase the mind you would get into one of these binary digits i was talking to you about before one of the things that made come off of dianetics entirely is i could make release and very often the fellow would sail off and so on wed called them clears in those days and quite validly he had been temporarily cleared but his reactions to the entirety of existence were really infinitely less than those of clear and of course infinitely infinitely less from those for an ot you see after youre clear then you have to study up and regain what you can do anybody who is clever enough to mock up mind and keep it in place and not even know about it for that long hes got lot of abilities to enhe must be very clever bunny indeed and so he is but an individual has as many engrams and secondaries as he has had experiences as he is old now i dont ask you to take my word for how old you are because its very impolite particularly to ladies to hang any vast age upon them but if you will put yourself on meter someday and start chalking it up as to how long youve had mind or something like this you would come up with something very interesting indeed youll feel better too unless you get too serious about it and then youll plummet yourself right down into the middle of the reactive bank and then youll have an awful time so thislightly lightly you know little goes long ways sort of thing but if you ask the question bluntly how old am i you would probably get variety of answers because of course you are the ones who invented time and you arent old you have been in certain state for certain period of time and you can measure those states but you cannot measure totala total total with any degree of accuracy youre going to get variations all over the place now you start going back in time and youll find out that there have beentheres been quite long period now in view of the fact that youve probably averaged pain everywell lets be reasonable about it lets say youve averaged pain out of every year every year you have done something youve stubbed your toe or youve had something happen lets say youve averaged pain in year and major catastrophe one way or the other every five or ten years now lets be very gross about the whole thing and say at least every lifetime youve had catastrophe i think that would be reasonable to suppose now therefore divide twentyfive into the length of time you have had mind which reads on the meter and im afraid you will get too many trillion incidents for anybody in this lifetime to sit and erase so although theoretically it could all be erased incident by incident chain by chain and so forththeoreticallyyou havent got that much auditing time and nobody has got that much patience it would take something on the order of zaom thousands of hours maybe binary digits of hours you see and this is impractical for human being because i point out the average age of the body at the time it decays totally is something around seventy seventyfive today see you havent got enough time take more than seventyfive years to get in enough auditing to erase all of the engrams on the track so therefore i had to shortcircuit this i had to bring this right to basics and i had to bring it to basics of what actually did thetan consist of rather than what was he mocking up and then we addressed this and we addressed the mechanics of the thing we have our current gradation chart and then it is possible to clear somebody and its very interesting now that anybody who came into scientology untrained unprocessed and so forth would if he pressed right along with itnot too frantically but just kept going more or less the rate at which youre traveling at the momenthe would be at least minimum or maximum depending on how hard he pressed at it of two years to clear now you could do it much faster than that by becoming much more businesslike about it but reasonable assumptiona very reasonable assumption at the leisurely rate people move and all that sort of thing would be couple of years to clear itsi dont know what average time we have at the moment in the clearing course on the course itself i can only make guesses and so forth and i knew when the technology was availablei dont know how many clears weve got now and from that sort of thing i would guess that its somewhere between yeeight months and years auditing i would just guess that thats very reasonable auditing you know thats getting tired and lazy and stupid and forgetting about it and patching it up and going to review and then being very businesslike for two whole weeks and you know that kind of thing so thatthe lower grades however these things are so perfectedand there is shortcut for vi and vii anybody who comes along and tells you theres any shortcut for vi and vii hes just trying to cut your throat remember that there is shortcut somebody said to i should have thought ron that you would have blown the whole bank just by plotting it ho ho ho even and i wasgeti got on engrams eventually so i could take fantastic engram you know where you were just blown all to pieces and betrayed at the same time and totally surprised and scattered all over the environment for few minutes and that sort of thing and blow those things just by inspection say oh yes there it is whoooch and gone see i got up to point where i could do that huh confronting the basic reactive bank isnt like that im not trying to scare you im just trying to keep you from making mistakes now your engrams are erasable and in the process of erasing them you get into various phenomena which i have already told you about but some of those now auditing them obviously didnt listen so i will tell you again nicely and politely and withoutas stan said the other day he said whats marvelous about you he says you dont scream and beat the desk and so forth i accepted the compliment but actually some of your top executives will tell you i do scream and beat the desk every now and then you know not really over stupiditynot over stupidity that isnt why i scream and beat the desk just to get compliance now whats interesting about this is that the moment that you run late engram on chain letsyouve probably got your nomenclature bit tangled up and you probably should listen very carefully and you probably should get your misunderstood words out of this stuff and so on because this is very very important here you haveletslets take picture of ladder and were going down ladder here now the bottom rung of this ladder is the basic on the chain it is more important therefore ive made it blacker actually this here we put another ladder here and we put the top rung as very black and importantthats the way it looks and this bottom rung itimportant at the timewas very slight and you say therefore the toughest incident would be the earliest incident the toughest incident to try to do anything about is thethe most recent one and the easiest one to do something about is the earliest one now chain simply means series of incidents of similar content theres the hitbycars chain now there may only be one engram on chain but that would be very rare indeed there maybe are 20 hitbycars chains see 20 on the hitbycars chain now if were speaking of this lifetime you may find 1 or 2 on the hitbycars chain that wont erase on account of unfortunately for the reality of some people who dont like the truth and cant face you know people dont like past lives because youyoure pointing their attention back at lot of agony theres good reason for it see this guy is 41 years old41 years ago he died he probably didnt die pleasantly either being the kind of fellow he is so you tell him hes lived before this life youre pointing his attention back at that horrible incident and so forth and he just bounces straight back to present time shaking actually you think hes mad because hes talking about past life hes terrified dont tdont talk to aboutboutboutboutbout p pppast lives damn you scientologists you see oh you dogs kill em you say sonny boy why be so yellow now the resolution of problem requires that you handle the elements of the problem the resolution of problem requires that you handle the elements of problem you will never solve problem by handling different elements than the problem has you just never will this is one of mans favorite indoor sports solving problems by using different elements than the problem contains so therefore if you insist on person staying in this lifetime youre going to run into the hitbycars chain with 2 incidents in this lifetime which are the last of 520 incidents and youre trying to erase the last 2 of 520 incidents he was first hit by car 1765000 years ago 3 months 1 day 1 hour and 10 seconds ago the mind see back and when you go through an incident once and it doesnt desensitize and you start the fellow through again and the incident now appears little bit heavier and massy you better hit the silk man youre probably at 897 on that chain and you start to put this fellow through it you try to put this fellow through it too often and its just going to get heavier and heavier and thicker and thicker and one of the symptoms of this is his bouncing out of it now were not going to handle bouncers now and get guys repeated down into it and that sort of thing theres point in doing that there are easier ways to handle it just erase the earlier incident now its thealways requires the earliest incident that you can reach to totally desensitize chain but heres one of the symptoms you start throughstart the pc through an engram and when you bring him back through to go over it again he says exactly what he says before without any change or variation he is longer in the time of that engram he has bounced and hes now running out of the lock he put into pt hes now busy running the present time lock it was so heavy that it laid in lock in present time see do you follow it hasnt done him any harm so you were busy running an engram of ten or seven years ago you see and its the hitbycars and its boketyboketyboketyboketybokety boketyboketyboketybok and then you start him through it the second time and he goes boketyboketybok and theres new material shows up of any kind whatsoever hes not seven or ten years ago hes not back where it was at all hes erasing what he just laid in in pt hes just going over it again also hes learned better hes learned better than to go near it and you have run into the same mechanism exactly of why thetan keeps mindbecause he doesnt want to confront it it would erase if he confronted it but it is too painful for him to do so so youve actually got pc bit in over his head you have been bit too persuasive and you have been locating engrams on meter you naughty fellow oh you say of course well you always locate engrams on meter you run them on meter you introduce meter into the location of incidents and youre going to run pc over his head the whole time because the meter can see deeper than he can well the funny part of it is if you run what he can erase youve got level of confront he can confront did you ever lose anything and he thinks for little while and he said yeah i lost ring all right thats the incident meter now as we run him through it with dianetic auditing and so forthits secondary of course because it contains lossas we run him through this thing youre going to get meter action great and you better watch your meter too because its liable to go free needle or something on you see if it does forget that chain get onto something else you understand now man can remember what he can confront and thats all hes going to remember if he had fight at breakfast hes not going to want to remember breakfast well if he got hit by truck ten years ago he dont want to remember hit by truck ten years ago now if he talks about it at all its because hes talking about lock which hes moved up into pt which is comfortable hell tell you all about having been hit by truck but he wont give it to you in present time as though its just now this minute happening now you see he can come to present time away from the incident and have sort of synthetic history of this incident and he can go through that and if you locate incidents on meters thats the way he will run engrams all sort of synthetic in pt and he doesnt want to go back down the guythe guy who is the most shivery the guy who is at fear on the tone scale will act like hes on powerful spring which is shooting him straight up the track to pt and boy hes stuck right here you know he is not going to go back anyplace noplace ah how about breakfast oh well i dont know anything about bhow about breakfast well can you remember what you had for breakfast oh i dont know is that necessary this is not the chap who wins medals for courage see what im talking about he acts like hes being ejected on hydraulic thrust straight up to present time boy and hes here hummmmhummmmhummmm now you sayyou say now in your poor freud he was dealing with people of this type all the time you see they couldnt cotheyre as crazy as they couldnt confront you see and they were pretty nutty and he was asking them to go back and remember their childhood why man if hed everit never occurred to him to ask can you remember entering the office because they would have said probably i dont know how did i get here its fact amnesiaamnesia is simplyis not very mysterious mechanism its just guy who is so spooked that he doesnt dare remember ten seconds ago now hes had some experience beyond whichearlier than which he is not going to remember including the experience so hes only willing to remember some moment after that experience now we call this amnesia hes just scared now youll run into this all the time in varying degrees in pcs and the worst ones off are those that are just rigid in present time theyre going along with each click of the clock and further back than the last click this person will tell you he has bad memory that is not the only source of bad memory bad memory is just accumulated occlusion of it all but its nevertheless nonconfront see trying to train somebody with beatings would be the last way in the world that you could train anybody because youve given him all of his education so that he cant confront it now herehere we have then problemthis givetells you why some instructors are very beloved by their students and turn out genius students you know for some reason or other everything he gave the student the student finds thats the easiest thing in the world to confront so thats what he knows now where do you find relief to this situation of the pc stuck in present time now youre going to find some pc youre going to find an incident you will actually get him back into the first part of that incident youll get him to roll off that incident maybe hell even go through it once hell all of sudden hold back the pain that his hiphrrh thats it he was already in it so he said mmmm we dont want that we want this pshmom like diver coming out of the bottom of the sea he comes up to the surface and he runs the next time straight along on present time where its nice and safe he doesnt want anything to do with that dirty old nasty pain that almost took his leg off do you see do you get it so its all bounce it isnt just bouncer get out that pushes people up to present time or shoots them about now an individual actually will feel so imprisoned at some point of the trackhes liable to feel so imprisoned that he knows he cannot progress any further than that point forever and youll find somebody whos totally stuck on the track but this is somebody who is terrified of the future and people get in this frame of mind about when theyre to be executed if you can recall the last time you were about to be executed time must halt at that point and youll find out that pc seems to go back earlier very easily so he shoots back to the beginning of theof anything you cant hold him in an incident you say come come now were going to run the automobile accident when you hadwhen you were 5 years old and so forth yeah well ioh by the way i got one now i got one now two thousand years ago i got one now 15 thousand i got one trillion years ago got one 2 trillion years ago and you say well whoa whoa whoa well recognize what youre dealing with this is the guy who doesnt dare move forward with the time track now youd only get him misbehaving and dianetic audited pc only misbehaves when put beyond his ability to confront and then you run into all the problems of dianetics now you have to know an infinite number of solutions now you have to be clever not arf you have to be screaming genius with answers you have to sit there and sweat man as an auditor youve got to be right on the ball so much more on the ball than you can be that youll flub why youre running the pc over his head and one of the best ways in the world to run pc over his head in early stages of auditinglater on you can start using meterbut in the early daysi mean use meter to locate the way to really run pc over his head is take him bright brassy green familiarity with the mind doesnt even know about mental image pictures discover the source of his lumbosis plunge him into it straightaway and try to force him to go through it you will have very unwilling pc you have to practically sit on his head he bounces all over the place the second time you bring him through it he runs it in pt he can find other part of the chain he cant erase it you know hes in trouble all the way you have to therefore be very clever as an auditor do i make my point its just youre running him beyond his ability to confront that is all his ability to confront is onemillionth of aof an attention unit and what hes confronting and youre asking him to confront requires one thousandth of an attention unit and hes not about to stay there comfortably and do anything about it at all do you follow therefore if you will look in this bulletin of 3 april 1966 it carefully stresses gradient scales now after youve been going little while yes you can find it on meter but the guys ability to confront is up youre getting someplace but the truth of the matter is if you want to make release this way dont ever locate anything on meter and he will come out the right end of it he will be able to confront more and more and more and youve improved his ability to confront his past experience now you could almost bring about the same result with repetitive processeswhat can you confront see you could almost bring about the same result but as matter of fact an individual can then build up build up build up but he himself is not getting an insight into his mind with repetitive command of this character youre going for broke in other words youre going for result but with dianetic auditing were not going for result were trying to give you auditing practice and were trying to have some fun if you get results its your own fault and if you do this right why you will get results and the test of it is is does your pc feel any better afterwards now if he doesnt feel any better youve done one of two things youve either let him go too light or youve let him go too strong see youve insisted that he run some tiny light lock that he isnt even vaguely interested in and could confront dozen like it or youve insisted he go in over his head now the mind knows what it can tolerate so the best test is the pc not the meter the guy knows what he can tolerate so you say you wantgoing to run secondary now well you can ask him for now have you ever losthave you ever lost anything and if you wanted to be very sure you could say recently have you lost anything see asking sneakily on the line and he says yes as matter of fact i lost ring run it but now when youre asking for moments of loss remember that youre asking for the whole chain of all secondaries because that is the definition bywhich it has so you could soften your question up even further do you recall period of sadness lets attach the emotion to it now we could ask for times when he was sad times when he was afraid times when he was this times when he was that you talk about throwing people in over their head in the early days of running there were so many techniques developed for throwing people into engrams that it was practically snap of the fingers and over niagara falls the guy went he didnt have any choice we were so skilled in those days of putting people into incidents and so on that the most remarkable dramatizations would occurfantastic body convulsions theyd practically fly all over the room and i remember one chap that i snapped into an incidentand i cured something with him its true that you can do something with itof straight unadulterated terror terror so great that as his body shook on the bed he was lifting the legs of the bed off the floor and banging them down again in chatter sounds impossible i wouldnt have believed it if i hadnt seen it with own eyes that bed was chattering against the floor this guy was scared and there is thing like an odor of fear and that odor permeated the room to point where i never thought i would smell anything like it in my life it smelled like terrified army in full rout and it was an incident it was right there hed been sitting in it it was in full restim he justan incident he kept resisting he couldnt confront any part of it and i just tripped him into it with some skill but it was an incident where he and fellow scout had goneas couple of savagesto scout the enemy position and had been caught and his companion had been boiled and eaten before him and then he in an effort not to get eaten had managed to get free and throw himself over cliff and it finally developed however that he couldnt really determine whether hed been thrown over the cliff because he had gone mad or whether he had thrown himself over the cliff and it finally resolved and so forth that he had thrown himself over the cliff but he ran this out and the emotion discharged from it i only had to go through it five or six times and it finished it but he was not about to go anyplace else on the track it completely changed his life as matter of fact but there we were auditing for result and undoubtedly you could bring about fast result and the reason we wanted to bring about fast results is because there are so many engrams there are just so fantastically many engrams that we were becoming choosy as to which ones we were supposed to run and we were trying to speed up the process well youre not trying to do that youre just trying to learn about the mind the faster process was the first one i ever used which is gradient scales find something the fellow can confront and run him through it and factually ive made people lot better by getting them to run the incident of walking into the room to keep their appointment with managed to coax them back that far on the time track and i had my best results with that type of an approach so you say what would you consider your chronic emotion is and the fellow saysyou know you can be tricky about thiswhat would you say your chronic emotion would be well the fellow says iii dont know i think im just bored most of the time well thats good enough and can you remember time when you were bored oh yes yes good now lets start in at the beginning of that period youll find secondary and youll find another secondary and youll find another secondary below this and the next thing you know there was real stuff here in being bored you find this guy in actual fact was made to be in place of interest but some danger for period of time that was very upsetting now if you went and ran engrams to parallel thisyou dont have to call for engrams to parallel thissooner or later youre going to come up with an incident where he was executed or something in exactly the same type of surrounding as he was waiting for while in danger and that would be the engram which gave this other thing yes it is chronic emotion and you could ask for various types of emotions and this way you could sort the thing out there are lots of tricky things you can do im not trying to put any slightest block on the tricky things that you can do i dont care how many commands you give him while hes running it oh go on you know and so forth keep it up continue anything you want to say im just saying get the guy through it thats what youre supposed to do thats really what youre supposed to do well what does it take to do that and im telling you that youll get your best results by not throwing the fellow in over his head then you wont run into all of these things whereby you need 8765 solutions you see to 50000 problems see youre not going to run into any problems the guy will run what he almost can confront and hell get quite aquite bang out of running something he almost can confront hell get quite relief out of this but you would just be fascinated how little some people can confront but also you could be fascinated at how much some people can confront this fellow hell run through it and somatics are tearing all over the place and so forth and so the lion took another mouthful out of my left leg you know great its what the pc can do not what you decide the pc can do but the individual who just doesnt run well and doesnt seem to get anyplace and that sort of thing is of two varieties he has two things wrong he is either being asked to confront far far too much or far far too little and the number of them that will be confronting far far too little are very few and far between so it boils down to the most commonestthe commonest thing that youll run into is asking them to confront too much how much is too much well it is too much for the guy you are auditing that same too much wont be too much for the next guy you audit do you understand it varies from being to being because experience varies not only does experience vary but different parts of the track are in restimulation some people are in very tough basic incident of some kind or another which makes all other incidentsthe lightest of locksthe most painful things imaginable now you want to start running down chain now of course if you call for loss then thatyoure askmaking bid now to run out every single engram on the whole track so if you want to get little more practice why extend it little bit further and call forwhats the guys chronic emotion now well solve that chronic emotion work on it as project and youll do lot of secondaries secondaries will go right straight down the line now some people have an idea that there is an engram and then secondary occurs and then the secondary accumulates locks now it isnt that simple the mind isivejust because i have given you simple answers is reason the mind is simply built you have all the jerryrigged messes you ever wanted to run into now listen there will be chain that is to say the original and then the repeated incidents plotted in time thereafter of the same type of incident there will be chain of engrams which is to say incidents containing pain and unconsciousness you know the offwiththehead chain the offwiththehead chain see and here are 150 engrams each one of which consists of having ones head cut off now oddly enough there will also be in parallel to that the offwiththehead motivator series and therell be 49 or something like that incidents whereby the individual cut somebody elses head off now in addition to all of that each one of those will have accumulated locks which are consciouslevel experiences which sort of stick and the individual doesnt quite know why shiny piece of metal would be enough to make lock see so each one of the 150 engrams has many locks when i say many i would say oh 2 or 3 hundred thousand each one of the 150 now whats the secondaries well the secondaries if you had rung of ladder as you were looking at ladder and the bottom side of that rung were natural wood color and there was stripe of black painted across the top of the rung you would have the secondary its actually lying right straight there with the engram now each one of those 150 engrams has its own secondary theres secondary probably for every single one of the 150 engrams and each of those secondaries has lock and not only has lock but has maybe 2 or 3 thousand locks now worse than that this chain crossreferences and interconnects with public gatherings injuries during now thats not series of locks that will be independentan independent series of engrams containing pain and unconsciousness each one of the incidents you know why there was the fellow in the crowd and he was little boy and the crowd surged and they squashed him and he died you see i mean this type of incident now those willthose engramsthe offwiththehead chain will be the smashedinthecrowd chain you see the public gatherings incidents in they will be crossreferenced and their locks will intermingle so that the locks of one of these chains will also cross over and become the locks of the offwiththehead chain also isnt that great now let show you where you would really get foxed if you tried to trace something like this down and you would really have trouble we want to know and this is typicala typical freudian problemfetishism the fellow has fixation on hairbrushes i can assure you the mind has enough incident in it they just underestimated the amount of incident you see by aboutone tentrillionth is about all the incident they thought was there see hairbrush would be absolutely impossible to trace back to all of its engramic and secondary influences or associators be impossible it would be impossible to take any single article and trace it back to why the individual is afraid of it that would be impossible you could desensitize it you could find some reasons for it but to get the basic reason for it oh oh huh it occurs in engram chain one engram chain two engram chain three secondary chain four and 8 billion locks and it turns out not to be hairbrush anyhow it turns out to be small black animal hairbrush itself just restimulated but to set anybody job of tracing something like that back would be pure idiocy there would be point in it of any kind whatsoever wrong way to go about it wrong end to those are the cognitions that the guy gets out of it hey bridle yes yes you say coaxing him making him aware of your presence i always wondered i always wondered why i always wondered why yes its the disk on the bridle thats what it is you say well what was that well mother always used to wear cameo and it matches the disk on this bridle and its when i was killedhehat the tournament the fellow had disk on the side of the bridle and that hit and that was the last thing i saw and i used to wonder why i got colic all the time you see and my mother wore this yeah thats great im sure glad to get that straightened out well you be glad to get it straightened out too and you be glad when he moves off of it because hes going to find 8 thousand more reasons before hes through do you follow men have experienced things women have experienced things theres hardly anything an individual has not been or done at one time or another of his career and to say this is specialized thetan he has always been magistratedont make laugh at what period in his career did he get tired of being criminal and become magistrate after having been ditch digger coal heaver counsel an artisan pilot space opera ranger writer you know but the individuals experiential track is very important with regard to what he can do when he finally comes out because were producing new thing in clear were producing being without bank who has experience never had anything like that before see now one has had main points of experience on the track which have been more emphasized than other points and he will tend to be better at these things than things he has not had so much experience with but its case of emphasis not difference now where your individual is being run on engrams he can easily get in too deep but only if you push him in and if hes not running up new material if hes not running them properly why you figure out why in view of what ive been telling you now its either overor underconfront and my bet is on that its overconfront and you asked too generalized question and you took too vague an answer on something you didnt get the thing established you didnt decide what you were going to run you didnt get it all mapped out before you began it youre going to run some times when the guy was scared all right great were going to run some times when the guy was scared what was the last time he was scared all right and the individual all of sudden trips into this new mechanism of mustnt have any future back down the track he goes starts winding up in bad incidents and so forth well its simply because you sort of lost control of the whole situation you didnt steady him on and make him run what you started to run you got him all involved in whether he should go earlier and hes trying to go totally clear on engram running well if he wants to go totally clear on engram running he undoubtedly could do so undoubtedly do so itd only take him three or four lifetimes and i want to point out that the body goes to pieces in fairly regular lineup at once every seventy years or something like that and so he hasnt got time to do that you understand any more about engrams well im talking to you about the woof and the warp and the exact thing which youre auditing all the way to clear now i think that its good time that people not only got some practice auditing but also made some bowing acquaintance with that thing which has got them in the cage and its always very good thing when you find yourself in trap to find out what the trap consists of i often say that to myself when i find myself in traps but dont despair if you have not yet been able to run an engram on anybody you havent been able to run an engram because youve disdained to run some faint lock if all goes to pieces and you are longer able to make any progressand you havent been able to make any progressnot longer ableif you havent been able to make any progress with your pc and you havent been able to get him into anything you havent been able to run anything and so forth run breakfast youll find that usually works if you cant run breakfast and so forth run the time he came to the session as an incident do you know that peoplenot just that but people can be so bad off that present time and the march of time past him in this universe is itself continuous running engram he is living in moment of pain and unconsciousness and the tick tick of the clock is an engram in itself now person is pretty batty when theyre in that shape theyre very batty indeed as matter of fact you wont find them around here but thats how bad it can get and youve run into some vestige of that when youre not able to run incidents on your pc he just is not about to go anyplace its nice and safe where he is and so you can always run an incident on somebody dont listen to orders that i must run an engram run the incident your pc can confront and run and you will win all the way dont take incidents that you fish off the meter because youll throw him in over his head and i think youll have lot of fun this is great sport this is great sport i dont regard it any more than that but its very worthwhile sport and its one that you should indulge in because its going to make an awful good auditor out of you that knows great deal about the mind thank you thank you
