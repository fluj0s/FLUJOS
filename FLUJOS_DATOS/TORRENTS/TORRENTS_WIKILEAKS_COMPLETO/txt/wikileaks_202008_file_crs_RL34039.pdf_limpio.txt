development party akp to elect one of its own to be president of the re public provoked crisis the nominee the otherwise respected foreign minister abdu llah gul has roots in turkeys islamist movement and his wife wears head scarf which some secularists consider symbol of both islamism and backwardness moreove r because akp already controls the prime ministry and parliament it was ar gued that the balance of political power would be disturbed if the part also assumed the presidency the opposition engaged in mass demons trations boycotted the first round of the vote for president in parliament

government has challenging program including drafting new constitution and adva ncing economic reforms during the crisis the european union nd the us government had urged turks to adhere to their constitutional processes and warned the military not to intervene turkey is candidate for eu membership but the eus influence in turkey is limited because some european countries and many turks have

the justice and development party akp party with islamist roots which claims conservative democratic orienta tion controlled comfortable ma jority in par liament but its numbers fell short of the twothirds needed to elect president in the first and second rounds of vote sezer former head of the constitutional court is an ardent secularist who often vetoed akpproposed laws and appointments that he found conflicted with the founding na tionalist and secularist princi ples of the state both the akp and its seculari st opponents understood that much was at stake in the choice of sezers replacement on april 25 2007 prime minister recep tayyip erdogan named deputy prime minister and foreign minister abdullah gul to be the akps candidate for president in doing so erdogan appears to have severely misjudged his opposition failed to provide sufficient time for thoughtful discu ssion and contributed to one of the worst political crises in recent turkish history identity gul is widely respected as an effective foreign minister who helped to secure the opening of turkeys membership talks w ith the european union eu in 2005 and worked to smooth relations with the united states he promised to act according to secularist principles if elected president nonetheless secularists considered him to be controversial candidate partly because of his prominent role in two past banned islamist parties and mainly because his wife wears strictly islamic head scarf covering all of he r hair called turban in turkey turkish women are prohibited from wearing the head scarf in public institutions which president sezer interpreted to include the presidential palace çankaya1 secularists view the head scarf as symbol both of islamism and of retrogression to time before mustafa kemal ataturk the father of modern turkey im posed westernizing reforms on the country in the 1920s and 1930s as one of those reforms ataturk imported to turkey the french concept of laicite stricter version of secularism than that practiced in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34039crs2 2 at ataturks initiative the assembly of the new turkish republic passed sweeping laicist reforms in the name of modernization including abolition of the ottoman caliphate whose ruler held both temporal and religious power closing of religious schools while establishing system of public education outlawing of religious brotherhoods replacing the muslim calendar with one beginning with the christian era supplanting islamic law with new civil code based on swiss law and new penal code adapted from italian law among other measures laicite is said not just to separa mosque and state but to subordinate the mosque to the state 3 point made by former true path party dyp politician mehmet ali bayar at filling ataturks chair turkey picks president panel discussion at the brookings institution april 12 2007 4 however some akp appointees have served in acting capacities for extended periods of time according to the turkish constituti on president can return laws to parliament for reconsideration if parliament passes the same law unchanged second time he cannot veto it again but can refer the law to the constitutional court for determination of its validity in some cases akp has passed law unchanged in other cases it has retreated preferring to postpone its fight for another day 5 point made by milliyet washington correspondent yase min congar on the diane rehm show national public radio may 1 2007united states to turkey2 thus because of mrs guls head scarf the choice of president became an emotional figh t for the identity of the state power the opposition also argued that erdogans insistence on an akp president threatened turkeys balance of powers3 the akp already controlled the prime ministry and parliament the presidency would allow it to dominate other branches of government because of the presidents pow er to appoint the chief of staff of the armed forces constitutional court judges the higher education board and university rectors all still bastions of secularism the president also has substantial veto powers president sezer vetoed ot her high level gove rnment appointments liberally to prevent the akp from achieving control over more levers of state power in the bureaucracy and vetoed some legi slation thereby delaying akps pursuit of both its reform and re ligionfavoring agendas4 counterargument maintained that if akp elected presiden t then the voters could have restored the balance of power by denying the party mandate in national elections then scheduled to be held in november 2007 from this perspective the secularists did not need to provoke crisis over the election of president to preserve the balance of power they simply d to win the parliamentary elections5 this argument might lead to the conclusion that the opposition lacked confidence in its ability to defeat akp at the polls and chose other some would say less democratic means to achieve this goal to some extent the opposition republican peoples party chp is party of the armed forces bureaucracy legal system and academe in other words the historic secular elite fighting to retain its powers on the other side is the akp party of the aspiring lower and new middle and upper classes seeking to expand their powershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34039crs3 6 those who maintain that military intervention to protect turkeys secular identity is legal cite article 3 of the internal service law of the military which stipulates that the turkish armed forces are responsible for guarding and defending the turkish republic as defined by the constitution see soner cagaptay how will the turkish military react article written for the spanish royal institute acce ssible at http wwwwashingtoni nstituteorgopposition the republican peoples party chp atat urks party champion of secularism and the main opposition party in parliame nt had called on erdogan to choose consensus candidate for president and criticized him for not consulting before nominating gul yet following traditional practice of allowing the majority party to present candidate chp never suggested consensus candidate or named its own candidate for the presidency even before erdogans nomination of gu l chp leader deniz baykal had urged other parties in parlia ment to boycott the first round of the vote for president in order to deprive the akp of the votes required to elect its candidate and to force early national elections seculari st nongovernmental organiza tions had begun mobilizing with mass protest in ankara on apr il 14 then targeting possible erdogan presidential candidacy after the gul nomination unprecedentedly large demonstrations followed in major cities and some other urban areas against what participants viewed as threat of akp dominance on april 27 parliament convened for the first round of voting to elect president under the constitution twothirds or 367 votes from 550 members of parliament are required to ect president in the first two rounds majority or 276 votes are required in third and fourth rounds early parliamentary elections ensue if the legislators are unable to elect president akp he ld 353 seats gul received 357 votes with 361 deputie s present chp argued that quorum of 367 attendees was required for the first round to be valid it boycotted the vote in order to render it invalid chp then petitioned the constitutional court to nullify the vote military intervention the turkish military founded the modern turkish republic views itself as the protector of the republic and its secular principles and has been instrumental in the ouster of four civilian g overnments since 1960 the armed forces oversaw the drafting of the current constitution afte r 1980 coup the akp government has passed reforms to diminish the role of the military and to comply with european union eu demands for civilian control over the military yet the military remains the most respected institution in turkey with considerable influence over non military matters it has defined the major threats to the state as separatism and reactionism or isla mic fundamentalism many observers believed that the military would not silently permit the akp with its islamist origins to elect one of its own as the next president6 some secularists appeared to wish openly that the military would intervene in the process chief of the general staff general yasar buyukanit issued clear warning to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34039crs4 7 text of chief of staff buyukanits press

required to be present then parties with more than 276 deputies would have incentive to compromise and would simply wait for the third round of voting top court states vote was annulled to enable compromise turkish daily news june 28 2007akp on april 12 when he expressed hope that new president would be committed to secularism not in words but in essence7 then shortly before midnight on ap ril 27 after the first round of the presidential election the website of the ffice of the chief of the general staff carried message stating it must not be forgotten that the turkish armed forces are the sure and certain defenders of s ecularism they will make their position and stance perfectly clear as needs be let nobody have any doubt about this8 the posting also described local public events with fundamentalist ove rtones that it called an open challenge to the state in the apparel of religion in the past turkish governments had resigned in response to such warnings the akp did not instead the government spokesman reacted strongly to what he described as the inappropriat general staff statement he declared the general staff is an establishment under the pr ime ministers office it would be inconceivable if the general staff in mocracy upholding the rule of law made statement critical of the govern ment about any issue he also asserted that the statement was an attempt to influence the constitutional court9 some suggested that the militarys intervention may not have ended with its april 27 message noting that months passe d after similar dema rche in 1979 led to coup in september 198010 others considered the message itself to be an unacceptable email coup11 constitutional court ruling on may 1 the constitutional court annulle d the first round of the presidential election on the grounds that required twothirds quorum was not present12 president sezer had appointed many of th courts members and the court is seen as voice of the secular establishment it probably did not need the militarys prompting to reach its decision although the military was held responsible for the result the akp and others viewed the ruling as political one erdogan describedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34039crs5 13 turkish daily news may 2 2007it as bullet aimed at democracy13 the government said however that it would respect the decision some have compared the courts decision and the controversy over it to the us supreme court ruling in the 2000 presidential race constitutional amendments after failing to attain the newly prescribed quorum in parliament for replay of the first round of the vote for president prime minister erdogan called for early national elections he also proposed cons titutional amendments to provide for the direct election of the president in two r ounds fiveyear presidential term with the possibility of reelection instead of the current single sevenyear term reduction in the term of parliament from five year s to four definition of the parliamentary quorum at 184 for both sessions and elections and lowering of the age of eligibility for members of pa rliament to 25 parliament endorse d the amendments on may 7 president sezer vetoed them on may 25 declaring that directly elected president would create problems for the regime he suggested that it would be better if the amendments were debated in public and then discussed in parliament as expecte d however par liament passed the amendments again in the same form on june 1 the constitution did not allow sezer to veto them second time on june 18 he referred the amendments for publication to be presented to national referendum to be held 120 days thereafter at the same time he petitioned the constitutional court to invalidate the amendment package on july 5 the court rejected the presidents appeal paving the way for referendum on the amendments to be held on october 21 when they probably will be approved parliamentary elections parliamentary elections were held on july 22 instead of november 4 as otherwise scheduled the contestants after taking office in 2002 akp did not fo cus that much on an islamist agenda instead it endeavored to reposition itself as centrist party by emphasizing economic reforms that appealed to all classes and the government built roads hospitals and housing akp provided generally good g overnance and experienced few corruption scandals with regard to the latter it benefitted from relatively obliging media much of which is controlled by business moguls who have profited from the governments market reforms and priva tization programs finally prime minister erdogan provided akp with charismatic leader known for his common touch and communication skillshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34039crs6 some opposition parties attempted to coalesce before the election to ensure that they obtained at least 10 of the vote needed to enter parliament and to target

former prime minister necmettin erbakan leader of several earlier and banned islamist parties although ot her such believers remained on the lists erdogan also gave slots to defectors from chp and the centerright some minority figures and wellknown intellectuals meanwhile bayk eliminated about half of chps deputies and placed severa l prominent former anavatan and dyp centrists high on his lists14 campaign the akps political machine is formidable its grassroots operation is well oiled it controls central government minis tries which have i nvested in visible infrastructure projects and the many cal governments it heads provide critical social services nonakp parties failed to build comparable political organizations and lacked governmental resources still the political climate was viewed as more fluid than before the presidential electi on crisis and gave opposition parties greater hope the akp campaigned mainly on its economic performance since the akp took office in 2002 the economy has experien ced an average annual growth rate of 75 drop in the rate of inflation from 60 to about 9 an almost doubling of per capita income threefold increase in exports and tenfold increase in foreign investment to more than 20 billion in 2006 this theme resonated with voters more than others even though employment has not kept pace with other indicators the party also portrayed itself as having been victimized in the presidential election process because its candidate foreign minister gul is religious akp did not openly blame the military letting voters reach their own conclusions in addition akp argued that the fear of state ruled by seriat shariah islamic law is irrational and unsupported by its record in office prime minister erdogan also emphasized the ineptitude of earlier coalition governments compared to akps capable singleparty rule he did not appear to adequately counter accusati ons of ineffectiveness against pkk terrorism which probably was akps main weakness his stump speeches stressed that national unity is the best way to fight terrorism not exactly way to rouse the masses on june 12 he voiced opposition to an immediate incu rsion into northern iraq

baykal charged that prime minister erdogan is the most important obstacle to turkeys fight against terrorism because of his reluctance to launch an incursion into northern iraq15 baykal also assailed akp for deferring to us and european entreaties to stay outof iraq 16 his party claimed that the european union eu and united states demanded improvements in the human rights of ethnic and religious minorities in order to divide the country17 mhp voiced similar views chp had little else on which to campaign chp had failed to present an alternative vision or prog rams during its four and half years in opposition in parliament under baykals leadership the party opposed akp initiatives polarized the political climate and fueled xenophobic nationalism although selfdescribed leftist or social democratic party it proposed programs to serve the lower classes in 2002 chp ran what seemed to be campaign against religion offending many voters and geographically limiting its electoral successes to thrace and the aegean baykal had said that chps 2007 campaign again would be battle to defend secularism instead he mainly rped on akps alleged failure to counter terrorism dp had the potential to attract voters that the centerright lost to akp in 2002 yet dp had problems filling out its electoral lists which weakened its competitiveness dp leader mehmet agar himself implicated during an infamous scandal in the 1990s also gave slots on th lists to other disc redited politicians who may have harmed the partys image mo reover the campaigns focus on terrorism benefitted nationalist parties on the right and left more than dp analysis of parties and leaders the electoral contest was not simple one between islamists and secularists or the akp and the military it was simultaneously both of these and more the parties and leaders have complicated and sometimes conflicting records while turkey has indeed been democratizing and improving its overall human rights record some consider the democratic credentials of the major contenders deficient akp won only 34 of the vote in 2002 but governed as if it had won majority and did not reach out to the opposition it passed series of unquestionably revolutionary reforms to enable turkey to meet the european unions political and economic criteria for membership18 and called for even more democratic advances so that religious womenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34039crs9 18 continued democracy the rule of law human rights nd respect for and protection of minorities the existence of functioning market economy as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the union and the ability to take on the obligations of membership including adherence to the ai ms of political economic and monetary union 19 alevis practice heterodox faith based on shiite islam sufism and other elements the continuedcould freely wear their chosen attire in public institutions it also increased educational and broadcast rights for turk ish kurds yet prime minister erdogan never fulfilled his august 2005 promise to provide answers to the kurdish problem with more democracy and instead adopted less controversial hardline rhetoric an upsurge in pkk violence may account for some of his reticence to launch innovative policies but resistence from the military and nationalists was probably even more responsible for the inertia in addition akp did not revise the not orious penal code article 301 which criminalizes speech that insults turkis hness produced judicial prosecutions of literary luminaries such as nobel prize winner orhan pamuk and perhaps provoked the murder of armenian journalist hran t dink in january 2007 finally akp did not attempt to lower the 10 of the vote threshold to enter parliament which effectively deprives many voters of their fra nchise and right to be represented in the government lower threshold would llow the democratic society party dtp kurdish group to enter parliament as party and provide more democracy the military and nationalists oppose lower thre shold precisely because it would allow dtp with its focus on an ethnic identity to join the legislature again akp chose not to confront this opposition some observers believe that prime minister erdogan has the same autocratic tendencies that were characteristic of past turkish party and government leaders from this viewpoint his personal litigiousness against journalists and others reveals lack of understanding of freedom of ex pression his failure to consult widely regarding the nomination of president was troubling even if it was his prerogative his rush to amend the constitution without parliamentary or public deba was equally disturbing and gave rise to pe rception that the prime minister sought to change the rules simply because he coul d not get his way under the old ones and not to improve turkeys democracy furthermore the package of amendments contains potentially undemocratic and controversial provision th amendment to lower the quorum to 184 out of 550 for all legislative matters and elections would allow small minority of legislators to decide conse quential issues for the entire country by contrast the us constituti on defines working congressional quorum as majority while not seeking seriat shariah islamic law state as its opponents claim akps record on the role of religion in the state included actions that aroused the distrust of secularists and ot her observers concerning its goals the party is suspected of infiltrating sympathetic followers into the educational judicial and even military ranks it took actions favorin g sunni believers over others by failing to provide equal treatment for nonsunni muslim religious adherents such as the large alevi muslim minority and by failing to complete reforms to end mistreatment of nonmuslims19httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34039crs10 19 continued akp refused to recognize them as adherents of faith different from sunni islam 20 final results as published in the official gazette anatolia july 31 2007 bbc monitoring europeanthe directorate for religious affa irs appointed about 25000 new imams an unusually large number without much justif ication while refusi ng to fund alevi institutions akp pushed legislation to enable graduates of imamhatip religious or imam training schools to ter universities on an equal footing with graduates of state schools who have had liberal educati ons prime minister erdogan called for adultery to be criminalized and backed down only after european criticism he questioned the right of the european c ourt of human rights whose jurisdiction turkey accepts instead of religious scholars ulema to judge the head scarf issue for its part the chp cannot truly be sa id to be champion of democracy it argues that democracy is im possible without secularism yet its belief in democratic principles seems circumscribed as the party and its followers failed to react to the militarys interference in the presidential election and even appeared desirous of military intervention from which they could benefit politically moreover the chp often seems lacking in tolerance it vi ews the granting of rights to kurds and non muslim religious minorities as threats to th territorial integrity of the state and opposes revision of article 301 the party also is unwilling to openly discuss the head scarf issue when the majority of rkish women wear head coverings women made up only 10 of chps electoral lists chp also did not take up the issue of lowering 10 of the vote threshold to enter parliament in order to expand participation in the political system again probably due to its desire to keep kurdishbased party out of parliament moreover some argue that chp had overblown an unreal threat of seriat shariah state for political gain and that its wanton fearmongering exacerbated divisions in the country finally many observers note that deniz baykal

by larger margin 12 than in its first victory since 1954 when the democratic party then bested its earlier showing by onl 3 the vote is huge personal victory for prime minister erdogan without whom his party could not have achieved this result the outcome also is an ndorsement of the akps performance in government especially its ec onomic record while strongest in central anatolia the akp is the only party to register nationw ide appeal it even took votes from dtp in the latters presumed eastern and south eastern strongholds which may reflect the kurds appreciation for akpdelivered public services for reforms that have allowed them more linguistic freedom as well as their belief that akp was more likely to try to avoid military action that might harm their ethnic kin in norther iraq some kurds may believe that they longer need an ethnically identified party to achieve their goals while overwhelmingly favored by the poor the akp garnered votes from all social classes and educati onal groups reputable postelection survey found that 852 of akp voters favored the ruling party because of the economic situation and their expectations while 325 cited the unfair treatment of gu ls presidential bid21 meanwhile chp is again representing mainly thrace and the aegean regions the upper classes and the university educated as result of the election akp is the so party representing the center of the political spectrum in parliament and erdogan was able to form another single party government the election emphasized the turkish peoples preference for democracy voters resoundingly rejected the chps extraparlia mentary tactics of boycotts and appeals to the unelected judiciary as well as th militarys intervention even voters who do not agree with the more religionfavoring aspects of akps agenda seemed to want the military to recognize that turkeys mocracy has matured beyond the need for its interference and could handle what ever may happen on the religion front mehmet

that had not been applied to ot her candidate countries despite turkeys failure to meet commitment to open its ports to the internationally recognized greek cypriot government of the republic of
