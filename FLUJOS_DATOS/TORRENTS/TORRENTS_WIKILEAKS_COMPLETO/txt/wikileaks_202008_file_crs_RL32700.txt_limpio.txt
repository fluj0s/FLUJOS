agreement background legislative procedure and practical consequences updated june 9 2005 vladimir n pregelj specialist in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress seeking withdrawal of congressional approval of the wto agreement background legislative procedure and practical consequences summary the uruguay round agreements act uraa legislatively approved the world trade organization wto agreement and the specialized agreements annexed to it it also enacted the provisions implementing the many obligations the united states undertook under them and contains provisions section 125 establishing the legislative procedure for congressional withdrawal of such approval initiation of such withdrawal action is predicated on the transmission by the administration of mandatory quinquennial report next due by march 1 2005 analyzing the costs and benefits of past us participation in the wto as well as the value of continued us participation thereupon privileged joint resolution may be introduced by any member to withdraw the congress approval of the wto agreement provided by the uraa the legislative procedure for such withdrawal basically follows section 152 of the trade act of 1974 which provides for the enactment of joint resolutions disapproving certain traderelated actions which for this purpose has been modified specifically by section 125 of the uraa the procedure provides for nonmandatory introduction of the resolution with mandatory nonamendable language and specific expedited fasttrack consideration although the immediate function of the withdrawal provision is to create mechanism that will permit periodic congressional review of us participation in the wto and the provision focuses specifically on withdrawing the approval of the wto agreement it has been considered in congress and in the civil society in the broader context of united states withdrawal from actual participation ie membership in the wto on june 9 2005 the house defeated resolution hjres 27 to withdraw approval of the wto agreement by vote of 33886 similar resolution in the year 2000 failed by wider margin 36356 in the house and withdrawal resolution was not even introduced in the senate resolution offers congress the opportunity to debate the costs and benefits of us participation in the wto in this context congressional concern with us trading partners particularly the european union and canada and various other contentious issues emerged in the floor debate and statements on hjres 27 such issues are dealt with in detail in crs report rl32918 world trade organization wto issues in the debate on us participation by ian f fergusson and lenore sek this report which will be updated as needed sets out the background of the issue the functional timetable and requirements for taking the legislative action for such withdrawal and the related wto procedure it also describes past and current activity under the withdrawal provision and suggests the probable consequences of the withdrawal resolution if enacted and implemented contents background 1 legislative procedure 3 implementation procedure 7 practical consequences 8 congressional activity 10 seeking withdrawal of congressional approval of the wto agreement background legislative procedure and practical consequences background the uruguay round agreements act uraa pl 103465 in section 101 19 usc 3511 authorized the acceptance by the president of united states membership in the world trade organization wto and thereby of the rights and obligations of the agreement establishing the world trade organization wto agreement with its annexed specialized multilateral and plurilateral trade agreements1 the uraa on the other hand also contains provisions spelling out the legislative procedure whereby the statutory approval of the wto agreement and thereby of the united states membership in the wto can be withdrawn this legislation functionally ties the withdrawal of the us legislative approval of the wto agreement to the requirement of periodic reports by the executive to the congress on the operation of the wto and its effects on the united states section 124 of the uraa 19 usc 3534 requires the us trade representative to submit to the congress by march 1 of each year beginning in 1996 report on wide range of wto activities and administrative aspects of wto operations during the preceding wto fiscal year which is the calendar year moreover as required by section 125 of the uruguay round agreements act 19 usc 2535 beginning with march 1 2000 and every fifth year thereafter such report transmitted by the president must include an analysis of the effects of the wto agreement on the interests of the united states the costs and benefits to the united states of its participation in the wto and the value of the continued participation of the united states in the wto as pointed out in the section on disapproval resolutions contained in the statement of administrative action part of the documentation which is required 1 multilateral trade agreements mtas are agreements to which government automatically becomes party by accepting membership in the wto and hence apply between all wto members plurilateral trade agreements ptas apply only between wto members that specifically accede to them at present there are only two ptas agreement on trade in civil aircraft and agreement on government procurement both acceded to by the united states crs2 to be transmitted by the president to the congress together with the draft of the implementing bill for the uruguay round agreements act the provision creates mechanism that will permit periodic congressional review of us participation in the wto2 following the submission of such quinquennial report and its review by congress congress can withdraw its approval of the wto agreement leading to the termination of the united states participation in the wto through the enactment of joint resolution disapproving the original approval of the wto agreement the reasons for the disapproval provision are explained by the house ways and means committee as follows the purpose of this provision is to provide an opportunity for the congress to evaluate the transition of the gatt to the wto and to assess periodically whether continued membership in this organization is in the best interest of the united states it is the desire of the committee not to leave this decision totally in the hands of the executive branch but to be active in determining whether the wto is an effective organization for achieving common trade goals and principles and for settling trade disputes among sovereign nations in the course of the fiveyear review individual members of congress can evaluate whether the wto remains on course as tradeoriented organization and has not expanded its activities to nontrade related areas congress wants to ensure that the united states can continue to exercise substantial influence within the wto and successfully promote goals that benefit american producers workers and consumers congress may vote on joint resolution disapproving the continued participation of the us in the wto3 the senate report on the provision similarly states regarding united states continued membership in the wto that section 125 establishes mechanism through which the congress may withdraw the approval of us participation in the wto granted under section 102a of the bill congress may consider and adopt joint resolution providing for withdrawal of us approval of the wto agreement the effect of which would be to end us participation in the wto4 2 us president clinton

round agreements act joint report to accompany s continued crs3 the withdrawal provision was added to the original draft of the measure in the trade subcommittee of the house ways and means committee prior to its introduction since the bill implementing the wto agreement was to be considered under the fasttrack procedure and hence could not be amended once introduced any changes to it had to be made before its formal introduction in mock markups in the relevant committees with both congressional and executive participation the withdrawal issue came into legislative focus for the first time after the presidents quinquennial report of march 2 2000 but congressional disapproval action initiated in response to that report was unsuccessful see p 910 legislative procedure the legislation lays out specific expedited fasttrack procedure to be followed by the congress in the consideration of the withdrawal measure to the extent that it differs from the regular procedure5 this procedure follows in the main the special abbreviated fasttrack procedure for the consideration of resolutions disapproving certain actions section 152 of the trade act of 1974 as amended 19 usc 21926 which has been modified with respect to the timetable for certain legislative steps by the provisions of section 125 itself the provisions of both section 152 of the trade act of 1974 and section 125 of the uraa are specifically defined as exercises of the rulemaking power of either house and deemed part of the rules of either house they can be changed by either house with respect to its own procedure at any time in the same manner and to the same extent as any other rule of that house section 151a of the trade act of 1974 as amended applied to the procedure by section 152 of the same act and section 125d of the uruguay round agreements act 19 usc 2191a 2192 and 3535d in the presentation that follows consequently statutory references to section 125 refer to that section of the uruguay round agreements act 19 usc 3535 while those to section 152 refer to that section of the trade act of 1974 19 usc 2192 functionally the timetable for legislative consideration of the joint resolution of disapproval encompasses the following steps 4 continued 2467 srept 103412 washington us govt print offnovember 22 1994 p 24 5 steps that are part of the regular legislative procedure omitted in this specific legislation but applicable to it are added in this report in parentheses at the appropriate places 6 this procedure is used primarily for enacting joint resolutions to disapprove presidential determinations that nonmarketeconomy country is not in violation of the freeemigration requirements of the jacksonvanik amendment sec 402b trade act of 1974 19 usc 2192b or to disapprove presidential

law sec 125c1 19 usc 3535c1 to read after the resolving clause only as follows that the congress withdraws its approval provided under section 101a of the uruguay round agreements act of the wto agreement as defined in section 29 of that act this provision by its very nature makes the withdrawal resolution nonamendable 3 committee referral the resolution is referred in the house to the committee on ways and means and in the senate to the committee on finance sec 152b 19 usc 2192b 4 committee consideration if the committee of either house to which the resolution has been referred has not reported it within 45 days9 after its introduction the committee is automatically discharged from further consideration of the resolution and the resolution is placed on the appropriate calendar for floor consideration sec 125c2c 19 usc 3535c2c also placed on the appropriate calendar under regular legislative procedure are measures that have been reported whether favorably or adversely 7 the 90day period excludes any day on which either house is not in session because of an adjournment of more than three days to day certain or sine die and any saturday and sunday on which either house is

ways and means committee or that committee has been discharged sec 125c2dii 19 usc 3535c2dii b motion to proceed to the consideration of the resolution may only be made on the second legislative day after the calendar day on which the sponsor of the motion announces to the house his intention to do so sec 125c2e 19 usc 3535c2e the motion is highly privileged and nondebatable amendment to the motion nor motion to reconsider the vote by which it has been agreed or disagreed to is in order sec 152d1 19 usc 2192d1 c debate is limited to 20 hours divided equally between those favoring and

f except as provided in the preceding provisions consideration of the resolution is governed by the rules of the house of representatives applicable to other measures in similar circumstances sec 152d5 19 usc 2192d5 hence like all expedited procedures this procedure can be superseded by the houses adoption of resolution reported by the rules committee providing for different procedure 10 the exception for resolution adopted by the other house cannot apply to the consideration of the senatepassed withdrawal resolution in the house of representatives since senate resolution passed by that chamber is to be kept at the desk and is hence not transmitted to the house for the latters consideration see item 7c on next page crs6 7 procedure in the senate joint resolution of withdrawal that has passed the house is upon receipt by the senate referred to the committee on finance sec 152f1ai 19 usc 2192f1ai b if joint resolution was introduced in the senate before receipt of the resolution passed by the house the house resolution is placed on the senate calendar but the senate considers its own resolution except that the senate vote on the passage of the resolution is on the house resolution sec 152f1aii 19 usc 2192f1aii c if the senate passes joint resolution of withdrawal before receiving the passed house resolution its resolution is held at the desk pending the receipt of the house resolution upon receipt of the house resolution the latter is deemed to have been read twice considered read the third time and passed sec152f1b 19 usc 2192f1b in the procedure for the enactment of withdrawal resolution items b and c are materially irrelevant since they imply the possibility of difference between the house and senate languages of the measure possible in the consideration of some other resolutions under section 152 see footnote 4 but not of wto withdrawal resolution in view of its mandatory language this procedure also makes it functionally clear that resolution of withdrawal cannot be adopted unless it is house joint resolution 8 floor consideration in the senate motion to proceed to the consideration of the resolution is privileged an amendment to the motion is not in order nor is motion to reconsider the vote on the motion to proceed whether agreed or disagreed to sec 152e1 19 usc 2192e1 b debate on the joint resolution and all debatable motions and appeals connected therewith is limited to 20 hours equally divided between and controlled by the majority leader and the minority leader or their designees sec 152e2 19 usc 2192e2 c debate on any debatable motion or appeal is limited to one hour equally divided between and controlled by its mover and the manager of the resolution except that when the manager is in favor of such motion or appeal the time in opposition is controlled by the minority leader or his designee such leaders or either of them may from time under their control on the passage of the resolution allot additional time to any senator during the consideration of any debatable motion or appeal sec 152e3 19 usc 2192e3 d motion to further limit debate on the resolution on debatable motion or on an appeal is nondebatable and amendment to or motion to recommit the resolution is in order sec 152e4 19 usc 2192e4 crs7 9 deadline for transmission to the president if the congress adopts joint resolution of withdrawal it must transmit it to the president within 90 days11 from the receipt of the presidents quinquennial report sec 125b2i 19 usc 3535b2i 10 override of the veto if the president vetoes the joint resolution each house may vote to override the veto by twothirds majority either by the last day of the 90day period beginning on the date the congress receives the presidents report or the last day of the 15day period12 beginning on the date the congress receives the veto message whichever is later sec 125b2aii 19 usc 3535b2aii in the senate consideration of veto message including consideration of any debatable motions and appeals related thereto is limited to ten hours equally divided between and controlled by the majority leader and the minority leader or their designees sec 152f3 19 usc f3 under the rules of the house of representatives the debate on overriding presidential veto is normally limited to one hour implementation procedure 1 implementation of the withdrawal by the united states13 section 125 is not selfimplementing nor does it contain any specific provision regarding the withdrawal resolutions entry into effect presumably on the date of its enactment nor directive presumably to the president to transmit the notice of withdrawal to the directorgeneral14 nor the deadline for such transmittal this discrepancy was noted with some other relevant comments on page 4 of the house report on the measure as follows while enactment of resolution withdrawing congressional approval under section 125 would call into question the future of us participation in the wto it does not expressly provide for the president to withdraw from the wto nor would the resolution put the united states in violation of its wto obligations15 2 wto withdrawal procedure the withdrawal of member from the wto is regulated by article xv of the wto agreement the provision requires the transmission of written notice of 11 computed as in footnote 7 12 both periods computed as in footnote 7 13 assuming that the resolution has been adopted 14 see section 2 below 15 see footnote 3 crs8 withdrawal by the withdrawing member to the directorgeneral of the wto which takes effect six months after the date of its receipt and applies to the wto agreement and all related multilateral trade agreements withdrawal from plurilateral agreements acceded to by the withdrawing member is controlled by the specific provisions of such agreements thus the withdrawal from the plurilateral agreement on government procurement under its article 10 takes effect 60 days after the receipt of written notice of withdrawal by the directorgeneral of the wto and the withdrawal from the agreement on civilian aircraft under its article 96 12 months from the receipt of the written notice practical consequences whether or not the withdrawal resolution is adopted its mandatory consideration after its introduction can be expected to deal with various causes of dissatisfaction and in some instances frustration that some members not all on the proponent side of the withdrawal issue feel toward the wto regime as in the debate on the withdrawal resolution introduced in 2000 see section of past activity on next page the salient arguments in favor of the resolution as put forward by its supporters in the debate are likely to be the encroachment on us sovereignty by virtue of us membership in the wto and submission to the obligations under the wto agreement usurpation of congress constitutional power to regulate commerce with foreign nations violation of the us constitution by implementing the wto agreement as congressionalexecutive agreement rather than treaty and more tangibly the perceived for the united states adverse results of the wto dispute settlement mechanism16 in cases where the united states is either the complainant or the defendant again as in 2000 the opposition to the resolution is likely to argue that the wto has contributed greatly to the expansion regulation and transparency of international trade including that of the united states and that some deficiencies of the wto regime as seen by the supporters of the resolution are nonexistent and their adverse effects exaggerated and merely in need of reform rather than being sufficient reason for united states withdrawal from the wto in the event that the withdrawal resolution is adopted and actually implemented by the united states withdrawal from the wto such withdrawal would on the most general level exclude the united states from participation in an international multilateral system of trade rules and practices which initially in the general agreement on tariffs and trade of 1947 was formulated and promoted principally by the united states itself since then it has been greatly expanded in the form of the wto agreement likewise with the united states participation and under its leadership into worldwide comprehensive code of rules covering most aspects of 16 for information on various aspects of the wto dispute settlement mechanism see crs report rs20088 dispute settlement in the world trade organization an overview crs report rs21763 wto dispute settlement stages and pending us activity before the dispute settlement body and crs report rl32014 wto dispute settlement status of us compliance in pending cases crs9 international trade this code has radically reduced tariff and nontariff obstacles to free flows of world commerce in goods and services and provided forum for settling international trade disputes us withdrawal from the wto also would likely erode the us leadership position in international trade relations and thereby possibly put strain on the cohesiveness of the organization on more specific functional level the withdrawal would relieve the united states from the obligations stemming specifically from the wto agreement but also preclude it from benefitting from its rights under the agreement particularly from access to wto dispute settlement mechanism except for that access however this exclusion from the wto regime would in practice be likely to result in very limited selective changes in the united states position in international trade at least in the short run on the us side most obligations under the wto agreement have been enacted by the uraa as general us domestic law and would not be automatically repealed by the withdrawal resolution to that extent they would continue to apply not only to wto members but to us trading partners in general some provisions of the wto agreement have been substantively in effect on the basis of earlier also generally applicable legislation others have been amended or newly enacted by the uraa again as generally applicable domestic legislation such applicability would not cease due to the us withdrawal from the wto similarly those us present rights under the wto ie obligations of other wto members toward the united states which are reflected in those countries generally applicable statutes or regulations would not cease to apply to the united states in either case appropriate action in the united states by new legislation would need to be taken to nullify their reciprocal applicability if the united states withdraws from the wto its trade relationships with number of countries could continue to be regulated by earlier bilateral compacts with them substantially less comprehensive than the wto which are still in force but currently suspended while both parties are members of the wto and by later agreements not related to the wto eg freetrade agreements within these parameters the united states but also all other wto members would be free of any restraint that is now mandated by wto rules if they wished to take any adverse action against each other by acting in such manner however they would be open to unrestrained retaliation and counterretaliation without recourse to the established wto mediatory or conciliatory procedure in this context us withdrawal from the wto would result in major disadvantage for the united states the loss of access to the wto dispute settlement mechanism with the concomitant loss of potential wto approval of wtolegal retaliatory action on the part of the united states in the event that the challenged us measure could have been found not to be in violation of wto rules crs10 congressional activity the first section 125 report was included as chapter ii world trade organization in 2000 trade policy agenda and 1999 annual report of the president of the united states on the trade agreements program transmitted to congress on march 2 2000 the report presented favorably the wto accomplishments that took place during the preceding fiveyear review period but also discussed in detail issues still to be resolved with regard to the future operation of the organization in response representative ron paul tx and several cosponsors introduced on march 6 2000 hjres 90 to withdraw
