president bush signed bcra into law senator mitch mcconnell filed suit in us district court for the district of columbia against the federal election commission fec and the federal communications commission fcc arguing that portions of bcra violate the first amendment and the equal protection component of the due process clause of the fifth amendment to the constitution likewise the national rifle association nra filed suit against the fec and the attorney general arguing that the law deprives it of freedom of speech and association of the right to petition the government for redress of grievances and of the rights to equal protection and due process in violation of the first and fifth am endments to the constitution ultimately eleven suits challenging the law were brought by more than 80 plaintiffs and were consolidated into one lead case mcconnell v fec on may 2 2003 the us district court for the di strict of columbia issued its decision in mcconnell v fec 1 striking down many significant provisions of the law the threejudge panel which was split 2 to 1 on many issues ordered that its ruling take effect immediately after the court issued its opinion several appeals were filed and on may 19 the us district court issued stay to its ruling leaving bcra as enacted in effect until the supreme court ruled under the bcra expedited review provision the courts cision was directly reviewed by the us supreme court on september 8 the supreme court returned to the bench month before its term officially began to hear four hours of oral argument in the case and issued its

since its 1976 decision in buckley v valeo2 the us supreme court in mcconnell v fec3 upheld against facial constitutional challenges key portions of bcra the most significant portion of the courts decision is the 119 page majority opinion coauthored by justices stevens and oconnor joined by justices souter ginsburg and breyer in which the court upheld two critical features of bcra the limits on raising and spending previously unregulated political party soft money and the prohibition on corporations and labor unions using treasury fundswhich is unregulated soft moneyto finance electioneering

according to the contribution limits source prohibitions and disclosure requirements of the federal election campaign act feca while the term soft money is used to describe funds raised and spent outside the federal election regulatory framework but which may have at least an indirect impact on federal elections in upholding bcras two principal complementary features the mcconnell court readily acknowledged that it was under illusion that bcra will be the last c ongressional statement on the matter of money in politics money like wa ter will always find an outlet the court predicted and therefore campaign finance issues that will inevitably arise and corresponding legislative responses from congress are concerns for another day4 indeed in 2007 the court in fec v wisconsin right to life inc wrtl ii5 determined that bcras electioneering communications provision was unconstitutional as applied to ads that wisconsin right to life inc sought to run thereby limiting the laws

of bcra prohibits nationa l party committees and their agents from soliciting receiving directing or spending any soft money6 as the court noted title i takes the national parties out of the softmoney business7 in addition title i prohibits state and local party committees from using soft money for activities that affect federal elections prohibits parties from soliciting for and donating funds to taxexempt organizations that spend money in connection with federal elections prohibits federal candidates and officeholders from receiving spending or soliciting soft money in connection with federal elections and restricts their ability to do so in connection with state and local elections and prevents circumvention of the restrictions on national state and local party committees by prohibiting state and local candidates from raising and spending soft money to fund advertisements and other public communications that promote or attack federal candidates 8 plaintiffs challenged title i based on the first amendment as well as art i 4 of the us constitution principles of federalism and the equal protection component of the due process clause of the 14th amendment the court upheld the constitutionality of all provisions in title i finding that its provisions satisfy the first amendment test applicable to limits on campaign contributions they are closely drawn to effect the sufficiently important interest of preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption rejecting plaintiffs contention that the bcra restrictions on campaign contributions must be subject to strict scrutiny in evaluating the consti tutionality of title i the court applied the less rigorous standard of reviewclosely drawn scrutiny citing its landmark 1976 decision buckley v valeo and its progeny the court noted that it has long subjected restrictions on campaign expenditures to closer scrutiny than limits on contributions in view of the comparatively marginal restriction upon the contributors ability to engage in free communication that contribution limits entail 9 the court observed that its treatment of 4 id at 224 5 127 s ct 2652 2007 6 see 2 usc 441ia 7 mcconnell 540 us at 133 8 see 2

also warranted by the important interests that underlie such restrictions ie preventing both actual corruption threatened by larg dollar contributions as well as the erosion of public confidence in the electoral process resulting from the appearance of corruption determining that the lesser standard shows proper deference to congress ability to weigh competing constitutional interests in an area in which it enjoys particular expertise the court noted that during its lengthy consideration of bcra congress properly relied on its authority to regulate in this area and hence considerations of stare decisis as well as respect for the legislative branch of government provided additional powerful reasons for adhering to the treatment of contribution limits that the court has consistently followed since 1976 10 responding to plaintiffs argument that many of the provisions in title i restrict not only contributions but also the spending and solicitati on of funds that were raised outside of fecas contribution limits the court determined that it is irrelevant that congress chose to regulate contributions on the demand rather than the supply side instead the relevant inquiry is whether its mechanism to implement contribution limit or to prevent circumvention of that limit burdens speech in way that direct restriction on contribution would not the court concluded that title i only burdens speech to the extent of contribution limit it merely limits the source and individual amount of donations simply because title i accomplishes its goals by prohibiting the spending of soft money does not render it tantamount to an expenditure limitation11 unpersuaded by dissenting justices position that congress regulatory interest is limited to only the prevention of actual or apparent quid pro quo corruption inherent in contributions made to candidate12 the court found that such crabbed view of corruption and specifically the appearance of corruption ignores precedent common sense and the realities of political fundraising exposed by the record in this litigation13 according to the court equally problematic as classic quid pro quo corruption is the danger that officeholders running for re election will make legislative decisions in accordance with the wishes of large financial contributors instead of deciding issues based on the merits or constituent interests as such corruption is neither easily detected nor practical to criminalize the court reasoned title i offers the best means of prevention ie identifying and eliminating the temptation14

instead the statute requires that such ads may only be paid for with corporate and labor union political action committee pac regulated hard money16 the court upheld the constitutionality of this provision in buckley v valeo17 the court construed fecas disclosure and reporting requirements as well as its expenditure limitations to apply only to funds used for communications that contain express advocacy of the election or defeat of clearly identified candidate numerous lower courts have since interpreted buckley to stand for the proposition that communications must contain express terms of advocacy such as vote for or vote against in order for regulation of such communications to pass constitutional muster under the first amendment absent express advocacy according to most lower courts communication is considered issue advocacy which is protected by the first amendment and therefore may not be regulated effectively overturning such lower court rulings the mcconnell court held that neither the first amendment nor buckley prohibits bcras regulation of electioneering communications even though electioneering communications by definition do not necessarily contain express advocacy when the buckley court distinguished between express and issue advocacy the mcconnell court found it did so as matter of statutory interpretation not constitutional command moreover the court announced that by narrowly reading the feca provisions in buckley to avoid problems of vagueness and overbreadth it did not suggest that statute that was neither vague nor overbroad would be required to toe the same express advocacy line 18 the presence or absence of magic words cannot meaningfully distinguish electioneering sp eech from true issue ad according to the court19 while title ii prohibits corporations and labor unions from using their general treasury funds for electioneering communications the court observed that they are still free to use separate segregated funds pacs to run such ads therefor the court concluded that it is erroneous to view this provision of bcra as complete ban on expression rather than simply regulation20 further the court found that the regulation is not overbroad because the vast majority of ads that are broadcast within the electioneering communication time period 60 days before general election and 30 days before primary have an electioneering purpose 21 the court also rejected plaintiffs assertion that the segregated fund requirement for electioneering communications is underinclusive because it only applies to broadcast advertisements and not print or internet communications congress is permitted the court determined to take one step at time to address the problems it identifies as acute with title ii of bcra the court observed congress chose to address the problem of corporations and unions using soft money to finance virtual torrent of televised electionrelated ads in recent campaigns 22 in upholding bcras extension of the prohibition on using treasury funds for financing electioneering communications to nonprofit corporations the mcconnell court found that even though the statute does not expressly exempt organizations meeting the criteria established in its 16 see 2 usc 441bb 17 see 424 us 1 80 1976 18 mcconnell 540 us at 192 19 id at 193 20 id at 204 21 id at 206 22 id at 207

insufficient reason to invalidate the entire section as mcfl had been established supreme court precedent for many years prior to enactment of bcra the court assumed that when congress drafted this section of bcra it was well aware that it could not validly apply to mcfltype entities24 subsequently in the 2007 decision fec v wisconsin right to life inc wrtl ii25 the supreme court held that title ii of bcra was unconstitutional as applied to ads that wisconsin right to life inc sought to run while not expressly overruling its 2003 ruling in mcconnell v fec the court limited the laws application specifically it ruled that advertisements that may reasonably be interpreted as something other than an appeal to vote for or against specific candidate are not the functional equivalent of express advocacy and therefore cannot be regulated 26
