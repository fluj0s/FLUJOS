will be repealed gradually by the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra repeal of the federal estate tax and increase of the exclusion amount or its credit equivalent as prescribed by egtrra will also repeal or diminish most state estate inheritance and gift taxes1 in fy2005 state estate and gift tax revenue was 082 of total state tax revenue but there was considerable variation among the states2 this report will briefly describe the federal credit for state estate taxes and provide data on the relative importance of estate inheritance and gift taxes to each state and the district of columbia g17g159g142g155g159g146g142g160g561 the federal credit for state estate taxes first appeared in the revenue act of 1924 some eight years after the introduction of the federal estate tax the 1924 act stipulated that estates could claim credit for state estate taxes up to 25 of the federal estate tax liability after numerous modifications since its introduction the federal credit was schedule of 21 gradually increasing rates beginning at 0 and eventually reaching 16 the rates were levied on the value of the net federal estate less 60000 exemption the remainder was called the adjusted taxable estate the top credit rate of 16 applied to adjusted taxable estate values over 10040000

g344g342g342g343g561g507g7g9g22g20g20g3g508g561 because many state tax codes are linked directly to federal tax code changes in federal law also affect the state tax codes two parts of egtrra affect the tax revenue generated by state estate taxes first egtrra phased out the federal credit for state death taxes for deaths occurring before january 1 2005 and replaced it with deduction beginning in 2005 the phaseout began in 2002 when the credit was reduced by 25 by 50 in 2003 and by 75 in 2004 when estates began deducting state estate taxes the value of the deduction in terms of reduced tax liability is the top marginal federal estate tax rate 45 in 2007 multiplied by state estate taxes paid in contrast before egtrra the value of the credit was 100 or it reduced federal tax liability dollarfordollar thus after egtrra state estate taxes impose real tax liability or burden in addition the applicable exclusion amount for federal estate taxes has increased to 2 million the increase in the applicable exclusion amount is important to many states because it also serves as the filing threshold for the federal estate tax some states require estates to file state return only when federal return is required if fewer federal estate tax returns are filed then fewer state estate tax returns would be filed states could avoid losing revenue by decoupling from the federal tax code as some have since egtrra became law however the changes enacted by egtrra will necessarily create state estate tax burdens if states decouple from the federal tax code and collect estate tax revenue if repeal of the federal estate tax is made permanent the estates of those dying in states with free standing estate tax would still pay state estate taxes according to recent survey 24 states and 1 for the remainder of the report all state taxes that are triggered by death will be referred to as state estate taxes state estate taxes thus include state inheritance taxes succession taxes and estate taxes 2 us census bureau governments division state government tax collections website httpwwwcensusgovgovs wwwstatetax05html visited may 4 2006 t

table 1 3 the next section provides data on state estate tax revenue as reported by the us census bureau the contribution of the estate tax to states finances likely influenced the decoupling decision the more reliant states are less likely to repeal the tax for more information on the federal estate tax and the credit equivalent see crs report rl30600 estate and gift taxes economic issues by

most states and the district of columbia picked up the federal credit for state estate taxes as described above others collected an independent inheritance or succession tax and in most cases imposed an additional estate tax to absorb any remaining federal credit the following explanation of the florida estate tax which was an exclusively pick up state before egtrra appeared on the florida department of taxation official website in 20064 floridas estate tax system is commonly referred to as pick up tax florida picks up all or portion of the credit for state death taxes allowed by the federal government under this system florida estate tax is not due unless an estate is required to file federal estate tax return in states with estate tax laws similar to floridas the state estate tax was repealed when the federal credit was repealed in 2005 in contrast the states that impose an independent estate tax will lose only the portion of their estate tax th at relies on the existence of the federal credit for example pennsylvania maintains an inheritance tax which is applied with graduated rates and depends on the relationship of the heir to the decedent lower rates for closer relatives not the federal estate tax pennsylvania describes the inheritance tax on its official website 5 the inheritance tax is imposed on the valu of the decedents estate transferred to beneficiaries by will or intestacy certain inter vivos transfers are also subject to inheritance tax fractional portion of property held by the decedent and one or more other persons jointly with the right of survivorship is taxable in the decedents estate specified deductions may be taken in determining taxable estate value inheritance tax is calculated at percentage of the value of the assets transferred which is determined by the relationship of the heir to the decedent and th decedents date of death when the estate tax is repealed taxpayers in the states like pennsylvania with standalone estate taxes would lose the federal credit along with the federal liability however the state inheritance tax would still generate state tax revenue because of this political pressure to repeal state inheritance taxes upon repeal of the federal estate tax might be greatest in states with an independent inheritance tax like pennsylvanias states with laws similar to pennsylvanias and 3 joel michael
