titutional might depend upon whether court viewed it as contentbased restriction on speech or as analogous to the zoning of adult theaters or even as mere disclosure requirement that did not raise significant first amendment issue if court viewed it as contentbased restriction on speech then it would be constitutional only if th court found that it served compelling governmental interest by the

could disallow name for only few reasons such as that it is confusingly similar to an existing name or is contrary to generally accepted legal norms relating to morality and public order that are recognized under interna tional principles of law6 it remains to be seen whether under this plan icaan would approve an application to use xxx domain before the plan takes effect icaan must approve final version of it this is expected to occur in early 20097 some opponents of pornography support the proposal for voluntar xxx domain and some oppose it likewise some in the pornography business support the proposal and some oppose it both the abovementioned articles comment on the support and opposition to the proposal the proposal has had its share of critics some of them claim that xxx domain would provide legitimacy to the pornography industry supporters claim that xxx domain would make it easier for people to filter out content they do not want the family research council warns that it the proposal will simply breed more smut but senator joe lieberman supports virtual redlight district because he says it would make the job of filtering out porn easier meanwhile some

107th congress which was introduced by senator landrieu both bills direct the secretary of commerce acting through the national telecommunications and information administration to establish the new domain the rest of this report will consider the constitutionality of mandatory xxx domain without focusing on these bills or any other particular proposal it does not matter for constitutional purposes specifically how the bill would define the material that it would require to be in the xxx domain we w ill assume merely that such material would include sexually explicit material that is protected by the first amendment and all sexually explicit material is generally protected by the first amendment unless it constitutes obscenity or child pornography that is produced with an actual minor10 contentbased discrimination to require that websites with sexually explicit material be under separate domain name would be to treat such material differently from other speech and therefore could be viewed as discriminating against speech on the basis of its content the supreme court has said that it is rare that regulation restricting speec h because of its content will ever be permissible11 as general rule the suprem court will uphold contentbased speech regulation only if it satisfies strict scrutiny which means only if it is necessary to promote compelling interest and is the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest12 by contrast if regulation of speech is justified without reference to the content of the sp eech then the supreme court considers it contentneutral and will uphold it if it is designed to serve substantial governmental interest and allows for reasonable alternative avenues of communication13 in other words if regulation of speech has purpose other than to protect people from harm that the speech itself might cause then it stands better chance of being found constitutional one might argue that although requiring sexually explicit ma terial to be under separate domain name woul d discriminate against speech on the basis of its contenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33224crs4 14 id at 47 emphasis in original 15 id at 48 16 if sexually explicit speech is regulated in manner that affects only minors then it is more likely to be constitutional in ginsberg v new york 390 us 629 634 1968 for example the supreme court upheld state statute that prohibited the sale to minors of what the court called girlie picture magazines when how ever the government has restricted adults access to speech even with the purpose of protecting minors the court has held that the government may not reduce the adult population to only what is fit for children see eg reno v american civil liber ties union 521 us 844 875 1997 in which the court struck down the part of the communica tions decency act of 1996 that prohibited indecent material on the internetthat would not be the purpose of the re quirement and the re quirement could be justified without reference to the content of the speech it would regulate its purpose would arguably be to facilitate parents or librarians use of filters when children access the internet it would accomplish this by dividing websites into two categories those with sexually explicit material nd those without it this could be viewed as analogous to requiring adult movie theaters to locate in areas that are zoned for them in city of renton v playtime theaters inc the supreme court upheld such zoning on the theory that it is not aimed at the content of the films shown at adult motion picture theaters but rather at the secondary effects of such theaters on the surrounding community14 the ordinance by its terms is designed to prevent crime protect the citys retail trade maintain property values and generally protect and preserve the quality of the citys neighborhoods commercial districts and the quality of urban life not to suppre ss the expression of unpopular views15 analogously one might argue to restrict sexually explicit material to separate domain name arguably would zone certain websites not because of the content of their speech but to lessen the secondary ffect of minors viewing those websites without parental approval in effect th proposal like zoning ordinance would seek to isolate certain material into pa rticular neighborhoods in cyberspace and assist parents in preventing their ch ildren from visiting those neighborhoods possibly fatal flaw with this analogy however is that in renton the secondary effects that the zoning ordina nce sought to prevent crime lowered property values and deterioration in the quality of urban life were not effects of viewing the regulated speech itself the xxx pr oposal by contrast would apparently attempt to protect minors from the effects of viewing the regulated speech itself and these effects therefore are argu ably not secondary in the sense that the supreme court meant in renton the xxx proposal from this view would impose burden on speech because congress deems it harmful and that is not sufficient basis on which the government may regulate speech in manner that affects adults unless the regulation satisfies strict scrutiny16 in ashcroft v free speech coalition for example the supreme court struck down federal statute that banned virtual child pornography and other child pornography produced without the use of an actual minor despite various harms that the government claimed that viewing such pornography could cause such as whe tting the appetite s of pedophiles

the governments claim that prohibiting indecent material on the internet constitutes sort of cyberzoning aimed at secondary effects and sepa rate opinion by justice oconnor in reno 529 us at 888 zoning law is valid only if adults are still able to obtain the regulated speech 19 compelling commercial speech ie disclosures in commercial advertisements and on product labels is generally constitutional because the supreme court has held that an advertisers rights are reasonably protecte d as long as disclosure requirements are reasonably related to the states interest in preventing deception of consumers the right of commercial speaker not to divulge ac curate information regarding his services is not fundamental right za uderer v office of disciplinary c ounsel 471 us 626 651 652 n14 1985 20 487 us 781 796797 1988 italics in originalencouraging them to engage in illegal conduct17 the supreme court has stated we have made clear that the lesser scrutiny afforded regulations targeting the secondary effects of crime or declining property values s application to content based regulations targeting the primary ffects of protected speech the statute now before us burdens speech because of its content it must receive strict scrutiny18 thus court might view the xxx proposal either as contentbased regulation which is constitutional only if it satisfies strict scrutiny by advancing compelling governmental interest by the least restrictive means or as content neutral regulation which is constitutional if it advances substantial governmental interest and allows for r easonable alternative avenues of communication we will apply these two tests to th xxx pr oposal in the sections below titled strict scrutiny and contentneutral scrutiny first however we will explain why the xxx pr oposal would even raise free sp eech issue in light of the fact that it would not censor speech compelled speech the xxx proposal could be viewed as in effect compelling speech on the part of websites with sexually explicit ma terial it would compel them to identify themselves th rough use of sepa rate domain name as containing such material in general it is as unconstitutional for the government to compel speech as it is for it to censor speech except in the commercial context19 in riley v national federation of the blind of north carolina inc north carolina statute required professional fundraisers for charities to disclose to potential donors the gross percentage of revenues retained in prior charitable solicitations the supreme court held this unconstitutional writing there is certainly some difference between compelled speech and compelled silence but in the context of prot ected speech the difference is without constitutional significance for the first amendment

319 us 624 1943 25 418 us 241 1974 in meese v keene however the court upheld co mpelled disclosure in noncommercial context21 this case involved provision of the foreign agents registration act of 1938 which requires that when an agent of foreign principal seeks to disseminate foreign political propaganda he must label such material with certain information including his identity the principals identity and the fact that he has registered with the department of justice the material need not state that it is political propaganda but one agent objected to the statutes designating material by that term which he cons idered pejorative the agent wished to exhibit without the required labels three canadian films on nuclear war and acid rain that the justice department had determined were political propaganda in meese v keene the supreme court upheld the statutes use of the term essentially because it considered the term not necessarily pejorative on the subject of compelled disclosu re the court wrote congress did not prohibit edit or re strain the distribution of advocacy materials to the contrary congress simply required the disseminators of such material to make additional disclo sures that would better enable the public to evaluate the import of the propaganda22 one might infer from this that comp elled disclosure in noncommercial context gives rise to serious first am endment issue and nothing in the courts opinion would seem to refute this inferen ce thus it seems impossible to reconcile this opinion with the courts holding year later in riley which did not mention meese v keene that in noncommercial cont ext there is difference of constitutional significance between comp elled speech and compelled silence in meese v keene furthermore the court did not mention earlier cases in which it had struck down laws compelling speech in noncommercial context for example in wooley v maynard the court struck down new hampshire statute requiring motorists to leave visible on their license plates the motto live free or die23 in west virginia state board of education v barnette the court held that state may not require children to pledge allegiance to the united states24 and in miami herald publishing co v tornillo the court struck down florida statute that required newspapers to grant political candidates equal space to reply to the newspapers criticism and attacks on their record25 in any event if one view s the xxx proposal as discriminating on the basis of content then one could cite most of the compelled speech cases for the proposition that the xxx proposal would be unconstitutional unless it can pass strict scrutiny but one could cite meese v keene adapting the above quotation from it to argue that the xxx proposal would be constitutional b ecause it would not prohibit edithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33224crs7 26 sable supra note 12 27 see the constitution of the united states of america analysis and interpretation 2004 at

contrary congress would simply require the disseminators of such material to make additional disclosures that would better enable the public to evaluate the content of the website strict scrutiny if the xxx proposal were viewed as contentbased and not as constitutional simply by virtue of its similarity to the statute upheld in meese v keene then as noted it would be subject to strict scrutiny which means that it would be constitutional only if it is necessary to promote compelling interest and is the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest26 though the supreme court may be beco ming less absolute in viewing the protection of all minors re gardless of age from all sexual material to be compelling interest27 it has never struck down on the ground that it did not further compelling governmental interest st atute aimed at denying minors access to sexual material rather the court tends to assume the existence of compelling governmental interest in denying minor s access to pornography and move on to the least restrictive means part of the strict scrutiny test upholding or striking down the statute on that issue in striking down the part of the communications decency act of 1996 that banned from the internet ll indecent material that was accessible to minors the court wrote in order to deny minors access to potentially harmful speech the cda effectively suppresses large amount of speech that adults have constitutional right to receive and to address to one another that burden on adult speech is unacceptable if less restrictive alternativ would be at least as effective in achieving the legitimate purpose that the statute was enacted to serve28 the xxx proposal would not suppress sp eech but would only compel it to be under separate domain name but are there less restrictive means by which to accomplish the xxx pr oposals goal we will consider two alternative means one alternative might be to make use of the separate dom ain name voluntary the question with respect to this altern ative would be whether there would be an incentive for sexually explicit websites to use separate domain name voluntarily an incentive sufficient to induce enough of them to use separate domain name so as to make the proposal as effective as it would be if it compelled them to use separate domain name an incentive arguab ly is that just as the proposal would make it easier to block websites that us separate domain na it might make it easier to locate websites that use separate domain name in addition one might argue statute c ould effectively make use of separate domain name mandatory only for websites based in the united states as the ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33224crs8 29 this was one of the reasons that the s upreme court upheld preliminary injunction against enforcement of the child online protection act see ashcroft v american civil liberties union 542 us 656 667 2004 the district court not ed in its factfindings that one witness estimated that 40 of harmfu ltominors content comes from overseas 30 reno supra note 16 521 us at 867government does not generally have authority over foreign websites therefore statute that mandated use of separate domain name w ould not cover all websites with sexually explicit material and this would appear to strengthen the case that voluntary use of separate domain name would be as ffective as mandatory use29 second alternative to the proposal might be one that already exists the dot kids implementation and efficiency act of 2002 mentioned at the beginning of this report this statute may enable parents w ho wish to do so to block out all websites not under the dot kids domain name if parents used filter to prevent their children from gaining access to any website that does not use the dot kids domain then they would be denying their children access to much material on the internet that is not sexually explicit if one deems purpose of both the d ot kids statute and the xxx pr oposal to be not only to deny children access to sexually explicit material but not to deny them access to nonsexually explicit material then the dot kids act might be viewed as less effec tive than the xxx pr oposal and therefore as not an adequate alternative to the latter but in another respect the dot kids statute could be more effective because it could enable parents to block foreign as well as domestic websites in that respect it might be viewed as an adequate alternative to th xxx proposal contentneutral scrutiny if court were to fi nd the xxx pr oposal to be analogous to the zoning of adult theat ers that the supreme court has upheld then it would ask whether the proposal is design ed to serve substantial governmental interest and allows for r easonable alternative avenue s of communication because it appears that court would likely find the proposal to serve compelling interest court would ipso facto likely find the pr oposal to meet the less rigorous test of serving substantial inte rest and because the proposal would not prevent anyone from posting protected speech but would merely require them to post some speech under separate domain name it apparently could not even be said to reduce their avenues of communication except insofar as internet users chose to block websites that used the separate domain name though the proposal would presumably facilitate such blocking it would not require it and therefore would seem likely to be found constitutional if th is lessthanstrictscru tiny test were applied criminal penalties factor that might make difference to the xxx proposals constitutionality is whether it im posed criminal penalties if it did that might tip the balance toward making it unconstitutional in reno v american civil liberties union the supreme court in striking down the communications decency act of 1996 was apparently influenced by the fact that th statute would have imposed criminal penalties including imprisonment30 it distinguished federal communications commission v pacifica foundation in which it had upheld the ban on indecent material on broadcast media in part on the ground that the radio station that had

489 497499 1982penalized with only federal communi cations commission declaratory order31 the commissions declaratory order the court in reno wrote was not punitive we expressly refused to decide whether the indecent broadcast would justify criminal prosecution32 breadth of the requirement another factor that might make difference to the xxx proposals constitutionality is whether it applied only to websites that contained predominantly nographic material or it applied to any posting of material that might be deemed pornographi c even on websites that did not contain predominantly pornographic material the latter approach would seem more problematic from constituti onal standpoint because it w ould deter any website not under the xxx domai n name from posting material that might be deemed pornographic even if the website posted it for other than pornographic purposes and even if the website contained material that was predominantly for example of literary artistic or medical nature that would not attract children but even proposal that applied only to websites that contained predominately pornographic material might be unconstitutional if it defined too vaguely the websites that it would require to us the xxx domain the c onstitutional problem with an overly vague definition is that it might deter website that did not use the xxx domain from posting sexually explicit material for its literary artistic or medical content it might be deterred for fear that the material could be construed as pornographic and the website sanctioned vague law violates due process because it fails to give the person of ordinary intelligence reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited so that he may act accordingly perhaps the most important factor affecting the clarity that the constitution demands of law is whether it threatens to inhibit the exercise of constitutionally protected rights if for example the law interferes with the right of free sp eech or of association more stringent vagueness test should apply33 conclusion if court were to apply str ict scrutiny to the xxx proposal then it appears difficult to predict whethe r it would be constitutional although it seems likely that the supreme court would find that it serves compelling governmental interest it is not certain whet her it would find that it would be the least restrictive means to serve that interest if court were to apply contentneutral scrutiny or if the court were to follow its reasoning in meese v keene then it seems likely that it would find the xxx pr oposal to be constitutional
