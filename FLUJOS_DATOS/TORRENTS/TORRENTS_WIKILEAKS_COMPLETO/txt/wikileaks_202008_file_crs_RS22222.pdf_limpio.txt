of crs report rl33035 material support of terrorists and foreign terrorist organizations sunset amendments without the footnotes appendix and some of the citations to authority found in the longer parent report material support definitions sections 2339a and 2339b are proximity crimes they proscribe certain conduct because of its proximity to other crimes in this case terrorist offenses section 2339a outlaws providing material support or resources for the commission of any of several designated federal crimes that terrorist might commit or attempting or conspiring to such support or assistance section 2339b outlaws providinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22222crs2 material support or resources to designated foreign terrorist orga nization or attempting or conspiring to do so section 6603 of the intelligence reform and prevention of terrorism act made several amendments to sec tion 2339a nd 2339b in response to judicial decisions that either found them unc onstitutionally vague or suggested demanding mens rea knowledge requirement s ection 2339a contains defini tion of material support or resources that applies to both sections 18 usc 2339ab some courts had been particularly troubled by the uncertain sweep of the terms training personnel and expert advice or assistance used in the definition the ninth circuit for instance had found the terms unconstitutionally vague humanitarian law project v reno 205 f3d 1130 1137138 9th cir 2000 personnel because the term might be thought to envelope the efforts of simple advocate training because the term might be thought to sweep in benign academic instruction and expert advice or assistance because like personnel and training might be read to include first amendment protected pure speech and advocacy section 6603 supplied new definition for training the term training means instruction or teaching designed to impar t specific skill as opposed to general knowledge 18 usc 2339ab2 as explai ned by justice depa rtment witnesses the amendment would also add specific definition of t raining in response to the ninth circuits decision that this term too was unconstitutionally vague as an example the court opined that the term conceivably could include teaching members of foreign terrorist organizations to use international human rights laws to resolve conflicts in peaceful manner the amendment w ould alleviate such concerns by limiting the term training to instruction or teaching designed to impart specific skill as opposed to general knowledge cr itics might argue that the attemp ted fix appears to turn on the dubious premise that effective advocacy g peaceful conflict resolution through the use of human rights laws is not skill the same might be said of section 6603s new definition of expert advice or assistance plucked from the federal rules of evidence the term expert advice or assistance means advice or assistance derived from scientific technical or other specialized knowledge 18 usc 2339ab3 section 6603 may rely on its first amendmen t disclaimer to answer the objection that the uncertainty of the two terms could chill or lead to prosecution of mere advocacy or other first amendment protected activities at least with regard to prosecutions under 2339b nothing in this section shall be cons trued or applied so as to abridge the exercise of rights guaranteed unde r the first amendment to the constitution of the united states 18 usc 2339bi in any event section 6603s new explanati on of the scope of the prohibition against providing personnel in section 2339b seem s far more specific and to correspond more closely the courts concerns person may be prosecuted under this section in connection with the term personnel unless that person has knowi ngly provided attempted to provide or conspired to provide foreign terrorist organization with 1 or more individuals who may be or include himself to work unde r that terrorist organizations direction orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22222crs3 control or to organize manage supervise or otherwise direct the operation of that organization individual s who act entirely independently of the foreign terrorist organization to advance its goals or objectives shall not be considered to be working under the foreign terrorist organi zations direction and control 18 usc 2339bh finally section 6603 addressed an ambiguity inherent in the earlier definition in its earlier form the definition of material support or resources in subsection 2339a included mixture of tangible things and other things that might more properly be considered benefits or servi ces eg currency and training yet this defining mixture ended with the catchall phrase and other physical assets 18 usc 2339ab2000 ed section 6603 responded with an amendment to section 2339a stating that material support or resources covers serv ices and other intangible pr operty and that the specific types of property and services mentioned are simply examples critics might contend that by eliminating the ambiguity in favor of the more sweeping construction property tangible or intangible or services including versus property or other physical assets th amendment is more likely to create than dissipate vagueness the first court to pass upon the constitu tionality of section 6603s clarifying amendments gave them mixed grade s ection 6603 did cure the vagueness problems associated with use of the term personnel but the terms training and expert advice or assistance remain unconstitutionally vague notwithstanding the amendments in section 6603 the term service which section 6603 added to the definition of prohibited support or resources is itself unconstitutiona lly vague and the boilerplate first amendment clause does nothing to supply greater clarity humanitarian law project v gonzales __ fsupp2d __ __ cd cal july 25 2005 the first amendment clause in the court s view is inadequate to cure potential vagueness issues because it does not clar ify the prohibited conduct with sufficient definiteness for ordinary people id at __ n20 by the same token the court felt that for the average person with background in law use of definition from the federal rules of evidence would do little to clarify th mysteries of the term expert advice or assistance id at __ and even as amended by s ection 6603 the term training is not sufficiently clear so that persons of ordinary intelligence can reasonably understand what conduct the statute prohibits partic ularly when the term easily encompasses protected speech and advocacy id at __ since the term service is defined to include training and expert advice or assistance they pull the term down with them id at __ material support knowledge section 2339b outlaws knowin g violations narrowly construed this might serve as counter bala nce for the suspect r each of the material support element the tem porary amendment however added the caveat that to violate this paragraph person must have know ledge that the organization is designated terrorist organization as defi ned in subsection g6 that the organization has engaged or engages in terrorist activity as defined in section 212a3b of the immigration and nationality act or that the organization has engaged or engages in terrorism as defined in section 140d2 of the foreign relations authorization act fiscal years 1988 and 1989 18 usc 2339ba1 18 usc 2339ba1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22222crs4 justice department officials urged the adop tion of the addition in order to avoid case law indicating that conviction would require either proof of knowledge of the specific facts that led to particular entity being signated terrorist organization or proof of knowledge that the assistance provided would be used for terrorist purposes the change seems to foreclose those problems but it does little for any vagueness problems material support overseas application as result of modifications by section 6603 section 2339b now describes its overseas application more explicitly and more expansively than was once the case it permits federal prosecution of an act proscribed in section 2339b and committed entirely abroad by foreign national with greater connection to the united states required than th at we have been able to bring the offender to this country for trial 18 usc 2339bd 1dthere is jurisdiction over an offense under subsection if d after the conduct required for the offense occurs an offender is brought into or found in the untie d states even if the conduct required for the offense occurs outside the united states in its other modifications to jurisdic tion section 6603 arguably does more than articulate more specifically the preexistin g reach of section 2339b prior to the enactment of section 6603 sec tion 2339b applied to anyone who acted within the united states or subject to the jurisdiction of th united states when they provided material support to foreign terrorist organizati on 18 usc 2339ba12000 ed person subject to the jurisdiction of the united states arguably referred to american citizens residents of this country and entities organized under our laws moreover if extraterritorial jurisdiction existed over the underlying offense it was said to exist over aiding and abetting the commission of the underlying offense or over conspiracy to commit it section 6603 removed the phrase within th united states or subject to the jurisdiction of the united states from s ection 2339ba1 and provided more explicit list of jurisdictional circumstances in sec tion 2339bd1 ie the offense is committed in whole or in part within the united states the offender is us citizen permanent resident alien or habitu us resident the offense occurs in or affects us interstate or foreign commerce the offender is later found or brought to th us or the offender is an accomplice or aider or abetter or conspirator with respect to violation of the section by another over whom the us has subject matter jurisdiction federal crimes of terrorism section 2339a outlaws provi ding material support or resources with the intent that they be used for the commission of certain designated violent crimes predicate offens section 6603 enlarged th list of predicate offenses to include any federal crime of terrorism cited in 18 usc 2332bg5b section 2339a already covered assistance rendere d for the commission of the following 18 usc 32 destruction of aircraft 18 usc 37 violence at international airports 18 usc 81 arson within federal enclave 18 usc 175 biological

piracy 49 usc 60123b destruction of gas pipeline facilities with the addition of the federal crimes of terrorism not already among the enumerated section 2339a now also conde mns assistance relating to 18 usc 175b unlawful posse ssion biological materials 18 usc 175c smallpox virus offenses 18 usc 1030a1 5aicertain computer fraud and abuse offenses 18 usc 2332g antiaircraft offenses 18 usc 2332h radiological di spersal device offenses 18 usc 2339 harboring terrorists 18 usc 2339c financing of terrorism 42 usc 2122 atomic weapons offenses 49 usc 46504 2d sentence assault on flight crew with dangerous weapon 49 usc 46505b3 or c explosive or incendiary devices or endangerment of human life by means of weapons on an aircraft within us jurisdiction 49 usc 46506 homicide or attempted homicide aboard an aircraft within us jurisdiction in certain of the earlier versions of the intelligence reform legi slation and in various free standing bills devoted to similar pur pose proponents would have brought any crime of international or domestic terrorism 18 usc 2331 ra ther than any federal crime of terrorism 18 usc 2332bg5b within th circle of predi cate offenses use of the phrase international or dom estic terrorism has generated considerable debate in the context of the usa patriot act and it may be for this reason that the more narrowly and precisely defined federal crime of terrorism cross reference was ultimately selectedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22222crs6 section 6603 also introduced two crimes 18 usc 1361 destruction of federal property and 18 usc 2156 production of fective national defe nse material into the family of federal crimes of terrorism both crimes were already predicate offenses in section 2339a so it was unnecessary to introduce them into section 2332bg5b in order to bring them within section 2339a of course there are other consequences that flow from including sections 1361 and 2156 within the definition of federal crime s of terrorism under section 2332bg5b prior to designation as federa l crimes of terrorism violati ons of section 2156 were subject to the general five year statute of limitations 18 usc 3282 now they are subject to an eight year statute of limitations unless they involve the risk of death or serious bodily injury in which case they may be prosecute d at any time 18 usc 3286 violations of section 1361 which were already subject to an eight year statute of limitations 18 usc 3286 may now be prosecuted at any time if they involve the risk of death or serious injury id prior to designation as federal crime of terro rism conviction and imprisonment for violation of either sect ion carried maximum term of supervised release of not more than three years the maximum term is now supervision for life or any term of years following conviction for viola tion of either section that involves the risk of death or serious injury 18 usc 3583 prior to designation as federal crime of terrorism suspects charged with violation of either section were entitled to normal bail procedures now they face the rebuttable pr esumption of pretrial detention 18 usc 3142 prior to designation as federal crime of terrorism ne ither section appeared as racketeering rico predicat offense 18 usc 1961 fe deral racketeering statutes outlaw the patterned commission of predicate offense or offenses to acquire or operate an enterprise in or affec ting interstate commerce 18 u sc 19611962 by designation as rico predicate they also become money laundering predicate offenses under sections 18 usc 1956 1957 18 usc 1956c7a 1957f3 status which section 1361 but not section 2156 already enjoyed 18 usc 1956c 7d prosecutorial forbearance section 6603 also added an immunity provision under which an individual or entity who provides per sonnel training or expert advice or assistance in violation of section 2339b ma not be prosecuted if the offense was committed with the prior approval of the secretary of state and the attorney general as long as the support cannot be used to carry out the various violent acts of terrorism described in 8 usc 1182a3biii hijack ing sabotage hostage taking assassination and the like 18 usc 2339bj the provision is presumably designed to encourage stings and other undercover investigations it is not clear why it is necessary prosecution of 18 usc 2339b or any other federal crime fo r that matter is possible without the attorney generals approval ordinarily exercise d through the various united states attorneys frcrimp 7cindictments must be signed by the attorney for the government of course the state department is more likely to be involved in activities abroad
