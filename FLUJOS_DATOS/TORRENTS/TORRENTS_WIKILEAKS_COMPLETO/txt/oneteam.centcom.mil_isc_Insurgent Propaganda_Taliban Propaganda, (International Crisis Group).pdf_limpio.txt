asia report n158 24 july 2008 taliban propaganda winn ing the war of words executive summary nd recommendations the taliban has created sophisticated communica tions apparatus that projects an increasingly confident movement using the full range of media it is suc cessfully tapping into strains of afghan nationalism and exploiting policy failures by the kabul government and its international backers the result is weakening public support for nationbuilding even though few actively support the taliban the karzai govern ment and its allies must make greater efforts through word and deed to address sources of alienation exploited in taliban propaga nda particularly by ending arbitrary detentions and curtailing civilian casualties from aerial bombing analysing the talibans public statements has limits since the insurgent group seeks to underscore suc cesses or imagined successes and present itself as having the purest of aims while disguising weaknesses and underplaying its brutality however the method still offers window into what the movement considers effective in terms of recruitment and bol stering its legitimacy amo ng both supporters and po tential sympathisers the movement reveals itself in its communications as the product of the antisoviet jihad and the civil war that followed but not representative of indigenous strands of religious thought or traditional pre conflict power structures largely ethnonationalist phenomenon without popular grassroots appeal beyond its core of support in sections of the pashtun community still reliant on sanctuaries in pakistan even though local support has grown linked with transnational extremist groups for mostly tactical rather than strategic reasons but divided over these links internally seeking to exploit local tribal disputes for recruit ment and mainly appealing to the disgruntled and disenfranchised in specific locations but lacking wider tribal agenda and difficult negotiating partner because it lacks coherent agenda includes allies with divergent agendas and has leadership that refuses to talk before the withdrawal of foreign forces and with out the imposition of sharia islamic law out of power and lacking control over territory the taliban has proved adept at projecting itself as stronger than it is in term s of numbers and resources despite the increasing sophistication of some of its propaganda however it still puts out contradictory messages that indicate internal rifts and the diffuse nature of the insurgency these reveal crossborder leadership and support apparatus striving to present unified front and assert control even as various groups maintain their own communi cations networks main taining relations with tran snational jihadist networks which have more global ag enda is potential prob lem for the taliban which has always been largely nationalistic movement website in the name of the former regime the islamic emirate of afghanistan is used as an international distribution centre for leader ship statements and inflated tales of battlefield exploits while fairly rudimentary this is not small effort updates appear several times day in five languages magazines put out by the movement or its supporters provide further source of information on leadership structures and issues considered to be of importance but for the largely rural and illiterate population great efforts are also put into conveying preaching and battle reports via dvds audio cassettes shabnamah night letters pamphlets or leaflets usually containing threats and traditional nationalist songs and poems the taliban also increasingly uses mobile phones to spread its message the vast majority of the material is in pashtu and shortage of language skills in the international commu nity means much of this either passes unnoticed or is misunderstood englishlangua ge statements are rela tively crude but the taliban is able to put out its story rapidly more effort is devoted to arabic language output aimed at soliciting the support of transnational taliban propaganda winning the war of words crisis group asia report n158 24 july 2008 page ii networks and funders the overriding strategic narra tive is quest for legitimacy and the projection of strength use of tactics such as suicide bombings previously unknown in afghanistan and roadside bombs as well as such audacious actions in 2008 as prison break in kandahar city an attack on military parade attended by preside nt hamid karzai and an assault on fivestar hotel demonstrate that grabbing attention lies at the core of operations within afghanistan the taliban is adept at exploiting local disenfranchisement and disillusionment the kabul administration needs to ensure it is seen as one worth fighting for not least by ending the culture of impunity and demanding accountability of its members the international community must provide the necessary support and pressure for improved performance while also examining its own actions whatever the military benefits of arbitrary detentions they are far outweighed by the alienation they cause the effec tiveness of aerial bombardment even if strictly exercised within the bounds of international law must be considered against the damage to popular support greater efforts are needed in western capitals to ex plain to their own populati ons the necessity of staying for the long haul rather than yielding to the pressure of quick fixes that give only the appearance of action the taliban is not going to be defeated militarily and is impervious to outside criticism rather the legitimacy of its ideas and actions must be challenged more forcefully by the afghan government and citizens its killings of civilians and ta rgeting of community lead ers need to be highlighted including public account ing for actions by the militants through open trials something that has not yet happened strengthening the legitimacy of the afghan government and ensuring that its actions and those of its international backers are similarly bound by the rule of law should be an important complement ultimately winning popular support is not about telling local communities that they are better off today it is about proving it recommendations to the government of afghanistan 1 do not block the flow of information but seek instead to disclose more in an open and timely manner and build morale by responding more quickly on incidents such as civilian casualties and other alleged abuses by the government or its international supporters that are likely to feed into insurgent propaganda b speaking out strongly and consistently about taliban killings and attacks while holding the international community and afghan national security agencies proportionately accountable for their actions c refraining from threatening the media for re porting and ensuring that legal definitions of incitement in the media are appropriate and clear and d holding open trials of captured insurgents and allowing their victims public redress 2 build the morale of the security forces by having senior officials regularly visit afghan army and police units around the country and put human face on the violence by assisting the wounded and bereaved families 3 end the culture of impunity by ensuring the rule of law including by holding government and security officials accountable for crimes and abuses to the governments of countries contributing international troops 4 improve communications with afghans on the direc tions and activities of the international engagement while ensuring an afghan lead in appropriate areas through reaching out to local correspondents for inter national and national media not just foreign reporters b building language skills among foreign staff and properly training sufficient numbers of professional translators c streamlining systems and devolving more re sponsibility to groundba sed personnel so they can respond rapidly to incidents involving in ternational forces and d directing enquiries on incidents that do not in volve foreign troops to the appropriate afghan institution 5 emphasise that the foreign presence is in support of the afghan people and subject to the rule of law by ensuring that international troops are held ac countable in particular by conducting thorough investigations and impr oving data collection and information sharing on incidents of alleged civilian casualties 6 communicate clearly to the afghan public that while the troops will stay as long as necessary there are longerterm strategic objectives such as permanent bases in the country taliban propaganda winning the war of words crisis group asia report n158 24 july 2008 page iii 7 ensure when using aerial force not only that an operation is strictly within the parameters of international law but also that its potential immediate military gain has been weighed against longer term community perceptions 8 press the pakistan military to end its appeasement of protaliban militants and afghan insurgents operating from pakistani territory and encourage dialogue between kabul and the democratically elected government in islamabad to donors 9 emphasise the building and reform of judicial and detention systems in which detainees can be han dled safely and legitimately and held to account within ruleoflaw system kabulbrussels 24 july 2008 asia report n158 24 july 2008 taliban propaganda winn ing the war of words i introduction the taliban has proved remarkably successful in pro jecting itself as much stronger than it is in terms of numbers and resources on battlefield where inde pendent verification is nearly impossible1 increas ingly the afghan population in conflicthit areas is sitting on the fence or weighing options amid sense of insurgent momentum the talibans growing fidence and worsening violence have created sense in many capitals of an intractable conflict 2 communications lie at the core of the insurgents actions they use all available networks political social economic and military to convince the enemys political decisionmakers that their strategic goals are either unachievable or too costly for the per ceived benefit 3 this can be seen in the increasing use of asymmetric attacks such as suicide and road bombings which have major impact on public opinion while requiring little ma npower or popular support there is also growing use of spectacular events which draw headlines around th world as us mili tary officer put it unfortunately we tend to view in formation operations as supplementing kinetic fighting operations for the taliban however information objectives tend to drive kinetic operations virtually 1 see crisis group asia

taliban has had its successes sometimes contradictory messages signal internal divisions and underscore the diffuse nature of the insurgency as well as increasing alliances with criminals there are number of groups involved in spreading the violence including jalaluddin haqqanis network the remnants of hizbe islami khalis gulbuddin hekmatyars hizbe islami and foreign networks including alqaeda 5

may be coordination with others 6 the report studies public communiqués in an attempt to learn more about the messenger from the message to understand how the taliban seeks to project itself how words measure up against actions the coherence and clarity of stated goals and links to broader net works given the insecure environment it was not possible to access the networks such as local mullahs and

soviets in afghanistan in the 1980s the us and its western allies as well as saudi arabia and other middle eastern states provided military and financial support to seven sunni islamist parties which had pakistans backing and many of which operated out of pakistani safe havens 11 these islamist factions were armed and equipped in deliberate preference to tribal nationalist or royalist parties for multiple reasons pakistani support was based on fears of irredentist claims by pashtun nationalists on its pashtun borderlands saudi arabia was guided by its sunni wahhabisalafi ideological preferences the us saw the islamists as the most desirable ally against the soviets and th sovietbacked kabul com munist regime gulbuddin hekmatyars hizbe islami 12 now taliban ally was th main

khalis was dominated by tribal ulama islamic scholars hizbe islami hekmatyar was the most organised and disciplined of the mujahidin factions demanding loyalty to the party rather than individual

the taliban foot soldiers the talibs students from which the movement took its name were mainly dispossessed ma rginalised pashtun youth many from the pakistani madrasas other recruits to the movement were the products of decades of radi calisation and violence in their homeland having first emerged in 1994 as local reaction to the postsoviet chaos in the southern region of kandahar the movements easy early victories quickly drew the attention of pakistans security services whose previously favoured client hekmatyar had little success in capturing the capital kabul from largely non pashtun mujahidin factions with this powerful institutional sponsorship the taliban rapidly extended its rule in series of dramatic victories taking kabul in 1996 and overrunning the final major city the

core leadership20 the talibans obscurantist brand of deobandi islam product of and reaction to years of war and dislocation and superimposed on pashtunwali was an anom aly to prewar afghan society nonpashtun groups were violently suppressed as the taliban sought to impose its distorted interpre tation of islam and pash tun social codes most vividly seen in attitudes to wards women on others they first targeted bad muslims while western culture came only second they had quite good relations with the united states till the autumn of 1997 and did not bother to expel western ngos later

pictures of afghan casualties and the destruction of property allegedly by foreign forces images from the iraq war also began to appear in 20052006 as the insurgency grew in afghanistan the propaganda projected an increasing air of confidence and assertiveness depicting images of the bodies of international troops and afghan security forces along with their destroyed vehicles and captured supplies as well as taliban weapons caches and operations 54 media environment the taliban is militarily overwhelmed by interna tional air power and it lacks control over territory or state institutions as

approach the most prominent afghan specialists admit in their interviews that the taliban media activities are very quick and reactive when journalists ask us for information the karzai media are much weaker and cannot compete with us journalists confirm that when they ask the ministry of defence to give information about particular event it takes 24 hours to get the answer while we can give the information through satellite phones in record time 62 such speed is of course much easier when spokes men do not need to establish facts still in its infancy the local media too often accepts taliban statements at face value partly doubt because of the diffi culty of verification as well as the governments and the international militarys failure to provide timely reactions instead of more

for only few hours at time 113 audio cassettes114 and for city dwellers with com puters mp3s are one of the most effective means of communication containing songs and poetry in par ticular religious chants and taranas emotional martial nationalistic songs without musical accompaniment these are tied closely to afghan imagery and history not necessarily produced by the taliban but aimed at building wider sympathy for the insurgency within the population while some songs refer directly to taliban activities they mainly simply aim to heighten resistance to foreigners and appeal to nationalism they feed into long cultural tradition of travelling minstrels carrying news and opinions indeed there are examples today of such songs being memorised and passed along one cassette the convoy of martyrs volume 1 contains songs such as let go to jihad my mother i am going with your permission and convoys going to jihad i am joining the martyrs 115 many people told crisis group that they enjoyed such music even if they did not support the taliban others reported carrying the cassettes in their vehicles as protection if they were stopped at taliban checkpost popular tunes are

group that will determine if its ideas turn into actions the taliban seeks to exploit popular sentiment drawing on local narratives understanding that those ideas or grievances which already have some currency resonate the most although manipulated and exaggerated often massively taliban propaganda usually has at its core real incidents or deeply felt issues the treatment of taliban prisoners or minority pashtun communities in the north for example created an early well of resentment that the taliban could tap after the talibans ouster the karzai administration and its international backers believed peace would have to come before justice 117 as result there was little community reconciliation to heal rifts created and exacerbated by years of conflict and human rights abuses alienation was further fuelled by the often highhanded tactics of the usled coalition forces focused on eliminating taliban and alqaeda remnants and conducting operations mainly in the pashtunmajority south and eastern provinces such was the starting point from which the taliban began its outreach feeding on local grievances but increasingly showing confidence and sense of momentum taliban statements and arguments may often appear contradictory and counterintuitive for instance highlighting the insecurity it does much to create the language the taliban uses is also important it continues to lay claim to being the islamic emirate of afghanistan while it has sought to distinguish itself from previous mujahidin factions many of which are seen as brutal and selfserving it also uses the term mujahidin for its fighters aiming to tie itself with past conflicts that resound within afghani 117 president karzai told the bbc we must first have peace stabilise peace make it certain make it stand on its

alleged abuses or overreaction by international forces are regularly found in taliban magazines and online publications these are usually exaggerated but incidents such as the april 2007 deaths when marines shot civilians in nangarhar following suicide attack on their unit are repeatedly cited and the lack of pub lic accountability is subject of local outrage 132 noting the media interest in civilian casualties the taliban has aggressively pushed the issue attempting to depict an indiscriminate occupation force our oppressed nation is still under the brutal occupation of aggressors and their homes and har vest come under the crusader armys bombardment everyday and every minute they kill children old people and women and violate islamic sanctities and national customs 133 independent verification is often all but impossible since most conflictrelated deaths take place in remote areas made too dangerous by militants to check numbers and civiliancombatant status however in july 2008

with making sure they attack the right targets avoiding killing civilians it takes time to train them properly 144 karzai has repeatedly and publicly called upon the international forces to exercise more care145 those foreign forces indeed must appreciate that it is not just the military requirement or legal justification that has to be considered for each bomb but also the potentially wider psychological and strategic impact at the same time to ensure true picture of what is happening on the ground much greater attention needs to be given to the insurgents deliberate conduct of opera

again has returned back to the colonisation of those occupying forces as result of which our houses are destroyed our children are orphaned our brave and courageous combatants either are martyred very ruthlessly or are sent to jail 148 the overthrow of the brutal soviet occupation with the role of foreign backers expunged is highlighted in magazine article as yet another episode in the mighty

foisted by foreigners on afghans today in particular equating the small gains made by women such as appearing on television with immorality we see today that all medi and propaganda tools in afghanistan including tv radio and newspapers aim at spreading obscenities alcohol and western habits that are contrary to islam the crusaders built several centres with different names in kabul and the provinces capitals to spread such habits we can find today hollywood branch in kabul these centres try to use afghan girls to produce those movies and there are serious efforts to build internet centres and cd shops and bordellos 151 many afghans particularly at local level do not understand the different forces in their country however stories and statements in taliban publications play up the debates in western capitals to highlight perceived lack of resolve and shorttermism and dis suade afghans from throwing in their lot with the karzai government articles emphasise contradictory policies and actions particularly relations with neighbouring pakistan like dizzy patient they do amazing and strange activities sometimes they announce to the whole nation the end of mujahidin resistance sometimes they talk about negotiation and reconciliation sometimes they start mass killing of innocent pris oners sometimes they accuse neighbours of interfering in afghanistans internal affairs and sometimes they hold joint meetings with them 152 apart from exaggerating lifestyle changes in afghani stan and particularly kabul the main theme being perpetuated is that the taliban will outlast the foreign presence and will punish those associated with it or their foreign ways the response this requires from foreign leaders is delicate balance in statements to emphasise to the afghan people that the troops are present to support the karzai government and will stay as long as necessary but not forever but it also demands more than words including redoubled effort to build 150 us

themselves as unflagging and their ultimate victory as inevitable is crucial to securing advantage the taliban seeks to portray itself as steadfast and its violence as legitimate growing popular discontent with the corruption of those in power only helps fuel griev ances even among those for whom the taliban holds natural appeal 1 corrupt government the international communitys decision after the talibans ouster to coopt many unpopular commanders and warlords into the new administration and the failure by karzai and his international backers to stand up to them today has had farreaching implications for the administrations legitimacy and its ability to deliver good governance and services to the population 153 in the 1990s the talibans original appeal was that of purifying force against abusive powerholders who had destroyed much of kabul in their quest for power many of them are back in power today taliban propaganda often focuses on the role of these mujahidin factional leaders in the fratricidal civil war after the soviet withdrawal dvd referring to warlords and commanders now back in power asked who is responsible for this tragedy and diffi culty the ordinary

wretched people who consciously are and were against the past sacred jihad and who try to tarnish the sacred name of jihad in the minds of the public 155 the karzai administration is also derided as puppet of the western powers with much imagery based on the green dollars paid to those who work with the international community this picks up on local anger at the large amounts of money the

displayed before them they read prepared comments slowly having trouble with the words at least two read the same speech 168 unama report noted that in afghanistan this public culture of suicide attackers as martyrs has not developed and while videos of assassinations are commonplace videotaped wills of attackers are very rare because these rituals ceremonies and practices are critical to the founding and mainte nance of culture that venera tes and even sustains suicide attacks and their perpetrators attention and care is needed to retard or preclude the development of such culture in

n158 24 july 2008 page 25 v what they do not say this section briefly outlines issues that have bearing on the present conflict or that some commentators argue do but which do not appear on the talibans public agenda some issues are not highlighted be cause they reflect badly on the movement or risk creating divisions interestingly although the taliban was virulently antishia after taking power statements today particularly from the leadership do not address this and even seek to emphasise communal harmony this may be in deliberate attempt to preclude shia opposition at this stage there is also rarely talk about narcotics an obviously sensitive topic since the haram religiously forbidden trade helps provide financing for the insurgency 170 when challenged on this point the taliban tends to refer to the final year of the regime when production although not trafficking was banned mansoor dadullah argued when we were in power we eliminated the opium problem with one single command since our country was wrested out of our hands the farmers have begun cultivating opium again karzai and 42 coalition countries cannot stop them 171 the taliban understandably strongly denies criminal activities attributed to the movement for instance stories about an alleged 20 million ransom for korean hostages were denounced as devilish propa ganda 172 given the talibans abhorrent record on womens rights and access for women and girls to education and health services during their tenure in power there would seem to be clear case for the karzai govern ment to highlight its improvements in womens 170 see for instance kate clark talibans 100m opium takings bbc news 24 june 2008 171 transcript die weltwoche interview with taliban commander mansoor dadullah 7 june 2007 www

orchestrated against the islamic emirate of afghanistan by the main stream media which is propagating to the world that the islamic emirate of afghanistan was paid 20 million in ran som money by the south korean government to win the freedom of the south koreans which is not true the islamic emirate of afghanistan released the remaining south kore ans as goodwill gesture islamic emirate of afghanistan statement concerning the mainstream media propaganda asserting that ransom money was paid for the south koreans released 31 august 2008 ditions sporadic and regional advances in political participation by women and school attendance by girls have however been offset by failure to insist on accountability for those whose forces committed sexual violence during the years of conflict and continue such abuse today but have been given posi tions of power further women suffer broadly from the recent lack of security corruption rights abuses and civilian casualties finally the administration has failed to publicly articulate vision of womens rights participation and pr otection that is both home grown and consistent with traditional afghan islamic society thus the debate has been ceded to those who erroneously argue that such efforts are an alien concept imposed on afghanistan by foreigners and their afghan puppets tribalism taliban statements do not use tribal vocabulary the taliban is certainly predom inantly pashtun but pash tun tribal and subtribal loyalties and divisions do not shape the movement indeed it emerged during the antisoviet jihad largely as posttribal grouping the years of conflict and displacement breaking down previous ties and hierarchies the ghilzai and the durrani are the two largest and historically antagonistic pash tun tribal confederations the durrani dynasty created the modern state of afghanistan and remained the dominant political actor until the pdpa takeover in 1978 president karzai belongs to the popalzai subtribe of the durranis although mullah omar is ghilzai the taliban movement originally centred on the durrani heartland of kandahar with the southern city becoming its facto capital and remaining of importance to the movement the taliban leadership today is largely ghilzai but also has durrani members it is wrong and even counterproductive to call the insurgency ghilzai uprising designation that appears to be gaining some currency such labels risk becoming self fulfilling and could marginalise and alienate some pashtun groups even more thus undermining national reconciliation local dynamics particularly of district and provincial administrations better explain why certain tribes have joined and others have rejected the taliban recruits are not attracted because of the insurgents overall appeal to certain tribe or group rather the very op posite some have joined because of exclusion of their tribe or community at local level in the current political set up since 2001 for example the zirak wing of the durrani including the barakzai alokozai and the popalzai has dominated local administrations in taliban propaganda winning the war of words crisis group asia report n158 24 july 2008 page 26 the south many of the noorzais of the panjpai wing of the durrani around panjwayi who saw the militia of rival tribes sent into their area as police in mid2006 consider that they are simply fighting back with the only ally available the taliban by definition they become antigovernment 173 in system that is largely based on patronage net works rather than representative and meritocratic institutions the use of force much too often becomes the only recourse available for excluded and marginalised communities and groups tribalism is reaction to the lack of democracy and to system in which the centre provides access to power and resources to favoured few trusted groups while deliberately excluding others b wider world when in power the taliban had little interest in the outside world beyond the quest for legitimacy olivier roy observed the taliban express deep rejection of the western cultural model but strategic opposition to the west 174 this changed somewhat as the leadership grew close to alqaeda and sanc tions were imposed after the regimes refusal to hand over bin laden however even today the taliban focus is firmly internal wh it has ventured into the wider realm of global politics it has usually sought to emphasise respect for other countries sovereignty mullah omar has proclaimed the islamic emirate never interferes in other coun tries domestic affairs nor can it tolerate the inter ference of other countries in our domestic affairs we are making efforts to free our beloved afghanistan with all our strength from the occupation of the invaders and to prepare free and liberated conditions for our people to live in 175 rare statement on international affairs in the name of the taliban political commission asserted the islamic emirate is eager for good relations with all foreign countries and neighbours and wants to live with them in peace in the light of the provi sions of the holy religion of islam similarly the islamic emirate expects that

afghanistan s neighbours and demned security council resolutions on irans shia regime thereby apparently causing quite stir in cyberspace among more global islamists who reject the concept of nation

america we will take revengeamerica has humiliated our country and our people we will never negotiate 178 as yet however there is evidence of talib an operations outside the region and the vast majority of statements are in wardlooking although the taliban does not recognise the validity of the durand line the border between afghanistan and pakistan drawn by the british in colonial india days and an issue that strained relations with islamabad when it ruled in kabul 179 there is little evidence that it is pursuing irreden tist goals however while the taliban is unlikely to directly challenge the pakistani military and so put at risk its vital crossborder sanctuaries the talibans ideological and ethnic ties with pakistan tribal militants who have pledged allegiance to mullah omar

assistance the iranian road mines which are found in afghani stan come from the puppet police and northern alliance hazara shia kafirs 182 who have very close relationship with iran iran is and has always been number one enemy of the taliban so it is absurd to claim that iran is supporting the taliban 183 far more obvious and vital are the enduring ties within the pakistani security organs and the flourish ing extremist environment in that country but this continues to be denied the reports in mayjune 2008 of sharp increase in crossborder activity from pakistan after the military there resumed negotiations on peace deals with protaliban pashtun militants were summarily rejected peace in any part of the world is in the interest of humans and the deal in pakistan has in way any effect on the jihad in afghanistan afghanistan is sovereign country which is currently being occupied by invaders america and its puppets linking the increase in mujahidin operations in afghanistan to the peace deal in pakistan is once again diverting the attention of afghans and the rest of the world from their humiliating defeat 184 the taliban similarly angrily rejected accusations by the afghan government of pakistani intelligence involvement in the crisis in pakistan the afghan taliban have concentrated on afghanistan they do not interfere in pakistan and nor do they need to we have our

statement on the website announced mullah mansoor dadullah is not obedient to the islamic emirate of afghanistan in his actions and has carried out activities which were against the rules of the

voices the insurgency is not driven by strong coherent organisational structure on the contrary it is loose alliance of groups fighting alongside variety of fellow travellers at the heart of it is the taliban but even during its previous regime several of the groups coopted into its movement maintained distinct net works particularly post2001 broader coalitions are often tactical alliances of convenience amid these fluid relationships the taliban has tried to project itself as the rightful rulers while other smaller groups have sought shelter under th taliban umbrella to legitimate their own actions the taliban attempts to project more cohesive structure and coordinated strategy than the reality in which it has struggled to exert authority over its field commanders as recog nised by spokesman qari yousuf on fundamental issues all orders and decrees are coming from the centre all mujahidin are bound by the stance of the leadership although in some daily simple affairs and issues the commander of each area can himself make decisionsbecause the resistance is step by step being strengthened and as our areas of control expand the leaderships watch improves and stances become

wazir akbar khan district in november 2007 the taliban claimed it had organ ised this as did hizbe islami hekmatyar 196 asked whether the taliban and hizb islami had cooperated in the attack on the kabuls serena hotel in january 2008 taliban spokesman zabi hullah mujahid replied contact among the mujahidin does exist as far as coordination in operations is concerned that is dif ferent the mujahidin of the islamic emirate have their own strategy and tactics there is such coordination among them on operations however their aim too is to fight the crusaders197 the following antigovernment

mullah mohammad omar akhund yet i respect him and all those fighting against the invaders even if they had enmity with us in the past 212 he added we do not have any relationship with alqaeda213 an analyst has suggested that given the previously adversarial relationship the talibans agreement with hizbe islami in 2002 appears to have been more of matter of gulbuddin hekmatyars willingness to emerge from obscurity than the result of genuine interest on the part of the taliban leadership 214 its communication apparatus is certainly separate from that of the taliban while hekmatyars spokesperson haroun zarghoon arrived relatively late on the scene in 2006 the factions longrunning newspaper shahadat martyrdom still appears in pakistan its well presented webvers ion shahadatnewscom is updated regularly and operates apparently uninterrupted evidently created and designed in pakistan it posts pakistani telephone contact its coverage focuses on exaggerated versions of hizbe islami

egyptian and original alqaeda member mustafa abu alyazid as the head of the organisation in afghanistan in an official video recording which appeared on jazeera 218 in several audio and video appearances since then he has made special appeals for funding and trained personnel for afghanistan libyan abu yahya allibi has also been prolific speaker on sahab and other alqaeda outlets since his escape from bagram prison in july 2005 including ab out afghanistan unsurpris ingly alqaeda material is far more professional than local afghan productions although the latter appear to be learning

mujahidin in afghanistan its existence highlights the importance of the area to the organisation the relationship between the taliban and alqaeda works both ways the taliban or individual members of the movement seeks resources support and volun teers from alqaeda the stateless transnational movement in turn seeks to tie afghanistan into its wider narrative of war between the west and islam b

2007 version of sharia the taliban is also adamant that foreign troops must leave an essential precondition if it is to win power while it does not directly threaten the outside world the taliban certainly poses threat by its willingness as in the past to enter into alli ances of convenience with radical islamist forces afghan regional and transnational the taliban appears to have strategy beyond the use of violence to achieve the dual goals of state capture and imposition of its version of an islamic order given the autonomy that taliban commanders and allied networks enjoy the leadership might exercise little control over everyday military operations but there are some broad trends that include hindering government outreach and as result undermining kabuls legitimacy by preventing through violence and intimidation the population and in particular women from utilising the few services that exist such as schools and health clin ics 219 eroding public support in we stern capitals through attacks on foreign forces and constant drumbeat of aggressive rhetoric that emphasises the tali bans staying power undermining the morale of afghan security forces through attacks on them as well as threats which further erode public confidence in the ability of kabul to provide security demonstrating their reach with complex attacks on highprofile targets which seize headlines even in areas where they do not have much popular support and targeting progovernment local community leaders who speak against the movement and closely monitoring and responding to the media to try and shape coverage 219 according to spokesman of the public health ministry 40 health workers were killed or kidnapped while delivering services in the past two years and at least 36 health facilities were shut down in the east and south due to the insecurity over 360000 affected by reduced health service irin 14 may 2008 while afghanistan still has one of the worlds highest

fatimi june 2007 international development asso ciation world bank taliban propaganda winning the war of words crisis group asia report n158 24 july 2008 page 33 the movement uses communications as force mul tiplier and is quick to claim actions even when the facts are not established in bid to appear allpowerful and set the agenda it further understands that even implied threats and grandiose rhetoric can impact on the populations perceptions and calcula tions the increasing use of very public attacks has had striking effect on morale far beyond the immediate victims images for instance of unarmed soldiers fleeing the parade ground in kabul in the face of gunfire had profound influence on the population such strategies do not require huge resources in terms of manpower or military hardware while there is more and more talk within kabul and among some western capital of dialogue and negotiations with the taliban there is little softening in the rhetoric of the movements leadership which still insists that the withdrawal of foreign troops is an essen tial precondition for any negotiations according to mullah dadullah our terms for ending the war are that america withdraws from iraq and afghanistan and that it unconditionally stops harming the muslims then we will consider negotiating with them 220 karzais dismissal has appear ed as another precondition if karzai has the power to fulfil the first condition of the islamic emirate then the islamic emirate is ready to negotiate on other issues but karzai is never in position to fulfil the first condition of the islamic emirate because he was installed after foreign forces came to afghanistan he must leave before the foreign forces leave 221 indeed given the insurgencys current momentum the taliban leadership would appear to have little incentive to negotiate this does not however necessarily preclude talks with midlevel commanders who have not joined the taliban for ideological reasons moreover many foot soldiers just want fairer deal under any government at the same time kabul and the international community must also realise that unilateral concessions to those pashtun commanders who have benefited by the rule of the gun could fuel another round of conflict should their equally wellarmed eth nic adversaries see their interests threatened or the perception be created that violence brings rewards 220 mullah dadullahs interview 2006 op cit 221 mullah brader gives decisive declarations on jihadi velopments in afghanistan op cit p 18 vii conclusion the taliban seeks to create the illusion of inevitability and invincibility while trying to defend the legitimacy of its actions it has succeeded in conveying an impres sion of coherence and momentum far greater than reality both within afghanistan among population that is weary of war and outside with those in western capitals also weary of commitments to fardistant conflict the insurgents cannot win on the battlefield but they do not have to all they need to do is wear out their opponents and influencing percep tions at home and abroad are vital component of this strategy the afghan and other governments engaged in the afghanistan endeavour have failed to communicate robustly and honestly with their populations in way that would help build and sustain popular will for longterm endeavour the taliban has proved adept at fuelling existing grievances suspicions and perceptions in its attempt to drive wedge between the afghan people and the karzai government and its international supporters kabul has not managed in firm and coherent way to undermine the talibans legitimacy through consistently highlighting its violent tactics and links to criminal groups instead it has too often simply sought to crack down on the local media which admittedly in its fledgling state and in the absence of other narra tives has often portrayed the conflict naively both kabul and its interna tional supporters need to respond in timely coordinated manner if they are to effectively counter taliban allegations they must also focus far more than is presently done on the human costs of insurgent violence the members of the multilateral coalition must also realise the importance of communicating exactly what is at stake in afghani stan to their domestic constituents 222 this should not be so difficult 11 september 2001 demonstrates the importance of ensuring that afghanistan does not once again become failed state that hosts extremists above all there is an urgent need for deeperrooted change not just cosmetic tinkering the afghan government must be truly accountable bound by the rule 222 in the words of canadian governmentmandated in quiry to put things bluntly governments from the start of canadas afghan involvement have failed to communicate with canadians with balance and candour about the reasons for canadian involvement or about the risks difficulties and expected results of that involvement

interests of the people and capable of providing services and security military means alone will not succeed in countering the insurgency instead by building institutions and offering the services that give the afghan people better life the government can gain public support thus denying the insurgents opportunities to exploit local griev ances and thereby gain modicum of legitimacy the insurgents of course understand the importance of violently disrupting the governments capacity to provide security and services since the afghan security forces still lack the ab ility to counter the insur gents on their own the security umbrella provided by the international community remains vital if afghani stan is to stabilise while it is necessary to emphasise that foreign troops will stay as long as needed the international community must prioritise the building of afghan security and administrative capabilities and assure the afghan people that there are longterm designs on the region any talk of longterm us bases would for instance feed into nationalistic resistance as well as neighbours apprehensions international forces must also demonstrate that they are accountable by putting in place more transparent sys tems to investigate and report on civilian casualties and other complaints only then will they succeed in neutralising the talibans attempts to paint the foreign intervention as an invasion and foreign troops as an occupation force the afghan government must seek to improve ties with the democratically ected government in paki stan the international community would be best served by encouraging this dialogue process even as it pressures the pakistan military to end policy of appeasing protaliban militants and afghan insur gents operating from pakistani territory the taliban is violent minority movement which holds out genuine hope to afghanistan but is grow ing through tapping into dive rse grievances and re sentments countering it requi res
