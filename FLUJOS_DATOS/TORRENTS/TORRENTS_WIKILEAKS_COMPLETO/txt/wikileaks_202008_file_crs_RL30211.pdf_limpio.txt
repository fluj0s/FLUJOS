consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 hr 3194 pl 106113 legislation that enacts by reference hr 3422 the foreign operations appropriations act fy2000 hr 3422 was the third foreign operations measure debated by congress in 1999 and represented the results of extensive negotiations between congress and the white house to resolve funding differences president clinton had vetoed the first foreign operations measure hr 2606 because it cut 192 billion from his request hr 3422 provides 135 billion for regular foreign aid programs plus 18 billion over three years for the wye rivermiddle east peace accord for total package of 153 billion hr 3422 remains about 900 million below the presidents amended budget proposal in addit ion to including the wye river money the new foreign operations measure adds 799 million for several accounts that congress had reduced earlier including the world banks international development association and funds for the presidents counterproliferation expanded threat reduction initiativ in the former soviet union new funding is offset by delaying the transfer beyond fy2000 of 550 million of israels military aid this will not reduce israels 192 billion military aid but because the funds would have been placed in an interest bearing account it will result in the loss to israel of interest earned on the early disbursement the most significant administration funding priority not included in the revised foreign operations measure is multilateral debt relief for poor developing countries congressional negotiators agreed to an additional 90 million for bilateral debt relief bringing the debt reduction total to 123 million and they adopted modified authorization in hr 3425 also enacted by reference in pl 106113 for the us to support the imf offmarket sale of gold congress however would not add another 250 million to forgive debt owed to multilateral institutions or 600 million requested for debt relief in fy20012003 on the most contentious issue the admin istration further accepted abortionrelated international family planning policy restrictions in exchange for congressional approval of nearly 1 billion in arrears payments on november 30 president clinton exercised his waiver authority to exempt the abortion conditions from applying to 15 million of the 385 million population aid appropriation and said he would oppose inclusio n of these restrictions in future spending measureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30211crs2 1although the foreign operations appropriations bill is often characterized as the foreign aid spending measure it does not include funding for all foreign assistance programs food aid administered under the pl 480 program and managed by usaid is appropriated in the agriculture appropriations bill further the foreign operations measure includes funds for one activitythe exportimport bankthat is not regarded as foreign assistance but rather as us government activity promoting trade opportunities for american businesses in most years this results in foreign operations appropriation including the eximbank that is slightly less 15 in fy1998 than the official foreign aid budget throughout this report references to foreign operations and foreign aid are used interchangeablyintroduction the annual foreign operations appropriations bill is the primary legislative vehicle through which congress reviews and votes on the us foreign assistance budget and influences executive branch foreign policy making generally1 it contains the largest share about 70 of total international affairs spending by the united states see figure 1 the legislation funds all us bilateral development assistance programs managed mostly by the us agency for international development usaid together with several smaller independent foreign aid agencies such as the peace corps and the interamerican and african development foundations foreign operations includes separate accounts for aid programs in the former soviet union also referred to as the new independent states nis account and centraleastern europe activities that are jointly managed by usaid and the state department security assistance economic and military aid for israel and egypt is also part of the foreign operations spending measure as are smaller security aid programs administered largely by the state department in conjunction with usaid and the pentagon us contributions to the world bank and other regional multilateral development banks managed by the treasury department and voluntary payments to international organizations handled by the state department are also funded in the foreign operations bill finally the legislation includes appropriations for three export promotion agencies the overseas private investment corporation opic the exportimport bank and the trade and development agency from the perspective of congressional oversight and involvement in us foreign aid policy making the foreign operations bill has taken on even greater significance during the past decade congress has not enacted foreign aid authorization bill since 1985 leaving most foreign assistance programs without regular authorizations emanating from the legislative oversight committees as result foreign operations spending measures increasingly have expanded their scope beyond spending issues and played major role in shaping authorizing and guiding both executive and congressional foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives it has been largely through foreign operations appropriations that the united states has modified aid policy and resource allocation priorities since the end of the cold war the legislation has also been key tool used by congress to apply restrictions and conditions on administration management of foreign assistance actions that have frequently resulted in executivelegislative clashes over presidential prerogat ives in foreign policy makinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30211crs3 international affairs budget request fy2000 discretionary budget authority by appropriation bills an additional 13 million for the us institute for peace is in

reductions to his budget request the house 214211 and senate 5149 agreed on october 5 and 6 respectively to the conference report clearing the measure for the white house president clinton vetoed the legislation however on october 18 because of low funding levels and the absence of appropriations for several initiatives including the wye rivermiddle east peace package and an expansion of the

operations funding trends as the united states has adjusted its foreign and defense policy to postcold war environment one of the major foreign assistance challenges for congress and executive branch policymakers has been to formulate the most effective foreign aid program amidst tightening resource basehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30211crs5 after peaking at 207 billion in fy1985 foreign operations appropriations began period of decline falling to about 123 billion in fy1997 foreign aid spending cuts were especially sharp in fy1996 when congress cut funding by 115 billion nearly 9 from the previous year many government and nongovernment experts argued that these budget reductions seriously undermined us foreign policy interests and limited the ability of american officials to influence overseas events after foreign operations funding levels fell again in fy1997 although by much smaller amounts the state department and other executive agencies launched an aggressive campaign in to reverse the decadelong decline in the foreign policy budget this effort coincided with congressional approval of near 1 billion increase for fy1998 setting foreign operations appropriations at 1315 billion foreign operations funds rose again to 138 billion in fy1999 when lawmakers at the urging of the white house added nearly 900 million in the final days of the 105th congress as shown in table 2 the amount for fy1999 was the highest in five years bolstered especially by 21 billion supplemental funding for central america hurricane relief kosovo humanitarian aid and several other foreign assistance emergencies for fy1999 foreign operations represented 087 of the entire federal budget and 26 of total discretionary budget authority by comparison these same figures in fy1985 were 2 and

enacted in pl 105277 and pl 10631 it excludes however 17861 billion for the imf over the past 20 years foreign operations spending has experienced three distinct trends when calculated in real terms taking into account the effects of inflation the first period was marked by steady growth in foreign operations appropriations levels during the early 1980s when the united states rapidly expanded securityrelated aid programs in central america pakistan and to countries providing the us with military bases funding peaked in fy1985 at 319 billion in fy1999 dollars followed by sharp cut in fy1986 as the effects of the grammrudman deficit reduction initiative took hold and limited federal spending in most areas for the next five years during second phase of foreign operations budget trends appropriations remained relatively stable at about 195 billion per year real terms towards the end of the cold war foreign aid spending in real terms began to fall steadily from about 167 billion in fy1992 to 15 billion in fy1995 to 13 billion in fy1997 appropriations for fy1997 were the lowest since 1975 when congress slashed foreign assistance spending during the us withdrawal from vietnam fy1999 foreign operations spending is about 29 below the averagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30211crs6 data notes unless otherwise indicated this report expresses dollar amounts in terms of discretionary budget authority the foreign operations appropriations bill includes one mandatory program that is not included in figures and tables usaids foreign service retirement fund the retirement fund is scheduled to receive 446 million for fy1999 in addition funding levels and trends discussed in this report exclude us contributio ns to the international monetary fund imf proposals that are enacted periodically about every five years in foreign operations bills congress approved 179 billion for the imf in fy1999 the first appropri ation since fy1993 including these large infrequent and uniquely scored imf appropriations tends to distort general analysis of foreign operations funding trends although congress provides new budget authority through appropriations for the full amount of us participation the transaction is considered an exchange of assets between the united states and the imf and results in outlays from the us treasury in short the appropriations are offset by the creation of us counterpart claim on the imf that is liquid and interest bearing forappropriation level approved by congress during the late 1980s 17 less than fy1992 year that might be considered the first postcold war foreign aid budget and 8 less than fy1995 when the majority in congress changed foreign operat ions the fy2000 budget resolution and section 302b allocations in most years appropriation committees do not begin markups of their spending bills until congress has adopted budget resolution and funds have been distributed to the appropriations panels under what is referred to as the section 302a allocation process reference to the pertinent authority in the congressional budget act following this house and senate appropriations committees separately decide how to allot the total amount available among their 13 subcommit tees staying within the functional guidelines set in the budget resolution this second step is referred to as the section 302b allocation as noted above foreign policy funds are appropriated within four bills with foreign operations having the largest share of around 6870 in most years how much foreign policy money to allocate to each of the four subcommittees and how to distribute the funds among the numerous programs remain decisions exclusively reserved for the appropriations committees nevertheless overall ceilings set in the budget resolution can have significant implications for the budget limitations within which the foreign operations subcommittees will operate when they meet to mark up their annual appropriation bills the fy2000 budget resolution that cleared congress on april 15 hconres 68 strongly suggested that the foreign operations subcommittees would receive significantly reduced section 302b allocation than assumed in the presidentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30211crs7 2 the base appropriation refers to amounts funded in the regular foreign operations appropriations for fy1999 as included in division of the omnibus appropriations act fy1999 pl 105277 congress approved additional foreign operations funds in two supplemental measures about 411 million for child survival programs aid to russia victims of the kenyatanzania embassy bombings counternarcotics counterterrorism and y2k upgrades division b of pl 105277 and about 1633 billion for central america hurricane relief kosovo humanitarian assistance counternarcotics and the administration of three foreign affairs commissions all but about 5 million of the supplementals were declared emergencies and do not count against the foreign operations fy1999 allocation limits 3 budget authority or appropriation is the legal authority to incur financial obligations it normally results in the outlay or actual expenditure of federal government funds budget hconres 68 set 177 billion target for total international affairs budget figure 15 below the request in late may 1999 house and senate appropriations committees approved section 302b funding allocations for each of their 13 appropriation bills setting amounts for foreign operations programs sharply below the presidents 146 billion request and the 133 billion base appropriation for fy19992 the senate committee initially provided 125 billion in budget authority but later raised the amount to 127 billion it is 128 less than the budget proposal and 48 below the current foreign operations base the house appropriations panel originally allocated 1036 billion for foreign operations 29 below the presidents request and 22 under the base after shifting funds among several subcommittee accounts the house panel subsequently increased the foreign operations amount by over 22 billion resulting in 12625 billion level limitations on outlays under the section 302b allocation were also problematic3 congress can only influence new outlays those that will spendout in fy2000 as result of enactment of new budget authority house and senate outlay allocations provide about the same amount in controllable or new outlays 543 billion and 525 billion respectively these levels were about 11 less than the request moreover funding limits at these levels constrained the ability of the appropriations committees to respond to new aid initiatives such as the wye rivermiddle east peace package and expande d debt reduction for the worlds poorest nations secretary of state albright told the senate appropriations committee on may 20 that cuts of this magnitude would gravely imperil immediate and longterm american interests major reason that the foreign operations allocation as well as the allocation for several other spending measures were so low was the congressional and white house desire to stay within discretionary spending cap limits agreed to in 1997 the caps which were negotiated at time of budget deficits were intended to provide the means to balance the us budget by fy2002 with the far earlier emergence of budget surplus some lawmakers including members of the appropriations committees called for revisions to the budget caps so that portion of the surplus could be used to ease the spending limitations posed by the current ceilings other members however argued that the surplus was largely made up ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30211crs8 4 see below for detailed discussion of development assistance funding strategies the presidents request to reestablish

agreement was about 700 million or 5 higher than the base foreign operations spending level congress approved for fy1999 see footnote 3 congress further enacted an additional 2 billion in two fy1999 emergency supplementals for central american hurricane relief kosovo humanitarian assistance and series of other foreign aid accounts compared with the 154 billion total fy1999 foreign operations spending the base plus supplementals the fy2000 request without the wye river funds was about 135 billion or 9 less than fy1999 amounts see below for discussion of the supplementaladvance appropriation requests subsequently the president amended his request from 141 billion to 1438 billion primarily through september 1999 proposal that added 250 million for poor country debt relief in fy2000 and 600 million more during fy20012003 including the wye river funds the total fy2000 request as amended came to 16186 billion funding for selected foreign operations accounts for the most part portions of the 700 million increase above the base sought for fy2000 were spread out over many foreign operations accounts resulting in small boosts for these aid activities development assistance

egypt for further information see discussion below in section on middle east aidaccords in bosnia and to somewhat lesser extent efforts to counter the drug trade in latin america israel 285 billion and egypt 2 billion would continue to be the largest recipients although levels would decline as the united states continues to implement reduction in economic assistance to both countries5 russia and

separate actions during the summer the house and senate approved bills spending roughly the same amount of money overall 12624 billion and 12691 billion respectively but at levels less than appropriated in fy1999 and well below the presidents request the legislation however included some significant differences in how to allocate funds among the various foreign aid accounts conferees approved 12693 billion nearly identical to the senates level but still below amounts for fy1999 and the presidents request on very close votes largely along party lines the house 214211 and senate 5149 agreed on october 5 and 6 respectiv ely to the 12693 billion spending measure most democrats supported the presidents opposition to the measure because of the sizable cuts made to his foreign aid request other members voted against the bill because the conference agreement removed housepassed abortion restrictions related to international family planning programs and included funding for the population fund which maintains activities in china keeping to an earlier pledge president clinton vetoed hr 2606 on october 18 because of inadequate funding levels as primary reasons for his veto the president specifically cited cuts to his request for voluntary peacekeeping activities the expanded threat reduction initiative designed to safeguard weapons of mass destruction in russia and other former soviet states contributions to multilateral development banks and support for the heavily indebted poor country hipc debt relief program as well as the absence of funding for the wye river accord supporting the middle east peace process following the midoctober veto of hr 2606 the white house and congressional leaders negotiated the terms of compromise package that narrowed the gap between executivelegislative funding differences on november 5 the house approved revised foreign operations measure hr 3196 that added 799 million for white house priorities plus 18 billion for the wye river agreement although acceptable to the president the bill fell about 900 million short of the administrations amended request including denial of 247 million for the cancellation of poor country debt owed to multilateral development banks subsequent negotiations followed as congress and the president attempted to complete an omnibus spending package for the five remaining appropriation bills the most important changes for foreign operations reflected in the introduction of third measure hr 3422 and separate authorization bill hr 3425

bill passed by the house on november 18 and by the senate on november 19 enacted by reference hr 3422 and hr 3425 president clinton signed into law hr 3194 on november 29 1999 senate debate the senate approved its version of the foreign operations request for fy2000 on june 30 1999 s 1234 the 12691 billion was about 19 billion or 13 less than the presidents request compared to fy1999 levels the recommendation was about 700 million or 5 below the base foreign aid appropriation regular foreign operations funding approved in the fy1999 omnibus spending bill pl 105277 and over 27 billion or 177 under total foreign operations appropriation s for fy1999 that includes large central america and kosovo emergency relief supplementals house debate it had been expected that the house appropriations bill would fall far below the senate measure due to an initial 104 billion budget authority allocation to the subcommittee see discussion above under the section on 302b allocations and foreign operations immediately prior to the house committee markup on july 20 however the panel revised the foreign operations figure upwards to 126 making available roughly the same amount of money as passed the senate as adopted in the house on august 3 hr 2606 appropriated 12624 billion in discretionary funds 199 billion or 136 less than the fy2000 request it was 777 million below the base fy1999 appropriation and 28 billion 18 under the total foreign operations enacted amounts for this year including both base funding and emergency supplementals conference consideration veto of hr 2606 and revised foreign operations bill on september 22 housesenate conferees resolved all differences except one in their respective versions of hr 2606 subsequently members worked out their disagreement on international family planning and contributions to the population fund and approved on september 27 1293 billion measure like the senatepassed bill the conference fell about 700 million or 5 below the base spending level for fy1999 and 19 billion 13 less than the presidents request president clinton and his senior foreign policy advisors argued that the conference agreement shirked number of us financial responsibilities and jeopardized american interests in promoting middle east peace safeguarding nuclear weapons and scientist expertise in the former soviet union and stabilizing several global hot spots following the veto of hr 2606 and several weeks of negotiations congressional leaders and white house officials agreed to compromise package which the president says he supports the agreement approved by the house on november 5 in second foreign operations measure hr 3196 added 1825 billion for the wye river peace accord and 799 million for range of foreign aid programs the white house charged were underfunded in the earlier hr 2606 the total package in hr 3196 represented full funding for the wye river agreement and roughly half of administrations request that had been cut in hr 2606httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30211crs13 6 on july 19 the white house amended its fy2000 child survival request by seeking an additional 45 million to support presidential aids initiative aimed primarily on africaas negotiations to resolve all budget issues continued after house passage of hr 3196 third foreign operations spending measure hr 3422 was introduced on november 17 legislation representing the final agreement over foreign aid spending the major difference between hr 3196 and hr 3422 is the addition in hr 3422 of abortion restrictions that apply to international family planning programs congressional negotiators had been insisting that the white house accept such conditions on population assistance in exchange for congressional approval of nearly 1 billion to pay off us arrears at the united nations in virtually all other respects the two bills are the same the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 hr 3194 pl 106113 enacts hr 3422 and several other spending and authorization measures by reference the house approved hr 3194 and therefore hr 3422 on november 18 and the senate approved the bill on november 19 with the exception of over 26 billion in additional funding for selected accounts and the inclusion of abortion restrictions for international family planning programs hr 3422 is virtually identical to the conference agreement on hr 2606 bill vetoed by the president three major congressional priorities funded in the vetoed measure and continued in hr 3422 include kosovo and balkan assistance hr 3422 includes about 535 million for balkan reconstruction and regional economic stabilization with 150 million recommendation specifically for kosovo this follows closely what the senate had passed in s 1234 the presidents budget prepared before the outbreak of hostilities included only 393 million for the region the house measure did not include earmarked funds for kosovo and regional reconstruction initiative hr 3422 stipulates however that none of the funds for kosovo are to be used for large scale infrastructure projects or be available until the president certifies that the us commitment at late1999 kosovo donor pledging conference does not exceed 15 of total pledges child survival and disease progra ms hr 3422 provides separate account as proposed by the house at 715 million for children and infectious disease activities overall the revised foreign operations bill increases the account from the base fy1999 appropriation of 650 million and the amended 700 million fy2000 request6 in addition if the president exercises his authority to waive abortionrelated family planning restrictions 125 million will be transferred from population aid programs to child survival and disease activities aid to israel egypt and jordan following the lead of senate and housepassed levels hr 3422 increases aid to israel and egypt beyond the administrations regular funding request the presidents budget had proposed accelerating to 150 million the tenyear 100 million per year pace for reducing us assistance to the two countries that congress began last year the bill increases the request by 50 million restoring the tenyear 100 million per year reduction under the hr 3422 israel will receivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30211crs14 288 billion and egypt 2035 billion in addition the bill earmarks 225 million for jordan as requested in many other areas the revised foreign operations bill increases spending levels that had led to the presidents veto of hr 2606 wye river accord hr 3422 provides full funding of 18 billion through fy2002 for the middle east peace pledge made by president clinton in late 1998 at the time the us committed 900 million for fy1999 500 million for fy2000 and 500 million for fy2001 in additional assistance to israel jordan and the palestinians during period when little progress was made by the parties in implementing the wye accord congress approved in may 1999 only 100 million for jordan in the fy1999 supplemental appropriations with the more recent meetings between president clinton and newly elected israeli prime minister ehud barak the administration once again pressed congress to approve expeditious ly the remaining wye accord aid pledges hr 3422 further adds an additional 25 million in military aid for egypt although not linked with the wye accords the administration had requested for fy2000 that congress approve early disbursement of some of egypts military aid that could be deposited into an interest bearing account that would enhance egypts aid package this would be similar to an arrangement extended for several years to israel because of budget limitations and the outlay impact of early disbursement of funds congress rejected the proposal in hr 2606 the 25 million included in hr 3422 represents roughly the amount of interest egypt would have earned under the early disbursement plan aid to russia and nuclear weapons safeguards top administration priority has been 241 million for its expanded threat reduction program counterproliferation initiative in the former states of the soviet union the amounts approved in hr 2606 for russia and other independent states 735 million would have jeopardized funding for the threat reduction project plus squeezed aid for russia and some of the other countries in the region hr 3422 adds 104 million for the account bringing the total to 839 million and specifically earmarks 241 million for the counter proliferation initiative the new bill continues other provisions from hr 2606 by setting aid targets of 180 million for ukraine 95 million for georgia and 90 million for armenia even with the additional funding bilateral economic aid for russia and several other countries in the region are likely to fall below requested levels and perhaps below fy1999 amounts multilateral development bank funding multilateral assistance funded within title iv of the foreign operations appropri ation received one of the deepest cuts under the terms of hr 2606 over 500 million or onethird less than requested hr 3422 restores 233 million to title iv including 150 million for the world banks international development association ida congress initially cut the 803 million request to 625 million primarily due to disagreement with bank policy over extending loan to china that would involve the resettlement of poor chinese farmers into traditionally tibetan area the new foreign operations measure also fully funds 128 million the african development fund and increases from 1 million to 41httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30211crs15 million resources for the us to subscribe to new african development bank replenishment hr 3422 also adds 16 million for the interamerican investment corporation funding that was not provided in hr 2606 us voluntary contributions to international organizations received an additional 13 million funds that most likely will be used to increase payments to the development program the amount and terms of 25 million american contribution to the population fund did not change under the revised foreign operations bill the major remaining resource shortfall for multilateral programs in hr 3422 is for the global environment facility for which the appropriation remains at 358 million or onefourth of the request economic support fund esf assistance esf bilateral economic aid channel through which the united states extends support largely for political and security purposes had been cut significantly under hr 2606 except for middle east recipients after subtracting earmarks for israel egypt jordan and lebanon the vetoed foreign operations measure had reduced the presidents request for all other esf activities by roughly 45 most vulnerable would have been aid programs in haiti guatemala cambodia and indonesia as well as series of regional human rights democracy building environment and other global issue initiatives hr 3422 restores 1685 million to the esf account leaving more modest 95 million or 17 shortfall usaid operating expenses under hr 2606 congress approved the senatepassed level of 495 million for the costs of staff salaries and living expenses overseas for the primary us bilateral aid agency agency officials argued that without higher funding they would be forced to initiate reductioninforce as had occurred in 1997 moreover usaid continues to be plagued by ineffective financial management systems and failed attempts to replace them hr 3422 provides an additional 25 million that should allow usaid to cover its operating costs as well as complete plans for new financial management initiative peacekeeping operations voluntary contributions to nonun sponsored peacekeeping activities had been reduced in hr 2606 to 78 million 52 million less than the request hr 3422 adds back 75 million for total of 153 million that will cover american payments to peacekeeping operations included in the original requests plus those such as in sierra leone and east timor that have developed since early 1999 peace corps under the terms of the conference agreement of hr 2606 peace corps funding was cut to 235 million 35 million less than the request and 5 million under fy1999 levels hr 3422 restores some of the reduction by adding 10 million the 245 million fy2000 appropriation however will still fall short of the administrations goal of achieving 10000 volunteer peace corps in few areas the third foreign operations bill does not substantially alter funding shortfalls that had been approve d in the vetoed hr 2606 the most significant from the administrations perspective is debt relief for the worldshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30211crs16 poorest nations in the original budget request submitted in early 1999 the president sought 120 million for debt reduction including funds for us participation in the world bankimf managed heavily indebted poor country hipc initiative designed to provide extensive reduction of debts owed to both bilateral governments and multilateral institutions following g7 agreement in june and world bankimf endorsement in september to significantly expand hipc the president asked congress on september 21 to increase debt relief funding to 370 million in fy2000 plus 600 million for fy20012003 the conference agreement on hr 2606 included only 33 million for debt cancellation none of which could be used for helping reduce multilateral debt the revised hr 3422 increases debt relief funding by 90 million all of which must be used for bilateral reduction hipc proponents fear that if the united states does not contribute to the multilateral portion of the hipc initiative other bilateral donors will follow leaving large funding shortfall for hipc implementation although the white house did not achieve full funding for debt relief congress agreed in separate bill hr 3425 that is also enacted by reference to the consolidated appropriations act to authorize us support for an imf offmarket sale of gold that would finance the funds ability to writedown poor country debts in perhaps the most controversial provision included in hr 3422 the white house agreed to accept restrictions on international family planning policy that prohibit us grants to private foreign nongovernmental and multilateral organizations that either perform abortions or lobby to change abortion laws in foreign countries the president can waive the restrictions for up to 15 million in grants but if he does population aid funding declines from 385 million to 3725 million the restrictions apply only to fy2000 and will expire on september 30 2000 although the president exercised his waiver authority on november 30 1999 and instructed usaid to minimize any adverse impact the provision might have on usfunded family planning programs the legislation represents the first time in 15 years of heated congressional debate that such restrictions have been enacted into law critics of abortion restrictions are concerned primarily about the precedent that this sets and the effect it will have on another contentious debate in congress next year when the current restrictions expire the white house reluctantly agreed to the abortion conditions when congressional leaders refused to approve funds to pay off us arrears to the united nations unless the restrictions were also added another funding reduction in hr 2606 not addressed in hr 3422 is for the interamerican foundation the iaf is small independent grassroots aid organization supporting projects in latin america since 1969 under both hr 2606 and hr 3196 the iaf will receive 5 million in fy2000 less than quarter of the administrations 223 million request further the bills authorize the president to abolish the iaf next year the foundation had been heavily criticized for recent management irregularities and for the continuation of funding for certain ngos that had been involved in the kidnaping of americans in 1997 the third foreign operations bill further does not include funding for two emerging foreign aid initiatives that the administration had announced earlier it would pursue during the final budget negotiations although the executive branch never submitted formal requests it had consulted extensively with congressional committeeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30211crs17 for additional funds for balkan reconstruction and stabilization efforts and counter narcotics programs in colombia as noted above both hr 2606 and hr 3422 provide more for balkan and kosovo assistance than requested by the administration earlier in 1999 but there remains about 300400 million gap between amounts provided in hr 3422 and what the executive wants to pledge for reconstruction needs presumably the balkan aid package will come before congress in 2000 as part of supplemental to provide additional dod costs of peacekeeping operations in the region for counternarcotics an initiative with strong congressional support hr 3422 increases spending by 20 million for fy2000 nevertheless this remains far short of preliminary proposals recommending 1 billion15 billion for colombia and the andean region over three years two nonfun ding but controversial policy issues that had been narrowly approved during house and senate floor debate and settled by conferees in hr 2606 are continued unchanged in hr 3422 school of the americas hr 3422 drops house provision that would have denied international military education and training funds imet for the armys school of the americas located at fort benning georgia the school trains latin american military officers drawing on imet for some of its operating costs although most of its funding comes from defense department money critics of the school contend that it has trained some of the most ruthless human rights violators among latin american militaries especially during the 1970s and 1980s the administration which argues that the schools curriculum has been overhauled during the 1990s and is designed to promote the observance of human rights principles by its graduates strongly opposed the house amendment prior to releasing funds to the school however hr 3422 requires the president to issue certain certifications regarding the curriculum at the school of the americas silk road strategy act the new foreign operations bill includes the senatepassed text authorizing aid programs for the south caucuses and central asia the socalled silk road strategy act as originally offered during senate debate by senator brownback the text would have allowed the president to waive the ban of nonhumanitarian aid to azerbaijan found in section 907 of the freedom support act an amendment by senator mcconnell and others however struck the waiver provision 5345 thereby maintaining the section 907 restriction the house had approved similar legislation including retention of section 907 in separate bill hr 1152 offsets for higher foreign operations spending congressional and white house priority for additional fy2000 funding in any spending measure has been to package them in such way that the total amount does not exceed discretionary spending caps or draw on budget surpluses derived from social security payments the 2624 billion addon for foreign operations is offset in two ways first the wye rivermiddle east peace package is designated as an emergency which means none of the 1825 billion will count against the discretionary caps to offset the outlay impact of the additional spending something that could potentially dip into the social security surplus hr 3422 limits to 137 billion the amount that israel can receive earlier than it would otherwise of its total 192 billion military aid transfershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30211crs18 for many years congress has approve d the immediate transfer of economic assistance to israel that could then be invested in interestbearing accounts before israel needed the funds to service debts owed the united states several years ago congress extended this benefit by allowing the early disbursement and the outlay of 18 billion in annual us military aid normally for other countries little or military assistance would be drawn upon in the year it was appropriated and therefore would not result in any outlays consequently the lower outlays estimated under hr 3422 because israel will not receive 550 million in early disbursement of military aid fully offsets the outlay impact of funding for the wye river accord and other foreign aid spending although this does not cut the 192 billion military aid package for israel it will result in the loss to israel of whatever interest would have accrued major policy and spending issues in the foreign operations debate in addition to funding decisions made by congress in the foreign operations appropriation bill the annual spending measure also includes wide range of policy provisions that frequently raise contentious foreign policy disagreements between the president and congress as mentioned above because congress has not enacted foreign aid authorization bills for over decade the foreign operations legislation often becomes the vehicle for debate on the conduct of us foreign policy more generally many of these policy provisions take the form of conditions or restrictions on how the president can use money included in the spending bill many of these provisions are opposed by the administration as excessively limiting his ability to manage american foreign policy the legislativeexecutive policy differences have in the past delayed the enactment of the foreign operations bill or have prompted presidential veto among the most significant funding and policy issues raised during congressional debate this year on the foreign operations appropriation measure concern conflicting executivelegislative branch development assistance strategy priorities restrictions on international family planning programs regional aid allocations competing initiatives to reduce debt burdens of the poorest developing countries and the terms and conditions under which the united states provides heavy fuel oil to north korea policy priorities of us development aid since the end of the cold war recurring debate has focused on what should replace the anticommunist foreign aid rationale of the past 50 years more fundamental question raised by some especially critics of development assistance is whether the united states needs to maintain an active globally focused economi c aid program many of these critics argue that aid can be transformed into smaller more targeted and often privatized instrument to support only the highest priority us foreign policy interests although there has been definitive consensus on priorities the clinton administration has strongly supported the retention of an activist foreign aid policy which can be used to bolster variety of us foreign policy initiatives around the world in early 1994 usaid released its blueprint for postcold war development aid policy based around the goal of sustainable development and its four strategies of promoting economic growth stabilizing global population protecting thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30211crs19 7 selected elements of economic growth programs that have broad congressional support such as microenterprise and agriculture activities were unaffected by reductions elsewhere in this sectorenvironment and advancing democracy more recently usaid added fifth strategy aimed at developing human capacity through education since adopting these strategies in 1994 usaid has maintained that they operate as interlinked mutually reinforcing elements of an overall us effort to promote the advancement of market economies and democratic transitions in developing nations officials argue that us aid is justified until countries reach point of sustainability that longer requires external aid funding reductions congressional restrictions and fluctuating administration priorities however have required usaid to alter the mix of resources devoted to each of the strategies raising questions over whether the integrative mutually reinforcing principles can be maintained congress for example limited development aid for population programs in fys199699 to roughly two thirds of the amount provided in fy1995 see below for more discussion on family planning restrictions further the state departments bureau of global affairs places high priority on environment programs and presses usaid to allocate the maximum amount possible to such activities as result the environment sector of sustainable development likely has not declined as much as it might have otherwise at the center of this issue for the past four years has been differences between congress and the executive branch regarding funding levels for programs supporting child survival basic education and efforts against hivaids and other infectious diseases despite cutting overall development aid in fys199697 by about 23 from fy1995 levels congress earmarked children and disease programs at amounts equal to or somewhat greater than those allocated in fy1995 making the cuts on all other elements of sustainable development closer to 30 congress boosted development aid appropriations for fy1999 by about 20 million beyond the presidents request but lawmakers set funding targets for child survival and infectious disease activities at about 460 million 85 million more than the administratio n proposed as result usaid cut funding for economic growth programs by 47 million and environment projects by 42 million below what the agency had planned for fy19997 congressional proponents of the child survival priority argue that even though budget pressures require the united states to reduce or hold the line on foreign aid spending the protection of children remains core american value demanding that cuts should be implemented without putting at risk the lives and wellbeing of small children in developing nations they further point out that the spread of infectious diseases poses direct threat to us citizens and that american national interests require continued support for global efforts to reduce or eliminate such illnesseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30211crs20 table 5 usaid sustainable

child survival and 10 million for hivaids provided in supplemental appropriations includes july 19 budget amendment seeking 45 million more to support presidential aids initiative aimed primarily at subsaharan africa although agreeing with the importance of child survival and infectious disease programs usaid officials apply broader definition to the terms arguing for example that efforts to protect small children go well beyond immunizations and access to other health services the quality of childs life they assert also is determined by an array of other factors including the degree of relative stability in society protection of the surrounding environment access to adequate shelter and implementation of sound economic policies that will ensure jobs and economic opportunities in the future consequently they contend that the squeeze that these targets place on other areas of sustainable development partially undermines the success of programs that also benefit childrenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30211crs21 8usaid contended however that the request for child survival and hivaids was the same as the fy1999 base appropriation enacted by congress in the regular foreign operations bill that was incorporated into the omnibus appropriations pl 105277 under the emergency supplemental division of pl 105277 congress added 50 million for child survival and hivaids programs that usaid did not include in its base in any case the white house amended its child survival request in july adding 45 million for an hivaids in africa initiative this brought the amended proposal for children and disease programs to 700 million the same as for fy1999 including the supplementalas has been the pattern the past few years usaids sustainable development request for fy2000 reduced or maintained at current levels funding for several congressional priorities while increasing development aid overall by 59 million or about 3 the 189 billion original request would have cut funds for child survival programs by 40 million from fy1999 appropriations and hold spending for other infectious diseases activities at the current allocation of 50 million8 environmental funds especially those for global climate change programs would grow the most under the administrations request up 42 million 17 from existing amounts family planning spending would also increase slightly rising by 16 million 5 from fy1999 levels other congressional development aid priorities would also receive higher funding under the presidents budget for fy2000 for example microenterprise agriculture and basic education programs each would grow by 10 12 for fy2000 congressional action hr 2606 as approved by the conferees and continued largely unchanged in the revised hr 3422 reduces the amended usaid development aid account by 87 million while at the same time increases funds for selected activities some of the largest development assistance and child survival earmarks and recommendations including those mentioned in house and senate committee reports on the legislation are international population aid 385 million as passed by the house the president requested 400 million while the senate had earmarked 425 million within development assistance and as much as 45 million under other accounts hivaids and other infectious diseases 180 million for hivaids including

usaid to restore biodiversity funding to the same proportion of development assistance funds it received in fy1995 this would result in about 99 million for biodiversity activities in fy2000 funding had fallen by nearly half in recent years from about 100 million in fy1995 to 55 million in fy1998 with the support of congress usaid increased the fy1999 program level to 68 million the net result of the overall reduction to development assistance plus increases for selected senate and house priorities would likely be lower funding levels for other sustaina ble development activities economic growth and private sector programs environmental activities other than biodiversity and democracy promotion programs are the most likely areas to face modest funding cuts under hr 3422 population and family planning assistance another aspect of the discussion regarding policy priorities of us development aid is the continuing controversy regarding internati onal family planning restrictions for fy2000 the president sought 400 million for usaid population programs 15 million increase over fy1999 levels the principal dispute over population assistance however goes well beyond funding issues centering more directly on abortionrelated activities of foreign recipients of usaid grants for over decade congress has engaged in contentious debates over us international family planning policy often as part of the foreign operations appropriations twice congressional positions on this issue have been one of the major reasons prompting presidential veto us international family planning programs had been one of the largest growth areas of the foreign aid budget in the 1990s from an average of about 250 million in the late 1980s fy1995 spending across all foreign operations accounts totaled approximately 548 million in the following years when congress deadlocked over abortionrelated restrictions and us population aid policy situation that blocked movement of the entire foreign operations bill lawmakers adopted interim provisions that among other things strictly limited the amount of funding for usaid family planning programs the appropriation cap of 385 million enacted in each of fy1997 1999 is roughly twothirds the amount provided in fy1995 as result of the impasse over abortion restrictions congress established delayed timetable for making these funds available schedule that included monthly apportionments or metering of the appropriation second issue in the population aid debate and one directly connected to funding reductions and metering of the past four years deals with abortion restrictions and the eligibility requirements for foreign organizations receiving funds to implement ussponsored family planning programs during the mid1980s in what hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30211crs23 become known as the mexico city policy the reagan and later the bush administration restricted funds for foreign nongovernmental organizations that were involved in performing or promoting abortions in countries where they worked even if such activities were undertaken with nonus funds several groups including international planned parenthood federationlondon ippf became ineligible for us financial support in some years congress narrowly approved measures to overturn this prohibition but white house vetoes kept the policy in place president clinton in 1993 reversed the position of his two predecessors allowing the united states to resume funding for all family planning organizations so long as us money was not used in abortionrelated work during the past four years the house and senate have taken opposing positions on the mexico city issue that in each case held up enactment of the final foreign operations spending measure the house position sponsored by representative smith nj and others supported reinstatement of the mexico city policy restricting us aid funds to foreign organizations involved in performing abortions or in lobbying to change abortion laws or policies in foreign countries the senate on the other side has rejected house provisions dealing with mexico city policy favoring policy that leaves these decisions in the hands of the administration moreover administration officials have stated that president clinton would veto any bills that include the housepassed mexico city restrictions threat he carried out in october 1998 when he rejected legislation authorizing family planning programs that included mexico city policy hr 1757 unable to reach an agreement satisfactory to both sides congress has adopted interim arrangements for fy19961999 that do not resolve the broad population program controversy but has permitted the stalled foreign operations measure to move forward it was hoped that the arrangement which neither side liked would provide incentives for those involved in the debate to find middle ground under the terms of the fy1999 tempora ry arrangement as included in pl 105277 congress deleted the housesupported mexico city restrictions limited population aid funding to 385 million down from 435 million passed by the senate and delayed or metered the availability of the funds at rate of onetwelfth of the 385 million per month congress further enacted for fy1999 ban on us contributions to the population fund unfpa prohibition that had been in place during the reagan and bush administrations but which was lifted by president clinton in 1993 at issue are unfpa programs in china country where there have been continuing reports for many years of coercive family planning practices during the mid1990s congress reduced unfpa contributions by an amount the organization spent in china but when unfpa ended its china program in 1997 the controversy subsided unfpa however reinstituted activities in china soon thereafter resulting in the withholding in fy1998 of 5 million for unfpa and the enactment for fy1999 of total prohibition on the us 25 million contribution so long as the organizationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30211crs24 9in related legislative action the house international relations committee on april 29 1999 reported an omnibus state department authorization bill hr 1211 that earmarks 25 million for unfpa in fy2000 us contributions however would be conditioned on how unfpa operates in china namely that unfpa programs focus on improving the delivery of voluntary family planning information and services and that unfpa works only in counties where participant quotas and targets have been abolished and coercive practices terminated the full committee overturned subcommittee recommendation to prohibit us contributions to unfpa unless the president certified that unfpa had withdrawn from china or that china longer engaged in coercive family planning practices in subsequent debate on revised substitute bill hr 2415 the house rejected an amendment by representative smith that would have restored the subcommittee prohibition and instead adopted campbell amendment authorizing 25 million for the unfpa but making it subject to dollarfordollar reduction by however much unfpa spends in china 10following adoption of the tiahrt amendment in the 105th congress the house on march 23 1999 passed nonbinding resolution hres 118 reemphasizing the voluntary nature of international family planning programs the resolution was aimed at meeting of the general assembly in late june that reviewed and appraised the implementation of the program of action of the 1994 international conference on population and development sponsors of hres 118 reportedly wanted to signal the conference that congress believes that all family planning programs should be complete ly voluntary avoid numerical targets and provide recipients complete information on methodsremained active in china nevertheless the clinton administration sought 25 million for the unfpa in fy20009 new element in the family planning issue added during the fy1999 debate emerged following reports that peru where usaid has population aid programs had established national targets for tubal ligations and vasectomies there were also allegations that some peruvian health workers may have conditioned the receipt of food and medical care on the acceptance of sterilizations usaid maintains policy of strict voluntarism for family planning programs it supports and opposes the use of performancebased quota systems the agency says that perus government has instituted significant reforms in its family planning programs including criteria that ensure voluntary informed consent to reinforce us policies opposing programs based on coercive practices or quota systems congress adopted for fy1999 an amendment by representative tiahrt that more precisely defines the term voluntary family planning programs and establishes criteria for usaid to apply regarding the voluntary nature of its population projects10 for more information see crs issue brief 96026 us international population assistance issues for congress by larry nowels congressional action s 1234 as approved by the senate increased family planning funds within the development aid account from the 355 million request to 425 million across all accounts including esf nis and seed programs the senate recommendation would set population aid at about 470 million 70 million increase above the administrations overall 400 million recommendation the bill further earmarked unfpa funding at 25 million as requested the house measure like previous bills capped family planning assistance at 385 million but unlike enacted foreign operations laws the past few years thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30211crs25 house bill would not meter the availability of these funds an amendment offered by representative pelosi at the house committees markup restored the 25 million request for the population fund but made it subject to reduction by whatever amount unfpa spends in china in 2000 during floor debate the house adopted two competing and apparently conflicting amendments affecting us international family planning policy on 228 200 vote the house approved modified mexico city policy amendment by representative smith nj prohibiting us funds to foreign ngos that perform abortions or lobby to change abortion laws in foreign countries regardless of whether such activities are financed with us funds the house also adopted 221208 counter amendment by representative greenwood permitting us grants to foreign ngos as long as they do not use usprovided money to perform abortions or violate abortion laws in foreign nations the greenwood amendment further requires such organizations to support programs that reduce the incidence of abortion as method of family planning because the smith language is more restrictive concerning foreign ngo eligibility for receiving usaid grants it would be the operative text if both amendments are enacted requirements in the greenwood provision that ngos support programs reducing abortions as method of family planning and adhere to abortion laws in foreign countries nevertheless would also apply should conferees adopt both positions theoretically however some foreign ngos that would be eligible recipients of usaid grants under the greenwood amendment would be barred from receiving us population aid under the smith restrictions the white house said the president would veto any bill that included the smith language as has been the case in the past the foreign operations conference committee meeting could not resolve the housesenate differences on the family planning issue senate conferees insisted that unfpa funding remain in the bill while their house counterparts agreed to drop the modified mexico city abortion restrictions contained in the smith amendment if the unfpa contribution was also removed following further negotiations conferees agreed to continue current law regarding population aid funding levels and abortion restrictions that is 385 million metered on monthly basis but the deletion of both the smith and greenwood amendments they also added the 25 million unfpa earmark with conditions that passed the house and senate the revised foreign operations bill hr 3422 makes changes to the conference agreement of hr 2606 regarding unfpa funding and conditions but the issue of abortion restrictions became one of the last and most contentious issues resolved in the final budget package when congressional leaders refused to include arrearage payments without revised mexico city language the white house reluctantly agreed to the abortion restrictions this is the first time that mexico city restrictions are included in legislation under the terms of hr 3422 private foreign nongovernmental and multilatera l organizations that either perform abortions or lobby to change abortion laws in foreign countries are prohibited from receiving usaid population aid grants the president can waive the restrictions for up to 15 million in grants but if he does population aid funding declines from 385 million to 3725 million the restrictions apply only to fy2000 and will expire on september 30 2000 although the president used his waiver authority on november 30 and thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30211crs26 impact on usfunded family planning programs is expected to be minimal critics of abortion restrictions are concerned primarily about the precedent that is set and the effect it will have on another contentious debate in congress next year when the current restrictions expire regional allocations of us foreign aid and the request for an africa specific account although the middle east has received by far the largest proportion of us assistance over the past three decades 5563 of bilateral aid appropriated in foreign operations spending measures in most years allocations to other regions have fluctuated considerably especially since the end of the cold war asia which received substantial assistance in the 1980s associated with the presence of us military bases in the philippines had its share drop to 16 to 4 by fy1997 latin america where central american governments were confronted with internal conflict had its share drop from 16 to 6 africas proportion remained about the same 78 development that disappointed those who argued that the worlds poorest region should receive higher priority especially with the reduction in emphasis on security assistance us aid to the emerging democracies and market oriented economies in eastern europe and the former soviet union where the united states had programs prior to 1990 grew to represent 14 of american bilateral assistance funded in the foreign operations bill for fy1997 table 6

and congressional committees believed these shifts in regional aid allocations had swung too far this was particularly true in the cases of asia and latin america given the asian financial crises and significant us interests to promote economic developm ent in latin america in order to counter the trend of rising illegal immigration to the united states foreign operations appropriations measures the past two years have emphasized the need to maintain or increase assistance especially to latin america in the case of africa others argued that not enough has been reallocated to offer sufficient help to meet the regions unmet needs and to promote future usafrican trade opportunities as the share of bilateral foreign operations funding for the middle east exceeded 60 some in congress began promoting the view that there should be some limits to the amount provided and that if the administration wanted to pursue new middle east peace initiatives using foreign aid as an implementing tool resources should be found within existing middle east programs and not be taken from other regions accordingly for fy1998 congress took steps to legislate cap on foreign operations resources for the middle east at the initiative of representative callahan chairman of the house foreign operations subcommittee lawmakers stipulated in the fy1998 funding measure section 586 of pl 105118 that selected middle east nations and regional programs could not receive more than 54 billion of the total appropriation following this israel put forth in january 1998 plan to cut its aid over the next ten to twelve years the concept behind the israeli initiative to decrease assistance from the united states was first raised by prime minister netanyahu in speech before joint session of congress on july 10 1996 as outlined to congressional and administration officials by israeli finance minister neeman in late january 1998 the united states would cut economic aid by 120 million each year for about ten years while increasing military assistance by 60 million annually at the end of the period israel would be receiving an annual appropriation of 24 billion in military aid but longer receiving any economic assistance if done over tenyear period us aid to israel would fall 60 million each year in net terms with total savings of 600 million by 2009 for fy1999 congress supported the 60 million net reduction of aid to israel also adding similar 40 economic aid cut for egypt the presidents fy2000 foreign operations request reflected several of these regional allocation views expressed by congress in recent years highlights of the administrations recommendations include the following creation of the development fund for africa account after threeyear absence the president asked congress to reestablish separate foreign operations account for african aid and to increase funding slightly over fy1999 levels ten years ago congress and the administration launched joint initiative to create special legislative authority for us economic aid to africa the development fund for africa dfa authorized in chapter 10 of the foreign assistance act of 1961 was intended to extend more flexibility to usaid program managers and to protect aid resources for africa from being transferred to other regions as new foreign policyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30211crs28 crises unfolded at its peak the united states channeled about 800 million annually through the dfa although the dfa authorization law remained in force congress ended the practice of direct dfa appropriation in fy1996 funding africas assistance out of worldwide development aid and child survival accounts following president clintons visit to africa in 1998 during which he pledged to restore us aid to higher levels provided in previous years the administration has proposed direct dfa appropriation account for fy2000 the budget includes 745 million for african development aid including funds from both the dfa and child survival accounts combined with funds requested under the economic support fund largely for democracy and economic growth initiatives and smaller amounts of military assistance the fy2000 budget includes 893 million for africa this compares to fy1999 allocations of 883 million increased funding for asia the fy2000 foreign aid budget proposed significant increases in assistance programs throughout the asian region the 424 million requested is nearly 100 million or 30 higher than allocations for fy1999 this represents the largest percentage increase sought in the fy2000 foreign aid request for any of the five major regions under usaids portfolio much of the increased funding is for new east asian economic recovery initiative this multi year plan administered by usaid would support job creation opportunities social safety net programs transparency and anticorruption activities and regional economic recovery programs the administration plans to spend about 53 million for the initiative out of both development aid and esf accounts the administration is also proposing an expansion of various east and south asian regional programs aimed at meeting global climate change goals and deterring forest and marinecoastal zone degradation and promoting democratization and governance initiatives in south asia the fy2000 budget request further includes new item 5 million program to counter violence against women and to promote increased participation by women in the political process modest increases for most latin america programs central america reconstruction supplem ental excluding counternarcotics assistance and emergency central american hurricane relief latin america would receive modest increase in us assistance for fy2000 the fy1999 omnibus appropriation act included separate emergency supplemental for drug control programs most of which was earmarked for colombia that doubled the regular counter narcotics budget the 735 million proposed level for the region is roughly 8 higher than the base allocations for fy1999 after adjusting for the supplemental drug and central america disaster funds the most significant regional initiative congress addressed in 1999 was supplemental for reconstruction and other assistance for the victims of hurricanes mitch and georges which struck central america and the caribbean in 1998 and the more recent earthquake in colombia of the 1 billion appropriated for hurricane relief and reconstruction enacted in pl 10631 621 million will finance central america and caribbean recovery fund to assist nicaragua honduras and other states to rebuild their countries middle east aid reduced for fy2000 but large supplemental package sought for wye peace accord the presidents fy2000 foreign aid request for thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30211crs29 middle east reduced slightly us assistance to the region from 547 billion enacted for fy1999 to 524 billion proposed for next year the 230 million reduction stemmed largely from largerthanexpected cuts in assistance for israel and egypt many assumed when congress first began this downsizing in fy1999 that phased cuts would continue at steady pace of 100 million per year for ten years the fy2000 proposal however recommends cut of 150 million 60 million for egypt and 90 million net for israel administration officials say that they still intend to follow the tenyear time period but that they have not established firm pace at which amounts would be reduced the budget also included 19 billion supplementaladvance appropriation proposal to be allocated over three years in support of the wye memorandum and the next phase in the middle east peace process the 19 billion wye memorandum proposal would provide 900 million in fy1999 and an advance appropriation of 500 million in both of fy2000 and fy2001 israel would receive 12 billion the palestinians and jordan 400 million and 300 million respectively although the president had hoped that congress would dispense with this proposal as part of an fy1999 supplemental pl 10631 congress only considered 100 million requested for jordan in fy1999 deferring the balance to subsequent legislation including the foreign operations measure for fy2000 sharp increase in aid to russia and other former soviet states in dollar terms us assistance to russia and the other newly independent states nis of the former soviet union would grow more than for any other region the 1032 billion fy2000 request for the nis account is 185 million or 22 higher than for this year aid to russia would rise from 172 million in fy1999 to 295 million the increase sought for fy2000 however is totally the result of 241 million expanded threat reduction assistance initiative planned to be launched in russia and other nis countries next year the etr initiative is aimed at reducing the risks of weapons proliferation weapons delivery systems materials and technology and the transfer of scientific and technical expertise the 241 million requested in foreign operations spending is part of larger 1 billion administration proposal for increasing amounts dedicated to proliferation issues in the nis

bills 535 million earmark for east european assistance this represents change from the vetoed hr 2606httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30211crs30 funding levels for former soviet states received major boost in the revised foreign operations bill from amounts approved in hr 2606 the new bill sets spending at 839 million up 104 million from hr 2606 level 38 million higher than fy1999 but 193 million less than requested for fy2000 hr 3422 earmarks 241 million for the one of the presidents top priorities the counterproliferation expanded threat reduction initiative other earmarks for ukraine armenia and georgia protect funding for these countries while allocations for russia and several other former soviet states might be reduced because of overall account reductions and the earmarks middle east assistance especially for israel egypt and jordan would be funded at or above requested levels for regular aid programs moreover the new foreign operations measure fully funds the wye river accord the absence of which in hr 2606 had been primary reason for the veto given the worldwide reductions in hr 2606 under both the development assistance and esf accounts it was likely that spending in africa latin america and asia would fall below the presidents request an additional 1685 million in esf aid added in hr 3422 will reduce this impact somewhat although the decisions of how to allocate the specific cuts will be up to the administration hr 3422 further does not reestablish separate development fund for africa as proposed korean energy development organization kedo and us north korea policy at the heart of the clinton administrations north korea policy is the 1994 usnorth korea agreed framework an arrangement under which the united states provides the dprk with package of nuclear energy economic and diplomatic benefits in exchange for suspension by north korea in the operations and infrastructure development of its nuclear program as part of the accord two new light water nuclear reactors will be constructed financed largely by south korea and japan to replace the nuclear facilities shut down under the agreed framework that have the potential to produce nuclear weapons grade material while the new reactors are being built the united states and other nations have been contributing funds to the korean energy development organization kedo for the purchase of heavy fuel oil to supplement north koreas power and electricity production administration officials previously estimated that annual kedo contributions appropriated in the foreign operations bill would total about 2030 million the administrations policy of engagement with north korea and the approach outlined in the agreed framework have been frequent source of controversy in congressional debates in recent years but series of actions in 1998 by the north korean government missile sales to iran suspected construction of new nuclear site and the launch of rocket that traveled over japanese airspace prompted sharp reaction from congressional critics during which the house voted to prohibit the presidents fy1999 35 million request for kedo although lawmakers ultimately agreed to provide the 35 million payment of heavy fuel oil congress attached stiff conditions that had to be met in 1999 prior to the full transfer of funds under terms provided in pl 105277 the first 15 million became available only after march 4 1999 when the president certified that progresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30211crs31 was occurring on implementing several nuclearrelated agreements with north korea that the dprk was cooperating fully in the canning and storage of all spent fuel from its graphitemoderated nuclear reactors that north korea had not diverted any assistance and that the us was moving ahead with efforts to block dprks development and export of ballistic missiles the remaining 20 million became available june 1 following second presidential certification that progress has been made on the nuclear and ballistic missile issues and that the us and north korea had agreed on the means to satisfy us concerns about the dprks suspect underground construction pl 105277 further limited the presidents special waiver authority section 614 of the foreign assistance act of 1961 blocking its use to provide more than 35 million to kedo in fy1999 in addition congress required the president to appoint senior north korea policy coordinator by january 1 1999 to review usdprk policy and to direct negotiations with north korea the president named former secretary of defense william perry to the position in late 1998 the review of north korean policy was delayed until after visit by secretary perry to north korea in may and separate visit by us inspectors to the suspected underground nuclear site in preliminary report the inspectors said that although they found an extensive underground tunnel complex work had ceased the tunnels were empty and there was not evidence that north korea was in violation of the agreed framework reportedly north korea had been demanding payment for us inspection something the united states rejected nevertheless shortly following the midmarch announcement by the state department that north korea had agreed to multiple site visits officials said that the united states would proceed with bilateral pilot agricultura l project designed to improve potato production in north korea and contribute an additional 200000 metric tons of food aid to help north korea deal with its continuing food shortage and widespread starvation and malnutrition this was followed by an another 400000 food pledge on may 17 while officials argue that food assistance is based solely on humanitarian considerations and need some observers contend there is connection between arrangements to visit the suspected nuclear site and the food decision beyond issues related to conditions in last years foreign operations measure and the release of fy1999 funds for kedo congress considered this year the administrations 55 million request for kedo payments in fy2000 the proposal is the highest since the us first began financing heavy fuel oil in

launched at the june 1997 g8 denver summit the jubilee 2000 campaign is spearheaded primarily by catholic and protestant organizations from over 60 countries together with other religious and nongovernmental organizations the principal aim of jubilee 2000 is to achieve unconditional debt forgiveness for the most heavily indebted poor countries by the year 2000 on terms that will maximize the benefits for the poorest segments of the populationreprogramming funds to increase the 35 million appropriation if he chose to do so at later date debt reduction initiatives for poor countries providing debt relief to poor developing nations that borrowed in the past from the united states other creditor governments and international financial institutions has emerged as one of the key issues in the foreign operations debate for fy2000 the result of several factors first the administrations initial request of 120 million was nearly four times the amount appropriated for fy1999 in support of continuing debt reduction programs and two new activities for fy2000 secondly encouraged by various international campaigns promoting more expansive debt relief that will target poverty reduction including the jubilee 2000 movement11 several congressional initiatives have been introduced in 1999 that go beyond the presidents fy2000 request further on march 16 1999 the white house announced more ambitious us debt reduction policies for the worlds most heavily indebted poor nations at the g7 summit in june the presidents new policy was largely endorsed by the other major creditor governments finally during world bankimf meetings in september the institutions endorsed the g7 proposals for reforming the heavily indebted poor country hipc initiative for the past decade the united states has engaged in various forms of debt relief for developing nations resulting in the cancellation of about 144 billion of foreign debt much of it 101 billion resulted from special cases involving key us national interests for egypt in 1990 7 billion for poland in 1991 25 billion and for jordan in 1995 635 million us debt reduction policy for other nations based strictly on need has been guided by the principle that eligible countries must have demonstrated strong and sustained commitment to economic policy reforms prior to receiving debt relief under budget rules instituted in 1992 congress has had to appropriate funds in advance representing the costs of canceling debt the cost determination methodology is based on complicated formula that takes into account among other things the loans net present value its interest rate and the likelihood the loan will be repaid for especially poor countries with particularly large debt overhangs the appropriation requirement may be quite small relative to the loans face value perhaps 10 or less when it was first introduced in 1996 hipc was hailed as the first arrangement that included relief from debts owed to the world bank the imf and other international institutions organizations that hold over 25 of debt held by the most heavily indebted nations previously multilateral organizations had declined to participate in debt cancellation arguing that it would increase their costs of raising new money to lend expenses that would have to be passed on to borrowers forty one countries mostly in africa are eligible for hipc although only 29 likely have unsustainable debt further criterion for being hipc participant countrieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30211crs33 deemed eligible for hipc terms may have their bilateral public debt reduced by 80 after they have maintained record of strong economic performance for as much as six years at present uganda bolivia and mozambique are the only nations that enjoy full hipc benefits strong critics of hipc emerged especially among nongovernmental organizations and religious groups working in developing countries they charge that hipc terms are not deep enough that 90 or 100 of bilateral debt owed should be canceled and multilateral debt writeoffs should go further and that six years is far too long period for countries to qualify they further believe that the non sustainable debt criteria based largely on ratio of countrys debttoexports is too high and therefore excludes many countries that are also in need of debt relief some critics oppose the economic reform requirements and argue for unconditional debt reduction number of organizations further advocate instituting mechanisms that would ensure that savings realized by debtor governments would be channeled into spending on basic services such as health and education that would improve the quality of life of the very poor many of these arguments are reflected in legislative initiatives launched in 1999 including hr 1095 debt relief poverty reduction act of 1999 hr 772 hope for africa act and hr 2232 debt relief and development in africa act of 1999 complicating enactment of such bills however is the large additional costs that would be associated with efforts to broaden deepen and accelerate hipc or us bilateral debt reduction policies for fy2000 the president sought in february 1999 120 million for three debt reduction activities funded under the foreign operations legislation but between march and june the white house expanded us debt reduction policy addressing many of the concerns expressed by hipc critics the presidents new initiative much of which was endorsed by other leaders at the june g7 economic summit in cologne would provide deeper debt relief to more poor developing countries some of these steps are similar to those proposed in pending legislation especially hr 1095 although all congressional initiatives would expand hipc beyond the administrations revised policy reflecting the higher costs of an enhanced hipc initiative the white house sent to congress on september 21 an 850 million budget amendment to cover the anticipated us costs the revised 970 million total request over three years have the following major components 110 million plus 210 million more in fy20012003 to continue us bilateral debt relief agreements for reforming poor countries 210 million plus 390 million more in fy20012003 for us contributions to the hipc trust fund while the world bank and the imf will finance their own participation in hipc some multilateral organizations such as the african development bank do not have the necessary resources to extend debt relief to their debtors the trust fund which has received contributions of over 450 million from about 19 countries is designed to assist these international agencies to reduce debt owed by eligible hipc nations 50 million for debt relief to countries that are committed to protecting their tropical forests congress enacted last year the tropical forest conservation act of 1998 pl 105214 authorizing the president to buy back swap orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30211crs34 cancel concessi onal us economic and food aid loans in order to generate local currencies that will be used to support tropical forest conservation programs congressional action the 33 million appropriation for debt reduction limited entirely for bilateral relief was major factor in the presidents decision to veto hr 2606 while the revised foreign operations bill adds 90 million for bilateral debt cancellation us contributions can be made to the hipc trust fund and funding for fy20012003 must be dealt with in the future nevertheless in separate legislation hr 3425 that is also enacted by reference in the consolidated appropriations measure the white house gained congressional approval an authorization that would allow the united states to vote in favor of an imf off market gold sale that will finance the funds costs of hipc participation fy1999 supplemental appropriations and foreign operations congress considered several major fy1999 supplemental appropriation requests as part of s 544 and hr

caribbean reconstruction aid in the wake of hurricanes that struck the region in late 1998 100 million for jordan the most urgently sought portion of 19 billion threeyear aid package for israel jordan and the palestinians to help implement the terms of the wye memorandum negotiated in october 1998 and 819 million in humanitarian and refugee aid to kosovo and surrounding countries all of the middle east and kosovo assistance and nearly 700 million of the central american relief package fall under the jurisdiction of the foreign operations measure because of congressional decisions to offset the costs of the new spending however the president threatened to veto preliminary house and senate bills proposed offsets cuts to existing appropriations affected foreign operations programs especially in hr 1141 among the most controversial offsets in the house bill was the rescission of 648 million in callable capital appropriated prior to 1980 that is used by multilateral development banks to
