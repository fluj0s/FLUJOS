inspector general act of 1978 and its amendments of 1988 inspectors general are granted substantial independence and powers to carry out their mandate to combat waste fraud and abuse1 recent initiatives have added offices in the architect of the capitol office aoc government accountability office gao and for afgh anistan reconstruction funding and assignments for specific operations and mechanisms to oversee the gulf recovery program other proposals in the 110th congress are designed to strengthen the igs independence add to their reports and create new posts in the intelligence community responsibilities the igs four principal re sponsibilities are 1 conducting and supervising audits and investigations rela ting to the programs and operations of the agency 2 providing leadership and coordi nation and recommending policies to promote the economy efficiency and effectiveness of these 3 preventing and detecting wastehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98379crs2 fraud and abuse in these and 4 keeping the agency head and congress fully and currently informed about problems defi ciencies and recommended corrective action authority and duties to carry out these purposes igs have been granted broad authority to conduct audits and investigati ons access directly all records and information of the agency request assistance from other federal state and local government agencies subpoena information and documen ts administer oaths when ta king testimony hire staff and manage their own resources and recei ve and respond to complaints from agency employees whose confidentiality is to be pr otected in addition the homeland security act of 2002 gave law enforcement powers to cr iminal investigators in offices headed by presidential appointees igs moreover imp lement the cash incentive award program in their agencies for em ployee disclosures of waste fraud and abuse 5 usc 4511 reporting requirements igs have reporting obligations regarding their findings conclusions and recommendations these include reporting 1 suspected violations of federal criminal law directly and expeditiously to the attorney general 2 semiannually to the agency head who must s ubmit the ig report along with his or her comments to congress within 30 days and 3 particularly serious or flagrant problems immediately to the agency head who must submit the ig report with comments to congress within seven days the central intelligence agency cia ig must also report to the intelligence committees if the director or acting director is the focus of an investigation or audit by means of thes reports and otherwise eg testimony at hearings igs are to keep the agency head and congress fully and currently informed independence and neutrality in addition to having their own powers eg to hire staff and issue subpoenas ig independence is reinforced through protection of their budgets in the larger establishments qualif ications for their appointment prohibitions on interference with their activities and operations with few exceptions and fixing the priorities and projects for their offices without outside direction an exception to the igs rule occurs when review is ordered in statute although inspectors general at their own discretion may conduc t reviews requested by the presid ent agency heads other igs or congressional offices other provisions are designed to protect the igs independence and ensure their neutrality for instance igs are specifically prohibited from taking corrective action themselves along with this the inspector general act prohibits the transfer of program operating responsibilities to an ig the rationale for both is that it would be difficult if not impossible for igs to audit or inve stigate programs and operations impartially and objectively if they were direc tly involved in making changes in them or carrying them out supervision igs serve under the general s upervision of the agency head reporting exclusively to the head or to the officer next in rank if such authority is delegated with but few specified exceptions neither the agency head nor the officer next in line shall prevent or prohibit the inspector general from initiating carrying out or completing any audit or i nvestigation or from issuing any subpoena under the ig act the heads of only six agencies the departments of defense homeland security justice and the treasury plus the us postal service usps and federal reserve board may prevent the ig from initiating carrying out or completing an audit or investigation or issuing subpoena and th only for specified reasons to protect national security interests or ongoing criminal investigations among others whenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98379crs3 exercising this power the head must explain such action within 30 days to the house government oversight and reform committee the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee and other appropriate panels the cia ig act similarly allows the director to prohibit or lt an investigation or audit but he or she must notify the house and senate intelligence panels of the reasons within seven days appropriations presidentially appointed igs in the establishments but not in designated federal entities dfes are gr anted separate ppropriations account separate budget account in the case of the ci for their offices this restricts agency administrators from transferring or reducing ig funding once it has been specified in law appointment removal and tenure under the inspector general act igs in the larger establishments are appointed by th president subject to senate c onfirmation and are to be selected without regard to po litical aff iliation and solely on the basis of integrity and demonstrated ab ility in relevant fields tw other igs appointed by the president operate under similar but distinct requirements th cia ig is to be selected under these criteria as well as experience in the field of foreign intelligence and the special inspector general for afghanista n reconstruction sigar is the only ig appointed by the president alone presiden tially nominated and nateconfirmed igs can be removed only by the president when so doi ng he must notify congress of the reasons by comparison igs in the dfes are appoint ed by and can be removed by the agency head who must notify congress in writing when exercising this power the usps ig is the only ig with removal for cause and then with the written concurrence of at least seven of the nine governors who also appoint the officer terms of office are set for three igs
