0441 kabul 00000503 0012 of 002 classified by acting deputy ambassador joseph mussomeli reasons b and d 1 s summary former taliban ambassador to pakistan abdul salam zaeef advocates peace as the only option now for afghanistan while encouraged by the latest attention to achieving peace in afghanistan he believes action and sincerity not talk and good intentions are required to make progress he also wants negotiations among all involved parties including armed taliban and those who are active within the constitutional order and that obstacles such as the and us blacklists must be removed before these talks can start zaeefs viewpoint could reflect his annoyance at the pace of reconciliation talks that may have left him on the sidelines end summary negotiations first 2 s in recent meeting on february 8 with former taliban ambassador to pakistan abdul salam zaeef at his modest residence in kabuls pasthundominant khushhaal neighborhood zaeef told us he was convinced that there is longer any other option than peace for afghanistan peace is requirement for afghans americans and the international community at large however while encouraged by the latest attention to political settlement in afghanistan talk and good intentions are not enough rather action strategy and sincerity are required to make progress in particular zaeef expressed skepticism about karzais true intentions because karzai is deceiving all sides when he sits with he tells he wants the foreign troops to leave then he tells you he wants them to stay forever and he tells yet third story to islamic leaders of other countries zaeef said karzais only clear objective is to remain in power he thinks the presence of foreign troops will help him do so opined zaeef 3 s zaeef posited that the peace process must first start with negotiations among all involved parties including armed and disarmed taliban and that hurdles must be removed before entering these talks only after successful negotiations can reintegration and reconciliation occur he asserted to our query regarding which hindrances must be removed he listed ending the talibans isolation by removing them from the 1267 and us blacklists zaeef continues on the 1267 list and the cessation of foreign hostilities against the group during the negotiations taliban saved afghanistan from disintegration 4 s while most afghans want an end to hostilities zaeef said warlords do not and they were the reason the taliban seized control of the country to begin with without taliban intervention and its imposition of strong dictatorship afghanistan would have been divided between pakistan and iran zaeef said when the taliban seized power their first priority was to instill order and governance by ruling with strict hand they had also tried to establish central government to defend against challenges from the region and had attempted to clear the country of warlords who had ruled pieces of the country and had committed horrible human rights abuses unfortunately we were unable to even achieve our first goal he lamented zaeef insisted that if the taliban had remained in power it would have gradually become more moderate taliban are not misogynists 5 s like muttawakil ref zaeef asserted that the taliban were not misogynists who opposed womens education and the right to work as long as their actions did not violate islam while acknowledging the taliban made some mistakes he countered that saving afghanistan from disintegration far outweighed the talibans negative actions moreover now that conditions in afghanistan had changed he believed if peace were made with the taliban the old strict rules would not return he asserted that mullah omars intention was not to topple the afghan government rather he sought reforms to the constitution and other laws so they could be in accordance with islam comment while some extaliban assert that the taliban seek only minor unspecified constitutional revisions others insist that kabul 00000503 0022 of 002 the changes must be so farreaching such as reversing equal protections for women and elevating sharia law above other constitutional provisions that it amounts to full revision end comment foreigners will never win military victory 6 s responding to our reference to extreme versus moderate taliban elements zaeef suggested that we should instead differentiate the taliban by whether they choose force or peace to achieve their objectives ultimately however the armed taliban obey the orders of their political leaders therefore only political solution will work reasoned zaeef furthermore while americans have attempted to make the war an international cause it is clearly americas war and the iranians russians chinese and pakistanis and even the british are content for various reasons to see you mired in quagmire here he said foreigners have never won military victory in afghanistan zaeef warned comment 7 s zaeef has been relatively quiet during the governments formulation of the reintegrationreconciliation policy unveiled in london although he is certainly one of karzais informal advisors in this regard and appears to maintain contact with taliban leadership he appeared annoyed at not being more engaged in the policy development and also may be waiting less patiently for his delisting in view of the january 25 breakthrough which delisted five other afghans 8 s in february 5 inter press service ips article by gareth porter titled peace talks may follow extaliban mediators plan porter claimed that karzai had personally asked extaliban officials to help start the peace negotiations through road map for political settlement and mentions zaeef muttawakil and former taliban commander arsullah rahmani currently parliamentarian as extaliban liaisons the article also suggests that mullah omar may have selected zaeef as his point of contact for talks with the americans and nato and laid down some initial conditions of settlement some of those conditions coincide with president karzais call at the london conference for an end to night raids and detentions by foreigners matter how reconstituted the taliban mentality remains one that many afghans fear ref b and the government of afghanistan should increase its efforts to assure the whole population that there will be peace deal at the expense of nonpashtuns and womens rights end comment eikenberry
