being spent for 10 programs within the committees jurisdiction which are not authorized to be appropriated in fy2006 according to the chairman3 the presiding officer sustained point of order against

consideration in this session of bill to r eauthorize the national historic preservation act would likely include discussion of the preserve america program and save americas treasures an issue that

unappropriated balance including both federal and state share accounts in the aml fund was nearly 17 billion by the end of fy2004 western states are additi onally critical of the program because as

the bia the office of assistant secretaryindian affairs asia and the office of special trustee for american indians ost in the office of the interior secretary see office of special trustee section below the reorganization arises from issues and events related to trust f unds and trust assets management and is integrally related to the reform and improvement of trust management historically the bia has been responsible for managing indian tribes and individuals trust funds nd trust assets tr ust assets include trust lands and the lands surface and subsurface economic resour ces eg timber grazing or minerals and cover about 45 million acres of tribal trust land and 10 million acres of individual indian trust land trust asse ts management includes real estate services processing of transactions eg sales and leases surveys appraisals probate functions land title records activities and other functions the bia however has been frequently ch arged with mismanaging indian trust funds and trust assets i nvestigations and audits in the 1980s and after supported these criticisms especially in the areas of accounting linkage of owners to assets and retention of records this led to trust reform act in 1994 and the filing of an extensive court case in 1996 see office of special trustee s ection below the 1994 act created the ost assigning it responsibility for oversight of trust management reform in 1996 trust fund ma nagement was transferred to the ost from the bia but the bia retained management of trust assets unsuccessful efforts at trust manage ment reform in the 1990s led doi to contract in 2001 with management cons ultant firm the firms recommendations included both improvements in trust mana gement and reorganization of the doi agencies carrying out trust management nd improvement8 following nearly year of doi consultation on reorganization w ith indian tribes and individuals doi announced the reorganization in december 2002 even t hough the department and tribal leaders had not r eached agreement on all aspects of reorganization doi however faced deadline in the court case to file plan for overall trust management reform and reorganization was part of dois planhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32893crs36 the current reorganization plan of bia asia and ost which doi expects to complete in fy2005 chiefly involve s trust management structures and functions under the plan the bias trus t operations at regiona l and agency levels remains in those offices but is split off from other bia services the ost adds trust officers to bia regional and agency offices to oversee trust ma nagement and provide information to indian trust beneficiaries certain tribes however that had been operating trust management reform pilot projects with their regional bia offices under selfgovernance compacts were excl uded from the reorganization under the fy2004 and fy2005 appropriations acts the bia ost and asia together with the office of historical trust accounting in the secretarys office also are implementing separate trust management improve ment project announced in march 2003 which includes impr ovements in trust asset systems policies and procedures historical accounting for trust accounts reduction of backlogs modernization of computer technology t he court case led in 2001 to continuing shutdown of bias worldwideweb c onnections and maintenance of the improved system many indian tribes and tribal organizati ons and the plaintiffs in the court case have been critical of the new reorganiza tion and have urgently asked that it be suspended tribes argue that the reorganization is premature because new trust procedures and policies are still being developed that it insufficiently defines new ost duties and that other major bia service programs are being limited or cut to pay for the reorganization for fy 2004fy2005 congress responded to tribal concerns by excluding from bia reorgani zation certain tribes that have been operating trust management reform pilot projects with their regional bia offices congress retained this exclusion for fy 2006 congress has not however suspended or stopped the reorganization and cong ress agreed with the administrations proposed fy2006 funding for bia central ffice trust reform and reorganization bia school system the bia funds 185 elementary and secondary schools and peripheral dormitories with over 2000 structures educating about 48000 students in 23 states tribes and trib organizations under selfdetermination contracts and other grants operate 120 of these institu tions the bia operates the remainder biafunded sc hools key problems are low student achievement and especially large number of inadequate school facilities some observers feel tribal opera tion of schools will improve student achievement to encourage tribal board s to take over operation of current bia operated schools for fy2004fy2005 congress created an administrative cost fund to pay tribal school boards startup administrative costs the funds fy2005 appropriation was 986000 the administr ations fy2006 proposal reduced this fund to 500000 and congress agreed many bia school facilities are old and dilapidated with health and safety deficiencies bia education constructi on covers both constr uction of new school facilities to replace facilities that cannot be repaired and improve ment and repair of existing facilities schools are replaced or re paired according to priority lists the bia has estimated the current backlog in education facility repairs at 942 million but this figure changes as new repair needs appear each year httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32893crs37 table 12 above shows fy2005 educati on construction funds and for fy2006 the administrations proposal the house nd

proposal was reduction for replacem entschool construction of 621 million 59 the administration asserted that majority of school replacement projects funded in previous years are still under cons

construction by 535 million 20 and replacementschool construction by 401 million 38 from the fy2005 enacted levels in response to the administrations position that some projects under self determination contracts have been too slow in commencing the fy2005 appropriations act authorized the bi to reassume ma nagement of school construction projects that are under tribal selfdetermination contracts if the construction does not begin within 18 months of fundi ng availability congress retained this provision for fy2006 because construction appropriations are in some tribes views not reducing construction needs fast enough indian tr ibes have urged congress to explore additional sources of construction fi nancing in the fy2001fy2005 interior appropriations acts congress authorized

on th grounds that local governments need additional pilt funds to provi vital services and that additional funds would help close the gap between authorized and ppropriated funding the amendment was opposed on the assertion that there were insu fficient funds in the bill overall to direct more money to pilt and that it would have an adverse impact on management of important doi programs and

delay the courtordered accounting similar to the provision in the fy2004 interior appropriations act13 congress has long been concerned that the current and potential costs of the cobell lawsuit may jeopardize doi trust refo rm implementation reduce spending on other indian programs and be difficult to fund besides the ongoing expenses of the litigation possible costs include 1213 b illion for the courtordered historical accounting cobell settlement that might cost as much as the courtordered historical accounting the over100 billion that cobell plaintiffs estimate their iim accounts are owed or the 275 billion that the cobell plaintiffs have proposed as settlement amount14 among the funding sources fo r these large costs discussed in recent house interior appropriations subcommittee hearing were discretionary appropriations and the treasury departments judgment fund15 but some senior appropriators consider the fund insufficient even for 613 billion dollar settlement16 among other options congress may await stay reversal or other appeals court action or it ma enact another delay to the courtordered accounting or it may take other actions such as directing settlement or

office of navajo and hopi indian relocation the office of navajo and hopi indian relocation onhir and its predecessor were created pursuant to 1974 act pl 93531 as amended to resolve lengthy dispute between the hopi and navajo tribes involving lands originally set aside by the federal government for reservation in 1882 pursuant to the 1974 act the lands were partitioned between the two tribes members of one tribe living on land partitioned to the other tribe were to be relocated and provided new homes and bonuses at federal expense re location is to be voluntary onhirs chief activities consist of land acquisition housing acquisition or construction infrastructure construction and postmove support all for families being relocated as well as certification of families eligibility for relocation benefits congress has been concerned at times about the speed of the relocation process and about avoiding forced re locations or evictions for fy2005 onhir received an appropriation of 49 million 63 reduction from fy2004 when it received 134 million congress reduced funding because it anticipated that carryover funds from pr evious fiscal year s would offset the reduction in

navajo families resided on land partitioned or judicially confirmed to the hopi while only 26 eligible hopi families lived on navajo partitioned land according to onhir data moreover bout 250 navajo families only some of them among the 3400 eligible families signed accommodation agreements in the late 1990s under pl 104 301 1996 ttlement of related hopius issues that allowed them to stay on hopi land under hopi law about half of them however may wish to opt out of thes agreements and relocate using onhir benefits according to onhir of the 26 hopi families on navajo partitioned land 100 were relocated to replacement homes by the end of fy2004 according to onhir while 96 of the navajo families have comp leted relocation onhir timates that 130 navajo families were awaiting reloca tion as of the end of fy2004 of these 130 remaining navajo families 119 are not currently residing on hopi partitioned land but are in various stages of acquiri ng replacement housing 50 of the 119 families are currently having homes built or seeking homes others are in earlier stages eleven of the 130 navajo families are still residing on h opi partitioned land according to onhir three of these 11 navajo families are having homes built or seeking homes but the other eight families refuse to relocate or sign an accommodation agreement onhir and the us department of justice are negotiating with the hopi tribe to allow the eight families to stay on hopi land as au tonomous families in return for onhirs relocating off hopi land those families who signed agreements but wish to opt out onhir estimated in its fy2006 budget justif ication that relocation moves for currently eligible families w ill be completed by the nd of fy2006 the addition of navajo families who ve opted out of accommodation agreements and of navajo families who filed applications or appeals but whom onhir proposes to accommodate to avoid litigation toge ther estimated at 210 families would mean that all relocation moves would not be completed until the end of fy2008 according to onhir however this sche dule would depend on infrastructure needs and relocatees decisions required post move assistance to relocatees would necessitate another two years of expenditures after the last relocation move whether in fy2006 or fy2008 according to onhir onhir contends that the government would be vulnerable to litigation if the 210 families were not accommodated congress has at times expresse d impatience at the speed of relocation and legislation has been introduced in this congress s 1003 to sunset onhir in 2008 and transfer any remaining duties to the secretary of the interior longstanding proviso in onhir appr opriations language retained for fy2006 in the appropriations law prohi bits onhir from evicting any navajo fa mily from hopi partitioned lands unless replacement home were provided this language appears to prevent onhir from fo rcibly relocating na vajo families in the near future because of onhirs back log of approved relocatees awaiting replacement homes as the backlog is reduced however forced eviction may become an issue if any remaining navajo families refuse relocation and if the hopi

control when donor and sponsordesignated f unds put restrictions on the use of that funding there is concern that donordes ignated funding may require building to be renamed for that indivi dual or corporate donor even if an appropriate name is already being used in addition there is debate over whether companies who are allowed to advertise at cultural events might in some way compromise the

governments through grant program administered by the nps third administrations have requested and congress has appropria ted money from the lwcf to fund some related activities that do not involve land acquisition this third use is relatively recent addition starting with the fy1998 appropriation prog rams funded have varied from year to year most of the appropriations for fede ral acquisitions generally are specified for management units such as specific national wildlife refuge while the state grant program and appropriations for related activities are rarely earmarked through fy2005 the

million in fy1996 to 4532 million in fy2001 however since then the appropr iation for land acquisition has declined to 1146 million for fy2006 plus 99 million in prior year balances the table shows that in fy2006 the administration re quested much larger amount from the fund for other programs than congress provi ded due in part to different spending priorities and views on how the fund should

under its nds legacy initiative and congressional interest in in creasing conservation funding through legislation known as the conservation and reinvestment ac t cara which passed the house in the 106th congress the fy2001 interior appr opriations law authorized that total spending for csc would increase each year by 1600 million from 16 billion in fy2001 of which 12 billion would be throug h interior appropria tions laws to 24 billion in fy2006 all csc funding is s ubject to the appropriations process25 the appropriations history through fy2006 is as follows the fy2001 laws exceeded the target of 16 billion by appropriating total of 168 billion 120 billion for interior appr opriations programs and 048 billion for commerce appropriations programs tot als for interior and commerce funding were both increases from fy2000 when the cs c did not exist with funding of 566 and 160 million respectively the fy2002 request totaled 154 billion for this group of programs and congress appropriated 175 billion thus almost reaching the target of 176 billion for fy2002 the appropriation for the in terior portion was 132 billion reaching the authorized target amount the fy2003 request totaled 167 billion for this group of programs decrease from fy2002 funding and below the target of 192 billion for fy2003 congress appropriated total of 151 billion for the interior porti on congress provided 103 billion about 410 million less than the authorized target of 144 billion the fy2004 request totaled 133 billion according to estimates compiled by interior and commerce appr opriations subcommittee staffs this amount was below the fy2004 target of 208 billion for th interior portion the request was 100 billion and the target was 156 billion th administration had an alternative estimate that increased the total fy 2004 request to 122 billion for interior programs but it was based on some different assumptions about which programs to include the total appropr iation was not specified in congressional documents the fy2005 request from the department of the interior included 105 billion for the csc an increase of 140 million over the fy2004 appropriation for the same group of programs according to the departme nt however this total did not include requests from the forest service or department of commerce neither the forest service nor the department of commerce used the csc as structure for organizing or tabulating their requests the total appropriated amount credited to the csc in fy2005 is unclear as the only bill or accompanying committee report to identify funding levels for the csc was the house appropriations committees report in this report the csc is mentioned in the minority views where representatives obey and dicks state that the bill would fund
