tinued in effect throughout the united states food traveling in interstate commerce frequently required manufacturers to meet different nutrition labeling andor sa fety standards in different states creating additiona l expense and confusion in 1990 passage of the nutrition labelin g and education act nlea achieved uniformity for nutrition labeling throughout the country provisions in the act required that all state and local provisions th at were not identical to federal standards be preempted once study of all federa l state and local requirements was completed the study was conducted to determine which re quirements would be preempted and which ones we re unique to stateslocalitie s and should be allowed to remain in force the nlea allowed states to petition fda for an exemption from preemption if the requirement would not be in violation of any applicable federal requirement or unduly burden interstate commerce nd provided it addressed particular need not met by th requirements of the law the original bill that became nlea had contained provision to preempt state food safety provisions but it was dropped before passage legislation has been intr oduced on food safety unifo rmity in every congress since the 105th in the 109th congress the national uniformity for food act of 2005 hr 4167 would amend the food drug and cosmetic act fdca to prohibit any state or other

food raw agricultural commodities containing unsafe pesticides unapproved irradiated foods unsafe color or food additives tolerances for poisonous ingred ients conditions for emergency permit control and their suspension access for in spection and dietary supplement labeling regulations the bill would allow state to petition for an exemption or to establish national standard re lated to food regulation states would be allowed to establish requirements that otherwise would violate fdca provi sion if the requirement is needed to address an imminent hazard that is likely to result in serious adverse health consequences hr 4167 was passed by the house the national uniformity for food act of 2006 s 3128 was introduced with several changes from the house passed version senate hearing was

and discusses the potential impact of hr 4167 and s 3128 it will be updated as new action is taken on fu ture legislation brief history of food safety labeling legislation during the 1800s early food law in the united states began in towns followed by cities counties and st ates all of which enacted requirements that initially addressed concerns bout economic fraud and then food safety problems while food was produced and consumed locally these requirements were ad equate for providing consumer protection but as the country gr ew and food began to travel in interstate commerce individual state requirements were frequently different and sometimes in conflict and so product in compliance with labeling ndor safety requirements in one state would not be in compliance in another state there also was recognition that nutrient and food safety requirements generally were the same for most citizens in 1906 the pure food and drug law act the first federal statute administered by the food and drug administrati on fda defined which products were considered to be foods nd regulated the adulteration and misbranding of these products the meat inspection act of 1906 granted the us department of agriculture the power to conduct sanitary inspections in meat packing plants passage of the federal food drug and co smetic act of 1938 fdca gave fda further authority over most food regula tion including providing series of definitions elaborating on the concepts of adulteration and misbr anding control over all labeling of foods traveling in interstate commer ce detailed regulation of issues concerned with safety and wholesomen ess of foods and enforcement remedies available to the agency when neede d since 1938 fdca has been amended numerous times to address various food safe ty and nutrition issues as science and regulation have evolved fr equently state and local requirements were the source of national standards and fede ral requirements that subseque ntly were adopted for the entire country nevertheless national uniformity has not been achieved becausehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33559crs2 1 letter to member of congress on hr 4167 the national uniformity

proposition 65 in 1986 proposition 65 the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986 was approved in ca lifornia voter referendum this consumer protection measure requires manufacturers to provide clear and reasonable warnings on products that contain chemicals listed by the stat of california as reproductive toxins or carcinogens the warnings apply to occ upational exposures ambient environmental exposures and exposures from consumer pr oducts including foods while foods in compliance with existing administrative standards would be expected to be unaffected by these provisions the warnings would be required on food that contains or was exposed to chemicals known to cause cancer or birth defects at levels that pose significant risk prop 65 labeling for food requires among other things manufacturers to prove that their plastic packaging does not contain harmful levels of carcinogens eg benzene elimina tion of prop 65 for food packaging would remove barrier for manufacturers who must currently demonstrate that chemicals in the plastic do not leach into food at leve ls that would cause concern the statute has had wider impact in eliminating th use of certain hazardous chemicals altogether since its adoption prop 65 has been critic ized by the food industry because of its potential impact on food labeling howeve r to date there is evidence of problem affecting food manufacturer who was required to provide different information on labels of the same product sold in different states as result of the prop 651 nevertheless since it passage the food industry has sought to get prop 65 overturned in california or preempted by federal st atute requiring uniform food safety labeling it has also opposed passa ge of bills similar to prop 65 in states

states to petition fda fo r an exemption from preemption provided it would not be in violation of any app licable federal require ment or unduly burden interstate commerce and so long as it addressed particular need not met by the requirements of the act at the time many state requirements that were preempted had been on the books for decades and had never been rescinded even though many requirements were l onger being enforced during legislative consideration of nlea food and grocery organizations voiced concern about the complex array of state and local food safety laws and regulations that required their compliance5 these groups argued that national uniformity for food safety requirements both safety standard s and labeling was needed as much as nutrition labeling uniformity was needed while national uniformity for food safety provisions was in itially included in bill language the final act contained an exemption from nati onal uniformity for state food safety notification labeling requirements uniform safety labeling requirements were seen as too controversial provision at that time and threatened to undermine passage of the nutrition labeling reform which was the primary focus of the legislation as result the uniformity or preemption provi sion for food safety standards was dropped with the understanding among the intere sted parties in congress and the food industry that the issue would be taken up at later date national uniformity for food act bills concerned with food safety labeling uniformity began being introduced in 1998 in the 105th congress the national uniformity for food act of 1998 s 2356 and hr 4383 was introduced by senato r roberts and representative burr and referred to the senate committee on labor and human resources

that one of the primary goals is to preempt californi as proposition 65 and prevent s imilar requirements from being implemented in other states supporters of the legislation note that ll states would be allowed to petition the fda within 180 days of enactment to ex empt their state food safety laws from elimination under the bill and state requirements would rema in in effect while fda considers the request states could also apply to fda to nationalize their stricter state warnings if they had scientific evidence that some food or additive was hazardous and not addr essed by federal law supporters believe that the bill would continue to allow state or local entity to address emerge ncies under its imminent hazard authority the food industry an alysis estimated that only 11 state requirements would be affected by enactment of the legislation those opposed to the bills believe that it would have serious impact on the nations regulation of food safety and could jeopard ize the ability to fight bioterrorism19 opponents have expre ssed concern about the l ack of full debate on the impact of the legislation opponents argu that states are vi ewed as the primary guardians of food safety and that the bills would eliminate every state and local requirement that provided for greater cons umer protection and preempt all existing warnings about the safety of foods concern has been expressed about the in terpretation of the term identical in the bill and the phrase and for other purpos in terms of preemption and the reach of the acts provisions opponents fear that interpretation of these terms could lead to preemption of all state and local requirements including imminent hazard authority used to address emergencies an imminent hazard to the public health exists when there is sufficient evidence to show that product or practice poses significant threat of danger to health such threat creates public health situation that should be corrected immediately to prevent injury and not be permitted to continue while hearing or other form proceeding is being conducted many situations involving food safety that woul d be considered to represent an imminent hazard are identified during inspections 80 of which currently are done by state and local inspectors opponents have also raised concern about the cooperative programs for milk safety shellfish sa nitation and retail f ood protection where the states carry out compliance and enforcement activities and fda provides training standardization oversight and evaluation they believe that states might lose their legal foundation under the legislation for conducting the fda cooperative programs if all state laws were preempted fda operates these coope rative programs by providing model ordinances or codes which are not re gulations that have undergone notice and comment that states adopt into their laws and that rely on state funds licences and permit fees to support the operation of the pr ograms potentially these operations and the source of funding would be eliminated by the legislations passage requiringhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33559crs9 20 hrept 108770 suggested that state laws in

to finalize the 2003 house report estimated that 80 state laws in 37 states would be eliminated by the bills passage20 the current cbo scoring of hr 4167 only addresses the estimated costs to review petitions it does not address the costs of setting up programs that would replace the states current efforts under th eir existing laws the recent estimate by center for science in the public interest is that 220 state requirements would be affected finally opponents particularly those fro m california belie ve that the bills would prevent states from imposing warn ings against cancer or other health problems where fda has not acted or when the fdas standards are weaker than state believes is necessary to protect its citizens21 while the petition process is available many state officials view that process as very labor intensive and costly for states who choose to use it the gislation is unclear on whether states warning label would be eliminated if the federal government has similar warning while prop 65 has resulted in some warnings its californi supporters believe it has also created market incentive to rem ove dangerous chemicals from foods and to bring safer foods to market22 several questions about this legislation remain to be answered the significant difference in the estimates by cbo cspi and the food industry of the number of state requirements that potentially would be affected by the bills is indicative of the different perspectives about the legisla tions reach proponents claim that the impact of the legislation would be limited because the bills would not preempt state laws on food sanita tion inspections enforcement nutrition standards response to imminent hazards state requirements identical to federal requirements notification requirements unless requiring warnings about food safety or the safety of dietary supplements opponents believe that the bills reach would be broad and would undermine the existing food safety system and its protections including the cooperative inspection programs addressing imminent hazards and bioterrorism and would require significant stat resources to maintain the current level of protection another issue concerns the goal of national uniformity the bills would achieve national uniformity by preempting certain food safety provisions including prop65 however the number of state laws that w ould not be preempted raises the question of the degree to which national uniformity actually will be achieved by passage of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33559crs10 legislation both sides sought the july 2006 hearing on the legislation with the hope that it would provide the opportunity to help sort out the divergent views and provide clearer assessment of the legislations impact on both the issues of reach and degree of uniformity final action was taken in the senate to pass the bill before the end of the 109th congress since this issue continues to be of considerable concern to the food industry and state and federal regulators bills are likely to be reintroduced in the 110th congress new legislation may pr ovide an opportunity for proponents and opponents to previous bills to reach agr eement on legislative provisions and achieve passage in the 110th congress
