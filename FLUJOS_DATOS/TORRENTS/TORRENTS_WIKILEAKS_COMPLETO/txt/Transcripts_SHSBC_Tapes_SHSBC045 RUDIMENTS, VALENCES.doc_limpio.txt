rudiments valences lecture given on 17 august 1961 hello okay this is 17 august ad 11 and i had very nice lecture to give you today and im not kidding you i had it all taped and was going to explain to you all about valences instead of that im going to rack up an overt on auditors because ive just caught you out man have i caught you out all summer long we have had one godawful problem why the hell cant you find goal on pc when it takes one hour and fifteen minutes to find the goal and the terminal and it takes mary sue about two and half hours why cant you find goal on pc and now i know why and im going to twirl my long black mustache and look right down your throat there is phenomenon that an emeter ceases to register in the presence of an outrudiment the emeter tone arm will cease to register on any process you are running when rudiment goes out you can be fooled by thinking process is flat when actually all that is wrong is that youve got rudiment out the tone arm will cease to move the needle will cease to move everything will cease to move except the rudiment that is out that will move in other words if you ask for the rudiment that was out youll get response on the needle but all other things in the presence of an out rudiment do not move now can you get that real clear all right youve got mr pc and mr pc is moving very well on the tone arm and the needle is moving very well and suddenly the tone arm slows down and stops and it stays stopped for twenty minutes so you say the process is flat flat my hat rudiment went out which caused the process longer to operate the only thing which will now operate is the out rudiment now if you get the rudiment off that has gone wrong and you get that rudiment in promptly and properly the process will now pick up the motion of the tone arm and will now in addition to that move the needle you got that now now dont make mistake on this because this is the most important part of auditing there can be there is more important part of auditing than what im telling you right this minute process can appear to be flat just because rudiments out youre running how often have you failed to leave something and all of sudden why its sitting there at 40 and it just sits there at 40 and it just doesnt move and then you say well thats the end of the process haha mmmmm rrrrtf aw you had rudiment out and the process appeared to go flat and the process was not flat at all and the only thing which will now move the emeter is the outrudiment you can find the rudiment the rudiment now will operate but its the only thing thatll operate the emeter arc break present time problem something wrong in the environment these various rudiments you see will move the emeter you flatten that with rudiments process then you move back over onto your process and what do you know this process that was so flat is not flat at all but it wobbles the tone arm and it lets the needle fly around and so forth and there it is so two things have been happening and this will become more horrible to you as i go along i think very often auditors not just here im not scolding you here youre better supervised here than elsewhere but im talking about auditors elsewhere in other classes in other areas in hgcs and so forth heres where your hgc clears arent getting made right here on this exact point im telling you these people are leaving prehav level processes unflat on the pc thats on the running of it just because they get the rudiments out then the prehav level looks unflat so they assess for new level ah but the old level isnt flat so of course the pc doesnt go anyplace so they just grind and then they not flatten the next level you see and then not flatten the next level and then not flatten the next level and we just go on grind grind grind grind do you see what can happen here you got that have you really got that audience yes you really see this audience yes all right the same thing will happen on goals assessment and i think your preclears goals lies in the first hundred and fifty goals the pc gave you and i think it is knocked out by an arc break and i think the pcs goal has already been given to you long ago and now appears to be flat because its arc broken out of existence by some technical flub thems hard words but i think i could take any person in this unit and in the matter of few minutes get the arc break off by auditing off the auditor who is doing the assessment and find in the first hundred and fifty or two hundred goals on the list that one of those goals is still alive and is still sticking and wont go out interesting i think i could do it with every person not only here but australia america anybody whos had trouble finding goal i think that is it i may be wrong because ive not put this immediately to test i do know that i could find your goals but i am pretty sure this is the phenomena thats getting in your road and you know what makes sure because there is something there is something in the south african regimen of goals assessment that hasnt been in any other unit or course and what is it i made sure that they had every student there checking the rudiments on every other students pc regularly and continuously isnt that right and it arent been done since so the answer must be rudiments there is the one difference and thats why i think that is the difference follow seem logical audience yes that if everybody every twentyfour hours or something like that was vetting rudiments checked by another auditor on his pc and that they were always finding them out and that this isnt now being done anyplace piece of the lineup has been knocked out if the director of processing of central organization does not every single day check the rudiments on every pc in the shop hes knucklehead well hes friend of mine but hes still knucklehead because in the first place the pc very often doesnt go live for the auditor easily on the rudiment where he will go live for another person on the rudiment and you can sit there and you can say to the pc do you have an arc break present time problem is it all right if i audit you and so forth have you got withhold and so on and theyre all apparently null and then somebody else walks in on the thing and says you got present time problem withhold an arc break kawooww theyre all live you should have seen richard halperns face one day when i took one of his pcs and found every rudiment falling off the pin but he said to plaintively but he said to i just checked those fifteen minutes ago and they were all in and its true he didnt get fall on them fifteen minutes before isnt that interesting all right two auditors should always audit as team auditors shouldnt be out in the brush country of lower south slobovia upper north manitowoc wisconsin auditing by themselves anyway auditors ought to audit in pairs wolves should run in packs auditors should go in pairs oh i didnt mean there was any comparison between the two i didnt say mice anyway auditing in pairs should check the rudiments on each others pcs every session sounds arduous doesnt it sounds like an awful lot of administration doesnt it sounds like an awful lot of people falling over an awful lot of chairs and so forth well actually you dont have to do it very formally in an auditing session you can almost lean the guy up against the mantelpiece prop the meter on the mantelpiece and say all right take ahold of the cans now do you have an arc break with your auditor do you have been audited with present time problem is it all right if youre audited in that auditing room do you have any withholds from the auditor or anybody else including and so forth fall fall fall well you dont do anything about them you say joe joe get on the ball the rudiments are out on your pc well which one all of them oh you know that kind of response its new look the soothing drone of the auditors voice has not got the pc into super control where he mustnt be out of order get the idea that was in the south african lineup and jean im sure did it as matter of fact she had two cases that were banging her head in and she finally herself in person went in and theyve been running null on present time problems do you have present time problem oh and they did it all the weeks of the course and she extended the course over week just to make sure that it was better and she grabbed hold of the meter on them and she found both of them had such fabulous present time problems that each one of them broke down and wept the second she put her finger on the present time problem ah theyd been audited but she was saying routine 1 does not work you see and something else is going on here we must be doing something you know yeah they were running routine 1 but it should have been picked up during the security checking but it wasnt picked up in the rudiments on the security check dont you see and so those people had actually gone six and seven weeks without anybody probing in to find out if there was something wrong with the pt problem and there was something wrong with the pt problem and that comprised almost 50 percent of her class do i make an impression on you audience yes all right out of kindness to the pc and yourself for heaven sakes start crosschecking rudiments kanow see start crosschecking rudiments by which i mean get somebody else to check the rudiments on your pc you check them perfectly soundly and run your sessions just as before but always get somebody else to crosscheck the rudiments on pc you got it and do it often do it frequently if not every session at least every couple of sessions for heaven sakes see now ill tell you what you do with these endless goals lists i could tell you what you do in colloquial marine fashion but im not going to tell you that you get youself the auditor off of the case that is to say you go on auditing case but just get any charge that you may have built up on this case with your goals assessment off run yourself on the prehav scale we dont care how see in other words get that get that flat and then take the original goals list the original and find out if any of them are still alive and work it over and find out if theres been an arc break around any of these goals and so forth get slippy about it im tired of giving you mechanical robot activity its time you graduated up into body class ii half human half robot okay now lets just work over that original list and lets find out what is there you know i know at least one person who probably is spooked because mary sue operating i think with another auditor shook that down in part of an afternoon and i think this pc doesnt trust his goal or terminal because it was that easy it was that fast you see it was that quick and everybody else takes so long well of course it must be something wrong with that particular terminal and goal theres nothing wrong with that terminal and goal nothing at all they were running just dandy there might be an unflat level someplace on the past run but that would be about the only thing actually past run has been little bit lengthy so i would suspect there was rudiment out on the run not on the assessment and id check that over very carefully but get your rudiments checked get your rudiments checked well get them crisscrossed get somebody else to check the rudiments on your pc and thats going to speed up all this nonsense about assessment and dont be so anxious to rub out goals youre trying to find goal youre not trying to erase all the fellows goals now it doesnt take very long to find goal on pc just disabuse yourself from that it just doesnt williams was almost staggered into the who was the the wife the wife of lot that went into pillar of salt out of frozen shock from watching sodom and gomorrah go boom or something ive forgotten its some fairy tale and anyway he turned in he went to australia and he started his course and everything was running all along and he practically turned into pillar of salt from shock at the length of time it was taking these goals to be assessed because it never happened to him in aus in south africa well i was riding him awful close and we were and that was the missing factor and im sure it hasnt been done since the american acc managed to go all the way its length with tremendous gains tremendous gains great deal of instruction took place everything was fine all the students happy and without one single goal being sound in six weeks record man well they werent crosschecking rudiments thats for sure so put that in as part of your auditing rundown because it is missing piece when we had all these gains and got all this stuff whizzing and going down in south africa here in this spring that was part of the rundown is everybody was checking everybody elses rudiments isnt that right how often did they do it female voice we did it every two days every two days they checked the other fellows pcs rudiments im sure it hasnt been done since you get these little tiny pieces of stuff that get left out of the pudding you know its beautiful pudding its beautiful pudding except nobody put any yeast in it or anything see it just lies there like pancake all right that was part of the rundown rudiments out means goals assessment not done now ive given you some other tricky ways of getting around goals assessment theres lot of this hasnt been in vain by long ways because youve learned lot of tricky ways of getting goals and all that sort of thing you know more about that now and ive had to dig up lot more about that and thats had to be articulated from one end to the other but i am sure just as sure as im sitting here and just as sure as theres body in this chair im pretty sure of that that it is simply matter of you get the rudiments out maybe on one or two goals just as slightly as that you see youre going on down the line erasing goals and you get the rudiments out on goal and then out on another goal and maybe one of those goals was it you see and you get the rudiments out and then maybe on the remainder of the list why of course they all null with great speed because the pc is chopped up or arc broke or got pt problem youve got in other words an inoperative emeter on the subject of goals itd be very operative on the subject of rudiments but its very inoperative on the subject of goals now if this isnt correct and if this doesnt bear fruit i will find out why dont worry but im pretty sure that this is it and what makes sure is it is the one piece of stuff that was missing from the south african course that was missing and its now missing here at saint hill and its now missing in australia im sure and it certainly was missing over in washington i am sure see its the missing item somebody else looking over your shoulder and checking the rudiments on the pc repetitively and often making sure that those things are in okay you have whiz at it here and you go back over that goals list that was first given to you or that you first got and you cover that list again after you have gotten any possibility of an arc break off or present time problem off or anything else off or any anxiety off or having finding ones goal as present time problem off you got it just get all of those things straight as straight as straight as straight even if you have to run yourself on the prehav scale dont you see on off the pc and im sure that youre going to find the goal was in the first couple of hundred you hear all right im pretty sure this is the case because you see im not having the trouble youre having in finding goals and terminals im just not having this trouble and its just something that has got saying what how how are they managing this what has entered into this well now heres another oddity i get goals and terminals without checking the rudiments hm youve seen do it repetitively but you can assign that to altitude because im in uncertain toned voice when im getting off goals and terminals is it this is it that is it the other thing you know bang bang bangbangbangbang so on theres great deal of certainty concerning this and also it doesnt seem to be very important i dont make it very important but ive even said to the fellow well do you have arc breaks and that sort of thing and the guy said oh yes yes yeah yeah do you have any overts on oh yes something like that well skip it so that is an invalidative part of this analysis but i think if you look this over very very carefully i think you will find that that will deliver into your paws i think you have slid over the goal and i think long since its in the background because youre also doing something else which is wrong as wrong as wrong you are asking for more goals before you go over the goals list at the beginning of every session see i never want any more goals off the pc i got enough after hes given after ive gotten writers cramp writing fifty or sixty of the things i got enough goals its almost by postulate one of those is going to be it you know 1 should be careful saying that because youll think i mean it but i just sort of look him over you know and hmhmhm one of these is it one of these is it must be but then there is this factor is ive actually never known pc to lie to when i ask them for something they deliver see which is all i mean by altitude i say what were your childhood goals burrhm thank you burrhm thank you burrhm thank you burrhm thank you all right thats good now what are your antisocial goals you know like burning down the town or something like this burrhm thank you burrhm thank you burrhm thank you all right now what artistic professional goals did you ever have well burrhm thats it burrhp thats it oh thats enough to hell with the rest of them i dont want him to have an artistic goal anyhow and then i say all right now what withheld goals do you have that you just wouldnt ever dare tell anybody about burrhm 1 hank you burrhm thank you burrhm thank you i wind up with list of thirty forty fifty sixty seventy eighty something of this character thats it i dont look over more goals now the difference is that because everybody was chewed away from this we had more methodology invented than was actually being employed originally on goals assessments and the original goals assessment it was quite odd that the one goal you made fall there actually will continue to fall thats quite discovery but its true but you dont even have to do it theres one goal there going to fall more than the rest of them and thatll continue to fall unless you get an arc break in the road you understand of course this thing altitude is one factor but only one factor of holding pc in session while you are doing goals assessment and you can hold him in session like he felt he was cast in concrete you know it just doesnt ever occur to him to have present time problem or an arc break thats about the thats the real secret of auditing if you yourself are sufficiently matter of fact sufficiently relaxed sufficiently in control of the situation and know your business well enough there is never any doubt enters your pcs mind from one end of the session to the other but what he should be sitting there getting audited but if theres bunch of doubts around then youve got to keep your rudiments clean clean clean so just as they have large fortyseven foot wastebasket at times square its cast your ballot here for clean new york i think thats awfully cute fortyseven foot wastebasket thats just what times square wants i can see it now it was so outrageous that bunch of businessmen have now chipped in to make park and grass plot and so forth there and so on but just with that type of corny corny corny advertising we should hang up little signs all over hgcs and classes and so forth keep your rudiments clean for clear pretty corny but its true now the amount of importance which you are giving an assessment is quite interesting but person can be assessed straight through to clear by assessment by elimination providing the rudiments are all in if you use the other data which i have now dug up and given you that is get all the notknows out about it and find out why he had the goal and so forth another another side of the coin an entirely different side of the coin okay you had enough hell for one day you mean you havent female voice did you say hell or help just hell go back over and check it and i think youll find its true that your pcs goal long occurred long time ago for running i think so this would be the only way that you possibly have missed somewhere theres the other road and the other road is you can assess pc straight through to clear you get rid of all of his goals he comes out at the other end you get rid of all of his terminals and so forth and he comes out at the other end and thats thats it that can happen too apparently theyre practically two different processes and now i will give you the lecture i was going to give you today all right audience hmhm well this is an important lecture it summates the findings of great many of years and particularly great many of the findings of this summer and the name of this lecture is valences and i should start it with definition of valence there are several types of valences in some other old pab youll find them classified into various types but valence is synthetic beingness at best or it is beingness what the pc is not but is pretending to be or thinks he is now that beingness could have been created for him by duplication of an existing beingness or synthetic which was proper term beingness built up by the descriptions of somebody else that just as horatio alger jr built up synthetic beingness called local boy makes good by hanging on the coattails of rich man which was his total motif synthetic beingness could be created which everybody would believe in and try to become or mama can run papa down so continuously that junior never under any circumstances ever meets papa or sees papa but becomes the synthetic beingness of papa all of which is an interesting thing one of the basics of this by the way is the first lecture of the first congress i ever gave in england that theres tape on this its what you think the other fellow is not what he is that is the other fellows your trouble with the other fellow now this is valence valence is then an artificial beingness of some kind or another but with that we dont have factually own valence there is such thing as ones own valence this was thrashed out in 1950 and went loose through the middle of the fifties and people refer to it and i may have even said it few times his own valence so forth but it is not correct it is just not correct because persons own valence is silliness that is silly statement because person is himself or in valence you see its one or the other he is either himself or in valence now valence is package and one of the earliest observations concerning this when i started to come to grips with this thing we now call profile or graph i analyzed it from all sides and came to just one conclusion regarding it and that is that it was picture of valence and that is all that graph is its picture of valence and any change that you got on pc was because you shifted his valence now youve already read that years ago its an old datum but now it merges up into first order of importance pardon it shoulders its way up through other data to stand on top as kingofthemountain datum thats picture of valence and youre never going to get another picture until youve done something about valences on the person and this boils down to this didactic statement which can now be made which makes this very important lecture the pc will not gain in any way shape or form through any effort to alter the characteristics of valence swallow that one because its very important statement and it s very factual statement pc will not change in any way by reason of processes which seek to alter the characteristics of the valence he is in hes in the valence of an ogre all right youre going to change the characteristics of the ogre and this is going to make better pc nono nono nono the pc will alter only if you change the valence as whole package and why is this its because the pc cannot take any responsibility whatsoever for any of the package of characteristics known as valence they are somebody elses and he takes responsibility for any of these nowimsupposedtos that go and make up this package called valence streetcar conductor of course as valence has number of now imsupposedtos right there he is dingdonging up and down the line letting on the passengers and taking first crack at the nickels and sixpences and after that the company gets whats left and whatever it is that the streetcar conductor is doing hes got nowimsupposedto hes supposed to get up in the morning he is supposed to go to work he is supposed to see the passengers on and off and he is supposed to collect the fares and make change you see nowimsupposedtos nowimsupposed tos hes supposed to wear cap hes supposed to wear uniform you get the idea i am supposed to i am supposed to i am supposed to all right now somebody gets into the valence of streetcar conductor and all of these nowimsupposedtos are now the nowim supposedtos of streetcar conductor theyre not anything that can be touched or reached by the person all the person could reach is the knowingness or identity called streetcar conductor now lets get down and find out what use does thetan make of valence this is the only use he makes of valence survival the road out the modus operandi of getting on in life surmounted by knowingness valence is solid knowingness body is solid knowingness you see streetcar conductor you know he is streetcar conductor so therefore all valences are knowingnesses theyre an effort to get somebody else to know that youre there and efforts to get somebody else to recognize something and therefore they are road out they are road out of unwanted areas this fellow is slogging around in the mud firing off mannlichers lebels leeenfields springfields garand markets or whatever other asinine thing the infantry is supposed to do and just as he catches the trench mortar in the midriff he discovers he does not want to be there he is in the wrong valence called soldier wrong valence that knowingness is now invalidated it must become not knowingness so he exteriorizes and he says the only way to fight war is as general obvious isnt it so his next lifetime hes going be general ill give you big joke on with regard to this sort of thing i always said that in the event of another war id be war correspondent id be sitting there with blonde on each knee and bottle of whiskey in front of and typewriter real tough picture you know i used to tell my friends this around new york city and id wed hear the horns go and then i would lean over and say sit over on the settee moment honey and i would pound out on the typewriter our brave boys today went over the top you see and put it on the wires to associated press but some of my friends had bad luck in the ethiopian war and so on so when the war came along i didnt do that but nevertheless thats just an example you know the trench mortar catches him in the midriff and he says in the next war he says i had better be war correspondent because the last war correspondent i saw was in that nice thick dugout eight miles to the rear of the front lines you got the idea he says thats the thing to be you see thats dandy so the next war comes along and he tries to be this thing and he cant be this thing so hes very unhappy about the whole thing he cant be this war correspondent but he tries and how he will go on long cycle of tryingnesses if this is really one of these plowedin sort of valence pictures not as not just joke as mine was and hes trying like mad and hell go war after war you know life after life and somehow or another hell eventually familiarize himself enough with the tools of the trade and sure enough war comes along and so help pete he gets to sit in this dugout and pound out this deathless line our brave boys today went over the top see while hes sitting there all right thats fine thats fine he goes along like that is very successful time goes on you see and they have run out of war criminals by few lifetimes later you see theyve run out of war criminals utterly theyve hanged everybody you see and they find out they can longer charge presidents kings and things and generals with starting wars so they assume quite probably quite rightly that its the fault of the press so immediately after this war the fifteenth life that hes been war correspondent he finds much to his horror that all war correspondents are now being arrested and being shot in painful manner so just at the moment when twelve bullets straight and true hit him in the chest he decides he had better not be war correspondent anymore this is something he had better not be so he decides that the best thing to be in war is mata hari you see or something like this so over years then and ages and so on hell go on working uphill and upgrade to solve this confusing problem called war to become mata hari you see he learns how to be woman you see and he keeps picking up female bodies and he becomes enticing one way or the other and he gets himself well endured to certain horizontal activities and excuse my french but he moves on up the line and he finally makes it you see and then lifetime after lifetime why hes just happy as clam here being mata hari and every time theres war why he immediately becomes an espionage agent and everything is just dandy and time goes on and so forth and then he finds out that the g2s of all of the armies this one particular war have gotten together and found out that this is how all of their information is getting across the lines so every person who is camp follower vivandiere call girl anything associated with it ever looks at general is promptly picked up and shot and as she stands there in the courtyard you see with twelve bullets going through her chest she decides at that moment to be nothing after that but peacemonger now thats the thing to be peacemonger you get the idea still trying to solve this silly problem you see valence valence valence valence valences are calculated to do something they are calculated to solve problem and every valence picked up is solution to problem so therefore you can say if youll excuse my rough talk that these identities as they are passed by on the track are old antiquated solutions to confusions theyre antiquated solutions to confusions now the goals which go toward beingness are of course the much more definite goal and the goal which is much more profitable in auditing is the beingness goal because it goes at once toward identity now person is not himself he is different knowingness the moment that he is valence and the auditing truth which emerges is this you can patch up valences broken leg providing the valence is supposed to have nonbroken legs got the idea and if your auditing of valence does not violate any of the vital nowimsupposedtos of the valence itll work therefore you can do assists on almost anybody but every once in while theyre bemused and amazed on an assist that should have worked but it didnt work it worked on everybody else but it didnt work on this particular person well you can chalk it up just to this and this alone this alone you have violated nowimsupposedto of that valence and the pc can do nothing about these nowimsupposedtos they are not under his control so your effort to patch up the broken leg was of valence and the valence oddly enough was crippled war veteran well crippled war veteran is supposed to have broken legs so of course you get nowhere you break your heart you know you say whats all this well what all this is is youre auditing hidden valence now any pc is being dominantly at any given time one valence but may be tortured or upset by other valences which are the only the concern of the valence he is being so any pcs troubles are only the troubles of the valence in which he is and those are pcs troubles and the troubles of the valence are part and parcel of the nowimsupposedtos of the valence so this tells you bluntly and obliquely and straightly and helicopterly that there aint remedy of valences difficulties there just is such thing as being able to take valence and remedy the difficulties of valence you can get rid of valence but you cant get rid of the difficulties of valence because they are outside the power of the pc to touch because theyre nowimsupposedtos which belong to something else which he doesnt fully control called valence so we take girl who is all geared up shes all geared up shes carefully grooved in war by war you see shes carefully grooved in and she knows the proper solution of this and if another war comes along she knows what she should do shes got this solved you see mata hari and she just is horrible to get withhold off of but shes awfully good in getting secrets off you she seems to have total promiscuity as viewpoint something thats incomprehensible and affair she ever has seems to have any real point to it thats so mysterious and you try to figure this thing out and of course you have not got the key to the closet so what skeleton is in it must remain therefore mystery the key to this closet of course is in event of another war shes going to be mata hari and war is so dangerous that she mustnt let go of any part of this solution but she would like to feel better you get the anomaly about it shed like to feel better but she cant let go of any of the things that are wrong so you get this oddity of please audit but you better not make well thats what it looks like but actually its you better get over the bumps so i can take care of myself without having to be mata hari in the next war dont you see these holes that keep appearing and disappearing on my chest while youre auditing tell that i had better not be anything but mata hari in the next war so youll sometimes have somatic turn on in pc and go off and turn on and go off and turn on and go off and turn on you never seem to be able to get rid of it its part of valence package that keeps them from becoming something else and they know better than to become that see and so theyll actually keep around the somatic to the degree that they can to prevent themselves from becoming an unworkable solution to future problem so this girls attitude toward men is unresolvable because its part and parcel of survival and just as you would be able to get your head torn off or get somebody very upset by you by walking in on grizzly bear and taking his rations away from him dont try to take that solution away from pc so long as it seems absolutely vital that it be solution what youve got to do quite on the contrary is to get the pc to face up to the various factors which make that valence i wander afield the only point im trying to make with you is just this one single devastating point just one and that is you cannot make valence well you can move valence so this tells you that any process run at random on pc has very small chance of success you take mr and you say all right now were going to solve your ideas about problems mr and were going to set you up mr so that you can reach and withdraw mr and were going to get you over breaking your legs mr and were going to get rid of those funny red marks that appear and disappear on your chest mr ah but the trick is youre not auditing mr youre auditing luckless person who has it all taped in the next war to be mata hari but hes man so this life is total loss as far as hes concerned wrong sex wrong wrong orientation for proper solution to the goal and if war came along he would be utterly flabbergasted because he could just see himself drifting back into this war correspondent who of course is blamed for his war crime okay moue valences dont audit them now that just strips down your bag of tricks as the effective bag of tricks to very small bag the really effective tricks this preselects them for you left and right is this process going to change familiarize accustom the person to identity or is it going to handle environments which make identities vital or is it going to alter in other words valences if this process is going to alter valences it will work and work rather rapidly and smoothly and stay worked and if it is not going to alter valences it is not going to work and it is not going to stay well and solved do you follow there thats big piece of information all in one batch now what makes valence stick the way it sticks what makes valence stick the way it sticks let us define psychotic lets newly define psychotic in terms of knowingness psychotic does not know what is going on in his environment and does not know what is going on inside himself it is all unknown and therefore unobservational unobserved he doesnt know whats happening inside himself and he doesnt know whats happening with himself and he doesnt know whats happening where he is and he doesnt know whats happening in front of him or behind him at any given time of the day or night this is the one common denominator of all psychosis not knowingness what is happening around him in his environment and not knowing what is happening where he is now lets take neurosis neurosis is hes got some idea whats happening where he is on some things and some faint idea whats happening in his environment on some things but generally unknowingness overbalances the knowingness and so you get neurosis now lets move it up scale little bit and lets take you you know whats happening where you are but you dont know whats happening in somebody else few feet away exactly whats happening at all times of the day and night you dont always know whats going on with everybody you got the idea so that makes slight unknownness doesnt it so just look it over now just get this as pictorial picture just as something to be graphed very easily there you sit right where you are and you know what you are you know where you are and youve got good idea what youre doing right where you are all right now lets take it to extreme do you know what is happening hundred miles straight ahead of you all right do you know whats happening three feet straight ahead of you yeah in this particular instance you do do you know what has happened within few feet of you all of your life at all times of your life oh theres some spots in your life where you didnt know what was going on few feet away you did know what you were doing but you didnt know what was going on there is that right all right those are the stuck spots of your track because its disagreement total disagreement you knew facing an unknown see its know versus an unknown and these two things are out of agreement you never be surprised whole bunch of cheerful idiots all of whom are stupid and they all know everybody is stupid you know they get along beautifully look at communist cell sometime theyre all happy and they all know theyre stupid you know but if fellow gets up to point where he has the least power of observation of any kind whatsoever he starts to run into this one and that is immediately in his perimeter there are things he doesnt know which makes an inequality well now these unknowingnesses can get so overwhelming that one will adopt valence to resolve them hell pick up valence which knows about these things they do it so often that in the united states great many of the scientists today are content to let the valence know everything that scientist should do and know i got the polar my polar times this afternoon and its got bunch of pictures in it and of course the polar regions are now being absolutely infiltrated and butted into and so on everybody is charging into the polar regions and anybody who is member of the polar society gets to know all about what snowdrifts theyre jumping into now and man let tell you theyre really jumping into lot of snowdrifts the boys are having ball and heres photograph heres photograph and heres bunch of perfectly valid human beings but theyve just invented motor that will chew up snow its tenhorsepower motor and fan blade goes underneath the snowbank and it just keeps chewing up snow and its all very nice and so forth but you look at the guy who is standing there posing with the picture you see of it and he is scientist one way or the other he isnt doing anything hes testing it and in all the midst of all these parkas and everything here is the perfect mockup you see up there at about 89 degrees north heres the perfect mockup of scientist theyve got to have the old school tie theyve got to have their diploma signed just right theyve got to have all of these various things theyve got to be just so theyve got to belong to the right societies in order to be these things and they get that that beingness has got to be just exact you know it mustnt vary hair and if anybody comes along and thinks thought in the field of science who doesnt have this exact beingness these boys almost go mad they just go berserk why also this doesnt add up the boys who invented most of the civilization in which we are now confusedly involved and who laid the fundamentals of it were not one of them scientists firestone ford you know edison these birds were about as far as you could get from this particular mockup but this other mockup is kind of whole track mockup actually theyve got scientist all mixed up with technician oh yes good scientist always demands of his technician that he have the right old school tie and that sort of thing because he doesnt want him running off with the uranium pot but its sort of body running without head now because theyre calling scientists technicians and that sort of thing you know its all messed up but its an exact beingness its an exact beingness and the moment you try to shake that beingness even the least little bit and you just by question you know yeah i asked one time i asked scientist who was being hired at vast expense on government project to develop jet propulsion atomic jet propulsion and i said well have you ever made up an orifice an optimum orifice pressure table for jet orifices well this would be the most fundamental thing you would ever dream up if you were doing jet propulsion job you see because it says how big is the cylinder and how fast must the velocity of particles go out of the cylinder to give you the maximum horsepower foot pounds of thrust and this bird was absolutely turned into screaming squirming jelly they hadnt done it you see they were still using the chicago fire departments hose tables and i had suddenly inadvertently exposed to view you see the fact that they were being about as thorough you see as somebody throwing bits of paper in the wind and i actually wasnt trying to invalidate the boy but he just went all to pieces and he became absolutely savage about just real bitter you know because obviously hes living the life of mockup you see youve got the right old school tie hes got the right letters hes got the right this hes got the right that he is at right desk he is wearing the right pipe he is you know hes got it all taped he reads the right papers and everything else but of course he isnt doing anything see all he is is package of nowimsupposedtos operating with chicago fire departments hose pressure tables this becomes very solid valence they seldom send the scientists out to fight the wars by the way and it could be just another mata hari dodge you see but the guy evidently really isnt thinking up anything he really isnt adding anything hes adding up figures and standing around and posing with one of the hard cases in the parka you see is the fellow who set this snow eradicator going and then stepped aside so the scientist could pose there by it you see manipulating it marvelous you can see on all sides of you these outrageously artificial valences which are pretended valences and you see the level of pretence of the valence and when you see it to that degree of course it immediately becomes spotted for you and you say haha yeah thats very artificial ahhhh but suzy glutz sits down and she is not in this type of artificiality and you say she is real yeah george aloysius doakes sits down and you say he is real see pretence here this man is downright matter of fact well maybe thats the valence downright matteroffact hes identified himself hasnt he well if hes identified himself by bunch of tricks such as clothes hat well you must be looking at valence you must be looking at valence and package of valences now the obvious valence that the fellow has body does not necessarily condemn him at all its the valence that he is being and is using the body to be that is the auditing target so human being has body all right so thetan has body and its following the current mode well this doesnt actually make valence you know its not plowed in its not below his level of consciousness hes just soared down from arcturus and he picked up body and hes walking it around and he sits down now you say to him who are you and he says well im im x54 and just came in from arcturus the only trace of valence there is x54 because he knows it see but of course psychiatrist would lock him up ive always been going to write another ole doc methuselah story you know about this type of crisscross anyway what i mean by valence as far as an auditing target is concerned is more or less the mentalimagepicture package which the person has composed to resolve the problems of existence which he doesnt know anything about he knows practically nothing of this valence he cannot really identify the valence he has fixed it up so that it is really unknown and really hidden because this thing apparently was surviving and it was totally unknown to him he picked up the package and hes going on with the package because its survival package this hes fairly sure of he notices that this drunken bum uncle of his who flops around all over the place and gets sick regularly saturday night all over the living room floor is cared for he doesnt have to work everybody steps very light in his vicinity he is just leading perfectly easy wonderful survival life and then we wonder why the little boy in the family all of sudden grows up and is practically his exact image well one he doesnt know why this fellow is leading this life you see and two hes got all sorts of confusions himself that this fellow doesnt seem to have so to escape from his own confusions he could pick up the valence of this stumblebum uncle you see and its always easier to pick up weaker valence than stronger one so your more logical target is the weaker valence now if the pc has bunch of chronic somatics of one kind or another these are part of the valence picture these are not the pc these are part of the valence picture so somatics are part of the valence picture somatics are not part of the pc theres even the mechanics of this has been worked out some years ago i worked it out so youve got to have actually two identities counteropposed in order to get smush and to keep valence in youve got to have couple of identities pinned up in other words youve got the pc being himself versus this thing in order to feel pain pain phenomenon has to be highly artificialized in other words to hurt why youve got to have couple of valences kicking around which are this way and that i wont go into the torturous methodology of how this was worked out i think it was washington 1957 but it works like this this fellow to have experience he says to himself he will have to survive this is the way hes got it worked out backwards to have experience hell have to survive to survive he has to be this package youve got somebody whos convinced that he could not survive as himself or experience as himself he has to be something else in order to experience he has to be something else in order to survive he has to be something else in order to lye and he is so sold on this idea of having to be something else in order to live dont you see that you havent chance until all of sudden he realizes that he could live without it and of course his total game or his games condition is the know notknow havecanthave bedontbe dodontdo arrangements of this particular valence and thats its relationship to some environment and of course the tragedy of it is its usually measured up for an environment which longer exists you get the boys going around the teddy boys you know or the edwardian jackets you know that sort of thing they think this is pretty good theyve got themselves all rigged up now you get the other crew thats going around these days in the slick motorcycle jackets these leather motorcycle jackets you see theyre all rigged up to live in space opera of course theyre just waiting theyre just waiting russia and the united states are going to have ball sooner or later and theyre turning into space societies now the like of which you never heard of you know socialism all these things are part of these balanced economy slave dictatorships and theyre getting themselves all fixed up to be rocket jockeys theyre going around acting like they ought to act you see if the society were space opera society well theyre getting familiar with it and theyre getting in practice and thatll be very good solution its true too youll be able to put them in spaceship and say all right arcturus or bust you see and they bust and youll see these various stratas with you right now as classes youll see whole classes of things i dont know what the girls of today are being particularly i havent looked it over very thoroughly lately but i will say this i will say this that the society has got practically every woman bit out of arrangement you see because here we had perfectly nice society going along which was an agrarian society and its values male female familial they were all figured out they were all taped everybody knew where they stood you see might have been rough but everybody knew where they stood now all of sudden you have coeducation and girl sniper does for eighteen hundred germans you see and whats she supposed to be doing well she doesnt know so she picks up all kinds of oddball valences of how women fit into other types and classes of society and you find some real wild ones you know i mean not necessarily wild girl but you find offbeat valences of various kinds or another and woman tends even more so in society which is in state of flux and which hasnt instantly and immediately found specific use or need for woman at any given instant such as an agrarian society where it was all comfortable you see everything was taped now youre in society where it isnt all taped and the exact specific need for woman isnt quite manifest you know shes supposed to get married shes supposed to have children shes supposed to work now wait minute lets see shes supposed to work yeah but shes supposed to work at home not really wheres she supposed to work well she s supposed to work out and contribute her money to the family coffers aw now wait minute now wait minute this doesnt make sense now lets see how can we figure this out well the girl goes halfbalmy trying to figure this out and all of sudden says well theres much better solution you see i had much better solution 1266000 years ago and much better solution to the whole thing you see and that was to be ballet dancer yeah well theres still uses for ballet dancers thats for sure you know well there you go thats the best thing only difficulty is she cant dance at this particular time and shes going to have to go several lifetimes grooving in grooving in grooving in shell eventually pick up mockup then shell be able to carry through this ambition but right now its on sleep see it isnt manifest it doesnt solve the thing therefore shes quite unhappy about it her now imsupposedtos get thrown aside so she then picks up package of now imsupposedtos you see to get her out of situations which oddly enough she isnt in either you get how the confusion merges and how it spins around all im trying to tell you is just that youve got to find and move valences in order to straighten out cases youve got to do that and you cant straighten out case without moving valence when you have moved valence you have changed profile when you have not moved valence i dont know what youve done all right lets look this over how would you apply this directly all right fellow has toothache you dont say to him what valence would find toothache profitable you could ask him that but you could say this is just quick one you see who had toothache that was the oldest one 1950 june who had toothache bang bang bang you remember several people who had toothaches and it tends to split the valence that is more valid than putting him in communication with the tooth in his head because that isnt his toothache in the first place this tooth cant ache without another tooth aching plastered on top of it in some kind of mental image picture ahha it cant ache thats whats interesting without another picture valence splattered on top of it got it all right were going to say to this fellow all right now uhm he just keeps having this problem about cars he just cant seem to keep car every time he gets car why somebody takes it away from him one way or the other and so on all right you say when did you have difficulty with car when did cars have difficulty with you uhuh car isnt really valence could be theres some engineers ive got an engineering firm theyre very good engineering firm and both the who is about fortysomething and the old man who is close to seventy talk to you and when they start talking they start the motor and they do they say rarrarrar thats right well peter hes heard them over the phone yeah they say rarrarrar and both of them have been to the hospital for repairs lately so we might we might get someplace unexpectedly on this subject of car because it might itself be kind of valence you know but we say when did you have difficulty with car and when did cars have difficulty with you well if it was valence it would work but it would be much more profitable to say who would have difficulty with cars see who would have difficulty with cars who would have difficulty with cars describe person that would have difficulty with cars you know process it right there at be and all of sudden youd find fantastic thing all right ill give you the right and wrong one again here thats little plainer you say when have you hidden thank this guy is we find him on hide and we say when have you hidden when have you hidden when have you hidden when have you hidden when have you hidden yeah you get some kind of result and you have lot of somatics and so forth and he comes back the next day and hes got the same somatic the same package so we say when have you hidden when have you hidden when have you hidden same somatics same package the next day you well youre processing valence see he isnt there to be processed practically you see hes overwhumped in some kind of valence and the valence is supposed to hide and youd say who would find it necessary to hide who would find it necessary to hide from what confusion would who hide you know thats an awful tough one its divided splitdoublequestion but it wouldnt ordinarily be used but thats what youre trying to find out you know who would try to hide from what confusion think of somebody who is always hiding who else would be always hiding think of person who hides because that valence has got the confusion he hasnt got it but you could double it in brass and you would produce probably more bombastic results you would be processing the condition in which the fellow found himself and so forth you could go at it this way you could say what beingness would be good solution for an environment where it couldnt be what beingness would be good solution for tough environment better one we had this long time ago we had who would survive what you know that sort of thing process your whos process your valences all right now lets get little bit further and lets go upstairs little more into the high school aspects of the thing got guy with toothache all right youre going to cure this toothache youd say who would want to cure toothache and you do an assessment on terminals youd say who would have toothache who would want to cure toothache who would have toothache who would want to cure toothache who would have toothache who would want to cure toothache hes given you the goal hes got toothache and he wants it cured youve got your goal so your goal is understood so youre jumping right off from there but make sure he wants to cure this toothache you know and you just run two sides of it and do terminal assessment on the thing it might not last to terminal the thing whole thing might blow before you got terminal do you see who would have toothache who would cure toothache causeeffect line of the goal you get whole terminals list on the thing dont be bit surprised if its blown but if one of them doesnt blow youve got it youve got the valence youve got it right there bongo bongo and its real stuck valence so open up with your prehav scale and you do an assessment on that valence and you run it at that level of the prehav scale not even bothering to mention the toothache again you see youre not now running the prehav scale against tooth see youre running the prehav scale right directly and immediately against the terminal youve found so what did you do you did routine 3 operation to do an assist now if you can see that routine 3 operation can operate as an assist and is workable as an assist your faith and ability in doing goals assessments of course would increase enormously wouldnt it now if you can find hidden standard on your pc and this is quite legitimate operation having not to do with an assist having to do with present time problem you find hidden standard on your pc what would have to happen in order to know that scientology worked what would have to happen in order to know this processing was working what would have to happen oh youd get whole list of these things and youd do an assessment on the thing these are goals these are present time problems you assess them down you find one that bongs real good and real hard bangbang on the meter you see you take that one take that one all by itself and there must be goal of some kind associated with that particular hidden standard and if it isnt inherently stated in the thing that fell youre still going to have to get the terminals for it all right let us say well hes got shoulder ache and thats what it is you know and when the shoulder ache gets more why he knows hes getting worse and when the shoulder ache gets less why he knows he is winning in auditing and this is the standard he uses in order to measure his auditing worse or better on the sore shoulder good all right well you could still go at it on both ends who could have it and who could cure it who would have it and who could cure it or who would cure it or who would try to cure it or who has it if you just did an assessment on who has it you would win or if you did an assessment on who would handle them youd win you see just get your list of terminals that have to do with sore shoulders if thats what fell all right do your terminals assessment move it over onto the prehav scale and you get the terminal if the shoulder is still there and run it on the prehav scale with your rudiments in you follow this all right there would be method of handling hidden standard right using this rule of handle the valence dont handle the significances now i will say this as final word here for long long time i had the question should you handle solids or significances should you handle conditions should you handle solids and i knew even last year that you had to handle solids youd better handle solids if youre really going to get anyplace but this was not the full picture the picture is this do not handle the conditions of the valence handle the valence now that clear cut and wellstated youll find is far more workable than conditions and solids because some conditions can appear to be solid think to somebody could be black blob lets make it much more workable than this dont handle conditions of valence dont audit at those things dont say well how could you cure sor shor uh sore shoulder boy try to say that one as an auditing command and so forth and so on now reach from the shoulder withdraw even though assists work and that sort of thing this is the limitation by the way of touch assist is explained to you right there and you know how limited it is well its limitations are the limitations of the valence youre trying to cure valence of some kind or another its the valence thats got bad one not the other so the condition the condition the condition because its the condition of the valence in order to handle this thing handle the valence handle the terminal handle the terminal always handle the terminal and youve got it and this thing will wrap up and i think youll find this will hold true very very nicely and very easily now that moves prehav prehav 13 sort of an activity right up into the limelight the tremendous success you had on failed help by making long list of terminals of everybody the person had ever known in this lifetime and then assessing those down and then running on the one that seemed to be the livest failed help is of course simply expanded into this other area of you assess the terminal on the prehav scale and you not just failed help but you take any level of the prehav scale that this terminal falls on so you get prehav 13 is an exceedingly profitable type of activity if you went right at it and did it hammer and tongs you have person make list of everybody they have known in this lifetime and then you go on and add to this list the way you would do terminals assessment and you just take everybody theyve known and then you assess that list to get the one that falls the most this time now you dont assess it by elimination you just assess it by the steepest and biggest reaction you assess it by reaction of the needle and it turns out to be mama or grandpa or something of the sort all right dont pay much more attention to it doesnt matter if you miss take that particular terminal that you found by the greatest reaction and you move that particular terminal over into the prehav scale and assess that terminal on the prehav scale find out about grandpa all up and down the prehav scale and you finally find that grandpa is falling gorgeously on failed abandon and then you run fiveway on failed abandon and youve got this thing pretty well set up now that was the original prehav 13 of course you dont run any twentyminute rule with prehav 13 you run the needle quiet and the tone arm doesnt seem to be moving too much and you run the needle quiet but its just little very short period of time that you observe it do you see and then go over and take off another one take another terminal and assess this this lifetime terminals for the now livest terminal and run it on the prehav scale assess it on the prehav scale do you follow and as soon as youve got this set up run it and promptly get the charge off of that one and all youre trying to do is take charge off of these terminals one after the other and youll find your pc will make tremendous jump now pc who has always got the rudiments out should probably be run for while on prehav 13 because youre running valences youre running valences pure and simple these are the people theyre tangled with up and down the track now youll find some of those are pretty tangled and some of those might require session or two to run but the pc will emerge at the other end of this thing feeling much better always consistently and continually now when youre trying to clean an auditor off you use this same procedure you take all the auditors the fellow ever had do prehav 13 type of assessment get the auditor that falls the most move him over onto the prehav scale get the idea and then you run that level flat and you take the next auditor and any way you wanted to go about it like this you could take any scientology personnel or any people in scientology and make list and run it the same way you have another type of action and itd be very beneficial youd get all this that by the way is how you would get off all the auditing fellow ever had and also if you used all scientology persons youd get off all the auditing he d ever given too see not that youd get them both off thats for sure its an interesting thing fellow could have been run on thousand processes and all of them wrong and this rather short short activity knocks out all the auditing he ever had leaves him with the gains and takes away all the losses interesting thing to know isnt it if you do it by valences so just look at this as valid activity that anything you can do by valences is going to get you someplace and things you cant do by valences wont get you anyplace if you want lasting gains do it by valences all right now goals goals you can run lots of goals on pc one way or the other and im sure you can find goals on pc left and right but if you just ran goals goals goals goals goals for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks without finding any kind of goal at all youd never get crack at the valences you only want the goal to get you into valences see now you could probably do an entirely different type of goals assessment you could just take list of the fellows goals and find do valence assessment for each goal then check the goal and its blown up and that would be auditing by assessment do you see how youd do that youd just take list he gives you forty goals you say fine you run down the thing you find one of those things is hot well lets do terminals assessment on it right now we dont bother to erase it just do terminals assessment well the thing is going to blow up on terminals assessment youll probably never get to the prehav scale with it if you just took goal after goal find out who would do that and who would it be done to and so on and just shook down all the terminals and got him to remembering people this way and that and got the valences all stirred up on the thing even minor goal would produce considerable case change dont you see so hes got this silly goal well to eat my dinner better all right almost starting from the first goal that he gave you on the list say who would eat their dinner better and who would force somebody to eat their dinner better you know something like this and you get list of those people you know and youll find out that goal that goal is cleaned up man that cleaned up slicker than any platter he ever cleaned got the idea there would be different way of attacking this until youve got clearcut idea in your own mind of exactly what the puttogether is exactly what the puttogether is in the mind the put together is very simple thing the fellow found himself to be inadequate that must have meant that he was in some kind of an environment which was horrifying to him so he adopted beingness of some kind or another to get him out of it or to be something else dont you see this is going on but he also had goal to get him out of it so he went out of it with goal and he went out of it with beingness sort of double action was going on here now he doesnt want to go back into that again and hed just better not ever go into it again so of course you start picking up goals and you start picking up terminals and you pick up goals and you pick up terminals well you get all of his escape points and he has to look at them sooner or later he has to see how he got started along this particular was going he starts as ising bank like mad right all right ill give you one more thing one more thing here and that is you can always put notknow bracket after know bracket on the prehav scale youve got fiveway bracket and it has to do with grandpa grandfather leaving well now find out on five different legs what isnt known about grandfathers leaving you got the idea so that you run the five know the five notknow and thatll just about treble your speed of run now the mechanism by which people used to be able to recall on arc straightwire and then theyd recall the same incidents over and over again and then theyd never get any further than this they you know theyd just recall those same cycles of incidents and new incidents would turn up and you were whipped well actually what was standing in their road was the notknow the notknow what did they not know about this particular thing you see so if you were to have added notknow on any recall process of any kind whatsoever youd have plowed out more track simple well lets see youd say with whom have you communicated or recall time you communicated and then what dont you know about having communicated or what communication dont you know about and youd find out that your arc straightwire would not then cycle on the same span of track itd be more and more track and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more as long as you were running not know alongside of the know right so we look over this then we find out that we could as easily put in notknow or some version of notknow in every command bracket five for five run the knows run the notknows and youll plow more and more track more and more track more and more track and speed the run give you model of that sort of thing well its just what dont you know about grandfather leaving what wouldnt you know about grandfather leaving or what havent you known or any way it works out on your command sheet get the idea those commands package commands are very unsafe its very unsafe to run an exact package command with check for the pc against the emeter you should always clear your commands against the emeter and find out if theyre all live and all answerable before you settle down for any kind of run okay well now you have tomorrow and whole weekend in order to digest all this and after youve digested it probably somebody will change your valence and probably it was only the valence remembering so thank you
