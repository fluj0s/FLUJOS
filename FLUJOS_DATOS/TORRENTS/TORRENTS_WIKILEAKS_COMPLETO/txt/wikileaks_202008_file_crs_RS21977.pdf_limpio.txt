provide dependable and affordable source of credit to rural areas at time when commercial lenders avoided farm loans fcs is not government agency nor guaranteed by the us government but is network of borrowerowned lending institutions it is not lender of last resort it is forprofit lender with statutory mandate to serve agriculture funds are raised through the sale of bonds on wall street five large banks allocate these funds to 95 credit associations that in turn make loans to eligible creditworthy borrowers statutes and oversight by the agriculture committees determine the scope of fcs activity benefits such as tax exemptions are also provided eligibility is limited to farmers farm input suppliers rural homeowners in towns under 2500 population and cooperatives the federal re gulator is the farm credit administration fca farmer mac is separate gse that is s econdary market for agricultural loans it is part of the fcs in that fca is its regulator but it is financially

2007 and spread throughout the us and global financ ial sectors in 2008 has taken toll on farmer macs capital farmer mac lost about 97 million in fannie mae stock and lehman brothers securities putting in jeopardy its ability to meet statutory capital requirements for september 30 2008 farmer mac had inve sted 52 million in fannie mae preferred stock it is now valued at about 32 million for 49 million loss1 its 60 million investment in lehman brothers debt s ecurities fell to about 12 million for 48 million loss2 in the last quarterly report filed on june 30 2008 its minimum statutory capital requirement was 215 million and it had capital of 255 million for 40 million cushion based on these amounts the investme nt losses would have put the capital under the required level without othe r action if the capital requirement is not met statute requires fca to downgrade farmer macs rating something it has never needed to do such enforcement would involve capital restoration plan suspension of dividend payments and possibly limitations on farm er macs growth 12 usc 2279bb6 however formal capital restoration pl an appears unnecessary because on october 1 2008 farmer mac announced that it raised 65 million in capital by issuing preferred stock the shares were bought by the five farm credit system ba nks and one commercial lender3 farmer macs core business involving

for expansion the farm credit system is authorized by statute to lend to farmers nd ranchers loans may also be made for the processing and marketing activities of these borrowers home loans in rural areas certain farmrelated businesse s and cooperatives loans to other borrowers are prohibited in recent years fcs has sought to expa nd its lending authority beyond traditional farm loans in 2006 an fcs report titled horizons4 highlighted perceived needs for greater lending authority including rural housing in towns with up to 50000 population currently 2500 and broader eligibility for agribusinesses commercial banks oppose any expansion of fcs lending authority saying that credit in rural areas is not constrained given financial deregulation nd integration and that fcss gse status provides an unfair advantage5 they say that federal tax benef its for fcs are longer necessary6 the policy decision of whether to expand fcs lending authority has become less about farm credit and more about the ideolo gical role of retail gse lender competing with private lenders7 fcs asserts its statutory mandate to serve agriculture and by extension rural areas th rough g ood times nd bad

of agriculture and rural areas the proposed rule st ates that many rural areas are struggling to retain economic viability and vitality and that essential facilities infrastructure and services often lag be hind those in metropolitan areas obstacles to rural economic development nd revitalization that are further compounded by funding challenges fca designed the rule to able fcs to collaborate and partner in rural development as financial in termediary promoting the flow of money into rural areas like banks fcs institutions may use their assets to make loans or buy investments some question whether investments in the type s of projects mentioned in the rule are safe andor missionrelated critics say that the rules finition of rural as 50000 population is at odds with the fcs statutory limit of 2500 population for rural home loans do investments in bonds and ventur capital effectively result in loans by another name to borrowers who otherwise are ineligible for fcs loans since 2004 an fca pilot program has been allowing similar investments in what sometimes are called rural america bonds12 the proposed rule basically would make the pilot program with revisions and th addition of the venture capital funds permanent part of fcs regulations and available to all fcs institutions the proposed rule was open for public comment until augu st 15 2008 and over 10000 comments were submitted13 among the comment letters are two bipartisan letters from the house financial services committee14 and the senate banking committee15 opposing the rule these letters note that the 2008 farm bill rejected legislation to expand fcs lending authorities request the proposed rule be withdrawn and ask that decisions about the scope of fcs activitie s be left to congress also representatives herger buyer and manzullo and senators byrd lugar and bingaman submitted letters from constituents who oppose the rule the chairm of the house and senate agriculture committees have not taken position public ly usdas rural development agency submitted comment letter in support of the rule16 which somewhat contradicts the administrations opposition to fcs expansion in the farm bill in 2007 the disposition of the proposed rule now awaits action by the fca the fca is authorized to implement rules that it believes are in accord with the statutes congress has official role in the approval process for this propos ed rule unless it exercises its legislative power including disapproving th rule under the congressional review act
