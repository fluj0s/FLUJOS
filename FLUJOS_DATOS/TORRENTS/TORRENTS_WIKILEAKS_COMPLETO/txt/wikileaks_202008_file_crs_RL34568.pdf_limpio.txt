lute stated that the administration did not expect the agreement to rise to the level of treaty and that it did not foresee the need for formal inputs from the congress4 reacting to the agreements contemplated in the d eclaration several members of congress have proposed numerous pieces of legislation designed to encourage or in some cases require the submission of the iraq agreements to congress for formal approval some of these bills would require consultation and reporting from the president concerning the progress of nego tiation of the agreements congress has also conducted multiple hearings that have either focuse d on or at least touched on the iraq agreements in these hearings congress has heard testimony from administration officials that has addressed the administrations plans and important issues concerning the anticipated agreements and has received promises from such officials to keep congress informed on th progress of negotiati ons this testimony has equipped congress with in formation pertinent to deciding what further action can be taken to involve congress more in the process of creating the iraq agreements congresss response to the iraq agr eements has illuminated the priority concerns and positions of the various st akeholders involved in the agreements several members of congress assert the necessity of congressional involvement in the planned iraq agreements from negotia tion to implementation arguing that the iraq agreements as described in the declaration of principles and general lutes statements by definition requi re advice and consent of the senate as formal treaty under the constitution or cong ressional approval of the ag reements through normal legislation other member s contend that any agreement with iraq given the importance of us involvement in iraq to the congress and the american people must be negotiated with meaningful consultation from the congress matter what legal form the agreement takes some statements from members suggest that us iraq agreement negotiated and executed out of the sight of congress might bind the hands of both the next adminis tration and the congress nd might include role for us troops in iraq that exceeds the scope of the 2002 congressi onal authorization to use force in iraq5 on the other hand certain members argue that the president is within his inherent powers and the congre ssional authorization to use force as hehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34568crs3 moves toward completion of the iraq agreements characterizing demands for greater congressional involvement as

agreements do not contain provisions for pe rmanent us bases in iraq and that he anticipated the united states would explicitly forswear such bases in the agreements as other administration officials

they assert ed that as whole the cor had several ongoing concerns the agreements should not be concluded at this time because iraq does not enjoy full sovereignty and as such cannot enter any agreement with the united states as an equal party iraq should not enter into the agreements til the new us president comes into office any agreement between the maliki government and the united states will not be implemented without approval by the cor provision for permanent us bases in the iraq agreements will be acceptable to the iraqi populace and the presence of us forces in iraq is longer needed and timetable for withdrawal of us forces is desired at the hearing chairman delahunt nnounced plan to create formalized interparliamentary dialogue mechanism between the legislatures of the united states and iraq that would allow us to conti nue these conversati ons and better inform ourselves because legislative bodies in democracy are absolutely essential and particularly in terms of oversight of the executive branches professor aljaberi indicated that the cor will pursue this idea possible further congressional action concerning the iraq agreements congress has several options for furt her action to help shape its own involvement in the negotiation and future execution and implementation of the iraq agreements members of congress could among other things choose to take further action continue with hearings on the iraq agreements pass legislation already introduced or introduce legislation that seeks to further define both the authority of the president concerning the us relationship with iraq and the role of congress in the negotiation and implementa tion of the iraq agreements many of these options are not mutually exclusivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34568crs19

the support of the iraqi parliament without limiting u s military flexibility to the point that the united states will find it unacceptableno further action possible course is for congress to do nothing more at this point if it is satisfied with the num erous measures it has taken so far to shed light on the negotiating process and to send message to the administration that congress is monitoring the administrations actions concerning these agreements two factors support this approach first as illustrated above th hearings conducted by various congressional committees and subcommittees have produced body of evidence concerning the agreements including both the intentions of the bush administration and the general sentiment of the iraqi c ouncil of representatives administration officials are on record with sworn testimony regarding bases security commitments troop levels scope of mission legal immunity for us forces and other issues congress has received pro mises that the administration will keep congress informed during the negotiation pr ocess for the iraq agreements and that the agreements will be subm itted in some form to the congress before they are implemented the hearings may have therefore produced useful result as an investigative device to pin down the administrations plans regarding the iraq agreements second it is apparent that the negotiati ons for the iraq agreements have not progressed smoothly and that consensus be tween the government of iraq and the bush administration may not be imminent28 given the overall criticism of the declaration of principles and the proposed iraq agreements in the hearings held to date congress may be satisfied that the agreements will not go forward to conclusion in the near future it may be the case that iraqi and us negotiators will not be able to agree to the terms for continuing us presence thus allaying concern in congress about the administration s intentions for those agreements on the other hand congress may wish to capitalize on some of the information gathered so far by continuing to hold h earings on such an important issue as the future of the usiraq relationship and th ongoing us presence in iraq as the recent comments from the iraqi government in the news and from the iraqi legislature at the hearing on june 4 have illustrated the political relationship in iraq between the maliki government and the cor concerni ng the iraq agreements and other issues remains highly dynamic and c ontentious it may be useful to take this information and present it to administration officials for their comment and explanation pass legislation already introduced certain members of congress may wish to push forward with passage of one or more of the proposed pieces

concerning the iraq agreements it does not afford congress the opportunity to directly shape the agreementmaking process requireme nts for consultation between the two branches may provide such an opportunity for congress but enforcing such requirement and ensuring congress is truly receiving full consultation are not easily achieved with regard to passage of legislation c ontaining requirement that one or more of the iraq agreements be submitted to congress for approval it can be expected that the administration will argue that the president has the constitutional authority within article ii apart from any need fo r congressional input to conclude the iraq agreements as sole executive agreements any such legislation may face veto and could precipitate constitutional confrontation concerning the respective powers of the legislature and the executive in determining the form of international agreements under us law as an alternative to requiring congressi onal approval outright provisions prohibiting the use of funds to implement the iraq agreements while significant would not present the same constitutional problems as they fall squarely within congresss appropria tions power some may stion however whether it is in the interest of the congress to cut ff funds for the iraq agreements as such measure may be viewed by some to compromise us interests as whole in iraq and create new problems for the success of u s foreign policy in the middle east new legislation to define presidential authority as recounted above administration officials have at certain points cited the 2002 congressional authorization of the invasion of iraq and the 2001 authorization to use force in response to the september 11 rrorist attacks as important sources of the presidents authority to enter into the iraq agreemen ts the proposed iraq agreements could be viewed as defining the parameters of th continued authorization for deployment of us forces in iraq those forces legal status and their ability to use force congress might consider legislation therefore delineating the presidents authority to conclude the iraq agreements by adding specific iraqagreement language to the existing use offorce authorizations29 amendments to the 2002 authorization of the use of force have already been introduced for example legislation was proposed prior to the signing of the declaration of principles that would set time restrictions on the authorization to use force in iraq30 new amendatory language directly regarding the iraq agreements could include certain directives to the president that would redefine the authorization to use force and therefore shape the c ontents of any such agreements such directives could include consultation and reporting requirements similar to legislation already proposed but could also cont ain specific limitations on any provisionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34568crs21 31 for an explanation of the different types of international agreements under us law

conclude the agreements with the government of iraq based on the terms of the declaration of principles effectively transforming what would be sole executive agreement into congressionalexecutive agreement31 this option would allow congress to insert conditions into its approval that could shape the substance and implementation of the iraq agreements there is precedent for this type of action in 1975 the ford administration executed an agreement with israel and egypt in support of the sinai ii agreements between those two countries and subsequently notified cong ress under the casezablocki act32 congress demanded role in the agreement and after negotiation with the ford administration passed joint resolution that contained various conditions on its approval of the agreement33 these provisions defined some of the parameters of the us involvement in the sinai ii agreem ents including key provision to remove us technicians from work on an early warning system between egypt and israel under certain circumstances new legislation to further define the role of congress congress may wish to codify specific role for itself in the negotiation or implementation of the iraq agreements creating joint congressionalexecutive decisionmaking mechanism this may include mandating the direct inclusion of members of congress in the negotiation process of the iraq agreements similar to provisions of the trade act of 1974 that include congress in various aspects of tradeagreement negotiations34 it may also entail creating crossbranch monitoring body tasked with reviewing the implementation of the iraq agreements an example of this sort of implementationreview mechanism is the commission on security and cooperation in europe created by congre ss to monitor the implementation of the final act of the conference on security nd cooperation in europe helsinki final act35 instead of strictly approving or disapproving the presidents actions concerning the proposed
