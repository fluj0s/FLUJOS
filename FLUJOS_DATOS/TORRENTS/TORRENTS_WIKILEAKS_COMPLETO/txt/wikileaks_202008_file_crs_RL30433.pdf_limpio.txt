dispositions of other courts and established supreme court precedent httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30433mandatory student fees and the first amendment background and analysis of issues in southworth v grebe summary the first amendment to the constitution of the united states provides that congress shall make law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridge the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for redress of grievances the supreme court of the united states has established that the first amendments free speech guarantee contains as necessary corollaries the right not to speak and the right not to be compelled to support the speech of others based on these principles students of the university of wisconsin filed suit against the schools board of regents asserting that the use of objecting students mandatory student activity fees to support political and ideological groups violated their first amendment rights of free speech free exercise and free association this assertion by the plaintiffs raised conflict between the general principle that academic institutions may provide neutral nondiscriminatory forum for the expression of diverse ideas and the maxim that individuals cannot be required to support political or ideological viewpoints to which they are opposed in considering this conflict the court of appeals for the seventh circuit looked to rosenberger v rector and visitors of university of virginia where the supreme court ruled that disbursement of student fees must be made on viewpoint neutral basis while the court did not address the issue of whether such fees were violative of the first amendment in rosenberger it did state that the analysis of the question would be controlled by standards established in two of its earlier decisions keller v state bar of california and abood v detroit board of education in those cases dealing with bar and teachers union dues respectively the court ruled that members of such organizations could be required to fund activities which are germane to the purpose for which the organization was established but could not be compelled to fund activities of political or ideological nature applying this germaneness standard to the academic context the court of appeals determined that the allocation of student fees to political and ideological groups was unconst itutional specifically the court explained that universitys interest in providing for diverse expression was not sufficiently germane to the educational process to justify such forced funding key factor in the courts decision was its conclusion that the disbursements placed too great burden on the first amendment rights of objecting students effectively forcing them to subsidize speech that was anathemic to their personal beliefs while the seventh circuit employed established precedent in its analysis its conclusion conflicts with the decisions of other courts because of this difference among the circuit courts the supreme court granted certiorari on the question of whether such fee

the international socialist organization the ten percent continuedengaging in political and ideologica l advocacy activities and speech1 specifically the objecting students argued that such funding violated their free speech and association rights2 the controversy arose from the university of wisconsins imposition of mandatory student fee assessed at 16575 for the 199596 academic year as noted by the seventh circuit the fee is mandatory because students ability to receive grades or to graduate is contingent upon payment of the fee under wisconsin state law both the board of regents and the students control funds generated by the fee with the regents possessing ultimate authority in the approval or disapproval of funding in particular the student fees are classified as either allocable or non allocable with the regents having plenary control over the latter3 the allocable portion of the student fee on the other hand falls under the authority of the associated students of madison asm which serves as the official representative of the student body these allocable funds support the asm budget as well as the general student service fund gssf both asm and gssf distribute the mandatory student fees to private organizations the gssf funds are distributed to registered student organizations university departments and qualified community based service organizations4 the asm budget

24southworth 151 f3d at 723advocacy the court of appeals observed that two necessary corollaries to the first amendments guarantee of free speech are the right not to speak and the right not to be compelled to subsidize the speech of others17 the seventh circuit noted that the supreme court had not ruled whether these corollaries protect objecting students from being forced by state universi ties to subsidize private political and ideological organizations18 however the court did determine that the supreme court had provided guidance on the appropriate analysis for such challenge in rosenberger v rector and visitors of the university of virginia 19 in rosenberger group of students who published christian newspaper were denied funding by the university of virginia the students challenged the denial of funding on the basis that the university had allocated student fees to nonreligious student newspapers thereby engaging in viewpoint discrimination upon review the supreme court determined that the disbursement of student activity fees to various groups had created forum of money that once established had to be made available on viewpoint neutral basis having made this determination the supreme court held that the university had violated the first amendment by discriminating on the basis of the religious viewpoint of the newspaper20 while the supreme court did not rule directly on the issue of whether objecting students could be forced to fund private organizations in rosenberger the seventh circuit found that the court had identified the proper analysis for such challenge21 in rosenberger citing keller v state bar of california and abood v detroit board of education the supreme court observed that the fee is mandatory and we do not have before us the question whether an objecting student has the first amendment right to demand pro rata return to the extent the fee is expended for speech to which he or she does not subscribe22 justice oconnor in concurrence also stated that although the question is not presented here i note the possibility that the student fee is susceptible to free speech clause challenge by an objectin g student that she should not be compelled to pay for speech with which she disagrees again citing keller and abood 23 in addition to the supreme courts declaration the seventh circuit also noted that every other circuit to have considered the constitutional uses of mandatory student fees has applied the abood and keller analysis24 accordinglyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30433crs5 25abood v detroit bd of educ 431

keller and lehnert the germaneness analysis in abood the supreme court considered whether nonunion employees of the detroit board of education could be required to pay service fee to the union as result of an agency shop agreement regarding collective bargaining the teachers argued that the imposition of such service fee violated their first amendment rights of free speech and free association the supreme court determined that the service fee was constitutional as it was justified by the legislative assessment of the important contribution of the union shop to the system of labor relations established by congress25 the court further explained that an individual could not withhold financial support on the basis that he or she did not agree with the groups strategy so long as the union was serving to promote the cause which justified bringing the group together26 in essence the court determined that both union and nonunion teachers benefitted from collective bargaining practices making it inequitable for non union teachers receiving such benefit to refuse to pay the associated service fee the court did stress however that union expenditures of political or ideological nature must be financed from charges dues or assessments paid by employees who do not object to advancing those ideas and who are not coerced into doing so against their will27 in keller the supreme court considered challenge by lawyers who objected to the use of mandatory state bar dues to fund lobbying on social issues in its analysis of the issue the court clarified its holding in abood stating that dissenting individuals dues could not be used for ideological activities not germane to the purpose which compelled association was justified28 applying this maxim to keller the court determined that the compelled association and integrated bar were justified by the states interest in regulating the legal profession and improving the quality of legal services29 given this legitimate interest the court determined that the state bar may constitutionally fund activities germane to those goals out of the mandatory dues of all members30 however the court again stressed that the state bar could not fund activities of an ideological nature which fall outside those areas of activity31 as the seventh circuit noted the decisions in abood and keller have been interpreted as establishing germaneness

expenditures are necessarily or reasonably incurred for the purpose of regulating the legal profession or improving the quality of the legal service available to the people of the state33 in addition to abood and keller the supreme court has employed the germaneness analysis in several cases culminating in the approach developed in lehnert v ferris faculty association 34 in lehnert the supreme court again considered the constitutionality of union expenditures employi ng the germaneness analysis developed in abood and keller conducting this analysis the court determined that threepr onged test was the proper avenue by which to determine whether union expenditures violated the first amendment rights of objecting employees specifically the court stated that such expenditures must be germane to collective bargaining justified by the governments vital policy interest in labor peace and avoiding free riders and not significantly add to the burdening of free speech that is inherent in the allowance of an agency or union shop35 having determined the appropriate analysis the seventh circuit proceeded to apply the test delineated in lehnert germaneness in its consideration of the first prong the court of appeals stated that the university had to possess legitimate governmental interest justifying the compelled funding and further demonstrate that such funding was germane to the asserted interest as the objecting students did not contend that the university lacked legitimate interest in compelled funding the court limited its consideration to whether the challenged activity was in fact germane to that interest36 the university claimed that its interest in education supported the funding of private organizations specifically the regents asserted that funding such groups engaged in political and ideological speech was germane to the universitys educational interest in that it would allow for diverse expression37 the court of appeals rejected this argument stating that germaneness cannot be read so broadly as to include forced funding of private political and ideological groups38 in reaching this determination the court of appeals compared the imposition of mandatory student fees to the facts of earlier compelled funding cases the court pointed to keller in particular where the state bar had asserted that its funding of lobbying on nuclear weapons abortion and prayer in public schools was justified by its purported authority to fund activities in all matters pertaining to the advancement of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30433crs7 39id at

objecting students dissent they must fund organizations promoting opposing views or they dont graduate id 44id at 728 45id at 728science of jurisprudence or to the improvement of the administration of justice39 noting that the supreme court rejected such rationale as overly broad in keller the court of appeals in southworth likewise rejected the universitys position b vital policy interests turning its attention to lehnerts second prong the court considered the universitys argument that it possessed vital interest in education and in allowing students to share the governance of the university system40 the court stated that neither of these interests presents vital interest in compelling students to fund private organizations which engage in political and ideological speech41 specifically the court determined that there was not common cause justifying compelled funding in the educational context in lehnert for instance the supreme court stated that while there was common cause between union and nonunion employees in supporting the unions political activities all employees had an equal interest in the negotiation and administration of collective bargaining agreements42 in southworth however the court determined that in the compelled funding context while there may be common educational cause in shared governance there is such link between private organizations that pursue political and ideologi cal agendas and objecting students accordingly the court ruled that there was vital policy interest supporting compelled funding of the private associations43 the university next argued that since private organizations were required to permit open access to all students permitting objecting students to withhold funding would result in freerider problem44 the court found this argument unconvincing on several levels first the court observed that the universitys own policy allowed nonstudents to participate in registered student organizations thereby negating its ability to decry the impact of freeriders relatedly the court pointed out that the vast majority of student groups subject to the open access policy received funds whatsoever45 on more substantive level the court explained that whereas unions are required to represent all employees equally the private organizations under consider ation did not act in representative capacity for the students and were not under an obligation to represent the students fairly furthermore the court found it significant that many of the ideological and political activities and speech to which the students objected occurred offcampus limiting the benefit of these aspects to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30433crs8 46id at 728 47id at 729 48id at 730 quoting abood v detroit bd of educ 431 us 23435 n31 quoting irving

inapplicable to the mandatory student fee dynamic46 c burdening free speech under the third prong of the lehnert analysis the court was required to take several factors into consideration in determining whether the mandatory student fees significantly added to the burdening of free speech inherent in their imposition first the court considered whether the forced funding imposed significant burden on objecting students speech noting the conviction of the objecting students philosophical and religious beliefs the court determined that forcing them to participate in the funding of groups with which they disagreed regarding sensitive issues such as abortion and homosexuality did indeed constitute significant burden offensive to the first amendment47 in support of this determination the court quoted madisons admonition that to compel man to furnish contributions and money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves is sinful and tyrannical48 next the court addressed the universitys assertion that there was evidence that student activity fees had been used to fund the actual political or ideological activities the organizations promoted49 noting the supreme courts determination in abood that merely limiting the use of the actual dollars collected from objecting individuals was not an adequate remedy the court of appeals stated that whether or not the student fees directly fund the political or ideological activities is irrelevant the first amendment is offended by the regents use of objecting students fees to subsidize organizations which engage in political and ideological activities50 further the court declared that the university could neither require objecting students to fund such organizations nor simply distribute objecting students funds to nonpolitical organizations and funnel nonobjecting students fees to the political and ideological organizations resulting in the same overall allocation of funds to do so according to the court would nonetheless result in objecting students subsidizing the political and ideological organizations as the court explained dollars are fungible and splitting the same amount in two does not cure the obvious subsidy51 the court then looked to the universitys argumen t that free speech concerns were not implicated where the organizations did not purport to speak for the entire student body rejecting this argument the court explained that the first amendments free speech guarantee carries with it the corresponding right not to be compelled to fund private speech as such the court held that the question of whether thirdhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30433crs9 52id at 732 53id at 732 the court further noted that even if the objecting students participated fully in the democratic

attribute the organizations political and ideological views to the objecting student was irrelevant52 regarding the universitys argument that students were free to work through the democratic process to proscribe funding for groups to which they objected the court was similarly unimpressed specifically the court declared that the first amendment trumps the democratic process and protects the individuals rights even when majority of citizens wants to infringe upon them53 lastly the court addressed the universitys assertion that it was authorized to impose student fees for the funding of political and ideological organizations in the same manner that congress and the states are able to use public money to support political parties and other ideological organizations the court explained that the student fee was not classifiable as such since mandatory activity fee is not general tax implemented to raise funds for university quoting rosenberger the court stressed that student activity funds do not represent government resources derived from tax revenue sales of assets or otherwise but fund that simply belongs to the students54 based on all of these factors the court of appeals for the seventh circuit held that the university had failed to meet its burden under the lehnert standard specifically the court explained that even if the funding of private political and ideological organizations was germane to the educational mission of university the forced funding by objecting students nonetheless constituted significant burden to free speech rights as such the court ruled that the university could not use the allocable portion of objecting students mandatory activity fees to fund organizations which engage in political or ideological activities advocacy or speech55 supreme court review the supreme court granted certiorari in southworth limited to the question of whether the first amendment is offended by policy or program under which public university students must pay mandatory fees that are used in part to support organizations that engage in political speech56 given the practical and constitutional impact of the seventh circuits decision it is evident that the supreme courts ultimate disposition of the issue will have significant implications in the first amendment and mandatory fee contexthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30433crs10

justify viewpoint discrimination among private speakers on the economic fact of scarcity id 58southworth 151 f3d at 722 the court of appeals for the eighth circuit has reached the same conclusion that rosenberger applies only to the distribut ion of student fees see curry v regents of the university of minnesota 167 f3d 420 422 n4 8th cir 1999 59southworth v grebe 157 f3d 1124 1128 wood j dissenting 60id at 1129 61447 us 74 1980 62id at 87a forum creation and compelled speech considerations of the several issues which will figure into the supreme courts consideration of southworth the most basic will be the degree to which the rosenberger decision applies to the collection and distribution of mandatory student fees as noted above rosenberger established that public university may not distribute student fees or other financial resources to student organizations based upon the substantive content of the groups speech rather the court declared once such forum of money has been established funds must be distributed on viewpoint neutral basis57 in addressing the supreme courts decision the seventh circuit determined that rosenberger pertained only to the disbursement of funds and had bearing on the constitutionality of forcing students to fund private political and ideological organizations58 on petition for rehearing the dissent in southworth argued that rosenberger was controlling maintaining that student fees constitute compelled subsidy of neutral forum for speech59 in making this argument the dissent analogized the student fee to the compelled funding of neutral fora such as the mall in washington dc which is used by countless speakers with virtually infinite range of viewpoints60 essentially this argument characterizes the student fee dynamic as identical to the forum access in pruneyard shopping center v robins 61 there the supreme court ruled that the owner of private shopping center could not deny individuals the opportunity to advocate message there since the mall was open to the public and the speech of the activists could not be attributed to the mall owners62 under this rationale the allocation of student fees could be said to create forum open to all student organizations with little likelihood that the views of such groups will be attributed to objecting students while this argument is facially appealing it ignores the unique aspects of compelled student fee specifically it would seem that the money compelled from the students as opposed to the subsequently created funding forum is analogous to the issues at play in pruneyard there the supreme court found it significant that the shopping mall owner had voluntarily granted public access in the student fee context however it cannot be said that objecting students have made their money available to the groups which they oppose willingly this factor seems to bring the student fee dynamic in line with subsequent determinations by the court that pruneyard ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30433crs11 63see pacific gas electric co v public utilities comm 475 us 1 1986 there the court stated notably absent from pruneyard was any concern that access to this area might affect the shopping center owners exercise of his own right to speak the owner did not even allege that he objected to the content of the pamphlets nor was the access right content based

student fee creates metaphorical forum for the expression of diverse viewpoints ignores the fact that the money in essence goes directly to support private organizations this fact further undermines the notion that the allocation of student fees merely supports neutral forum as argued by the dissent64 in light of these factors it seems that the seventh circuit correctly determined that the aboodkeller analysis was controlling irrespecti ve of the forum creation arguments forwarded by the dissent indeed it must be remembered that the supreme court directed just such an analysis in the rosenberger decision itself65 b application of the germaneness standard given the inapplicability of the rosenberger decision it seems that the primary factor in the mandatory fee analysis will not be whether the seventh circuit erred in following the abood and keller line of cases rather the courts focus will likely center on the more substantive question of whether the abood and keller germaneness analysis was correctly applied in the academic context in particular it has been argued that the seventh circuits decision misapprehends supreme court precedent by analogizing the union fees of abood and the integrated bar fees at issue in keller with the imposition of mandatory student fees66 the most significant aspect of this argument centers on the assertion that unlike unions or integrated bars university students pay fees not to the challenged groups but to the student government which then uses the money to fund its own operations and over 100 student groups regardless of viewpoint67 as such it is argued that the speech of such groups is not attributable to objecting students thereby nullifying any first amendment concerns regarding compelled speech68 indeed it does seem that valid argument may be made that whereas abood and keller involved mandatory contributions to an organization which unilaterally determined the speech at issue mandatory student fees are available to multiple groups minimizing the burden on free speech69 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30433crs12 70carroll v blinken 957 f2d 991 998 2nd cir 1992 71id at 998 the court of appeals for the third circuit reached the same conclusion in galda v rutgers 772 f2d 1060 1067 3rd cir 1985 stating if the university compelled student to make separate contributions to both the democratic and republican national committees the evil is not undone it is compounded 72southworth v grebe 157 f3d at 1125 rovner j dissenting 73see carroll v blinken 957 f2d 991 997 2nd cir 1992 in carroll the court stated that simply because portion of the student activity fee is briefly in the hands of the student association while being funneled from students to nypirg does not diminish the fact that transfer has taken place see also galda 772 f2d at 106768however while the funding of multiple groups by neutral student government may have the practical effect of preventing direct attribution to individual students it does not seem that this practice sufficiently alleviates the underlying constitutional impingement in particular courts have rejected the notion that such attenuation in the student fee context alleviates any constitutional infringement since the students themselves are not required to directly convey or support personally repugnant message in carroll v blinken for instance the court of appeals for the second circuit rejected the attenuation argument noting that while major compelled speech cases generally involved citizens compelled actually to speak or carry message nowhere did those opinions state or imply that compelled speech has only one modus operandi70 accordingly the second circuit determined that the mere fact that the student fee compelled speech through multiple groups in way heals the constitutional infirmity of such practice rather the court determined that the only effect of the student fee was to require that students fund more than one unwanted view71 another assertion by student fee proponents in this context is that the activity fees go to the student government which then makes funding decisions as opposed to being given directly to the student organizations on petition for rehearing the dissent raised this argument declaring that the recipient of the funds in this case is not itself engagin g in the challenged speech based on this premise the dissent argued that under rosenberger such speech is not attributable to the student government which further means that the speech necessarily cannot be attributed to the students paying the fees to the student government72 while this viewpoint appears to validate the student fee dynamic such characterization seems to misrepresent the nature of the transaction and has been rejected by the courts specifically the courts have determined that the mere fact that student government serves as an intermediary between the students and the organizations is irrelevant as such funneling does not alter the substantive fact that transfer has taken place73 the factors noted above seem to establish both that the abood and keller standard is applicable and that the fees do indeed constitute compelled speech as such it is likely that the supreme courts disposition of southwo rth will hinge on whether the seventh circuit correctly concluded that mandatory student fees are not sufficiently germane to universitys educational mission so as to outweigh the burden imposed on the first amendment rights of objecting students httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30433crs13 74carroll 957 f2d at 1001 75id

compelled speech concerns were at issue and that the allocation of the student fees did indeed encroach upon the constitutional rights of the objecting students75 however the court held that sunys goal to stimulate uninhibited and vigorous discussion on matters of campus and public concern among others alleviated the constitutional burden76 while the carroll court determined that student fees could be germane to universitys educational goals it stressed that the offcampus activities of student groups could not be funded specifically the court noted that the use of student fees to pay nonstudent lobbyists cover statewide administrative costs and to finance other university chapters stretched the nexus between the extracted fee and the universitys educational interests beyond what is constitutionally permissible77 clarifying this standard the court explained that students could be required to tolerate some compromise of their first amendment rights when the benefits of varied extracurricular life handson civics training and robust campus debate are all around them to approvingly take part in actively oppose or merely witness dispassionately firsthand78 the court further explained that these benefits vanish when student funds are spent outside the scope of campus related activities noting that universitys educational interests however substantial are still after all those of the university and its community not that of an independent statewide organization79 accordingly the court ruled that students could not be compelled to fund such of campus activity the court of appeals for the ninth circuit has also ruled that universitys educational mission may support the collection of mandatory student fees in rounds v oregon the court determined that the funding of an educational arm of oregon student pirg ospirg was germane to the educational mission of oregon state university based upon the organizations involvement in activities which the court deemed were directly linked to the intellectual enrichment of the campus environment80 the court also went to great lengths to stress that it was not facedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30433crs14 80continued handson

student referendum see southworth 151 f3d at 720 87galda 772 f2d at 1061with the issues presented in southworth since the organization in question engaged only in educational activities tailored to the universitys educational mission nonetheless the court did state that it disagreed with the southworth decision to the extent that the seventh circuits holding established that public university may not constitutionally establish and fund limited public forum for the expression of diverse viewpoints81 at the same time however the ninth circuit stated that it is of the utmost significance that the organizatio nal speech at issue occurs in an academic setting indicating agreement with the approach of the second circuit in carroll82 from the factors noted above it seems that the decisions in carroll and rounds provide reasonable basis for disagreement with the seventh circuits decision in southworth to the extent that they establish that university may use student fees to fund groups which engage in educational activities that directly augment the campus intellectual environment however it should be noted that the seventh circuits broad rejection of mandatory student fee allocation is not without precedent in smith v university of california the supreme court of californi considered an objection to the disbursement of funds to political or ideological organizations83 striking down the allocations the court declared that groups dedication to achieving its political or ideological goals at some point begins to outweigh any legitimate claim it may have to be educating students on the universitys behalf84 the court went on to declare that regulations permitting the funding of such groups are not narrowly drawn to avoid impinging on the rights of objecting students especially since university may achieve similar goals through course work and other less onerous methods85 even if the supreme court determines that the carroll approach is sufficient to protect the first amendment rights of objecting students it is likely that the seventh circuits decision will be upheld as it applies to student fees allocated through the referendum process86 specifically the seventh circuits decision finds support in galda v rutgers where the court of appeals for the third circuit addressed challenge by students at rutgers university who objected to referendum allocation supporting njpirg87 the court struck down the allocation noting that while organizations funded from general fee can be perceived broadly as providing ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30433crs15 88id at 1064 89id at 1067forum for diverse range of opinion those that are funded from dedicated fee do not provide forum for the expression of differing views88 this analysis applies to referendum allocations in southworth as well as the scenarios are essentially identical and share close nexus with the union and bar dues rejected in abood and keller specifically while the supreme court may determine that the carroll approach is proper given the universitys traditional role in fostering variety of viewpoints such justification fails when an outside organization independent of university and dedicated to advancing one position is entitled to compelled contributions from those who are opposed89 as such the seventh circuits decision seems well entrenched as it regards the student referendum process conclusion in light of the factors noted above it appears that the court of appeals correctly assessed the constitutional burden imposed by the disbursement of mandatory student activity fees as such arguments asserting that the court employed an improper analytical framework in striking down the allocation of student fees to political and ideological groups appear to be misplaced indeed it seems evident that the seventh circuit properly interpreted the supreme courts decision in rosenberger by applying the aboodkeller analysis as modified under lehnert at the same time the seventh circuits decision departs from precedent established in other student fee cases leaving open the possibility that the supreme court will reverse
