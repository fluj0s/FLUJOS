of humanitarian affairs ocha executive summary from may to september 2007 the office of internal ove rsight services oios conducted review of results based management rbm practices at the office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ocha oios found that rbm in ocha has in some respects been strengthened and is in the process of further development and improvement ochas strengthening of its internal planning function in particular is commendable the process aimed at formulating cascading set of programme objectives and indicators coupled with established routine for annual reportin g has helped to focus and sharpen ocha rbm practices these initiatives have brought direct benefits in terms of its external stakeholder liaison and extra budgetary xb resource base however the emerging planning system has been conceived as mecha nism that operates in parallel with and in separation from the formal and established general assembly decision making cycle thus undermining the coherence and ultimate integration of rbm efforts whilst the system evolving in reference to xb is reflecti ve of managerial commitment and genuine in depth stakeholder liaison the general assembly process is perceived as being subject to very little influence by actions of the department while ocha to large extent has meaningfully managed the mix of funding opportunities there is little doubt that the emphasis on attracting xb resources has left planning management and documentation pertaining to rb and core functions behind this has in particular affect ed the field offices oios notes that field off ice review has been undertaken in 2007 which might be useful to inform wider core function review and the need for more rb funding in support to regional basic humanitarian functions oios found that while the internal planning process brought some dis cipline to operational planning there are several technical weaknesses that remain t he use of performance indicators baselines and targets the quality and realism of indicator data collection methods and the aggregation of corporate indicator data need to be corrected to further strengthen ochas rbm orientation on enhancing accountability oios found that reporting to stakeholders has been improved by way of the annual reports however results presented in them are still to large extent not evid encebased or referenced against ex baselines and target instead high share of results claims rely on anecdotal case narratives quality assurance mechanism at the different stages and levels of the rbm process would help to strengthen the cr edibility and reliability of results presented to ocha stakeholders on internal accountability framewo rks oios found that linkages between individual organizational unit s and personal work plans were weak or absent and that 3 middle and senior level man agement had paid little attention to use of the individual performance assessment mechanism pas overall organizational learning needs further strengthening and clearer role in the decision making process whilst noting progress attained in numbe r of areas oios concluded that ocha needs to take several measures in order to make sensible use of results based tools to inform decision making as follows the formal biennial planning system and the already developed internal process need to be align ed to allow for coherence and clarity one plan approach with an improved planning framework and unified monitoring and reporting mechanisms should be pursued thorough review of core functions and management arrangements in cluding those at the field offices are required to assist ocha in formulating unified plan and budget proposal that will be more attuned to its realities and established requirements including an enhanced rb support to core humanitarian functions to further enhance organizatio nal learning ocha needs to strengthen its planning monitoring and evaluation capacities by more direct participation and influenc in the decision making process and by providing the planning monitoring and evaluation functions resources commensurate with their responsibilities evaluations should have programmatic coverage clear criteria for selecting evaluation topics and strengthened monitoring of follow up to recommendations made oios makes total of twelve recommendations for actions to b taken by ocha including the further accumulation of notes on number of issues warranting further review at the secretariat wide level contents paragraphs page i background 115 6 introduction 12 6 b

office for the coordi nation of humanitarian affairs ocha 1 previous oios inspect ion in ocha undertaken in 1999 was also considered as background information to the current exercise 2 2 oios invited ocha to comment on the draft report and these comments have been incorporat ed as approp riate in this final version oios greatly appreciates the courtes and cooperation extended to the oios team during the inspection including during the interviews in new york geneva sudan and panama 3 b inspection objective 3 the overall obj ective f this particular inspection is to determine whether ochas current managerial strategy systems and practices were conducive to attain ing the efficiency relevance effectiveness and ultimate impact t hat rbm is aimed at instilling thus the overarching areas subject to review included the following 4 translation of mandates into operational objectives b measurability of performance indicators c practice of continuous results monitoring and evaluation d use of results information to guide decision making partnerships and capacity development for rbm 4 the current exercise is part of series of rbm inspections undertaken to extract findings and recommendations at the entity level that may help to inform future development of the secretariat wide rbm fra mework this is the second oios inspection review of rbm at the programme level 5 the series of rbm inspections represents oios independent contribution to the reviews requested by member states not just of rbm6 but of experiences gained with the changes made in the planning and budget process7 good practices identified in the monitoring reporting and evaluation processes as well as the further response of the secretariat to 1 oios visited the country office set up and humanitarian operation in sudan and the regional office for latin america and the caribbean in panama as well as ochas hqs in new york and geneva 2 as issued in a54334 of 9 septem ber 1999 which addressed some issues related to management monitoring and reporting of ochas interagency coordination roles but not its internal management mechanisms 3 oios would in particular like to acknowledge the full support and cooperation of the designated inspection focal point mr rune froseth chief strategic planning unit and of mr aden ali and antoine gerard in sudan as well as gerard gomez douglas reimer and max bonnel sonia him and barbara blanco of the regional office for latina american and the caribbean located in panama 4 more detailed set of questions that have been used to inform the review is attached

inspection unit jiu in its series of re ports on rbm8 and the ensuing ga endorsement of the jiu benchmarking framework 9 5 the emphasis on rbm as topic for inspections is in line with the first recommendation of the recent review of governance and oversight in the u nited nations 10 further objective of the series of inspections as whole is to extract set of independent oversight11 criteria relevant to the rbm system of the organization whilst individual inspection reports in this series focus on actions taken at the entity level and within the realm of the programmes decision making we also seek findings which have potentially broader applicability with respect to the extraction of issues relevant to the systemic properties of rbm at the secretariat level oios is accumulating memor andum items that warrant further consideration c methodology 6 in conducting the current inspection oios used multi method approach combining quali tative and quantitative data collection methods as

applied has some limitations concerning data gathered from ochas field offices oios was only able to visit 2 of the 27 ocha field offices also despite number of meas ures intended to boost survey participation the response rates remained at low levels d results based management at the united nations secretariat 8 results based management rbm has been the vision that gave rise to the planning budgeting16 and reporting systems and mechanisms that have been implemented at the united nations secretariat since 200117 rbm can most broadly be described as an organizational governance paradigm that brings centrality to the effects ie the changes that occur bey ond the bureaucratic processes through enabling planning and decision making to be driven by future effects rather than mere routine efforts and activities the ultimate purpose of rbm is to strengthen the relevance and effectiveness of organizational performance as such rbm has been embedded in the series of united nations reforms undertaken aiming at shifting the focus of planning budgeting reporting and oversight from how things are done to what is accomplished 18 the expected outcome of this shift of focus is to ultimately improving governance strengthening management effectiveness and accountability 19 9 the normative elements of the united nations secretariat rbm system are outlined in the rules and regulations governing programme planning the progr amme aspects of the budget the monitoring of implementation and the methods for evaluation ppbme20 which frame the different parameters processes and procedures to the elaboration of the strategic frameworks21 budgets as well as the monitoring reporti ng and evaluation components of the rbm construct together with the instructions that are periodically issued in support of planning budgeting and performance reporting these constitute the operative elements of rbm implementation the formal biennial planning process begins from the artic ulation of results frameworks logframes built on assumed cause effect relationships or hierarchies of objectives for all departmental sub programmes they comprise set of objectives expected accomplishments ea s indicators of achievement ioa s and performance measures pm s pertaining to the two year planning and budgeting periods whilst objectives represent the basic longer term underlying principle for subprogramme usually derived from the formal mandates given to united nations programme expected accomplishments ea s reflect the outcomes to which subprogramme will contribute to within given biennium ioas are the means of verification of those eas and pm s are intended to capture the ant icipated degree of change from baseline to target within given biennium 10 the results frameworks that are developed as part of strategic planning also serve as reference points to resource allocation and are part of the budget fascicles that are pres ented to 16 building on ares55231 the parameters of

16 on the secretariat budget 24 the programme is guided by general assembly resolution 46182 of 19 december 1991 which also defined the functions of the emergency relief coordinator erc 25 against the backdrop of broader mission statement26 ochas stated programme objectives are to ensure the timely coherent and coordinated response of the inte rnational community to disasters and emergencies to promote disaster risk reduction and to facilitate the smooth transition from emergency relief to rehabilitation and development27 ochas activities are structure d into five separate subprogrammes28 in

additionally ocha has undertaken strengthening of its admin capacity and its strategic planning processes to enhance its ability to monitor manage and report on results f ochas budget structure and funding 14 ochas funding arrang ement is multifaceted and complex most of the ochas activities are financed through xb funds for the biennium 2006 2007 rbs estimated share of funding was only 11 of its total estimated requirements for 2006 the allotted rb of 129 us million d ollars represented only 8 of the total needs of 1522 million for the year35 table i under annex ii shows the estimated share or rb and xb resources planned for each of the subprogrammes for the biennium 2006 2007 whilst nominal value of rb funding increas ed from 21 million in 2002 2003 to 27 million for 2004 2005 the proportion of earmarked funding decreas ed from 49 in 2005 to 43 in 200636 this limits the flexibility of the organization to respond to emerging humanitarian crisis in rapid fashion oios noted that the field officeregional office network is financed solely with xb resources and by way of projects 37 foros represent approximate ly 60 of the total resources spent in given year38 similarly only 66 staff in ocha are finance d through the rb represents only 6 of the total 1018 staff39 g humanitarian reform 15 the office has led the launching of the wide range humanitarian reform agenda by

oios notes that ochas crucial role in the humanitarian response and assistance effort has recently been recognized by the general assembly resolution 61134 ii findings 1 rbm at ocha is in the process of further development and improvement 16 rbm at ocha was revitalized in 2006 by way of series of initiatives seeking to improve ochas planning monitoring management and accountability the most notable specific initiatives positively associated with implementation f rbm in ocha include40 establishment f strategic planning unit spu in charge of the strategic planning and reporting framework b the establishment of periodic work planning session s that culminate in annual planning document s by branches and field offices c the development of an internal h ierarchical planning framework41 with overall goals and objectives t guide the unit specific pr iorities and annual work plans d the stablishment of strategic corporate core indicators of achievement sporadic riskneeds based planning developed by few foros f establishment of the project funding review group pfrg strategic advisory body advising the smt on work and cost plans and lead mid year review process g the establishment of ndofcycle review exercise s h more structured consultative mech anisms at the planning monitoring and reporting stages with smt being the decision making body and pfrg being the advisory body and i more comprehensive guidelines on planning monitoring and reporting including riskbased planning component 17 with the ir focus on strengthening accountability in its xb resource base these initiatives have largely volved on parallel track that is not synchronized with the formal biennial ga and rb planning and budgeting framework in its timeframes cycles parameter s regulations and norms ochas staff have recognized that the strengthened xb planning process has helped organize the work of different organizational units42 nevertheless f rom review of the 2007 unit work plans oios noted the re are number of gaps in the planning frameworks lack of baseline figures for indicators of achievement 43 sporadic use of target data in its annual reports44 lack of explicitly defined external factors that might influence planned interventions towards the chievement of c ommon objectives lack of clear understanding on the use ioas with frequent alignment to output rather than outcome level 45 40 progress identified under this paragraph mostly related to the strengthening of the xb focused planning 41 albeit not fully aligned yet or in the proper logical sequence 42 from interviews conducted by oios 43 while results based work planning and monit oring guidelines for 2008 do make provision fo r setting up baseline figures review of 2007 work plans confirmed that they did not have any baselines 44 oios noted the little reference to target data on ochas annual report for 2006 12 limited uniformity and timeliness in submission of planning forms46 and reports47 partial understanding on data collection methods to report on ioas and sporadic vetting mechanism s to monitor the quality of the planning instruments as well as t he logical framework components limited standardization of fos logframes 2 ioas are still weak 18 arguably the greatest weakness of ochas resu lts framework is the still fragile formulation of ioas this is true at the organizational unit level and at the level of the core indicators oios noted number of indicators do not pass the smart48 test indicators such as funding section on cap on in tranet or number op eds article requests and other pi products developed or number of trainings undertaken49 ro website successfully established or organigram regularly updated and posted on intranet50 still reflect the completion of outputs rat her than the achievement of results similarly at the level of core indicators number of draft outlines on humanitarian policy developed in coordination with regional organizations percentage of field offices visited by hq administrative missions or number of specialized trainings offered to undac members are still far from reflecting results and rather concentrate on processes and products51 oios noted the there is lack of quality control or vetting mechanism that ensures that indicators p ass the smart test memorandum item 1 the quality of the work plans as reflected in the logical frameworks are the cornerstone of rbm implementation expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement that are not meaningful measurable attainable realistic and relevant will only render the monitoring process immaterial and of little value for informed decision making 3 data collection plans and methodologies are absent or unrealistic 45 for example fr om randomly selected work plan advocacy and information management branchadvocacy and public information section indicator from objective 11 number of op eds press releases success stories and other pi products produced or from objective 12 num

public information section work plan for 2007 50 these indicators were taken from ocha regional office dubai united arab emirates 51 these were extracted from the core ohca performance indicators 2007 formulated and approved in 6 july 2007 and available in ocha intranet httpochaonlineunorgstrategicplanningtabid656defaultaspx 13 19 oios noted with concern that data collection plans52 and methodol ogies are not consistently established the identification of variables data sources collection methods frequency of data collection or external factors that might affect the collection of data were not undertaken for any of the ioas of the internal p lanning process or for the core performance indicators related to the 2007 objectives on the biennial budget front while some data was available the identification of full methodologies for data collection was still very much incomplete53 in an ideal rbm framework data collection should be planned from the outset so that the re can be clear determination of resources and responsibilities oios noted that ocha was only able to undertake actual data collection and analysis for 11 of its formal indica tors of achievement see annex 7 oios is aware that while the annual work planning process show s some data collected against specific indicators by way of the m yr the spu as the responsible entity for ensuring the quality of the planning monitoring nd reporting process has means or protocols in place to verify the quality of the plans or the validity of the data collected against approved plans 54 additionally oios noted that there is systematic review or feedback provided by the spu to the s ubstantive units on the gaps and weaknesses identified in the approved plans55 memorandum item 2 the quality of the plans is not only limited to the formulation of the logical framework as such determining data collection methods budgeting for the reso urces necessary allocating responsibilities and determining accountability frameworks that can support credible performance assessments are as vital as the actual elaboration of the plans 4 parallel planning processes have slowed down coheren t implement ation and ultimate integration of rbm efforts 20 ochas planning budgeting monitoring reporting and performance assessment is managed n two separate track s this mitigates against coheren t planning and management involves unnecessary duplication possi ble confusion of terminology and raises governance concerns on the one hand t he formal process of rb planning for ga review as prescribed by the ppbme follows biennial cycle framework and monitoring arrangements on the other hand ocha has devel oped separate and more informal planning and reporting system largely for xb funding that is based on the introduction of five year vision 2007 2012 three year strategic planning framework 2007 2009 and an annual planning monitoring and report ing process the internal planning process comprises seven elements strategic

set of data collection methods available which included variables data sources collection method and frequency of data collection 54 this particularly applies to the foros which have been given flexibility to formulate additional objectives and indicators apart from those strategic ones established for all the office and it applies to any data collection plans established in particular their relevance to ioas th eir specificity plausibility and the appropriateness of methods to ensure reliab data is collected when reporting on results 55 this has been repeatedly argued by respondents and interviewees when asked about areas were planning could be improved 14 an annual report many staff members feel overwhelmed by the different requests and are confused about t he roles of the multiple strategic documents how they are related and how best to use them during the interviews ocha staff voiced that these systems need to be brought together since both plans ultimately respond to similar humanitarian demands oios finds substantive reason why the two should not b aligned to bring more coherence and transparency to ochas planning and management56 figure 1 timeline of ochas internal planning and reporting framework57 21 review of the different planning documents shows that ochas approved budget fascicle contains six objectives 20 expected accomplishments and 28 indicators of chievement see annex iii in parallel the internal annual plan for 2007 consisted of three goals further translated into 21 annual objectives58 and recently shortened and sharpened to only 14 objectives59 with an average set of 4 indicators of achiev ement60 per each of the 64 organizational units when oios analyz ed the correspondence betwe the approved budget fascicle and ochas annual plan less than half of the reviewed eas could be traced from the 56for the year 2008 ocha has decided that its strategic planning framework should include number of core indicators to facilitate the assessment of the objectives it had formulated while keeping its organizational unit arrangements for operational accountabi lity of its different hq and field operations 57 ocha in 2007 page 30 58 these key objectives established the priority areas for the organization 59 newly issued strategic planning framework 2007 2009 as per ocha intranet httpochaonlineunorgstrategicplanningtabid656defaultaspx 60 some ioas varied amongst the different organizational units and some where at least similar 15 budget fascicle to the annual plan and fewer than 20 of the i oas from the budget fascicle could be traced back to the annual plan61 regarding its management arrangements oios note d that w hilst the strengthened internal planning mechanisms were placed under the newly created strategic planning unit spu and mainstreamed to all hq and fos the formal planning and monitoring process was somewhat obscured by its placement under focal point within the executive office62 oios noted that this arrangement has now been changed to ensure that the spu would have tuition over the two processes ocha had recognized from the outset that these two planning frameworks were cl early not aligned in content or organization this confirms lack of coherence and complementarities between the two and exacerbates the c onfusion and lack of productive use of the formal rbm process when further probed spu noted that while aware of these parallel tracks and the lack of coherence ocha was advised by oppba that there should not be any changes to strategic frameworks devel oped on the basis of the previous medium term plans oios notes that i naction in this area would mean enduring with two separate and inefficient planning monitoring and reporting systems for the next four years63 memorandum item 3 there is perception among programmessubprogrammes that rely on xb funds that the general assembly budgeting process is only devoted to rb ppbme regulation 55 states the proposed programme budget shall be programmed to include all activities whether financed from regular budget or extrabudgetary resources memorandum item 4 rbm will remain stagnant if built in planning rigidities do not allow for improvement of the programme frameworks and their further congruence 5 emphasis on attracting xb funding has render ed plann ing m anagement and strengthened rb support to core humanitarian functions behind oios notes the incongruence between the general assemblys recent calls for strengthen ing coordination of humanitarian assistance64 and ochas lamentation for more predict able and stable funding through the united nations regular budget 65 oios notes further that the emergence of the separate xb planning and reporting track involves direct risk for the general assembly being rendered ignorant of major changes in directio n of ochas organization and activity oios learned66 that enhancing emergency response field

only 29 of the total ochas activities in hq ny 61 based on an analysis of ochas subprogr amme 1 2 and 5 62 there is one focal point in hq new york and another one in geneva there is only one staff coordinator of the formal planning monitoring and reporting efforts 63 oios notes that the preparation of the formal strategic planning framewor k for the biennium 2010 2011 starts in october of 2007 64 ares62134 paragraphs 2 and 3 65 ocha in 2007 introduction page 10 2nd paragraph of the right column 66 ocha in 2007 annex ii 67 ocha in 2007 page 158 159 annex ii 16 and geneva were considered core68 and that only 66 staff members out of the total 10 18 staff are funded by the regular budget functions for strategic p lanning monit oring reporting and evaluation were mostly funded as projects and were not receiv ing funding commensurate to their responsibilities69 oios recalls that that in total projects represented approximately 82 of ochas total estimated budget fo r 200770 the xb funding enterprise and the proliferation of projects has equally contributed to n unclear definition of what constitutes core functions affecting ochas structure management arrangements and recruitment p ractices while ocha to large xtent has managed to achieve financial stability through mix of rb and xb funding particularly due to ochas efforts at strengthening its xb resource base this has not facilitated n strengthened rb support to core activities and management arrangement s which have especially affect ed the field offices71 oios notes that field office review has been undertaken in 2007 which might be useful to inform wider core function review and the need for more rb funding in support to regional basic humanitarian functions memorandum item 5 the necessity of supplementary funding has created need to develop different unconnected planning tracks that do not bring coherence and efficiency to the management of rbm and which confuse duplicate and are at odds wit h promoting effectiveness of programmes management responsibilities are ambiguous 22 oios noted that the growth of the xb funding is mirrored by ambiguity within ochas accountability frameworks review of the recent annual plans indicates that ocha has ma repeated adjustments to its organizational set up mostly to respond to changes in their xb funding oios noted with concer n the almost yearly realignment and restructuring since 200272 units have been created merge d shift ed restructur ed an d realign ed frequent ly the official secretary general bulletin on the organization of ocha dates back to 199973 but does not bear resemblance to the organizational arrangement actually applied oios noted approved terms of reference tor for every div ision or an aggregate approach to formulating branchs work plans that depart and inform the unit and section level work planning74 oios noted further that xb staff in the f were managed through undp encumbering l category posts technical assistance project personnel under the 200 series of staff rules some of whom were managers of 68 ocha in 2007 page 157 annex i 69 oios noted that important functions such as strategic planning work planning enterprise risk management programme performance monitoring reporting on senior manager compacts review of management reviews business continuity as well as strengthened accountability mechanisms through evaluations are all part of core support activities that need to be undertaken and that should be funded from more stable source 70 according to ochas projections the 82 million of fos and the 22 of pro jects in hq will be required in 2007 to implement its work programme in addition to the regular xb funding earmarked and the rb 71 reference is made to the fact that most of the fos are managed through l posts and that the core activities that ocha delivers in the regions as well as some in hq are mostly financed through xb resources 72 oios reviewed the organigrams in place since 2002 as available in ocha in 2002 ocha in 2003 ocha in 2004 ocha in 2005 and ocha in 2006 73 stsgb19998 available t httpwwwunorgdocsjournalaspwsaspmstsgb19998 74 recently spu has been making progress in bringing some coherence to aggregate level of planning but more congruence is needed 17 rosfos this practice is against established policies and constitutes challenge that should be confronted without delay as it will only further exacerbate differe nces and management problems over time75 23 oios noted that the mechanisms to assign and monitor individual responsibilities pas are not yet fully operational or used to their maximum benefit and in support of ochas rbm endeavors the epas compliance rat for all ocha staff was only 44 for the period 2005 200676 and about 10 of the p rofessional staff members for the 2006 2007 cycle 77 oios was f urther concern ed about the availability of onl 4 epasses for p5s and above levels for the 2005 2006 cycle78 in the subsequent 2006 2007 cycle it was admitted that only one p5 and above levels had completed the preparation of their epas work plans oios tried to link individual work plans to their current organizational unit work plans but given the poor availability of individual work plan data only limited analysis was possible 79 likewise oios noted that the main indicators of the hrac were not achieved for the cycle 2005 2006 and that the hrac compliance and performance information80 was not used consis tently as basis for decision making memorandum item 6 oios notes that while oppba serves as gatekeeper of the planning and budgeting process its role cannot serve as hindrance to maintaining logical coherence between mandates results framewo rks and operational work and it should not contribute to lessening the scrutiny the ga has over an entitys programme of work 6 performance reporting is render ed largely from anecdotal data 24 aside from the recurrent practice of elaborating an annual re port ocha has recently introduced two events that endeavour to mainstream culture of continuous learning through periodic monitoring 81 the midyear review myr and the end ofcycle review just introduced in 2007 will help ocha to strengthen accounta bility to donors for the resources used to partners for their support and ultimately to vulnerable populations82 however oios noted that 9 6 out of the 64 organization units did not submit their myr 83 also oios 75 to regularize the situation management should clearly establish which posts are under the 100 series and which are under the 200 series within the framework of revised tor and functions of the different organizational entities and the revi sion of what constitutes core activities in ocha conduct classification exercise and issue vacancy announcements in accordance with established rules and procedures noting that instead of one year contracts staff should be getting fixed term contracts for at least 2 years even if they are financed through xb 76 see hrac and the pas compliance report by ohrm in the lan folder 77 2 p1 7p2 14p3 11p4 1p5 email m h 27082007 1230 pm 78 email from m ross of 14 august 2007 79 oios reviewed the five passes ocha provided from the hq level only seven out of the 24 goals less than one third could be traced to have been based on the budget fascicle a606 the pas reviewed were for sectionbranch chief positions that are directly responsi ble to oversee that ocha is focusing on the right issues 80 vacancy management geographic distribution pas compliance and staff development are indicators of hr accountability where ocha has to still make considerable improvements 81 aside from just monitoring this approach includes awareness and use of performance information 82 results based planning monitoring and reporting for 2008 page 15 first paragraph 83 namely office of usg executive officeadministrative office geographical coordinati on monitoring section promotion of the humanitarian agenda section phas and the fo in the republic of congo and sri lanka 18 noted that quality of reporting pra ctices are still weak there are mechanisms to systematically coordinat the collection of data and portfolio of evidence to document ioa facts and figures as data collection plans ve not been established the reports oios reviewed were mainly based on informal estimates f performance rather than evidenced based information84 slight majority of the external stakeholders were general ly satisfied with the performance information projected by ocha s annual reports while 53 of stakeholder respons to oios survey rated ocha performance reports to be of high quality 25 considered the results reporting to be sufficient 85 on the other hand some donors and stakeholders express ed concern about the reliability of ochas reporting the stakeholder survey indicated that the external users primarily look ed for updates on coordination efforts in operations updates on disaster information and other general information and planning and results information86 in that order while oios had means of verifying every single performance data point available in ochas annual report it noted that to the degree that results data are available the are mostly anecdotal there is direct reference to indicators of achievement baselines and targets to show the degree of progress in achieving objectives oios found that oc has monitoring and reporting instructions are still very flexible and general in linking evidence with results87 oios found that ochas compliance with results analysis and use of ioas data is at the lower end amongst s ecretariat departments88 memorandum item 7 while the monitoring and reporting segments are important elements of the implementation of rbm ultimately their relevance is defined by how reliable the data collected re and how credible the results information is to the entitys stakeholders 25 the spu while responsible for establish ing guidelines and setting mechanisms in place to track results and ensur the quality of the reporting has means of verifying the validity and veracity of the results reported or outputs implemented89 refinements to indicators90 and templates to track myr performance are worthy initiative s but their ability to adequately capture outcomes and fully reflect ocha s updated results is sti ll questionable quality assurance mechanism would infuse ochas results paradigm desirable measure of credibility and instill further stakeholders confidence in ochas work 84 in the case of sudan work p lan reporting was recognized to be based on what managers though t was possible to achieve rather th an what was actually verified 85 q4 external stakeholder survey 25 rated ochas systems and materials for reporting results achieved to be sufficient whereas 53 said the reporting was of high quality 86 q6 external stakeholder survey 30 mentioned t his item 87 results based planning and monitoring for 2008 page 25 part 22 the annual monitoring plan still requires that headquarters entities and fieldregional offices are required to report against the different indicators listed in their respectiv work plans in generic terms emphasis added oios 88 see annex 6 that shows that out of 20 expected accomplishments for the biennium 2006 2007 ocha has only been able to report on results statements for three of them 15 reporting it has also submi tted accomplishment accounts for the biennium 89 interviews with members of the spu confirmed that currently they do not have the capacity to check the veracity of results and that establishing protocols which would make the process more credible would be beneficial to strengthening the monitoring and reporting process 90 as noted in the recent revision of the core ocha performance indicators 6 july 2007 19 memorandum item 8 quality assurance at the planning monitoring and repo rting stages is critical element to obtaining credible and reliable data that can support and inform decision making and further the implementation of rbm 7 planning and monitoring functions would benefit from more strengthening and consultati ve approach 26 ochas leadership has positively supported and pushed for th strengthening of planning function oios noted with concern that while foros had been i ncreasingly participating in the strengthening of the internal planning processes they had not been more widely consulted n the elaboration of the strategic planning framework 2007 2009 prior to the most recent adjustment to the strategic planning instrument91 22 of the respondents92 mentioned that goals objectives and indicators were imposed rath er than consulted this is an area where spu itself has recognized that improvements were needed ie by opening the consultation mechanisms to wider participation providing feedback on the elaboration of plans and most importantly on monitoring and repo rting efforts and initiatives 27 factor that negatively affects staffs ability to meaningfully take part in planning consultations is their perceived lack of rbm congruent training interviewees and survey respondents indicated low understand ing of rbm its definition r what it entailed 93 available survey data indicates that fifty of the 71 respondents 70 had rbm related training 94 oios noted that the spu and the ess which are to operate as change agents in strengthening organizational learnin g accountability still have limited capacity95 or influence ov er the decision making process at mid level management96 both units can give advice regarding strategic decision making but cannot directly participate in the decision making process provide strategic guidance on priorities gaps lessons learned as they do not have any official status in the senior mana gement team oios believes that bringing ess and spu together maintaining clear division of responsibilities and allowing the ess to repor t directly to the head of the organization would help to strengthen the accountability and lessons learnt functions within the organization97 memorandum item 9 compulsory individual accountability mechanisms such as pas should not only be implemented but they should be fully in line with the organizational internal accountability frameworks for rbm to be coherent 91 strategic planning session was undertaken on 6 august 2007 where some representatives of t he different components in ocha including one or two members of the fos or ros network participated 92 question 15 staff survey 93 in the staff survey q5 one third of the respondents said they had understanding of rbm 94 q2 of the staff survey 95 both units have more than 6 staff three each 96 both units have chiefs at the p5 level and do not participate in the s mt with decision making voice 97 there is lack of clarity how they inform the planning process 20 8 decisions regarding resource s are not taken based on past performance 28 oios noted that m ore than half of its survey respondents stated that performance measures did not greatly influence resource allocation nor did they use performance information to adjust their work programme 98 during interview s too it was confirmed that the relevance of rbm s basis for decision making was perceiv ed as poor99 oios recalls that commencing in 2007 the revision of ocha cost plans was combined with the myr process nd assessed by the pfrg oios noted that paramount consideration was purely financial with the basic question in approving revised allo tments being whether the entity in question was going to be able to spend the funds rather than whether they will be able to achieve the targeted results additionally oios noted that currently the role of the pfrg to comprehensively review work plans for coherence and alignment are not fully being implemented 100 in light of programmatic performance historical or prospective appearing to be of little relevance it can be surprise that p rogrammatic p erformance assessments are perceived above all as com pliance requirement s or paper exercise rather than an opportunity to reflect on possible performance improvements 9 organizational learn ing process is underdeveloped 29 lesson learning reviews llr were established in 2002 along with the creation of t he evaluation and studies section ess with th purpose of learning from past experience s and incorporating lessons learned into future activities programming and to contribut to institutional memory ess is responsible for the management of portfoli of lessons learned and conducting llrs whilst lessons learned and good practices are available in the analysis and findings of some of the 33 evaluations and reviews ess has been part of or managed since 2002 101 oios noted that there was structure d practical and comprehensive r epository of lessons learned good practices case studies and protocols accumulating the body of ochas expertise the same was the case for cross cutting issues such as management of field offices regional hub preparedness or response to disaster situations oios agrees with the statement of staff member to the effect that ocha is good at identifying lessons and sometimes continuously identif ying the same lessons but learning them and applying them is completely different issue it is evident as recognized by ess itself102 that the use of information sharing and knowledge management opportunities has not yet taken hold also there is little support for undertaking self evaluations on particular projects output s and topics relevant to specific fos or 98 focal points interviewed expressed this concern geneva and new york and it was also evident from the responses received through the survey ie q3 99 the overwhelming response during interviews on how the performance information was used to inform decision making was either never or rarel 100 oios noted the disjointed formal planning process and the annual planning framework to show that the pfrg has not done much regarding the alignment of the planning processes 101 ess participated in 17 inter agency evaluations and managed 16 internal evaluations to date details are available in their webpage httpochaonlineunorgaboutochaor ganigrammepolicydevelopmentandstudiesbranchpdsbevaluationandst

ess recently introduced realtime evaluations rte s as an approach that aims at assisting in the id entification of weaknesses and lessons learned while an operation is being deployed and implemented oios was not able to obtain guidelines and proced ures on how rtes are undertaken given the fact that they are organized by the ess and carried out by ext ernal consultants they cannot be considered selfevaluations guidance or policy instructions on how or when to undertake self evaluations are still not av ailable oios noted that utilizing any potential tool for enhancing organizational learning and co llection of lessons learned is in line with ess improved accountability strategy 105 10 evaluation s lack programmatic coverage independence and systematic follow up 30 since its creation the ess has participated in 17 interagency evaluations and has coordinate d and undertaken 16 ocha specific evaluations 106 oios noted that out of the there were four project evaluations four llrs six thematic evaluations and two evaluations related to country operations arguably of the total 1 6 only the last two might q ualify as programmatic evaluations107 aside from these the focus of evaluations has not been programmatic as required by the ppbme moreover in defining the role of evaluation oios noted that this programmatic emphasis was not included at all in the test ocha evaluation framework and strategy for 2002 2005 oios also n oted that tracking and follow up on the implementation of recommendations remains challenge108 the ess 2007 work plan does not include specific output directly related to the establ ishment of tracking mechanism and follow up arrangements on the implementation of recommendations109 finally oios noted that the ess has structured system for selecting evaluation topics oios believes that ess could clearly benefit from applying risk assessment f ramework as basis for selecti ng its evaluation topics guidelines for the application of risk assessment framework have already been provided in the 2008 work planning and monitoring guidelines which ess should make use of oios note d that ess report ing lines are linked to

programme managers shall in collaboration with their staff undertake self evaluation of all subprogrammes under their re sponsibility iii recommendations 31 recommendation 1 with the cooperation of oppba ocha should harmonize its annual planning framework with the formal biennial planning processes112 to bring coherence to all logical framework components regardless of their so urce of funding this harmonization should be done in time for the 2010 2011 formal planning cycle but also consider any neces sary adjustments that can be made to the approved programme of work for 2008 2009 113 aiming at having one programme plan for all ocha paras 2 021 sp07006001 32 recommendation 2 ocha should conduct review of the core activities mandates organizational structures and functions to

comprehensive plan and be endorsed by the ga in its normal budget review and approval process 113 the annual planning cycle would require 2 work planning sessions where as the biennial cycle would require only one there could also be some streamlining by combining the cost p lan reviews with the mid year reviews and endofcycle reviews that would yield to the preparation of only three reports per biennium rather than four as it is currently the case ie 2 ocha in 200x and 2 annual reports vs 1 biennial plan 1first year nnual report which includes revisions to cost plans and adjustments and 1 end ofbiennium report 23 36 recommendation 6 ocha should initiative an rbm training programme that includes the provision of guida nce and advice on the different aspects of the rbm process initiatives such as train thetrainers web interfaces and training should be considered to further mainstream the rbm efforts separate training organized for p5 levels and above should als be considered mak ing emphasis on the management roles and responsibilities in moving the process forward114 in response to recent recommendation by the cpc115 28 sp07006 006 37 recommendation 7 spu
