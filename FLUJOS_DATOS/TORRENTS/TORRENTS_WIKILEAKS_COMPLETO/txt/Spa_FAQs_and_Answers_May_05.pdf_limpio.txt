setting up maharishi vedic health spa frequently asked questions do we need to have resting rooms resting rooms are not necessary for spa it is more costeffective to use 2 rooms as 2 treatment rooms rather than as 1 treatment room and 1 resting room is it better to have private bathrooms in each treatment room or locker rooms for ladies and for men it is best to have two upscale locker rooms for ladies and for men rather than private baths in each treatment room the locker rooms can be small one shower one toilet sink and 2 lockers for example locker rooms allow us to move people out of the treatment rooms more quickly how man rooms do we need for the spa we could start with 2 treatment rooms ladies are 2 to 3 times more likely to use spa services so we need to take that into consideration it would be good to have some flexibility with the use of the rooms what should the ideal rental space include access to utility sink is important for cleaning pots and equipment showers are ideal but not absolutely necessary toilet sink within our space is important verses going out of our rental space to use public restroom we want to find the ideal situation but we dont want to fail to rent space because we cannot find the ideal situation find the best situation that you can find and then we can think creatively about how to overcome any limitations where there is will there is way what oils do we use in the spa treatments mapi oils for vata pitta and kapha can be used for most treatments it is acceptable to dilute the oils with cured heated sesame oil we can choose the oils according to the season if someone has sensitive skin or if they get rashes or outbreaks easily then we should use olive oil to dilute the pitta oil we can dilute as much as 12 parts plain oil to 1 part mapi oil soon we will have new graha oils that will pacify the grahas and will be prescribed according to the guests birth time all mapi oils have beneficial value so we do not worry too much about which oil is used just follow the seasonal guidelines vata oil for vata season pitta oil for pitta season kapha oil for kapha season mapi will supply the herbs to be used to create the herbalized steam for the swedana mapi will supply all that is used in the 10 step royal facial treatment this includes oil cream eye compress clay etc mapi or the raj will supply raw silk gloves for the garshana treatment how do we know which treatments to recommend to the guests those guests with high blood pressure should not take the swedana steam treatment those with very sensitive skin prone to itching rashes and eruptions should have olive oil rather than sesame oil used during their massage the vishesh treatment should not be recommended to slight thin delicate people otherwise the licensed massage therapists lmt will determine appropriateness of treatment for the guests they have been trained to question guests in order to determine if guest should not receive treatment how
