landowner agrees not to develop property section 12204 of the food and energy security act of 2007 hr 2419 as passed by the senate would create new tax credit for taxpayers who agree to protect qualified species for specified amount of time under an approved plan the proposed credit is graduated so that taxpayers who grant more significant restrictions on their property are able to claim larger credit the intent of the proposed credit is that in exchange for forfeiting the development right the landowner will receive tax benefit the species will gain from having its habitat protected and the public will have the benefit of conserved property providing tax incentives for conservation is not new currently taxpayers may deduct charitable donations made for conservation purposes under internal revenue code irc 170 some say the proposed credit will provide needed incentive to private landowners to protect at risk species others state that the program may be too broad to enforce adequately noting that there have been abuses of the tax deduction provided by irc 170 another point of view is that the credit favors temporary efforts disproportionately to permanent conservation and would not provide the public with good value for the tax credit given this report will review conservation easements generally and discuss issues related to the proposed credit in section 12204 of hr 2419 as passed by the senate in particular the housepassed version of hr 2419 does not include the tax credit provision the senate has insisted on its amendment of hr 2419 and requested conference house and senate staff are engaged in active discussion the same tax credit provision is found in the heartland habitat harvest and horticulture act of 2007 s 2242 and similar proposals are included in the habitat and land conservation act of 2007 s 2223 and the endangered species recovery act of 2007 hr 1422 and s 700 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34338g14g142g144g138g149g561g3g151g138g149

centuries ago and have been refined by state case law generally an easement allows one property to be used to benefit another property often an easement is viewed as property right allowing an owner of neighboring land to use adjoining property such as for driveway or beach access however easements can also be granted to benefit the public more generally such as in the case of the easement taken around copley square in boston limiting the height of buildings so th at historic buildings would not be overwhelmed3 as also shown by the copley square easement easements do not have to grant access to tracts of land less tangible property rights may be conveyed for example the easements for light and air allowed in new york city whereby one property conveys its right to light and open space above its building to another easements are more than mere agreement between two parties they are described as running with the land meaning they attach to the property not to the people agreeing to them to accomplish this the easements must do more than grant mere personal right to the property for private easements there must be some sort of connection between the properties that creates reason for the easement and conveys benefit the agreement must have all the formality of deed such as being filed and should state that the easement runs with the land when an easement has been conveyed the property that has the benefit of the easement is known as the dominant estate the property upon which the easement exists is known as the servient estate in the case of the public easements such as is described above in the copley square case the dominant estate is held by the public as w hole when the terms of the easement mean the servient estate is prevented from unfettered use of the property it is known as negative 1 an identical provision is found in the heartland habitat harvest and horticulture act of 2007 s 2242 and similar provisions are included in the habitat and land conservation act of 2007 s 2223 and the endangered species recovery act of 2007 hr 1422 and s 700 2 for more information on hr 2419 see crs report rl34696 the 2008 farm bill ma jor provisions and legislative

use the property in limited way such as the right to travel across land conservation easement is relatively new form of property compared to the long history of easements it is most similar to public easement and is form of negative easement because it restricts landowners from using their property in certain ways conservation easement preserves the land in the condition it is at the time of the conveyance one could be granted for several reasonsto preserve undeveloped property to achieve open space goals of community to maintain agricultural land or to preserve land for the benefit of wildlife for example to some extent it could be argued that the conservation easement is hybrid of negative easement and an affirmative easement as discussed earlier it does prohibit landowner from using their property at will however it also could allow the right of access especially in the instance of easements provided for wildlife protection scientific observation or monitoring could be required in that instance or an affirmative easement could occur in the case of conservation easement that requires public access in order to qualify for tax benefits

under current law taxpayer who donates conservation easement to governmental unit or taxexempt organization may be able to deduct the donation as charitable contribution4 the donation must meet three requirements first it must be of qualified real property interest of which perpetual easement is one type second the donation must be made to qualifying organization such as governmental unit or public charity third it must be made exclusively for conservation purpose conservation purposes are 1 the preservation of land for outdoor recreation by or the education of the general public 2 the protection of natural habitat of fish wildlife or plants or similar ecosystems 3 the preservation of open space for the scenic enjoyment of the general public or pursuant to clearly delineated

claim the endangered species recovery and restoration credit the taxpayer would be required to enter into qualified habitat prot ection agreement this agreement would need to 1 include habitat management plan agreed to by the appropriate secretary5 and the taxpayer 2 be consistent with any applicable recovery plan approved for qualified species under the 3 be certified by the appropriate secretary as contributing to the recovery of qualified species and 4 require technical assistance be provided to taxpayers for carrying out their duties under the plan the habitat management plan required under the agreement must identify at least one qualified species to be protected the plan could restore or enhance the qualified species habitat or reduce threats to the species through habitat management the plan would need to describe the habitats current condition threats to the species that the plan was intended to reduce management practices to be undertaken by the taxpayer and technical assistance to be provided to the taxpayer the plan would also need to provide deadlines relating to and require monitoring of the undertaking of the management practices and the expected responses of the species and its habitat the new credit would distinguish between qualified habitat protection agreements on the basis of whether or not the agreement included an easement the taxpayer could grant an easement for the protection of qualified species habitat to the secretaries of the interior commerce agriculture or defense or to state the granting of such an easement and its length would affect the amount of the credit that could be claimed as discussed below the bill would classify agreements into three categories agreements in which the taxpayer granted an easement in perpetuity agreements in which the taxpayer granted an easement for period of at least 30 years and any other agreements in which the taxpayer agreed to protect the qualified species habitat for specified period of time g5g155g142g141g146g157g561g3g150g152g158g151g157g561 as mentioned there are two components to the endangered species recovery and restoration credit the habitat restoration credit and the habitat protection easement credit the habitat restoration credit is based on the costs paid or incurred during the year pursuant to the habitat management plan the habitat protection easement credit is based on the value of any easement granted by the taxpayer under the habitat protection agreement 5 under the bill the appropriate secretary generally refers to the secretary of the interior or the secretary of commerce httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34338g14g142g144g138g149g561g3g151g138g149 g162g156g146g156g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g5g152g151g156g142g155g159

easement granted for at least 30 years and 3 50 of those costs in all other cases the costs for which the credit could be claimed would be reduced by the amount of any financing provided under federal or state program that subsidized financing for the conservation of qualified species habitat additionally the costs would not include thos paid to comply with any federal state or local requirement other than those paid or incu rred under the agreement the taxpayers eligible to claim the credit would be both the property owners who entered into the habitat protection agreement and any parties who agreed to assume responsibility for the costs of its implementation the habitat protection easement credit would equal 1 the reduction in the propertys value due to the habitat protection agreement if such agreement included an easement granted in perpetuity essentially the value of the easement 2 75 of the reduction if the agreement included an easement granted for at least 30 years essentially 75 of the easements value and 3 zero in all other cases only the property owner who gr anted the easement would be eligible for the credit the credit would be reduced by any amount the taxpayer received in connection with the easement and would be disallowed if the taxpayer failed to provide the irs with qualified appraisal of the property several limitations apply to the amount that could be claimed as the credit including the allocation limitations discussed in the next section g3g149g149g152g140g138g157g146g152g151g561g14g146g150g146g157g156g561 taxpayers could claim the credit only if it had been allocated to them by the treasury secretary the bill would set nationwide limit on the amount that could be allocated annually and provides for new credit allocations after 2012 for each year from 2008 through 2012 the treasury secretary in consultation with the secretaries of the interior and commerce could allocate 290 million for habitat protection agreements with perpetual easements 55 million for agreements with 30year easements and 35 million for all other agreements the treasury secretary would be required to establish by regu lation within 180 days of the acts enactment and in consultation with the secretaries of the interior and commerce program to process applications for the credit priority under the program would be given to taxpayers with agreements relating to habitats that would significantly increase the likelihood of recovering and delisting an endangered or threatened species that are costeffective and would maximize the benefit

disfavored under common law the reason is that except for public easements easements must benefit neighboring or appurtenant property conservation easement c ould be seen as benefitting only the property itself since it is only conserving that area or it could be labeled as an easement in gross which is an easement the use of which it is not dependent on owning dominant estate easements in gross are subject to challenge as they can be characterized as more of personal agreement rather than true property right courts look at whether easements touch and concern land to determine whether the agreement is more than mere contract there is pat test for when an agreement touches and concerns the land to succeed either the benefit or the burden of the agreement must directly affect land rather than an individual an argument could be made that adjoining properties benefit from undeveloped preserved space next door however under this proposed legislation adjoining properties probably would not be the easement holders second problem that can occur when the easement is held by someone other than neighbor is that the oversight neighbor provides is lost common law easements could be monitored daily by the landowner next door 7 in the case of statutorily mandated easement the easement holder could be thousands of miles away 7 for discussion of the problems with conservation

habitat protection easements to receive tax benefits either tax credit in the amount of value the property loses by entering the easement if permanent easement or up to 75 percent of that value if 30year easement is entered the 30year easement has recent precedent under the healthy forest restoration act of 20038 that law provided tax credit of up to 75 percent to landowners who issued 30year easement to restore and enhance habitat for species listed under the 30year easement appears to contradict the basic distinction between an easement and contract as mentioned earlier an easement is co nsidered property right not contract it is presumed to last as long as the land based on this fundamental concept of easements 30year term is more in the nature of an agreement between parties than it is property right under the proposed provision property owner could enter 30year easement and obtain tax credit worth 75 percent of the value lost and still have the full use of the property after 30 years considering the enduring nature of property and of species protection 30 years may not be significant time period other landowners would be restricting development on their property permanently for just 25 percent more in tax cr edits some question the relative value of the benefit to the public compared to the tax benefit received by the landowner

be involved in each agreement it is possible for three parties to be involved the easement holder which would be an agency or state the agency that approves the habitat management plan and the agency that enforces the easement easement holders could come from many sources under the bill the easements would be held by the secretary of the interior the secretary of commerce the secretary of agriculture the secretary of defense or state each of these agencies would need system to keep track of easements that they hold and in the case of the department of the interior doi also track the habitat management plans they have approved the irs would have to track these agreements too these parties could each have enforcement responsibilities as easement holders traditionally ensure the easement is in place and this bill implies that enforcement would be allowed by either the irs or the easement holder there could be conflicts among the parties with the right to enforce if there were disagreements as to whether the terms of the easement had been met the habitat management plan would be approved by either doi or the department of commerce doc however it is not clear which agency w ould consider whether the easement is consistent with section 4 of the as required by the bill also the habitat management plan is referred to as an agreement but it is not clear whether or what enforcement rights the doi or doc would have as parties to that agreement again there could be conflict between what doi or doc considered breach in the terms of that agreement and whether the easement holder considered the terms of the agreement broken 8 pl 108148 title v 117 stat 1887 dec 3 2003 16 usc 6501 the healthy forests reserve program

usc 1538 and some special rules may prohibit harming threatened species see cfr title 50 this means that landowners are already prohibited from modifying their property in way that could harm an endangered species9 in those cases where an endangered species exists the habitat conservation easement could be viewed as landowner receiving compensation for obeying the law in the case of endangered qualified species the only difference between the status quo and the habitat protection easement is the habitat management plan on the other hand it could be seen more in the nature of compensation for taking of property right in that case the shortterm easement is less meaningful as constitutional taking is said to be permanent restriction on the use of property 9 an analogous situation occurred where taxpayers claimed historic property benefit even though under local law their property was already restricted under historic preservation laws because the taxpayers did not

donations under irc 170 according to the internal revenue service and the irs commissioner testified in 2006 that the agency has seen abuses that compromise the policies and the public benefit that congress intended to promote10 similar problems could surface with this credit program for example it appears that determining whether an easement or underlying agreement is in compliance with the law could require site visits nearly impossible task for the irs and the other agencies that would be involved in addition to factintensive re views there is also the problem that some of these easements and their attendant habitat management plans are intended to be enforced in perpetuity case law illustrates the complexities in enforcing conservation easements for one thing compliance is based on sitespecific facts for example to find whether wildlife sanctuary was serving its conservation purpose for state tax credit court had to review what public access was available to the site 11 in one case under irc 170 easements for conserving property along lake michigan were designed to preserve natural resources including habitat for threatened plants while also allowing the taxpayers to build additional footpaths to the beach construct boathouse trim trees and move plants in determining the permissibility of the claimed deduction courts closely looked at the easements with the sixth circuit concluding that they were carefully drawn to prohibit any activity or use of the encumbered property that would undermine their stated conservation purpose 12 there may also be concern about possible overvalu ation of the easements for purposes of the charitable contribution deduction under irc 170 the value of an easement is generally determined by comparing the value of property subject to the easement with and without the restriction 13 donations are subject to substantiation and appraisal requirements even with these safeguards there have been concerns about taxpayers overvaluing easements in determining the amount of the deduction14 and similar concerns could be raised with the credit program another enforcement issue could arise with credit recapture under the bill the treasury secretary is directed to promulgate regulations for recapturing the credit should taxpayers fail to carry out their duties under the habitat protection agreement and there are other available means to remediate such failure the recapture provision appears unusual in that it requires there be other means available to remedy the taxpayers noncompliance rather than simply requiring

plan the intent of the proposed credit is that in exchange for forfeiting the development right to property the landowner will receive tax benefit the habitat of endangered or threatened species will be protected and the public will have the benefit of conserved property and protected species while environmentalists and landowners appear united in wanting method of conserving property in exchange for tax credit some aspects of this proposed legislation could complicate the public benefit intended those factors include an uncertain enforcement scheme in which several agencies could be involved difficulty in monitoring compliance due to the scope of the program and uncertain provisions allowing access to the property and the temporary nature of some of the protections provided
