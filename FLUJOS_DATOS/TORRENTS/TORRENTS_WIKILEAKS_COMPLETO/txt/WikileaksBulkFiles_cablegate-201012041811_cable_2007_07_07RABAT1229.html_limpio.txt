security service the chief of the national police the minister of interior and his deputy senior royal advisor townsend thanked her hosts for moroccos excellent cooperation in the global war on terrorism including significant efforts to shut down the foreign fighter pipeline to iraq the moroccans affirmed that they highly value security cooperation and support from the usg as they continue to confront substantial and growing terror threat that extends across north africa and the sahel townsend also visited the sites of twin suicide bombings near the us consulategeneral and the private american language center and received briefing on efforts to augment security for us buildings and personnel in the city end summary 2 snf frances fragos townsend assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism was hosted for july 7 working lunch in rabat by yassine mansouri chief of the external studies directorate general dged moroccos premier intelligence agency joining the lunch were abdelatif hammouchi directorgeneral for territorial surveillance dgst which has the lead on domestic counterterrorism operations and charki draiss chief of the national police force dgsn townsend was accompanied by ambassador riley adnan kifayat and john pearson of the nsc staff and emboffs 3 snf welcoming townsend to morocco dged chief mansouri affirmed that the country has enjoyed longstanding and very cooperative security relationship with the usg to the benefit of both sides townsend expressed us satisfaction with the security relationship and particular gratitude for moroccos robust efforts to shut down the foreign fighter pipeline to iraq the moroccans made clear that stopping foreign fighters bound for iraq or other destinations was major gom priority 4 snf dgst chief hammouchi noted that morocco has disrupted 83 different terrorist cells since the 2003 casablanca bombings number of cells identified have had connections to the algerian gspc he noted mansouri added that the terrorist adversary is very strategically minded and is always seeking ways to maximize the impact of attacks by exploiting outside events townsend strongly agreed the timing of the attempted car bombs in london and the glasgow airport attack to coincide with the transition from the blair to the brown government was case in point she opined 5 snf townsend asked her hosts about the goms approach to monitoring and controlling materials that can be precursors to explosives tatp which was used in the april attacks in morocco is made from readily available ingredients she noted hammouchi stated that the broad availability of explosive precursors was source of frustration for the gom he recalled case in which violent jihadist had sent his wife on 38 separate trips in multiple cities to buy hydrogen peroxide from pharmacies our only weapon against this phenomenon is information hammouchi opined 6 snf the security chiefs underlined their conviction that the terrorist threat to morocco was transnational in nature at least 12 cells wrapped up in recent years have had direct connections to groups operating in algeria northern mali and spain of particular concern is recent information that number of individuals in terror camps in northern mali have moved from training units to operational units this information and the approach of important events on moroccos political calendar such as the fete du throne throne day and the parliamentary elections in early september prompted morocco to elevate its alert level on july 5 7 snf townsend asked the security chiefs for their assessment of ct cooperation between the countries of the maghreb region cooperation with the algerians was erratic hammouchi assessed sometimes they provide very good information and sometimes it seems like oneway street they make difficult partners mansouri added speculating that they still suffered psychic trauma from their bloody rabat 00001229 002 of 003 struggle against terror in the 1990s battle they fought largely on their own security cooperation with libya has been good mansouri noted they are ready to work with us and exchange information there has been an improvement in cooperation with the tunisians as well he continued though he opined that they are still prone to denial in assessing the terror threat 8 snf turning to the ideological front in the war on terror the security chiefs affirmed that ct disruption and preemption operations alone were not sufficient to defeat the enemy we have had to become involved in the ideological battle even if this isnt our business hammouchi stated unfortunately political and diplomatic restraints often limit our ability to act he added citing president bush townsend affirmed the us belief that the war of words and ideas is core theater of battle but often an area where muslim leaders can be more effective than americans 9 snf townsend asked about lines of authority within the moroccan government in pursuing the ideological battle against terrorists mansouri responded that there was diffusion of authority with the security agencies the ministry of communications and the ministry of religious affairs all countering extremism in different ways townsend observed that this mirrored the diffusion of counterextremist efforts in the usg but wondered if both systems wouldnt benefit from centralization of efforts 10 snf subsequent to the lunch minister of interior chakib benmoussa welcomed townsend the ambassador nsc staff and emboffs to his office the minister was joined by ministerdelegate fouad ali himma who as longstanding friend and close advisor of king mohammed vi is generally considered more powerful than the minister and senior moi officials khalid zerouali mohieddine amzazi noureddine benbrahim and abderahmane achour 11 snf affirming her appreciation of strong bilateral security cooperation townsend asked her hosts for more background on moroccos recent decision to elevate its state of alert the minister said that information developed following recent arrests of moroccans in the uk spain and morocco continuing stream of general threat information and upcoming events including the fete du throne and the legislative elections all prompted moroccan security officials to conclude that it would be prudent to elevate the alert level 12 snf townsend expressed understanding mentioning the usgs experience that it was relatively easy to raise the alert level but more difficult to bring it back down explaining such decisions to the public was always tricky she added himma agreed that the relationship between the security services and the public was crucially important and merited constant attention educating the public about the nature of the threat and enlisting them as allies is particularly important he added 13 snf defending the malikite rite of islam native to morocco against intolerant theological strains flowing out of the middle east was major priority for king mohammed vi and his government himma emphasized he asserted that in morocco our people are religious and conservative but not fundamentalist our rite is completely opposed to radical theology himma cited recent efforts to overhaul and upgrade the religious education system in the country traditionally subsidized by the monarchy the gom is working hard to strike balance between moroccan tradition and modernity seeking to take the best from both himma also cited the kings human development initiative launched in 2005 as an important piece of the counterextremist puzzle 14 snf townsend complimented the minister for moroccos apparent success in integrating various elements of the gom involved in countering terror and extremism into cohesive team himma affirmed that the gom strives to work as one integrated unit and also lauded the strong security cooperation morocco enjoys with countries like the us and spain but our ambition is even higher himma continued we would like to have the same level of coordination and cooperation with our neighboring countries particularly algeria 15 snf recalling visit to algiers as the kings personal envoy himma asserted that repeated moroccan efforts rabat 00001229 003 of 003 to bridge the diplomatic chasm had been rebuffed he claimed that he had told the algerians that morocco was prepared to reopen its border and take any of number of other confidence building measures but the algerians would never tell us what they want he attributed what he described as algerian intransigence to generational and mindset gap between the leaderships of the two countries noting that algiers was the next stop on her multicountry itinerary townsend said she would encourage the goa to expand security cooperation with morocco and to work hard to realize broader rapprochement with its neighbor 16 snf prior to her arrival in rabat townsend visited the us consulate general in casablanca which was targeted during twin suicide bomb attack on april 14 the cg rso and emboffs briefed townsend on the incident showing her the site of the bomb which detonated near the consulate general and the
