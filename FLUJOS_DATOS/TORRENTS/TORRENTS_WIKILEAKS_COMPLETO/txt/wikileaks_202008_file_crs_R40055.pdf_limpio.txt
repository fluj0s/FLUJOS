provisions requiring that parental consent be obtained prior to providing special education or related services to child with disability 4 however the statute does not specifically address the issue of what responsibilities the lea has when child has been receiving special education services and parent wishes to revoke consent for such services previously ed had interpreted the statute and regulations to prohibit the unilateral withdrawal of child from special education in most circumstances5 the new regulations reverse this interpretation to allow parents to unilaterally withdraw their child from the receipt of special education services6 but require that the revocation be in writing7 the department described the rationale for the new provision as continuation of the parents right to consent to services allowing parents to revoke consent for the continued provision of special education and related services at any time is consistent with the ideas emphasis on the role of parents in protecting their childs rights and the departments goal of enhancing parent involvement and choice in their childs education8 the regulations do not allow lea to use mediation or due process procedures to override parents decision to refuse to consent to further 1 20 usc 1400 et seq 2 73 fed reg 73006 dec 1 2008 3 for discussion of idea generally see crs report rs22590 the individuals

violation of the fape requirement if the child was not provided with special education or related services because of the parents revocation of consent10 in addition the regulations specifically provide that if the parents revoke consent the lea is not required to amend the childs records to remove references to the childs receipt of special education services11 ed described the rationale for not requiring changes in the childs records by observing that parents revocation of consent is not retroactive 12 the new regulations allowing for parental revocation of consent for idea services have generally been supported by parents groups13 one parent advocate has observed that allowing parental revocation of consent may prompt districts to heed parents requests for inclusiveness in the face of pressures to pull children out14 however other commentators have seen the new approach as undermining the team approach to decisionmaking15 in addition parents revocation of consent for special education may affect how the child is included fo r accountability purposes under the child left behind act nclba ed addressed this issue in its comments on the regulations noting that state may include child whose parents revoke consent for special education in the special education subgroup of purposes of calculating the annual yearly progress ayp for two years following parental revocation of consent16 however although ed does not expect the revision to affect ayp under the nclba one commentator has argued that there may be more of an effect than expected since if student needed special education services students scores may be weaker on state tests without those services 17 the regulations allowing parental revocation of consent for idea services also create some uncertainties regarding the childs coverage under section 504 of the rehabilitation act and the americans with disabilities act ada several federal statutes notably the individuals with disabilities education act sect ion 504 of the rehabilitation act 18 and the americans with disabilities act ada19 address the rights of individuals with disabilities to education some children who do not receive special education services under idea may receive them under section 504 and the ada20 several commenters on the regulations raised issues regarding whether section 504 and ada prot ections would continue to apply to student when parent revokes consent for idea services commenters also noted that ed had previously stated that under section 504 children with disabilities may not be disciplined for behavior that is manifestation of their disabilities if that disciplinary action constitutes change of placement and 9 34 cfr 300300b4 73 fed reg 73027 dec 1 2008 10 34 cfr 300300b4iii 73 fed reg 73027 dec 1

addressed the issue of whether individuals with special knowledge but who are not attorneys may represent parties at due process hearings in 1981 letter from theodore sky acting general counsel of the department of education to the honorable frank b brouillet the department had previously interpreted section 615h of the act and implementing regulations as allowing both attorneys and nonattorneys to perform the same functions at due process hearings25 however ed specifically rejected this previous interpretation in 2000 decision by the delaware supreme court in in the matter of arons26 held that lay advocate who represented families of children with disabilities in due process hearings had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law 2006 survey found that 10 states like delaware prohibit lay

the gap28 the issue regarding representation by lay advocates had prompted attempts to add statutory language authorizing lay advocates during the last idea reauthorization cul minating in pl 108446 but language in the house bill hr 1350 108th congress was deleted in conference29 the regulations change the previous interpretation by ed which allowed the use of lay advocates at due process hearings the regulations allow the right to be accompanied and advised by counsel and by individuals with special knowledge or training with respect to the problems of children with disabilities but add an exception stating that whether parents have the right to be represented by nonattorneys at due process hearings is determined under state law 30 the department stated that given that the act is silent regarding the representational role of nonattorneys in idea due process hearings the issue of whether nonattorneys may represent parties to due process hearing is matter that is left by the statute to each state to decide 31 commenters on the regulations argued that the rule on nonattorney advocates would negatively affect future cases as parents unable to afford attorneys fees or unable to find an attorney knowledgeable about special education law will be faced with the choice of either representing themselves or foregoing due process hearing32 school officials and parents groups have both predicted activity in the states if the proposed rule becomes final33 the issue may come up at the federal level again when congress begins the reauthorization process for idea34

agency38 however idea does not specify when the state must provide this report the proposed regulations would have required this public report later than 60 days following the states submission of its annual performance report to the secretary 39 several commenters requested that this public reporting timeline be changed ed agreed with the commenters who suggested that an extended timeline would allow for more accurate analysis of lea data thereby improving the quality of information reported to the public and ultimately contributing to improved outcomes for children with disabilities and their families 40 therefore ed revised the proposed regulations to require the report as soon as practicable but later than 120 days following the states submission of its annual performance report to the secretary 41 in addition although idea requires the posting of the states performance plan it does not specify whether other materials such as the annual report on each lea must also be made available the new regulations require the states performance plan the states annual performance report apr and the states annual reports on the performance of each lea to be made available through public means42 section 616e7 of idea requires states that have received determination from the secretary that the state needs intervention to make such information available to the public43 however the statute does not specify when this information is to be made available the new regulations clarify the circumstances under which public notice is required by requiring public notice whenever state receives notice that the secretary is proposing to take or is taking an enforcement action 44

department of educations ed office of inspector general oig found that neither that statute nor the idea regulations addresses whether state is required to allocate funds to charter school in its first year of operation if the school has students with disabilities enrolled47 the new regulations clarify that states are required to allocate some funds to leas including public charter schools that operate as leas even if an lea is not serving any children with disabilities48 the rationale for this new rule is that allocating funds to all leas will ensure that leas have part b funds available if they are needed to conduct child find activities ie identifying and evaluating children in need of special education or to serve children with disabilities who subsequently enroll or are identified during the year49 the oig also found that neither the statute nor the idea regulations addresses whether charter school lea that received base payment of zero in its first year of operation because it was serving children with disabilities and subsequently provided special education to children with disabilities is entitled to base payment in subsequent years if it does enroll students with disabilities 50 the new regulations require that base payment adjustment be made for these leas including public charter school that operates as an lea for the fiscal year after the first annual child count in which the lea reports that it is serving any children with disabilities51 the state will be required to divide the base allocation for the leas that would have been responsible for serving children with disabilities now being served by the new lea among the new lea and affected leas based on the relative numbers of children with disabilities currently provided special education by each of the leas 52 finally the regulations modify the procedures for the reallocation of lea funds53
