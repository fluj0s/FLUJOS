circuit court and district court nominations submitted to it some nominations do not receive senate confirmation1 neither the judiciary committee nor the full senate is compelled to act on the nomination and nominations that receive action are eventually returned to the president once the president submits judicial nomination to the senate it almost invariably is referred to the judiciary committee2 the committee may then hold hearing on the nomination after the hearing the committee has four basic options it may report the nomination to the senate fa vorably unfavorably or wit hout recommendation or it may choose to take action at all3 typically if the committee votes on the nomination it votes to report favorably however in small number of cases the committee has voted to report the nomination either unfavorably or without reco mmendation if majority of the committee agrees to any one of the motions to report the nomination moves to the full senate the nomina tion fails to be reported on tie vot by contrast the nomination remains in committee if the committee votes against reporting if there is committee vote on the nomination or if the committee votes to table the nomination once nomination is reported to the senate by the judiciary committee the senate can consider the nomination4 if the senate disapproves th nomination it is returned to the president with resolution of disapproval5 if judicial nomination does not receive senate vote the nomination ultimately will either be withdrawn by the president orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21734crs3 6 the senate may

1939 on the grounds that his nomination was personally offensive to the two virginia senators10 as was the tradition under sena torial courtesy at that time roberts was adversely re ported to the senate where he wa s rejected by vote of 72 to 9 in each of the other five cases before 1951 in which senatorial courtesy was the stated reason for objecting to judicial nomina tion the opposing senator stated that the nominee was personally obnoxious11 in one instance the nomination was not reported out of committee12 the other four nominations were reported adversely and rejected by voice vote in the senate13 between 1951 and 1978 judicial nom inations were reported without recommendation or unfavorably during that time one nomination that of william poff to the us district court for the western district of virginia was laid on the table by the senate judiciary committee based on senatorial courtesy14 since 1978 senators objections to nominations have rested largel on the perceived ideological orientation of judicial nominees the professional qua lifications of the nominees or both15 f r example daniel manion nominated by presid ent reagan to the seventh circuit court of appeals was criticized for lacking the record of distinction and achievement that was expected of appointees to the courts of appeals16 while his supporters argued that opposition to his nomination was based on his conservative views nd his activities with his father17 who had cofounded the john birch soci ety arguments made in support of and in opposition to the manion nomination were similar
