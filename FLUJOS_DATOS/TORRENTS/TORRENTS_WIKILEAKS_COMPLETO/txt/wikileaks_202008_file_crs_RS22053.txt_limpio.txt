speech before the national endowment for democracy president bush reiterated his commitment to promoting democracy in iraq and in the middle east and likened his forward strategy of freedom in the middle east to earlier us commitments to see democracy spread throughout eastern europe the president openly acknowledged in his speech that the united states has not been vigorous in pursuing the spread of democracy to the middle east by noting that 60 years of western nations excusing and accommodating the lack of freedom in the middle east did nothing to make us safe because in the long run

the middle east to be foreign policy priority analysts noted that president bushs november 2003 remarks foreshadowed new us efforts to foster the spread of reform and democracy in arab and muslimmajority countries2 in the months following the presidents remarks new plans emerged for encouraging democracy in the greater middle east3 on february 13 2004 the english language website of the londonbased arabic daily hayat published draft copy of the proposed g84 greater middle east plan working paper devised by us administration officials in conjunction with european partners to be presented at the june 810 2004 g8 summit meeting in sea island georgia5 the draft plan drew upon data from the united nations arab human development report of 2002 and 2003 which extensively outlined number of development shortfalls facing the arab world among other things the draft paper called on g8 members to provide technical assistance to monitor elections sponsor training programs for independent journalists increase funding for nongovernmental organizations establish middle east development bank and provide training to women interested in running for elective office in countries with upcoming parliamentary elections overall the draft paper focused almost exclusively on reform and made little httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22053 reference to the arabisraeli peace process although some observers praised the initiative for taking multilateral approach to democracy promotion in the middle east the surprise leak of the draft to the media elicited wave of criticism from arab governments and independent commentators6 arab governments such as egypt and jordan expressed frustration over not having been part of the drafting process and expressed their dismay over having to find out about the proposal through the media rather than through consultations with the us government others questioned the very definition of the greater middle east suggesting that there was little commonality among certain countries in the region and that it was difficult to apply such broad set of policies to diverse geographical area some analysts saw contradiction in the draft which relied heavily on the findings of the arab human 1 bush urges commitment to transform mideast washington post november 7 2003 2 on december 12 2002 secretary of state colin powell announced the creation of

also criticized by some for being an exclusively us government program crs3 development reports but then sought to prescribe solutions for many nonarab and non muslim peoples7 as result of the leak some arab governments suggested that they should offer their own internal reform programs according to jordanian foreign minister marwan muasher the idea is to come up with homegrown process in order that others not impose something from the outside8 some us policymakers who seek to balance us national security needs with the needs of regional governments have refuted the notion that the united states seeks to dictate reform policies to arab and muslimmajority countries instead they argue that the united states seeks to support serious and verifiable internal reform programs in countries where they exist but feels justified in taking the lead on the issue of reform with many countries in the middle east because local reformers are largely shut out of the political process arab reform initiatives after the initial skepticism over the first draft us and european diplomats hoped that arab leaders and intellectuals would produce regional agenda for reform prior to httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22053 the g8 summit in june 2004 the greater middle east plan could then be offered as g8 response to regional demands for reform some arab countries such as jordan have already taken steps to introduce their own reform initiatives in january 2004 the yemeni government hosted regional conference on democracy human rights and the role of the international criminal court which produced the sanaa declaration9 the declaration reiterated delegates support for the principles of democracy called for an end to the occupation of arab territories and suggested the establishment of an arab democratic dialogue forum to foster communication on human rights and democracy between governments and civil society groups in march 2004 arab nongovernmental participants10 in conference on reform in the arab world in alexandria egypt produced the alexandria statement document that called for individual arab countries to push forward on their own reform programs while 7 according to robert satloff of the washington institute for near east policy more than quarter of all residents of arab countries are not arab whether they are berbers in morocco and algeria nonarab christians in sudan or kurds in iraq the g8 proposal goes one better by its definition the greater middle east includes pakistan iran turkey afghanistan and israel making it region in which arabs are distinct minority yet virtually all of the proposals analysis and recommendations are directed toward arabs where is the recognition of the regions ethnic cultural religious and linguistic mosaic see

conference were nongovernmental reformers the conference was organized by the alexandria library which is nominally part of the egyptian government crs4 conforming to general framework agreed to by all arab countries11 the alexandria statement was far more specific than the sanaa declaration in its recommendations for reforms calling for the drafting of modern constitutions that outline clear separation of legislative and executive powers the abolition of emergency laws and extraordinary courts independent ownership of the media and the granting of political rights to students to allow for peaceful demonstrations beyond political reform issues the document called for twostate solution to the arabisraeli conflict respect for the territorial integrity of iraq and the transformation of the middle east into an area free of weapons of mass destruction in may 2004 the arab league held rescheduled summit meeting in tunisia to adopt resolutions on political reform according to delegate statements the resolutions drafted prior to the summit meeting agreed that all arab countries needed to change but at their own pace the arab league was anxious to come to an agreement on general statements of reform prior to the g8 summit meeting in june to avoid the appearance that western governments were driving the reform agenda in the middle east some commentators viewed the arab league meeting as an attempt by governments to take ownership of the reform process rather than leaving it to independent arab intellectuals httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22053 and activists according to the new york times the final arab league document although generally referring to respecting human rights and furthering the rights of women did not provide specific details to effect change in the middle east and one conference participant described the final resolution as wishy washy12 the june 810 2004 g8 summit meeting in sea island georgia launched bmena and laid the groundwork for future meetings by securing commitments from regional governments and g8 countries to jointly create development and education programs beyond bmena the g8 did release statement after the summit noting that the importance of the arabisraeli peace process and that the quartet road map is the way forward toward comprehensive settlement the december 2004 forum for the future the forum for the future held in rabat morocco featured foreign and finance ministers from about 20 arab and islamic countries in the middle east and north africa along with members of the group of eight industrialized nations and representatives of business and private advocacy groups israel was not invited to the conference prior to the start of the forum for the future some moroccan islamist groups held demonstrations in rabat press accounts of the conference focused largely on the negative reactions from arab officials who blamed the lack of progress on reform in the region on the continuation of the israelipalestinian conflict secretary of state colin powell attempted to keep the agenda focused on reform by remarking that increasing opportunities for all citizens especially women should not be put on hold to deal with other concerns13 other critics charged that the conference was too focused on economic liberalization and 11 the alexandria statement is available at

12 2004 crs5 modernization rather than on genuine political change according to leslie campbell director of the middle east program at the national democratic institute for international affairs the unspoken fact behind all of the discussions is that we are trying to work with bunch of people who are going to be kicked out of office if democratic change moves forward for now its easier to support freetrade agreements than political change14 however the democracy assistance dialogue did allow some human rights activists to express their opinions directly to government officials one egyptian human rights activist bahey eddin hassan of the cairo institute for human rights studies stated that arab regimes were the main obstacles for hindering reform and that palestinian and iraqi issues should not be used as excuses for not launching reforms15 overall the forum for the future produced the following pledges from participants create regionspecific private enterprise development fund at the international finance corporation ifc16 the fund is designed to provide technical support and financial assistance to small private enterprises and forum participants pledged total of 60 million
