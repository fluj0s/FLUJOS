the us treasury premiums from insured credit unions are the funds primary source of income this arrangement is similar to that of the fdic premiums are used to pay the funds operating expenses cover losses and build reserves premiums were originally set at onetwelfth of 1 of the total amount of member share accounts the fund also generates income from investing its reserves in government securities during the first decade of operations the insurance losses from troubled or failed credit unions were minimal this situation in combination with low operating expenses allowed the fund to build reserves towards the statutory target of 1 set by pl 91468 the decade of the 1980s was period of stress and change for all depository financial institutions and federal deposit insurance funds by the early 1980s the ncusif was operating under the constant pressure of growing caseload of problem and failing institutions insurance losses threatened the funds solvency the ncua requested recapitalization legislation from congress provisions for strengthening the fund were included in pl 983694 each federally insured credit union was required to place deposit with the fund in an amount equaling 1 of its insured share accounts the 1 is carried on each individual institutions books as an asset the ncusifs reserves 3 information from ncuas website see

operating level for the ratio of fund equity to insured shares between the statutorily prescribed parameters of 12 and 15 in recent years the ncua has set goal of achieving an operating level of 13 if the equity ratio falls below 12 the ncua board is required to assess premium to restore the equity ratio to 12 the board may assess premium if the ratio falls between 12 and the declared operating level in addition the board has the option of declaring dividend if at the end of the calendar year the ncusif equity level exceeds the boards set operating level goal examination fees and any penalties collected from insured institutions by the board are deposited into the ncusif portions of the fund not applied to current operations can be invested in government securities earnings are reinvested or deposited into the fund the ncusif has the authority to borrow up to 100 million from the us treasury if in the judgement of the board loan to the fund is required in addition the fund

up to the legal limit per depositor per insured institution if depositor has more than one account at the same institution those accounts are added together and the total is insured up to the legal limit an account holder may qualify for additional coverage at one institution if their funds are either in retirement accounts or in deposit accounts in different ownership categories for example joint ownership or revocable trust accounts the ncuas website has share insurance tool kit that includes brochure on insurance protection faq fact sheet and an online share insurance estimator that can be used to calculate an individual account holders insurance coverage6 deposit insurance is paid out when federally insured institution fails is closed and its assets liquidated to date account holder has ever lost penny in an account covered by ncusif or fdic deposit insurance during the early 2000s congress debated the costs and benefits of increasing the standard maximum insurance limit of 100000 as well as varying the coverage limit by type of account the 100000 limit had been in place for 20 years and inflation concerns coupled with the introduction and growth of new account types in particular retirement accounts fueled the debate in general the intent of federal deposit insurance is to provide degree of depositor security that benefits institutions and individuals deposit insurance is thought to help prevent the type of panic behavior that can cause bank runs which can in turn result in bank failures when an institution fails deposit insurance reduces the resulting financial impact on households and businesses in addition the economic instability that failed institution can cause community or region would be 5 the central liquidity facility clf is mixedownership us government corporation created to provide source of seasonal and emergency liquidity for credit unions for additional information on the clf please see httpwwwncuagovclfindexhtm 6 the insurance tool kit can be found at httpwwwncuagovshareinsuranceindexhtm crs4 diminished at the same time deposit insurance raises concerns over how to balance the benefits of providing deposit insurance with the potential downside of weakening the incentives for managerial discipline with deposit insurance managers of financial institutions may become less concerned over depositors withdrawing their funds and therefore the managers may take on more risk this behavior is often referred to as moral hazard this arguably increases the need for more effective supervision and examination practices by the regulators of insured institutions recent legislation the 109th congress passed two laws that authorized adjustments to deposit insurance coverage7 the federal deposit insurance reform act of 2005 pl 109171 and the federal deposit insurance reform conforming amendments act of 2005 pl 109173 made the following changes for share accounts insured by the ncusif the standard insurance coverage limit per depositor per insured httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22987 institution remains at 100000 until 2010 in 2010 and in each subsequent fiveyear period thereafter the ncua and the fdic will jointly determine whether an inflation adjustment is warranted the insurance limit for eligible retirement accounts is raised from 100000 to 250000 and this limit is also subject to the inflation adjustments and passthrough insurance coverage was established for employee benefit plans on october 3 2008 the president signed into law the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 pl 110343 this law commonly referred to as financial rescue package was enacted to address instability in the credit markets provisions of the law temporarily raise the basic limit of 100000 on federal deposit insurance coverage to 250000 retirement accounts retain their existing 250000 insurance coverage limit the intent of this action was to bolster public confidence in and provide additional liquidity to depository financial institutions the change became effective immediately and unless congress determines otherwise the limit returns to 100000 after december 31 2009 the ncuas share insurance tool kit has been updated to reflect these recent changes additional action taken by the fdic has raised interest in whether parity needs to be provided for credit unions on october 14 2008 the fdic announced new program the temporary liquidity guarantee program to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system8 components of the new program would affect deposit insurance by permitting participating fdic insured depository institutions to provide full unlimited deposit insurance coverage for noninterest bearing deposit transaction accounts the intended targets of this action were mainly paymentprocessing accounts 7 for the adjustments to share insurance see 12 usc 17811790d 8 fdic news release see httpwwwfdicgovnewsnewspress2008pr08100html crs5 for example payroll accounts used by businesses coverage provided by this guarantee would expire by year end 2009 the costs would be funded by 10 basis point insurance surcharge paid by participating institutions9 credit union advocates have expressed concern about whether similar full coverage of noninterest bearing transaction accounts at credit unions will be provided10 the fear is that public confidence in credit unions may be negatively affected by any differences in the account insurance coverage offered by banks and credit unions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22987 9 for additional information on the program see
