us constitution in article i section 6 authorizes compensation for members of congress ascertained by law and paid out of the treasury of the united states throughout american history congress has relied on three different methods in adjusting salaries for members stand alone legislation the most frequently used method was last used to provide increases in 1990 and 1991 it was the only method used by congress for many years the second method under which annual adjustments took effect automatically unless disapproved by congress was established in 1975 from 19751989 these annual adjustments were based on the rate of annual comparability increases given to the general schedule federal employees this method was changed by the 1989 ethics act to require that the annual adjustment be determined by formula based on ce rtain elements of the employment cost index under this revised process annual adjustments were accepted 13 times scheduled for january 1991 1992 1993 1998 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2008 and 2009 and denied six times scheduled for january 1994 1995 1996 1997 1999 and 2007 in january 2009 members received 28 pay adjustment under the formula established by the ethics reform act increasing their salary to 174000 members received 25 adjustment in pay in january 2008 resulting in salary of 169300 according to the formula members originally were scheduled to receive 27 annual adjustment increasing their salary to 169700 this figure was automatically revised downward to 25 to match the increase in base pay given employees under the general schedule by law members may not receive an increase greater than the increase in the base pay of gs employees members previously received pay adjustment in january 2006 when they received 19 annual adjustment based on the formula under the annual adjustment procedure increasing their salary to 165200 per annum according to the formula members originally were scheduled to receive 20 annual adjustment in january 2007 increasing their salary to 168500 this figure was automatically revised downward to 17 to match gs base pay members voted to delay and then prohibit pay adjustment for 2007 pay in 2007 remained 165200 third method for adjusting member pay is congressional action pursuant to recommendations from the president based on the recommendations of the citizens commission on public service and compensation established in the 1989 ethics reform act this commission was preceded by the commission on executive legislative and judicial salaries although the citizens commission was to have convened in 1993 it did not and has not met since then there is current plan to use the procedure

required 25 increase his plan specifying such change had to be sent to congress by november 30 2004 the president did issue an alternative plan to congress on november 30 2004 but it did not change the 25 base pay increase he submitted an alternative plan solely because of locality pay issue although his plan did not contain locality pay increase recommendation the president needed to issue an alternative plan because otherwise higher locality pay percentage would have automatically become effective the higher locality pay percentage was required by law and could have been changed only through an alternative plan and executive order the presidents plan of november 30 however assured that members would receive their scheduled 25 annual adjustment because of th link between member pay and gs base pay members do not receive locality pay the president did not address the pending 35 increase for base and locality pay combined in his november 30 plan because he had not yet received the legislation containing the increase hr 4818 he subsequently received and signed hr 4818 into law on december 8 pl 108 447 the president then was required to issue an executive order officially allocating the 35 between base pay and locality pay as consequence of the presidents action the base pay increase was 25 leaving 1 for locality pay in late fall of 2004 some press accounts led

potentially relating to the pending january 2006 increase and the senate voted to deny the adjustment the house vote occurred june 28 2005 when it agreed to rule providing for consideration of hr 3058 the fy2006 transportation treasury and housing and urban development the judiciary district of columbia and independent agencies appropriations bill special waiver language was needed in the rule to permit house consideration of an amendment that would prohibit the scheduled january 2006 pay increase in the absence of such language pay amendment was out of order this action is considered by some to be approval of an increase since the vote had the effect of not allowing members to offer and consider nongermane amendments to the bill they argue that if nongermane amendments had been allowed one could have been offered to modify or deny the scheduled 19 member pay increase this action some believe means that most members voted for the raise others however expressed interest in introdu cing other nongermane amendments on unrelated issues and as consequence some members believe that it cannot be said with any degree of certainty that members would have voted to accept pay increase if they had been given an opportunity the senate agreed october 18 2005 to an amendment by vote of 92 to 6 to forgo the scheduled january 2006 member pay adjustment 47 the prohibition did not apply to
