to finance homes during the housing boom have experienced rising foreclosure rates as housin g markets have declined some types of alternative mortgages may have exacerbated price declines and damaged the finances of consumers nd lenders the use of mortgages with adjustable rates zero down payment inte restonly or negative amortization features raise economic risk compared to traditional mortgages because some borrowers and lenders did not adequately evaluate these risks housin g finance markets have been hit with significant losses and financial markets have been in turmoil policymakers have responded with hous ing rescue package hr 3221 pl 110289 they have also authorized the partment of treasury to ins titute troubles asset relief program tarp to buy bad debts from banks hr 1424 pl 110343 alternative mortgages offer some combination of adjustable rates extremely low down payments negative amortization and optional monthly payments the prudent use of alternative mortgages offers benefits for example during periods of exceptionally high interest rates adjustable rates may suit consumers expecting rates to fall people whose incomes depend on commission or bonuses may be attracted to mortgages with flexible monthly payments these benefits come with potential costs for the borrower and for the financial system adjustable rates shift the risk of rising interest rates from banks to borrowers low down payments increase the risk that borrowers will owe more than their house is worth if prices fall borrower owing more than the house is worth may be unable to sell or refinance the house the use of alternative mortgages in these areas may have contributed to rising defaults and more volatile home prices more than trillion dollars of mortgages originated during the boom will reset their monthly payments by 2009 using its authority under the truth in nding act tila and regulation z the federal reserve issued on july 14 2008 new rules for mortgage origination

payments on his resetting mortgage and it is difficult to refinance while he is upside down3 the federal reserve issued new rules pursuant to the truth in lending act tila to help potential home buyers understand the risks in alternative mortgage s and to ensure that lenders follow safe and sound practices unlike regulatory guidance regulation z applies to banks and to nonbank lenders that operate in the subprime nd alta mortgage sectors4 mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures are rising and the prospect of coming mortgage resets in declining housing markets suggests that defaults will rise even higher alternative mortgages are sometimes ca lled nontraditional mortgages or exotic mortgages alternative mortgages have some combination of variable interest rates extremely low down payments interestonl periods andor negative amortization amortization refers to the gradual payment of the loans principal in some cases borrowers intended to refinance these loans or sell the houses relatively quickly the potential advantages of alternative featur for these buyers often depended on the expected path of interest rates and hom appreciation significant disadvantages became apparent however when interest rates and appreciation took what to some was an unexpected turn the sudden d ecrease in house price appreciation during 20062008 has caused problems for borrowers using alternative mortgages with resets that are expected to occur in coming months httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33775crs2 house prices boomed from 2000 to 2005 in many parts of the country and then suddenly ground to halt in 2006 ce 2006 house prices have fallen in many markets although adjustable rate mortga ges are not new their increased use during the boom was counterintuitive to many economists because mortgage rates were already low by historic standards other alternative features were not new but their use by the general public increased during th boom the increased use of alternative mortgages by unsophisticated borrowers may have been significant contributor to the rise in mortgage deli nquencies and foreclosures this report recounts recent events that led to increased foreclosures and the forecast of higher foreclosures explains salient features of alternative mortgages summarizes federal agency response pl aces the potential benefits and risks to consumers and financial systems in the c ontext of economic c onditions and assesses the estimates geographic impact events that led to unsustainable mortgages size and timing of the upcoming mortgage resets mortgage defaults are rising and are expected to increase significantly housing prices have slowed or declined in prev iously booming areas and it is taking longer to sell homes troubled borrowers now find it more difficult to sell their property to avoid foreclosure many borrowers took out loans with introductory periods that will expire resulting in higher payments even if interest rates are low and the underwriting of these loans appears to be relatively weak the combination of mortgage payment resets and weaker hous ing markets could lead to even higher mortgage defaults in coming years there are two periods of hi gher scheduled resets figure 1 shows that the first period january 2007 september 2008 d high pr oportion of subprime loans month 1 in figure 1 represents january of 2007 therefore month 23 represents november 2008 which has low number of subprime resets after november 2008 the number of payment resets in the alta and option arm categories increases alt loans are typically loans that would be considered low risk if everything in the loan documentation turns out to be accurate that is the loan has an alternative way to meet standards such as reduced income documentation informally these loans are sometimes referred to as liar loans because of the potential for fra ud an option arm is loan that allows the borro wer several options for any given months payment including paying less than the cu rrent interest due if the borrower pays less than current interest due then the loan negatively amortizes the balance increases and future payments risehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33775crs3 resets are the result of decisions made in 20042007 subprime borrowers often used alternativ mortgages with two or threeyear introductory periods socalle d 228s and 327s 228 originated in the second half of 2005 resets in the second half of 2007 the 228 and 327 resets that occurred through summer 2008 therefore were orig inated in 2004 through 2006 the state of the housing market and financial markets during 2004 through 2006 may provide clues to the sustainability of these mortgages the housing market in many areas ppreciated sharply in 2004 and 2005 but then the rate of appreciation slowed in 2006 and has ultimately beg to fall rapidly rising house prices build an owners equity which improves the borrowers risk profile and allows refinanc ing on better terms some borrowers and lenders may have agreed to higherrisk loans in ra pidly appreciating areas anticipating that continued house price increases woul d reduce the chances of default interest rates in 2004 through 2006 pr esented borrowers with conflicting incentives on the one hand figure 2 shows that rates on 30year fixed mortgages were generally around 6 during 2004 through 2006 low by historical standards borrowers had an incentive to use fixed rate mortgages to lockin these low rates on the other hand figure 2 also shows that the gap between short and longterm rates was relatively large in 2004 the larg er this gap the more borrower benefits from an adjustablerate mortgage which tends to follow shortterm rates also the benefit of an adjustable rate mortgage is greater if the borrower intends to quickly sell the house or refinance the loan which co incides with rapidly appreciating housing markets figure 1 alternative mortgage

however shortterm in terest rates were rising faster than longterm interest rates yet adjustable rates remained very popular house price appreciation slowed significantly in 2006 yet introductory periods remained popular the persistence of nontraditional terms could be evidence that some borrowers intended to sell or refinance quickly one indicator of speculative behavior source federal reserve credit quality of resetting loans appears weak as the reset dates of billi ons of dollars of subprime mortgages near analysts want to know the quality of the underwritin g that was used when the loans were originated for 228s and 327s this requi res information on the riskcharacteristics of loans originated in prior years in formation from industry sources suggests that nonagency subprime loans became more ri sky as the housing boom progressed for example figure 3 shows that the percent of subpr ime loans with low documentation doubled between 2000 and 20055 similarly the percent of subprime loans that used silent seconds to avoid private mortgage insurance pmi increased from almost noneshort term rates decline sharply during 20002004 02468101214 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990

25 of the subprime market by 20066 figure 3 also shows the increased use of subprime loans with in terestonly periods which requi re higher resets even if interest rates do not rise source compile by crs from ubs data in summary falling interest rates had two important effects on alternative mortgage markets first lower mortga ge rates initially helped bid up house prices as households qualified for larger loans wh ich increased apprecia tion rates second the incentive to use adjustable rate mort gages increased because shortterm rates initially fell faster than longterm rates house price appreciation and low interest rates which many expected to continue encouraged the use of mortgages that reset and have substantially higher future payments subseque nt increases in interest rates and slowing house prices have resulted in some unsustainab resets and the forecast of more unsustainable resets understanding the choice of mortgages containing reset requires an examination of the

interestonlyfigure 3 underwriting standards weakenedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33775crs6 features of nontraditional mortgages discussions of alternative mortgages of ten focus on some combination of four differences from traditional mortgages borrowers increasingly chose one or more of the following features adjustable rates extremely low or zero down payment interestonly payments and negative amortization adjustable rates there are many varieties of adjustable rate mortgages arms one of the simplest forms offers an initial low rate called teaser at the beginning of the loan and then resets after an introductory peri od the teaser rate may apply for one year or for as little as one month the mortgage contract may specify reset interest rate or may tie the rate to another interest rate by formula the resulting interest rate may itself be fixed or variable teaser rates should be distinguished from fully adjustable rate mortgages in principle 30year fixed rate mortgage could have onemonth teaser rate without materi ally affecting the costs nd benefits of the mortgage product excluding teaser rates variable rate mo rtgages tie the loan to the economy the future mortgage rate on these loans typically depends on another future interest rate observed in financial markets the rate might reset each month each year or only after several years the home buyers mo rtgage payment would drop if the interest rate dropped but would rise if the interest rate rose many adjustable rate mortgages provide for cap on the amount rate can ri in any period or over the life of the loan adjustable rate mortgages can be tied to variety of market interest rates one common reference rate is the london interba nk offered rate libor libor rates are determined in the london market for unsecu red bank loans it is rate that banks charge each other for short term loans less than 12 months typical adjustable rate mortgages will specify reset date at which time the mortgage rate will adjust to the libor or similar rate plus predetermined markup extremely low or zero down payment saving enough funds to meet the tr aditional 20 down payment can be significant barrier to otherwise creditwo rthy potential home buyers furthermore the required down payment grows with the appreciation rate if home appreciation is growing faster than household income then it will be difficult for first time home buyers to save sufficiently lending prog rams gradually reduced the required down payment options to 10 5 and eventually 3 of the purchase price there are mortgages that take this process to its logical conclusion and allow buyers to purchase with money down some prog rams even roll in closing and other acquisition costs for great erthan100 financinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33775crs7 related practice is using second mortgage to finance the down payment sometimes called piggy back ans or silent seconds the home buyer uses the second loan to borrow the funds for 20 down payment this down payment is enough to improve the interest rate and other terms of the first mortgage however the second mortgage carries higher interest rate and other less desirable features because the first mortgage has prior cla im on the collateral although the original firstmortgage lender may be aware of th piggy back loan and may have helped arrange it subsequent holders of the firs t mortgage may not be aware of the piggy back loan because lenders often sell the loans they originate to the sec ondary mortgage market interest only an interestonly mortgage allows the home buyer to carry the loan balance for period of time without having to pay b ack any principal the current mortgage payment covers only the monthly interest due on the existing balance eventually the monthly payment must also cover the pr incipal if the duration of the mortgage is not extended then the payments will have to amortize the remaining balance over shorter period of time therefore hom eowner choosing to pay only the interest for few months increases the m onthly payment for later months negative amortization unlike interestonly mortgages which leave the loan balance unchanged mortgage with negative amortization allows the borrower to increase the loans principal by paying less than the current interest due the remaining interest is added to the loan balance future payments are then recalculated based on the increased principal the homeowner gets lower current payments but at the cost of greater debt and higher future payments these four features of alternative mortgages are not mutually exclusive there are option mortgages which allow borrowers to choose each month to pay fully amortizing amount an interestonly am ount or negatively amortizing amount interestonly mortgages that use an adjust able rate when the introductory period ends are also common the increased use of these mortgages and innovative combination of features has drawn the atten tion of federal regulators federal agency actions on alternative mortgages financial regulatory institution guidance several federal banking ag encies including the federal reserve the office of thrift supervision ots the national credit union agency ncua the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the office of the comptroller of the currency occ oversee mortgage originations by financial institutions these agencies are all part of the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec and issued joint guidance statement the 1006 guidance for

duty on lenders to ensure that chosen mortgage product was suitable to the borrowers financial circumstances and goals 9 the federal reserve publishes the consumer handbook for adjustable rate mortgages charm booklets regulation z requires th at consumers be given charm booklets in continuedmortgages on october 4 20067 this guidance applies to federally regulated financial institutions but not to many non bank lenders in the subprime sector in addition to interagency guidance the fe deral reserve revise d regulation z under the truth in lending act tila in july 2008 regulation z app lies to all mortgage lenders october 2006 interagency guidance issues and comments the ffiec agencies ar responsible for overseeing both the consumer protection mandates of the truth in nding act tila and the safety and soundness of their regulated institutions the agencies recognized that alternative mortgages have existed for so time but were c oncerned that products with possible negative amortization were being offered to wider spectrum of borrowers by greater numbers of lenders the 1006 guidance addressed three areas of concern underwriting sta ndards risk management nd consumer protection the 1006 guidance specified that lenders must tighten underwriting standards to manage risk lenders must also provide clear information to consumers to ensure consumer protection but the guidance exp licitly rejected imposing the doctrine of suitability8 the comment period drew range of views on the proposal that became the 1006 guidance some depository institutions and industry groups argued against additional restrictions on alternative mortga ges they pointed out that alternatives to the traditional 30year fixed rate mortgage have been successfully used for many years some argued that alternative mortgages contribute to market flexibility in changing economy some also argued that lenders had the incentive and the capability to appropriately manage the risks critics of alternative mortgages encouraged more stringent limitations some argued that an agency guidance would not be effective enough because it would not apply to lenders regulated at the state level these critics argued for new federal legislation some consumer groups argued that alternative mortgages were too complex for unsophisticated borrowers to fully understand others argued that expanded use of nontraditional mortgages c ould encourage speculation in real estate and destabilize house prices consumer disclosure the 1006 guidance addressed some of the commenters consumer protec tion concerns lenders are to provide full disclosure in plain language lenders were already required to give consumers considering adjustable rate mortgages an informati on booklet published by the federal reserve9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33775crs9 9 continued the shopping phase if they ask for or are offered adjustable rate mortgages 10 us government accountability office alternative mortgage products impact on defaults remains unclear but disclosure of risks to borrowers could be improved gao 061112t september 20 2006 p 2the 1006 guidance now requires that cons umers considering other nontraditional mortgages be given similar information including examples of payment comparisons as of august 2007 the the ffiec has not issued mandatory interestonly or negativeamortization counterpart to the ad justable rate booklet although the office of the comptroller of the currency has model booklet the government accountability office gao also made recommendations for alternative mortgages on disclosure s gao found that although federal banking regulators have taken range of pro active steps to address amp alternative mortgage product lending current federa l standards for disclosures do not require information on amp specific risks10 gao recommended that the federal reserve improve its regulations governing disclosures by requiring language that explains the specific risks and features of alternative mortgages prudent practices in addition to consumer disclosure the 1006 guidance addresses number of lending practices that some commenters considered unsafe or unsound the use of alternative mortgages by less affluent borrowers raised concerns that some home buyers would not be able to sustain payments if housing market conditions changed the 1006 guidance sp ecifically addresses collateraldependent loans risk layering and thirdparty relationships the 1006 guidance stated that collateral dependent loans are an unsafe and unsound lending practice colla teraldependent loans refers to the practice of lenders to rely solely on the borrowers ability to sell or refinance the property to approve the loan an example of this practice would be an interestonly loan to person with down payment that resets after three or five years in the first few years of the loan the borrower is expected to pay high interest rate when the loan resets the buyer is expected to refinance the loan by which time appreciation could have provided down payment which would reduce the interest rate the buyer would be expected to pay the 1006 guidance requires loans to be underwritten for full risk layering to understand risk layering consider mortga ge with an optional negative amotization feature this option is the equivalent of extending the borrower additional credit without additional underwriting if the borrower chooses to pay less than current interest in the current month then the remaining interest is added to the loan balance for example borrower may be extende d 200000 loan that could rise to 250000 balance if the borrower pays the minimum each peri od the 1006 guidance specifies that lenders consider borrowers ability to repay the maximum loan balance assuming the borrower pays only the minimum monthly payment each period in the example the lender woul d have to qualify the borrower for 250000 loan not 200000 loan httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33775crs10 the 1006 guidance also addresses th irdparty relationships and risk management banks and financial institutions often do not originate or hold their loans mortgage brokers may market the loans to consumers once originated the loans may be sold to investors in the secondary mortgage market the guidance requires covered institutions to have strong systems and controls for establishing and maintaining third party relationships wh ile the industry worried that this would require institutions to oversee the marketing practices of thirdparties the agencies responded that an institutions risk mana gement system shoul d address the overall level of risk that thirdparty relationships create for the institution federal reserve revi sion of re gulation z consumer protection hearings the federal reserve administers the consumer protection laws that apply to ll lenders even nonbank lenders that are not subject to agency guidances the fede ral reserve

equity protection act which the federal reserve implements through regulation z the federa l reserve revised rules the board heard testimony focusing on four questions regarding its hoepa authority 1

by the federal reserve apply only to higher prices loans whereas others apply to all mortgage loans in addition the federal reserve adjusted its finition of higher priced loans to account for the effect of the gap between shortterm and longterm interest rates as well as lowering the threshold for signation as higher cost the federal reserve made several significant changes to the rules that apply to the origination of all mortgage loans secured by principal dwelling it bans creditors and mortgage brokers from coercing real estate appraiser to misstate homes value it also bans pyramiding

borrowers to voluntarily refinance troubled mortgages into an fha insured loan to participate borrowers must certify that their loan was unafford able as of march 2008 and lenders must agree to writedown the principal of the loan to more affordable level the program allows for up to 300 billion in fhainsured loans in which the borrower would be responsible for 90 of the new appraised value the lenders would writedown the loan an additional 45 to cover the one time premium and the first annual premium of the fha insurance therefore the lender must agree to write down the loan to 855 of the current appraised value and in some areas the current appraisal may be significantly below the original loan balance the fha loan limit was increased in high cost areas to as much as 625000 the

the mortgage market by 200512 payments on these mortgages will reset to higher levels in the next few years although such products were sometimes used in the past by sophisticated borrowers as cash management tools the recent housing boom saw alternative mortgages offered as affordability products to less sophisticated borrowers alternative mortgages were used by less wealthy borrowers in areas of high expected appreciation the concentra tion of mortgage resets in time and in location can cause concerns for individual borrowers for local r eal estate markets and for financial institutions payment resets affordability products and planned refinances the expanded use of alternative mort gages during the housing boom has created wave of mortgage resets due in the next few years as the introductory periods expire not only do adjustable rate mortgages change their payments as interest rateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33775crs12 13 some adjustable rates are tied to shortterm interest rates while traditional mortgages are long term some sophisticated borrowers choos adjustable or fixed rate mortgages based on the difference between short and longterm rates called the yield curve for these borrowers the steepness of the yield curve not th relation of current mortgage rates to their longterm trend would be th important considerationchange but interestonly mortgages increase their payments when the full amortization period begins even if intere st rates do not increase much further the increase in monthly payments is substantial for many borrowers consider 200000 interestonly loan orig inated at time when the prevailing mortgage rate is 65 the interestonl period lasts four years then the loan amortizes over the final 26 years at the 65 percent rate the monthly payments during the interestonly period will be 1083 the monthly payments increase to 1328 after four years even though the borrower will not be affected if interest rates rise above 65 percen t monthly payments will still rise 245 per month table 1 compares this hypothetical interestonly loan to similar fully amortizing fixed rate mortgage although the early payments of the interestonly

high and many people expected mortgage rates to fall the concern with morerecent adjustable rate mortgages is that their original rate was near historic lows so it is probable that the prevailing interest rate will be higher when they reset13 interest rate risk will be discussed in greater detail below table 2 presents sample payment resets af ter three years for 200000 mortgage if interest rates rise or fall by few percentage points if the interest rate was originally 6 then the monthly mortgage payment is 1199 if interest rates rise to 8 then the monthly mortgage payment rises to 1449

even using traditional qualifying ratios because the process was based on the early years of an alternative mortgage products payments as result underwriters are now qualifying people based on the maximum payment called the fully indexed rate consider again the 200000 loan at 65 presented in table 1 traditionally lenders presumed that there was cap on the percentage of household income borrowers could devote to housing costs if that cap was 28 and the traditional 30 year fixed rate mortgage had monthly payments of 1264 then borrower would need an income of 54177 to qualify for the traditional loan borrower with lower income could not qualify for that an and presumably could not buy the house the interestonly loan presents an inte resting qualifying issue if households can

mortgage contracts are almost always specified in nominal terms this means that fall in the real price might not cause borrower to be upside down on the mortgage if inflation is high enough to counteract the real price decline this scenario occurred in the early 1980s and the early 1990s on the ot her hand analysts considering the return to housing as an investment often focus on real

the failu re to achieve home equity through price appreciation local factors usually play dominant ro in determining regional house prices because of the role the job market plays in household income analysts assume the local unemployment rate is important even in the absence of other information for example david lereah chief economist fo r the national association of realtors emphasized the labor market in presenta tion to residents of charleston sc your unemployment situation is very positive i really dont know the local industries in charleston other than tourism but whatever it is its doing good job16 although lereah went on to discuss migration pattern s and other factors the stress on labor markets is unmistakable because local economies often play such crucial role in house prices one might think that the price risks embodied in low down payment mortgages is only problem if an areas unemployment rises while it is true that an increase in local unemployment can help drive down house pri ces it is important to note that prices can fall even if the local labor market is healthy the next sections show how different metro areas can have divergent pr ice trends but that the

the availability and popularity of adjustable rate mortgages ve changed with changing macroeconomic conditions when lenders held most of their loans in their own portfolio fixed rate mortgages imposed significant costs when interest rates rose the lenders own costs of funds depended on the shor tterm interest rates pr evalent as time progressed18 however the lenders income from their mortgages depended on the interest rates prevalent at the time the mortgages were originated this is called borrowing short and lending long rising in terest rates increase the lenders cost of funds but the lenders incomes do not rise in response to strains on the banking sector as interest rates rose in the late 1970s and early 1980s c ongress encouraged wider use of adjustable rate mortgages19 mortgage rates are affected by conditi ons in the macroeconomy although the federal reserve does not directly set long term interest rates such as mortgage rates federal reserve policy can determine short term interest rates and influence inflation the mortgage rate incorporates expectations of future inflation because mortgages are repaid over long periods figure 5 compares inflation mortgage rates and the federal reserve discount rate since 1972 the three are related but notice that the steep rise in the discount rate after 2003 s resulted in only minor rise in mortgage rates during the same period the

adjustable rates for example 61 of the conventional mortgages originated in 1984 were adjustable20 mortgage rates then declined from over 13 in 1984 to under 8 by 1993 once mortgage rates stabilized the popularity of adjustable rate mortgages declined for example only 12 of mortgages originated in 2001 were adjustable rates this relatively longstanding response of borrowers to changing macroeconomic conditions distinguishes adjustable rate mortgages from the use of interestonly mortgages as affordability products described earlier httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33775crs22 source federal reserve the pattern of adjustable rate mort gages during the recent boom suggests that borrowers accepted interest rate risk at time when interest ra tes were at historic lows figure 5 showed that the
