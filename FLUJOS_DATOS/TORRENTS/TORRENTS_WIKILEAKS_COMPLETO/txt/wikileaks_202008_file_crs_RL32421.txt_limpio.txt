specialist in telecommunications and internet policy resources science and industry division broadband over powerlines regulatory and related issues summary congress has expressed significant interest in increasing the availability of broadband services throughout the nation broadband over powerlines bpl has the potential to play significant role in increasing the competitive landscape of the communications industry as well as extend the reach of broadband to greater number of americans bpl like any technology has its advantages and disadvantages proponents state that bpl is less expensive to deploy than the cable and telephone companies broadband offerings it does not require upgrades to the actual electric grid and it is not limited by some technical constraints of its competitors however critics are concerned that bpl interferes with licensed radio frequencies used for amateur radio government and emergency response in october 2004 and october 2006 the federal communications commission fcc adopted report and order ro fcc 04245 and memorandum opinion and order moo fcc 06113 on bpl issues in may 2007 the american radio relay league arrl petitioned the us court of appeals for the dc circuit to review the fccs october 2004 ro and 2006 moo in its brief the arrl contends among other things that the fccs actions in adopting rules to govern unlicensed bpl systems fundamentally alter the longstanding rights of radio spectrum licensees including amateur radio operators in april 2008 the court remanded the rules to the commission in january 2007 representative mike ross introduced hr 462 the emergency amateur radio interference protection act which would require the fcc to conduct study on the interference caused by broadband internet transmission over powerlines the bill was referred to the committee on energy and commerce subcommittee on telecommunications and the internet on february 2 2007 further action has been taken in june 2007 senator mark pryor introduced s 1629 which contains the same study requirements as hr 462 that bill was referred to the senate committee on commerce science and transportation in august 2007 the house of representatives passed hr 3221 the new direction for energy independence national security and consumer protection act if signed into law section 9113a8 would require an assessment by newly established grid modernization commission to determine biannually the progress being made toward modernizing the electric system including an assessment of ancillary benefits to other economic sectors or activities beyond the electricity sector such as potential broadband service over power lines in october 2007 the national telecommunications and information administration ntia published its phase ii bpl study report the ntia concluded that the fccs bpl rules measurement guidelines and special protection provisions will limit the interference risks for federal radiocommunication systems

ongoing interest in increasing the availability of broadband1 services throughout the nation both in expanding the geographic availability of such services eg into rural as well as more urban areas as well as expanding the service choices available to consumers eg promoting additional service options at reasonable prices the telephone cable and satellite industries and more recently the electric utilities all provide broadband services to consumers electric utilities have long had the ability to send communications over their powerlines through what is called powerline communications plc technology but that capability was used primarily to maintain the operability of the power grid remote monitoring of the grid and other management functions it was not offered as commercial product because of technical limitations and regulatory limitations under the 1935 public utility holding company act puhca2 specifically regarding regulatory limitations puhca prohibited electric utilities from entering the retail telecommunications market without all of their operations including the telecommunications component being regulated by the securities and exchange commission under puhca however in 1996 driven by the elimination under the telecommunications act of the puhca 1 the fcc currently defines broadband as service or facility with an upstream customertoprovider and downstream providertocustomer transmission speed of more than 200 kilobits per second kbps it uses the term highspeed to describe services and facilities with over 200 kbps capability in at least one direction broadband is also different from narrowband modem service in that it is always on meaning there is need to dial up see inquiry concerning the deployment of advanced telecommunications capability to all americans in reasonable and timely fashion and possible steps to accelerate such deployment pursuant to section 706 of the telecommunications act of 1996 cc docket 98146 report february 6 2002

crosssubsidization the subsidization of competitive services with profits from regulated services which could become an issue as bpl is deployed more widely crosssubsidization within the electric industry however is not an issue for the fcc and is beyond the scope of this report for detailed description of puhca see crs report rl32728 electric utility regulatory reform issues for the 109th congress by amy abel crs2 limitations3 and the increasing demand for broadband services electric utilities began exploring ways to turn plc into commercially viable consumer service broadband over powerlines bpl4 many electric companies are now in the process of upgrading their transmission and distribution systems to provide bpl5 this technology has the potential to play significant role in increasing the competitive landscape of the electric utility and telecommunications industry as well as making broadband available to more americans than ever before bpl however like any technology has its advantages and disadvantages for example bpl in general is less expensive to deploy than the cable and telephone companies broadband offerings because it does not require upgrades to the actual electric grid and is not limited by certain technical constraints of its competitors specifically the telephone companies broadband service digital subscriber line dsl is limited to consumers within 18000 feet of central office unless expensive remote equipment is placed close to the customer cable companies while not limited by the same distance restrictions as the telephone companies still must upgrade their cable plant as well as the equipment at their 3 in 1996 the fcc adopted regulations to implement new section 34a1 of puhca under new section 34 registered public utility holding companies may enter the telecommunications industry without prior securities and exchange commission sec approval by acquiring or maintaining an interest in an exempt telecommunications

provide bpl with accompanying diagrams crs3 head end6 to provide cable modem service finally internet service delivered via satellite is still primarily downstreamonly service with dialup connection required to send data to the internet however critics of bpl have expressed concern that it will interfere with licensed radio spectrum such as amateur radio government and emergency response frequencies companies both in the united states and abroad have pilot tested bpl and many are now deploying it commercially for example in 2004 manassas va began testing bpl service and became the first us community with commercial bpl offering7 the service is now being used by roughly 1000 of the 12500 households in the manassas area however in manassas as well as in other areas where bpl is being deployed there have been some concerns and difficulties for example amateur radio operators have stated their concern that bpl will interfere with their radio signals8 efforts are being made by industry and government to address these concerns while still continuing bpl deployment in addition to providing new choices for consumers and increased competition in the broadband market bpl can provide other benefits both to the electric utilities and to others as tests and commercial deployments continue the electric utilities can capitalize on their existing relationships with consumers and the ubiquity of their networks also bpl can be sold either as retail service under the electric utilitys brand or as wholesale service to thirdparty isps offering smaller broadband providers another wire to the customer and electric utilities have expressed interest in providing such open access on wholesale basis9 concerns among electric utilities and investors about bpl deployment do remain however although the pilot tests and limited commercial deployments have thus far proven successful the viability of largescale commercial implementation remains unproven also while name recognition will help the electric utilities as they roll out their service there is also concern that they may have an unfair competitive advantage over smaller less established providers in this

the size of the established broadband providers the telephone and cable companies10 finally although bpl is likely to be deployed further out into rural areas than either cable or dsl it remains to be seen if bpl is as economical to deploy in those areas as policymakers and rural consumers hope the fcc opened rulemaking proceeding on the technical issues related to bpl deployment in february 2004 and adopted report and order on the proceeding in october 2004 see regulatory activity federal communications commission page 6 congress may wish to monitor how the fcc implements the rules that will guide bpl development and deployment as well as monitor more general issues surrounding bpl such as industry and societal issues regulatory and industry governance issues and technical issues these three categories of issues are discussed in detail at the end of this report see issues for congress stakeholders in addition to marketplace competitors and consumers the key stakeholders in this issue are the bpl industry amateur radio operators represented primarily by the american radio relay league arrl and various government entities in favor of bpl deployment and the fccs rules is the bpl industry the electric power companies internet service providers isp bpl equipment manufacturers bpl system solutions companies such as mainnet and the trade associations representing those companies trade associations involved include the edison electric institute the powerline communications association plca the plc forum united power line council uplc and the united telecom council utc11 these groups have financial stake in bringing bpl successfully to market and are eager to enter the broadband business amateur radio users have expressed opposition to bpl deployment because of concerns over its potential negative impact specifically interference on amateur radio frequencies by bpl emissions although some of its concerns had been addressed in the bpl report and order the arrl remained concerned about the impact of widespread deployment of these systems12 10 the first wave of bpl rollouts doesnt pose much of threat to the comcasts and verizons of the industry which boast millions of customers and have been selling high speed access since the late 90s some 22 million us households already subscribe to broadband service according to forrester research analyst jed

several government entities have an interest in how bpl is deployed specifically local and regional emergency responders the department of defense the federal emergency management agency now part of the department of homeland security and the national telecommunications and information administration ntia within the department of commerce have expressed both concern and support for bpl although these groups express concerns similar to those of arrl namely that bpl could potentially interfere with emergency communications and steps need to be taken to ensure noninterference they also express support for bpl because they believe it will contribute to more secure and bettermanaged electric transmission and distribution network13 the ntia expresses support for bpl because of its potential to further close the digital divide14 one of its major goals further because of the services that can be offered over bpl eg voice over internet protocol voip the law enforcement community is also concerned about the regulatory treatment of bpl specifically whether bpl services should be subject to federal wiretap requirements set forth in the communications assistance for law enforcement act calea the fcc has the largest role in how bpl will be deployed it not only is the regulatory agency that developed the rules governing bpl it also has statutory obligation under section 706 of the telecommunications act of 1996 to encourage the deployment on reasonable and timely basis of advanced telecommunications capability to all americans15 the fcc therefore will maintain significant influence on how the market for bpl service develops federal communications commission activity the fcc has been investigating bpl since 2003 and adopted rules regulating bpl systems in october 2004 it is also addressing bplrelated issues in its calea and ipenabled services proceedings 13 potential interference from broadband over powerline systems to federal government radio communications at

certain aspects of both the fccs october 2004 ro and august 2006 moo the court issued its decision in the matter on april 25 200825 finding that during its rulemaking process the fcc relied on five scientific studies that measured bpl devices radio emissions in an attempt to determine interference risks with other users of the spectrum although the agency released those studies during public comment process required by federal law it redacted portions of them arguing they were just internal communications that didnt influence its deliberations but after reviewing the unredacted studies in private the majority of the judges agreed with the arrl that it was against federal administrative procedure law to keep those portions under wraps particularly since they could call the fccs rules into question the court also said the fcc had not offered reasoned explanation for why it rejected arrlsubmitted data that could have influenced its interference estimates and potentially reshaped its rules the judges opted to send the rules back to the fcc with instructions to clarify those points and publicize its studies more fully although they did not overturn the rules themselves the court did not side entirely with the arrl on other key points related to the substance of the rules for instance the arrl had argued that the fcc was departing from longstanding agency precedent by refusing to require that bpl operations found to cause harmful interference be shut down immediately the socalled ceaseoperations rule the court wasnt persuaded by that argument 25 this decision is available online at httppacercadcuscourtsgovdocscommonopinions 2008040613431112979pdf crs9 saying the fcc had explained adequately that there isnt ample evidence that harmful interference is real risk26 communications assistance for law enforcement act proceeding on august 5 2005 the fcc ruled that providers of certain broadband and interconnected voip services must accommodate law enforcement wiretaps27 such definition includes the type of service that would be provided via bpl the fcc found that these services can be considered replacements for conventional telecommunications services currently subject to wiretap rules including circuit switched voice service and dialup internet access as such the new services are covered by calea which requires the fcc to preserve the ability of law enforcement to conduct wiretaps as technology evolves the rules are limited to facilitiesbased broadband internet access service providers and voip providers that offer services permitting users to receive calls from and place calls to the public switched telephone network28 ipenabled services proceeding on march 10 2004 the fcc released an nprm in the matter of ipenabled services29 this

interconnected voice over internet protocol voip service to supply enhanced 911 e911 capabilities to their customers the characteristics of interconnected voip services have posed challenges for 911e911 and threaten to compromise public safety thus the fcc required providers of interconnected voip service to provide e911 services to all of their customers as standard feature of the service

online at httpwwwntiadocgovntiahome fccfilings2004bpl finalreport adobentia_bpl_report_04413_volume_ipdf phase 2 of ntias study will evaluate the effectiveness of its phase 1 recommendations and continued crs11 the fccs noi the ntia described federal government usage of the 1780 mhz spectrum identified associated interference concerns and outlined the studies it planned to conduct to address those concerns the report 1 contains findings on interference risks to radio reception in the immediate vicinity of overhead power lines used by bpl systems access bpl only 2 suggests means for reducing these risks and 3 identifies techniques for mitigating interference should it occur34 one of the most important findings of the report was that existing part 15 compliance measurement procedures for bpl tended to significantly underestimate bpl peak field strength35 such underestimation increases the risk of interference according the report as currently applied to bpl systems part 15 measurement guidelines do not address the unique characteristics of bpl emissions overall the report concludes that bpl could interfere with licensed radio spectrum even though under the current part 15 testing parameters emission levels would be within the limits therefore it was recommended that the compliance measurement procedures be refined the ntia stated however that refining the compliance measurement procedures should not impede deployment of bpl because the technology can reportedly be deployed within more narrow range of frequencies that will not cause interference36 for these reasons the ntia did not recommend that the fcc relax part 15 field strength limits for bpl systems instead ntia recommended new measurement provisions derived from existing guidelines including using measurement antenna heights near the height of power lines measuring at uniform distance of 10 meters from the bpl device and power lines and measuring using calibrated rod antenna or loop antenna in connection with appropriate factors relating magnetic and electric field strength levels at frequencies below 30 mhz37 33 continued address potential interference via ionospheric propagation of bpl emissions from mature largescale deployments of bpl networks the arrl requested that the fcc extend the nprm comment deadline until june 13 2004 the deadline is currently june 1 2004 to accommodate the delayed release of this report the arrl stated it would like to have 60 days to review the ntia study prior to submitting comments the fcc denied the request see carrier

operation of unlicenced radiofrequency devices for example cordless phones computers wireless baby monitors and garage door openers as general condition of operation part 15 devices may not cause harmful interference to authorized radio services and must accept any interference that they receive the part 15 rules have allowed the development of new unlicenced devices while protecting authorized users of the radio spectrum from harmful interference 47 cfr section 15 36 ntia report pp 57 37 ibid crs12 overall ntia supported the continued development and deployment of bpl and suggested several means by which bpl interference could be prevented or eliminated for example mandatory registration of certain aspects of bpl systems would give radio operators the information needed to advise bpl operators of any anticipated interference problems or suspected actual interference ntia also recommended that bpl developers consider for example routinely using the minimum output power needed from each bpl device avoiding locally used radio frequencies using filters and terminations to extinguish bpl signals on power lines where they are not needed and carefully selecting bpl signal frequencies to decrease radiation38 issues for congress issues potentially of interest to congress may be divided into three categories industry and societal issues such as the impact of bpl on competition in broadband services and the potential for bpl to reach previously unserved and underserved populations larger regulatory and industry governance issues such as how the regulatory classification of bpl might affect other fcc regulations and proceedings eg the appropriate regulatory classification of ip based services and electric utility regulations eg reliability mandates federal energy regulatory commission ferc regulations and public utility holding company act puhca exemptions39 technical issues such as how bpl should be implemented to minimize interference with other services eg amateur radio frequencies and what effect bpl technology may have on reliability and security of the transmission and distribution systems and homeland security goals ie bpl may result in benefits as well as risks each issue is discussed below industry competition and societal issues since the passage of the 1996 telecommunications act congress has sought to increase both competition between broadband service providers as well as the 38 ibid 39 although electric utility entry into telecommunications is addressed in the 1996 act issues dealing primarily with electric

dsl providers both policymakers and consumers alike would likely welcome third widespread facilitiesbased option for receiving that service satellite broadband service is not widely available as it usually requires dialup uplink to the internet bpl could provide that opportunity for the third wire to the home while further increasing consumer choice is goal of both congress and the fcc there are still consumers who have options or perhaps only one option for receiving broadband service41 some of those consumers are likely part of those populations that are traditionally underserved eg rural residents lowincome consumers and for them bpl may also provide at least partial solution bpl not being limited technically by distance and not requiring upgrades to the electric lines themselves is significantly easier to deploy to what might be considered by cable and dsl providers to be undesirable areas of course cost and potential profitability are still issues in those areas and there will always be areas where deployment is simply not realistic either technologically or economically or both congress may wish to continue monitoring how the fcc balances ensuring that bpl as new technology is given every opportunity to reach the market while also ensuring that it is not given an unfair regulatory advantage over other similar services in the coming months the electric utilities will roll out their commercial bpl offerings as electric utilities deploy their commercial systems the fccs role 40 as mentioned above the fcc has mandate under section 706 of the 1996 act to promote broadband deployment 41 according to pew internet project report issued in april 2004 availability can figure into broadband adoption in two ways first the physical infrastructure to provide broadband is an obvious prerequisite to having service second the availability of multiple providers may matter as the existence of some competition in the market may be conducive to adoption among consumers with respect to broadband infrastructure 77 of americans say they live in an area in which broadband is available 8 said they do not live in an area where broadband is available and 15 say they do not know this compares with 71 of americans who said in october 2002 that broadband is available where they live 12 who said it was not available and 17 who did not know of those who live in place where they say broadband is not available 54 say they would like to get it higher than the 40 average for dialup users when asked whether there is more than one broadband provider in their area 61 of those who have broadband or know it is available said multiple providers serve their area one in six 17 said one provider serves their area and 22 did not know broadband users who lived in areas with multiple service providers said they paid 3850 per month for service while those who said they had one option for service paid an average of 4280 per month pew internet project broadband

utilities are given incentives for wide bpl deployment while also considering additional policy questions that arise will be watched to assess the success of both the fcc and of bpl regulatory and industrygovernance issues broadband over powerlines is just the latest in growing list of technologies and services that challenge the current structure of the fcc and the statutory and regulatory stove pipes required by current law while bpl is technology for the delivery of internet service it challenges traditional and embedded thinking and paradigms about telecommunications and information services because it does not fit neatly into an existing category of service if congress decides to amend the countrys current communications laws it may consider the impact that such new technologies are having on the way lawmakers and regulators have traditionally looked at underlying transmission technologies42 with respect to ipenabled services that would be provided over bpl the one with the most legal and regulatory impact may be ipbased voice service voice over internet protocol or voip voip is different from traditional telephone service in that it does not employ single dedicated path between the calling parties called circuit switching instead voip translates analog voice into digital packets and transmits those packets along multiple paths called packet switching and reassembles the packets at the receiving end43 this is the same format or protocol used to transmit email instant messages video and other data via the internet thus voice is longer separate service voice data looks just like every other kind of data until recently voip has been provided by companies that are in one way or another communications providers whether that be voice data or video communication however electricity companies have not generally been in the business of providing resale communications this blurring of lines between voice and other types of data has already raised issues such as law enforcements ability to conduct wiretaps and state versus federal jurisdiction over such calls discussed 42 during april and may 2004 the senate and the house held four hearings on issues related to the implementation of the telecommunications act of 1996 the senate committee on commerce science and transportation has held three hearings on the telecommunications act of 1996 and related issues telecommunications policy review lessons learned from the telecom act of 1996 april 27 2004 telecommunications policy look ahead april 28 2004 and telecommunications policy review view from industry may 12 2004 the chairmans remarks and witness statements are available online at httpcommercesenategov the house subcommittee on telecommunications and the internet of the committee on energy and commerce held one hearing on this issue on may 19 2004 competition in the communications marketplace how convergence is blurring the lines between voice video and data services these hearings were viewed as informational factfinding efforts to set the groundwork for reexamination of the 1996 act during the 109th congress 43 the packets once delivered may be converted back into an analog signal or left in digital form depending on the receiving partys terminal equipment ie telephone computer etc crs15 earlier in this report intercarrier compensation for call termination on the public switched network and universal service these issues will likely become even more complex with the entry of electric utilities into the communications business since they will be offering ipenabled services both directly to the consumer as well as to thirdparty vendors ie internet service providers as the market develops tension may develop over whether these new entrants should be required to adhere to existing requirements or perhaps how existing requirements should be changed to better reflect the current technological and competitive environment technical issues the fcc focused on technical issues in its bpl proceedings these issues have included how bpl should be implemented to minimize interference with other services eg amateur radio frequencies and what effect bpl technology could have on reliability and security of the transmission and distribution systems ie bpl may provide benefits as well as potentially create risks although the fccs regulations mandate the technical standards under which bpl will be deployed those standards will very likely have an impact on the previous two categories of issues and therefore congress may have an interest in monitoring the development of these technical issues as well interference with other licensed services some stakeholders have continued to express varying degrees of concern over the potential of bpl to disrupt licensed radio services including amateur public safety and emergency response frequencies44 the fcc continues to address those concerns in its bpl proceedings service reliability and security issues other stakeholders stated during the proceeding that bpl upgrades by the electric utilities have the potential to enhance the security and reliability of the transmission and distribution networks for example bpl technology can provide electricity outage detection home energy management distribution transformer overload analysis demand side management supervisory control and data acquisition scada data transmission safety checks for isolated circuits power quality monitoring phase loss detection line testing and outage localization among other things45 however while the first four functions 44

frequencies or corf the north american short wave radio association the association of public safety communications officials and the federal emergency management agency 45 noi comments of ppl telecom llc section iv available online at httpwwwnecaorgwawatchwwpdf070803_40pdf scada systems provide the command and control functions for some critical infrastructures such as the electric telecommunications gas and nuclear industries scada is computer system for gathering and analyzing real time data scada system gathers information such as where leak on pipeline has occurred transfers the information back to central site alerting the home station that the leak has occurred carrying out necessary analysis and control such as determining if the leak is critical and displaying the information in logical and organized fashion scada systems can be relatively simple such as one that monitors continued crs16 simply provide additional operational monitoring and control abilities the fact that enhanced data may be supplied to the scada system via bpl could be of concern to electric utility companies and homelandinfrastructure security officials the fcc did not address this issue in its rulemaking proceeding however some parties that did not participate in the rulemaking have expressed concern that bpl would make the transmission and distribution system vulnerable to individuals or groups trying to steal or corrupt consumers internet data or the utilities monitoring data or even to terrorists trying to cause largescale disruption of the nations electricity supply46 if sensitive operational information as well as consumers personal data is being sent over the lines the physical security of those lines and the integrity of the data on them become serious concern although bpl may offer significant social and competitive benefits the possible negative impact that bpl may have on reliability and security may be more important factor in bpl deployment congressional action 110th congress in january 2007 representative mike ross introduced hr 462 the emergency amateur radio interference protection act47 this bill would require that within 90 days after the date of enactment the fcc would be required to conduct study of the interference potential of systems for the transmission of broadband internet services over power lines the study would examine the variation of field strength of bpl service signals with distance from overhead power lines and technical justification for the use of any particular distance extrapolation factor the depth of adaptive or notch filtering for attenuating normally permitted bpl service radiated emission levels that would be necessary and sufficient to protect the reliability of mobile radio communications technical justification for the permitted radiated emission levels of bpl signals relative to ambient levels of manmade noise from other sources and 45 continued environmental conditions of small

enhancement act of 2006 also introduced by representative ross crs17 options for new or improved rules related to the transmission of bpl service that if implemented may prevent harmful interference to public safety and other radio communications systems upon completion the fcc would be required to submit the study report to the house committee on energy and commerce and the senate committee on commerce science and transportation this bill was referred to the house committee on energy and commerce further action has been taken in june 2007 senator mark pryor introduced s 1629 which contains the same study requirements as hr 462 that bill was referred to the senate committee on commerce science and transportation on august 4 2007 the house of representatives passed hr 3221 the new direction for energy independence national security and consumer protection act if signed into law section 9113a8 would require an assessment by newly established grid modernization commission to determine biannually the progress being made toward modernizing the electric system including an assessment of ancillary benefits to other economic sectors or activities beyond the electricity sector
