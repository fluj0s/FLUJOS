rbradleygeoumassedumhughesltrrarizonaedusrutherfordgsouriedu kbriffaueaacuktosbornueaacukmannvirginiaedu dear all i like phils suggestion i think such piece would do lot of good for the field when something as full of halftruthsmistruths as the sb piece is put forth it would be very useful to have peerreviewed review like this which we all have endorsed through coauthorship to point to in response this way when we get the inevitable so what do you have to say about this from our colleagues we already have selfcontained thorough rejoinder to point to im sure we wont all agree on every detail but there is enough commonality in our views on the big issues to make this worthwhile perhaps phil can go ahead and contact the editorial board at reviews of geophysics and see if theyre interested if so phil and i and anyone else interested could take the lead with this and then we can entrain everyone else in as we proceed with draft etc mike ps keith i hope youre feeling well and that your recovery proceeds quickly at 1002 am 3122003 0000 phil jones wrote dear all i agree with all the points being made and the multiauthored article would be good idea but how do we go about not letting it get buried somewhere can we not address the misconceptions by finally coming up with definitive dates for the lia and mwp and redefining what we think the terms really mean with all of us and more on the paper it should carry lot of weight in way we will be setting the agenda for what should be being done over the next few years we do want reputable journal but is the holocene the right vehicle it is probably the best of its class of journals out there mike and i were asked to write an article for the egs journal of surveys of geophysics youve not heard of this few have so we declined however it got thinking that we could try for reviews of geophysics need to contact the editorial board to see if this might be possible just thought but it certainly has high profile what we want to write is not the scholarly review jean grove bless her soul that just reviews but doesnt come to anything firm we want critical review that enables agendas to be set rays recent multiauthored piece goes lot of the way so we need to build on this cheers phil at 1255 110303 0500 michael mann wrote hi malcolm thanks for the feedbacki largely concur i do though think there is particular problem with climate research this is where my colleague pat michaels now publishes exclusively and his two closest colleagues are on the editorial board and review editor board so i promise you well see more of this there and i personally think there is bigger problem with the messenger in this case but the soon and baliunas paper is its own separate issue too i too like toms latter idea of more hefty multiauthored piece in an appropriate journal paleoceanography holocene that seeks to correct number of misconceptions out there perhaps using baliunas and soon as case study poster child but taking on slightly greater territory too question is who would take the lead role i know were all very busy mike at 1028 am 31103 0700 malcolm hughes wrote im with tom on this in way it comes back to rant of mine to which some of you have already been victim the general point is that there are two arms of climatology neoclimatology what you do based on instrumental records and direct systematic observations in networks all set in very late holoceneanthropocene time with hourly to decadal interests paleoclimatology stuff from rocks etc where major changes in the earth system including its climate associated with major changes in boundary conditions may be detected by examination of one or handful of paleo records between these two is what we do mesoclimatology dealing with many of the same phenomena as neoclimatology using documentary and natural archives to look at phenomena on interannual to millennial time scales given relatively small changes in boundary conditions until the last couple of centuries mesoclimatology has to work in way that is very similar to neoclimatology most notably it depends on heavily replicated networks of precisely dated records capable of being either calibrated or whose relationship to climate may be modeled accuarately and precisely because this distinction is not recognized by many eg sonnechkin broecker karlen we see an accumulation of misguided attempts at describing the climate of recent millennia it would be better to head this off in general rather than draw attention to bad paper after all as tom rightly says we could all nominate really bad papers that have been published in journals of outstanding reputation although there could well be differences between our lists end of rant cheers malcolm hi guys junk gets published in lots of places i think that what could be done is short reply to the authors in climate research or slightly longer note in reputable journal entitled something like continuing misconceptions about interpretation of past climate change i kind of like the more pointed character of the latter and submitting it as short note with group authorship carries heft that reply to paper in matter what journal does not tom dear all apologies for sending this again i was expecting stack of emails this morning in response but i inadvertently left mike off mistake in pasting and picked up toms old address tom is busy though with another offspring i looked briefly at the paper last night and it is appalling worst word i can think of today without the mood pepper appearing on the email ill have time to read more at the weekend as im coming to the us for the doe ccpp meeting at charleston added ed peck and keith onto this list as well i would like to have time to rise to the bait but i have so much else on at the moment as few of us will be at the egsagu meet in nice we should consider what to do there the phrasing of the questions at the start of the paper determine the answer they get they have idea what multiproxy averaging does by their logic i could argue 1998 wasnt the warmest year globally because it wasnt the warmest everywhere with their lia being 1300 1900 and their mwp 8001300 there appears at my quick first reading discussion of synchroneity of the coolwarm periods even with the instrumental record the early and late 20th century warming periods are only significant locally at between 1020 of grid boxes writing this i am becoming more convinced we should do something even if this is just to state once and for all what we mean by the lia and mwp i think the skeptics will use this paper to their own ends and it will set paleo back number of years if it goes unchallenged i will be emailing the journal to tell them im having nothing more to do with it until they rid themselves of this troublesome editor cru person is on the editorial board but papers get dealt with by the editor assigned by hans von storch cheers phil dear all tim osborn has just come across this best to ignore probably so dont let it spoil your day ive not looked at it yet it results from this journal having number of editors the responsible one for this is wellknown skeptic in nz he has let few papers through by michaels and gray in the past ive had words with hans von storch about this but got nowhere another thing to discuss in nice cheers phil xsender
