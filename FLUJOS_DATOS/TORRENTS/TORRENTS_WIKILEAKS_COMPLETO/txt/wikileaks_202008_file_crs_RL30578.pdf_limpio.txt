aliens in the united states to acquire lawful permanent resident status it grants the attorney general the discretionary authority to create record of lawful admission for permanent residence for an alien who lacks such record has continuously resided in the united states since before january 1 1972 and meets other specified requirements the registry provision originated in 1929 law that law set the required entry date from which continuous residence had to be shown known as the registry date at june 3 1921 the registry provision has been amended several times since 1929 most commonly to update the registry date the first update came in 1940 when the registry date was changed to july 1 1924 the registry provision underwent significant change in 1958 that year the registry date was changed to june 28 1940 and the registry requirements were revised as result of the 1958 changes the registry mechanism became available to aliens who had entered the country illegally or who had overstayed or violated the terms of temporary period of entry the registry date was subsequently changed to june 30 1948 and then to january 1 1972 where it stands today since 1985 approximately 60000 people have adjusted to lawful permanent residence under the registry provision bills to update the registry provision are before the 107th congress s 562 and hr 1561 propose to change the registry date to january 1 1986 while hr 500 would change the date to february 6 1996 these 3 bills also would put in place rolling registry date system under which the registry date would advance in 1year increments in each of 5 specified years taking different approach hr 2713 would require minimum 15year gap between entry into the united states and the filing of registry application thus if hr 2713 went into effect in 2001 individuals residing here since 1986 would be eligible for registry ins estimated last year that if the registry date were advanced to 1986 as many as 500000 undocumented aliens in the united states could acquire permanent resident status there is debate about the merits of advancing the registry date supporters maintain that longtime immigrants with strong ties to the country should be allowed to become lawful permanent residents opponents argue that aliens in the country illegally should not be rewarded with legal status and that advancing the registry date could encourage future illegal immigration registry can be viewed as form of amnesty for longterm unauthorized residents of the united states it differs in notable ways however from other mechanisms through

naturalizati on and charged the bureau with providing at us immigration stations books of record wherein the commissioners of immigration shall cause registry to be made in the case of each alien arriving in the united states of the name age occupation and date of arrival of said alien 4 the 1929 law extended this concept of registering new arrivals to permit the registry of any alien not ineligible to citizenship in whose case there is record of admission for permanent residence provided that the alien satisfied certain requirements this original registry provision required the alien to show the following the alien entered the united states prior to june 3 1921 the alien has continuously resided in the united states since entry the alien is person of good moral character and the alien is not subject to deportation the law further stated that for purposes of us immigration and naturalization laws an alien for whom registry record has been made shall be considered to have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence as of the entry date5 the registry provision has been reviewed periodically since 1929 it has been amended on several occasions most commonl to advance the required entry date from which continuous residence must be shown this required date is referred to as the registry date 1938 report prepared by the administration of president franklin roosevelt which proposed revision and codification of us nationality laws recommended that the registry provision be retained but that the registry date be changed to july 1 1924 the effective date of the thenprevailing immigration act of 19246 the report provided the following rationale for the proposed date change this would include number of aliens of good moral character who have resided in the united states for more than 10 years and are not subject to deportation but who cannot proceed toward naturalization because of lack of sufficient record of arrival it is not in the best interests of the united states that there should be considerable number of aliens here who have resided in this country for many years and who are otherwise eligible for naturalization and anxious to become citizens but who are prevented from doing so because of the absence of record of arrival upon which to base petition for naturalization7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30578crs3 8act of october 14 1940 ch

senate judiciary committee the subcommittee recommended that the registry provision be retained9 when us immigration and nationality laws were recodified and revised with the enactment of the ina of 1952 rephrased registry provision became 249 the registry date remained july 1 1924 1958 act the registry requirements underwent significant change in 1958 law enacted that year advanced the registry date to june 28 1940 it also eliminated the requirement that an alien applying for registry not be subject to deportation instead it required that the alien not be inadmissible under ina 212a insofar as it relates to criminals procurers and other immoral persons subversives violators of the narcotics laws or smugglers of aliens10 by eliminating deportability as bar to registry the registry mechanism became available to aliens who had entered the country illegally or who had overstayed or violated the terms of temporary period of entry according to the very similar senate and house judiciary committee reports on this legislation these changes to the registry provision were prompted by the growing concern of the congress with numbers of private bills proposing the granting of permanent residence to aliens who have had long periods of residence11 the senate report further stated in view of the diminishing potential of aliens eligible to seek benefits under section 249 of the immigration and nationality act it is believed an amendment of this section to extend the date of required entry and enlarge the scope of authority to permit discretionary consideration of the adjustment of status of alienshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30578crs4 12 senate committee on the judiciary srept 851905 p 2 house committee on the judiciary hrept 1727 p 2 contains very similar language 13

the senate and house reports expressed administration support for the bill it stated that the bills objective coincided with the program of the president in respect to the conferral of discretionary authority upon the attorney general to adjust the status of aliens in the united states who are found worthy of that privilege13 while endorsing an expansion of the registry provision the senate and house judiciary committees also suggested concerns in their reports about possible abuses of an updated registry mechanism these concerns were reflected in their choice of june 28 1940 as the new registry date it is not considered to be desirable to advance the required entry date beyond june 28 1940 the date of enactment of the alien registration act which inaugurated the requirement for registration of aliens seeking visas and also directed the registration of all aliens within the united states the possibility that an alien chose to enter illegally after the date of enactment of the alien registration act in order to avoid identification through the registration and fingerprinting data cannot be disregarded14 post1958 changes following passage of the 1958 act the registry date

placed jurisdictional limitation s on challenges to the legalization program20 in an effort according to the conference report on the iirira bill to put an end to litigation seeking to extend the amnesty provisions of irca21 since enactment this iirira provision 377 had been criticized by some who saw it as preventing aliens from pursuing legitimate claims in court although the 106th congress

furnished in registry application and would prohibit specified violations incidental to undocumented status including immigrationrelated document fraud from affecting such an application hr 2713 sponsored by representative maxine waters takes different approach to updating the registry provision rather than setting new registry date it effectively would establish an ongoing rolling registry date by enabling individuals to file registry applications 15 years after entry thus if hr 2713 went into effect in 2001 individuals who entered the united states in or before 1986 and have resided here continuously since then would be eligible for registry in 2002 those with continuous residence since 1987 would be eligible for registry s 562 has been referred to the senate judiciary committee hr 1561 hr 500 and hr 2713 have been referred to the house judiciary committee numbers affected by registry date change it is uncertain how many individuals would benefit from the proposed registry date changes ins estimated last year that if the registry date were advanced to 1986 as many as 500000 undocumented aliens in the united states could acquire lawful permanent residence procon arguments the merits of advancing the registry date is subject of debate supporters argue that changing the registry date would provide humanitarian relief to longtime residents with strong ties to the country in his introductory remarks on s 562 senator reid stated in my home state of nevada i have met with people who everyday fear being deported and separated from their families they are married to americans have american children and have worked and been paying taxes for many years24 along similar lines kevin appleby of the united states catholic conference believes that those who would be benefitted by this change of the registry date to 1986 have worked hard contribute d to their communities and deserve an opportunity to stay here25 supporters also cite more practical considerations for advancin g the registry date they maintain that longtime residents are highly unlikely to leave and that it is in the nations economic and social interest to more fully integrate them into society as legal residents in addition supporters argue that there is large and growing gaphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30578crs9 26quoted in carla marinucci in california little consensus on immigration proposal san francisco chronicle april 13 2000 p a3 27for discussion of legalizationrelated issues and legislation see crs report rl30780 immigration legalization and status adjustment legislation by ruth ellen wasembetween the registry date and the current year amounting to 29 years in 2001 and that it is time to advance the registry date and reduce that gap opponents of proposals to make longterm aliens eligible for lawful permanent residence by changing the registry date or by other means emphasize that the potential beneficiaries are in the united states illegally they argue that such illegal aliens should not be given amnesty according to daniel stein of the federation for american immigration reform when youre giving illegal aliens amnesty youre rewarding them by giving them what they broke the law for its like telling the bank robber not only are we not going to prosecute you youre going to keep the money26 in the view of opponents an amnesty would undermine efforts to control illegal immigration into the united states and would actually encourage more such immigration in the future another key concern of opponents is that granting legal status to large numbers of illegal aliens could hurt us workers by increasing competition for certain jobs in the event of subsequent economic downturn some fear potential largescale backlash against immigrants registry as form of amnesty registry can be viewed as form of amnesty for longterm unauthorized residents of the united states27 it differs in notable ways however from other mechanisms through which unauthorized aliens have acquired lawful permanent residence brief comparison of registry and the section 245a legalization program discussed above highlights the distinguishi ng features of registry registry is an ongoing provision while the section 245a legalization program was onetime event thus registry can be applied for at anytime while the legalization program had timelimited application periods the applicable continuous residence requirements represent another key difference between registry and the section 245a legalization program the current registry provision requires the alien to have had continuous residence in the united states since before 1972 it does not matter whether the alien was in lawful or unlawful immigration status by contrast the section 245a legalization program required the alien to have had continuous unlawful presence since before 1982 it also required continuous physical presence in the country since before november 6 1986 the enactment date of irca httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30578crs10 another important difference between the provisions concerns the eligibility requirements related to inadmissibility registry applicants must not be inadmissible on certain criminal or other specified grounds legalization applicants faced stricter requirement s they were subject to the full range of inadmissibility grounds under ina 212a with some exceptions legalization applicants were also subject to several additional grounds of disqualification among them the alien had to establish that he or she had not been convicted of any felony or of three or more misdemeanors in the united states finally registry is form of relief granted at the discretion of the attorney general applicants meeting its statutory requirements are not entitled to relief automatically under the section 245a program by contrast legalization was mandatory if the alien satisfied the eligibility requirements
