their publiclaw and us code alphanumerical designations contents background 1 implementing procedure 2 appendix 6 1 extension disapproval resolutions 6 2 procedural disapproval resolutions 6 3 nonbinding traderemedy laws resolutions 7 trade agreements procedure for congressional approval and implementation background the united states has recently completed or has in progress or intends to enter into negotiations with foreign countries of number of bilateral or multilateral trade agreements establishing freetrade areas ftas since they contain modifications of nontariff as well as tariff trade barriers they require changes in us trade legislation1 for the enactment of such legislation and its implementation specific procedures are set out in trade law which provide for expedited congressional consideration of the relevant measure if specified conditions required by law are complied with the expedited consideration originally called fast track procedure but recently also named trade authorities procedures taps provides for mandatory consideration of the measure once introduced with specific deadlines for each legislative phase allows amendments and requires final upordown vote the statutory authority and requirements2 for the enactment and implementation of such trade agreements that have recently been concluded or are in the process of negotiation or in the planning stage are contained in the provisions of the bipartisan trade promotion authority act of 2002 tpa act title xxi of the trade act of 2002 as amended by section 2004a17 of the miscellaneous trade and technical corrections act of 2004 pl 108429 the legislative procedure for their implementation is set out in section 151 of the trade act of 1974 pl 93618 the tpa act authorizes the use of the trade authorities procedures for the enactment of bills implementing agreements regarding tariffandnontariff barriers including freetrade agreements entered into with foreign countries by the president before july 1 2005 or july 1 2007 if the president requests such extension before april 1 2005 and either house of congress does not adopt an extension disapproval resolution see appendix item 1 1 implementation of trade agreements containing only tariff concessions historically has not required subsequent enactment and has taken place by presidential proclamation if the concessions agreed therein have been kept within the limits set by the legislation authorizing their negotiation 2 such requirements presidential consultations with and notices and reports to congress before during and after the negotiations of agreements to be implemented by means of trade authorities procedures are the subject of crs report rl31974 trade agreements requirements for presidential consultations notices and reports to congress regarding negotiations by vladimir n pregelj crs2 the expedited legislative procedures trade authorities procedures taps by which such agreements would be implemented are set out principally in section 151 of the trade act of 1974 pl 93618 as amended 19 usc 2191 although this statute is permanent law it has been enacted as an exercise of the rulemaking power of either house and can be changed by either house with respect to its own procedure at any time in the same manner and to the same extent as any other rule of that house it applies only to the procedure specifically covered by it eg approval of trade agreements but in that context supersedes any other rules to the extent that they are inconsistent with it section 151a 19 usc 2191a these permanent procedural provisions are occasionally supplemented by additional temporary ones contained in the legislative authority for the negotiation of the agreements such as various disapproval or other resolutions presented in the appendix they too are considered an exercise of the rulemaking power of either house of congress since the expedited procedures do not permit any amendments to the legislation once it has been introduced the final language of the implementing bill is fashioned through advance mock or nonmark markups by the relevant committees in order to arrive at legislative language that reflects the provisions of the agreement as well as congressional concerns regarding its implementation the version marked up in this manner is then transmitted together with the required statement of administrative action and other supporting documents by the president to congress for legislative action implementing procedure the steps in the expedited procedure for the legislative consideration and enactment of an implementing bill and the implementation of the underlying trade agreement are described below in their functional time sequence while care has been taken to reflect accurately the meaning of the relevant more extensively worded statutes consulting the actual language of any statute is recommended in case of any ambiguity or need for greater detail moreover because these provisions are rulemaking statutes questions concerning the interpretation of these procedures and possible parliamentary rulings pursuant to them should be referred to the house and senate parliamentarians offices in this description the provisions of section 151 of the trade act of 1974 are not specifically identified in their alphanumerical designation as contained in that act provisions contained in the trade act of 2002 however are identified with the addition of the abbreviation ta02 1 prior consultation and report regarding us trade remedy laws before entering into any tariffandnontariff agreement the president is required to consult with certain congressional bodies on the contents of the agreement and b submit report on possible effect of the agreement on us trade remedy laws3 3 detailed description of such consultation and report see crs report rl31974 trade continued crs3 2 mock markups since the implementing bill is not amendable see item 7 its draft is submitted to congress informally for hearings and mock markups by the relevant committees for changes reflecting the congresss concerns regarding the agreement and the final language of the legislation to be transmitted to congress formally for legislative action 3 enactment necessary the agreement can take effect only if it is approved by the enactment of an implementing bill section 2105a1d ta02 19 usc 3805a1d the specific expedited procedures for which are contained in section 151 19 usc 21914 4 transmittal of the agreement by the president to congress after entering into an agreement the president is required to submit to congress the final legal text of the agreement together with draft of the implementing bill statement of any administrative action proposed to implement the agreement and sundry supporting information while the law specifies deadline for such submission it must take place on day on which both houses are in session failure to comply with this submission requirement would prevent the agreement from entering into force section 2105a1c and a2 ta02 19 usc 3805a1c and a2 5 mandatory introduction of implementing bill on the day the trade agreement the implementing bill5 and the supporting documents are submitted to the congress the implementing bill must be introduced 3 continued agreements requirements for presidential consultations notices and reports to congress regarding negotiations by vladimir n pregelj 4 to qualify for expedited procedures the implementing bill must contain provisions approving the trade agreement and the statement of administrative action and the changes in existing laws required to implement the agreementsection 2103b3 ta02 19 usc 3803b3 expedited consideration of tariffandnontariff implementing bills is also contingent on the presidents compliance with various statutory requirements for consultations with and notices and reports to congress before during and after the negotiation of the agreement involved see footnote 3 failure to comply with such requirements may result in the adoption of procedural disapproval resolution denying expedited consideration see appendix item 2 5 in this description it is assumed that the implementing bill in question is an implementing revenue bill that is bill which contains one or more revenue measures by reason of which it must originate in the house of representatives section 151b2 19 usc 2191b2 this is requirement contained in article i section 7 of the constitution of the united states which provides that all bills for raising revenue shall originate in the house of representatives but the senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills although in this situation identical and nonamendable bills are introduced in both houses the measure enacted by congress and transmitted to the president consequently has to be the house bill and the enacting procedure reflects that circumstance cf the specific procedure for committee consideration in the senate described in item 10 crs4 by request in both houses of congress by their respective majority leaders for themselves and the minority leaders or by their designees section 151c1 19 usc 2191c1 6 committee referral in either house the implementing bill is referred to the appropriate committee or in the likely case that it contains provisions within the

computed as in footnote 6 11 in the united states enactment of the implementing bill into law crs6 appendix 1 extension disapproval resolutions12 by submitting relevant report the president may request an extension of the application of trade authorities procedures for bills implementing agreements involving tariffandnontariff barriers eg free trade agreements entered into after july 31 2005 and before july 1 2007 section 2103c1bi ta02 19 usc 3803c1bi b trade authorities are extended automatically upon such request if neither house adopts an extension disapproval resolution before july 1 2005 section 2103c1bii ta02 19 usc 3803c1bii c an extension disapproval resolution is resolution of either house containing language prescribed by law which may be introduced by any member and is referred in the house to the committees on ways and means and on rules section 2103c5a and b ta02 19 usc 3803c5a and b13 legislation contains deadline for committee report nor provision for discharge of committee of referral but see item below d on the floor of either house the resolution is considered under the specific expedited procedure of the trade act of 1974 for resolutions disapproving certain actions section 152d and 19 usc 2192d and and identical with the procedure for floor consideration of the implementing bill see items 7 and 9 above except that in the house amendment to the resolution is in order and in the senate motion to proceed to the consideration of the resolution is debatable the nondebatable motion to further limit debate on the resolution applies also to debatable motion or appeal and amendment to the resolution is in order it is not in order to consider an extension disapproval resolution not reported in the senate by the finance committee or in the house by the ways and means and rules committees or to consider it after june 30 2005 section 2103c5d ta02 19 usc 3803c5d 2 procedural disapproval resolutions14 if the president fails or refuses to notify or consult with the congress regarding the negotiation of tariffandnontariff agreement on specific topics as required by section 2105b1bii ta02 19 usc 3805b1bii the congress may deny the consideration of the implementing bill of such agreement under trade authorities procedures by both houses agreeing within 60 days from each other to twin onehouse procedural disapproval resolutions with respect to such agreement section 2105b1a ta02 19 usc 3805b1a b the language of the resolution is prescribed by law section 2105b1b ta02 19 usc 3085b1b 12 these provisions are enacted as an exercise of the rulemaking power of either house section 2105c ta02 19 usc 3805c see also text on p 2 regarding rule status of trade authorities procedures under section 151 13 the law does not specify the committee of referral in the senate but by necessary implication of section 2103c5di it is the committee on finance see subitem 14 see footnote 12 crs7 c the resolution may be introduced by any member of either house is referred to the ways and means committee and the rules committee in the house and to the finance committee in the senate and is nonamendable section 2105b2a ta02 19 usc 3805b2a15 d on the floor of either house the resolution is considered under the same expedited procedure section 152 trade act of 1974 see item 1d above as an extension disapproval resolution but only if other procedural disapproval resolution or traderemedy laws resolution see item 3 below with respect to that trade agreement has previously been reported in that house by the respective committee of referral section 2105b2b ta02 19 usc 3805b2b it is not in order to consider procedural disapproval resolution not reported in the house by the ways and means committee and the rules committee or in the senate by the finance committee section 2105b2c and d ta02 19 usc 3805b2c and d 3 nonbinding traderemedy laws resolutions16 if the traderemedy laws provisions of prospective tariffandnontariff trade agreement as described in the required relevant presidents report17 are inconsistent with the traderemedy laws negotiating objectives of the trade act of 2002 either house may adopt onehouse nonbinding resolution finding that there exists such inconsistency section 2104d3cii ta02 19 usc 3804d3cii18 b the language of the resolution is prescribed by law section 2104d3cii ta02 19 usc 3804d3cii c the resolution may be introduced by any member of either house is referred to the ways and means committee and the rules committee in the house and to the 15 the nonamendability language of this resolution differs in the procedures of the two houses in the house it applies to either ways and means and rules committee in the senate it is unqualified respectively subclauses iiii and iiiii suggesting that this provision permits amendments on the house floor amendments on the house floor however are not in order pursuant to section 152d2 19 usc 2192d2 of the specific expedited procedure unless that provision does not apply because of denial on whatever grounds of its applicability 16 see footnote 12 the term traderemedy laws resolution is used in this report to avoid possible ambiguity the legislation uses only resolution 17 the president is required by section 2104d3a of the trade act of 2002 19 usc 3804d3a to report to the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee at least 180 days before entering into tariffandnontariff agreement regarding any proposals in the agreement that is being negotiated which would require change in us countervailing antidumping or safeguard laws and how such proposals relate to the us negotiating objectives with respect to trade remedy laws stated in section 2102b14 19 usc 3802b14 18 the adoption itself of the nonbinding resolution has objective consequences but the fact of its having been reported in either house denies the application of the expedited procedure see item 2d above to floor consideration of procedural disapproval resolution in that house crs8 finance committee in the senate and is nonamendable section 2104d3ciii ta02 19 usc 3804d3ciii19 d on the floor of either house the resolution is considered under the same expedited procedure as an extension disapproval resolution see items 1d and 2dabove but only if procedural disapproval resolution or other trade remedy laws resolution with respect to that trade agreement has previously been reported in that house by the respective committee of referral section 2104d3c ta02 19 usc 3804d3c 19 the same nonamendability as applies to procedural disapproval resolution see item 2c and footnote15 above also applies under this rule to nonbinding resolution but this in practice has effect on procedural disapproval resolution since any such effect is contingent on the nonbinding resolutions merely having been reported see item 2d above and footnote 18 up to which procedural stage it is nonamendable in either house traderemedy laws resolution is also generally nonamendable in the house under the provisions of section 152d of the trade act of 1974 which applies to the consideration of such resolution unless the applicability of that rule is denied on whatever grounds to such consideration for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32011
