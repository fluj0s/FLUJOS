6608c25 shspec78 the antisocial personality reference hcob 27sep66 or introduction to scientology ethics pp 914 the antisocial personality lrh has made complete list of the characteristics of suppressive person the purpose of ethics is to get technology in ethics doesnt intend social betterment it only intends to ensure case advance by getting suppressives out of the environment an auditor must know about this so that he can recognize and handle pts and suppressive pcs this ability to recognize and handle can prevent an auditor from having loses and invalidating himself when an sp doesnt make case gain when pcs rollercoaster dont blame the past auditor or the hgc blame the sp pc who is critical of an auditor has missed withhold from that auditor the pc who goes on nattering about the thousands of hours of auditing that he has received with gain is another matter you can be too propitiative towards people whereupon you cant help them anymore you exert control and dont give effective help lrh never owed scientology to anyone one of the earliest techniques for controlling pcs taken from early dianetics was to walk out on pc who refused to be controlled with the rfactor that the session would resume when the pc decided to follow the auditors directions at that point lrh hadnt run into failed psychoanalytic cases and people who had been roughed up by psychotherapy there were lot of these people in the first foundation they were generally pts or sps these cases are much harder to handle with auditing than criminals the sp on the case may be nowhere near the pts individual or the trouble that the pts causes in early dianetics pc who got better and then crashed was said to have been on manic person who is manic and then gets depressed however has just run into an sp and has gone pts there is such thing as manic its just that psychiatrists hate people in that condition and so they promptly cave them in the guy says wow at last i realize that i can be sane and isnt the world wonderful the psychiatrist says ohmigawd youre in manic weve got to give you eighteen extra shocks or pills etc the psychiatrist says that euphoria is very bad this explains away persons getting better and this will be used by sps against you as an argument against scientology the only reason for cavein or rollercoaster is an sp joe winters overt was making deal with the publisher of book one to write book to get the mds into dianetics doctor looks at dianetics he claimed that dianetics was an art knack that couldnt be taught this led to complete squirrel nonstandard tech being spread all over the place with results i couldnt hold in tech because i 1 didnt have control of it and 2 didnt have ethics until ethics was gotten in in organizations it was impossible to keep tech in and working fully because there was way to hold the line and way to get the suppressives off tech lines an auditor who doesnt recognize ethicstype cases ie sps and ptss is setting himself up for loses and for eventually quitting auditing there is such thing as case who doesnt have wall there only picture of wall the universe for such person is very flimsy mockup consisting of dubin you can run contact processes on such person cchs and he will come back into contact with the wall that you and i see occasionally he will be startled while doing objective processes to see the wall getting shaky and disappearing you may think that you are making him ot but you arent because the wall is still there for you if he were ot it wouldnt be he will realize that his mockedup wall is not the wall that is there this individual doesnt have to be an sp to have mockups in place of walls for the sp people every one of us are mockups too we arent there god knows what is there in the place where we are standing paranoid is mild version of this an sp is not paranoid paranoid just thinks people are against him an sp is person who is surrounded by identities which others dont see the paranoid may see purely imaginary people who arent there at all the sp creates his enemies out of the real whole cloth of you and he doesnt see his enemies unless another real person is there to be turned into pink alligator crazed indian or the priests of the spanish inquisition what is really there in the sps universe is something else other than people something very threatening and dangerous yet mostly this person looks totally sane he doesnt hallucinate he is just delusional he is stuck on the track really stuck he has never moved beyond the stuck point on the track an sp doesnt make case gain because person needs to have at least concept of motion on the time track to get from one end of an engram to the other the sp cant run an engram because he is stuck in past moment in time and cant move through through the successive moments of the engram you or i might have had an incident there for long time without noticing it but the sp has had the world there for long time and hasnt noticed it the antisocial personality has been looked at before but it has never been fully described in earlier therapies we call such person suppressive because that is more explicit and accurate term these are the qualities of the suppressive 1 we speaks only in generalities he is always talking about they and everybody this effects ptss so they echo it but somebody told the pts newspapers speak of 850 dead on holiday but they neglect to state that 85 million people were on holiday that makes it all look sort of dangerous governments likewise govern the people or the masses not the individuals who are actually there this is where the sweeping generality comes in 2 he deals in bad news continually and exclusively he is critically hostile he never relays good news but may twist good news to bad bad news will be relayed and worsened very sp person is so batty that when he moves up in the world he makes this the norm 3 he alters any communication he never duplicates cf the game of telephone 4 he doesnt respond to treatment reform or psychotherapy the really bad sp wont come anywhere near an auditing chair the one thing this fellow can not do is confront his own mind the sp feels that he would go totally insane if he had to take one tiny little look at his mind that is why the sp goes mad at the idea of getting people to look at their own minds an sp is afraid that if he deals with the mind even slightly those spooks will move slightly sps cannot be reasoned with on the subject of the mind your crime is that you have almost made them confront something that they dont dare confront and you have almost exposed them because they are not under good control and if they love control they will be put away 5 he is surrounded by others in one or another state of ruin and cavein ptss around such person we find associates who are cowed ill failing or not succeeding if not actually driven insane when you try to treat these associates they dont keep their gains 6 he habitually selects the wrong target this is not conscious it is not just getting mad at the boss because somebody is mad at you it is very reactive in the sp for instance psychiatrists wreck people and sps in governments attack us there is complete dissociation it is bill failed at college so therefore we should go on diet not bill failed at college therefore we shouldnt send his brother pete because the sp attacks the wrong target he doesnt succeed very will on job this is saving grace 7 he doesnt complete cycles of action if he finds out that he has completed one he has to redo it he mustnt arrive and he doesnt arrive because his time sense is loused up he doesnt have the idea of consecutive events 8 he will often confess to alarming crimes with sense of guilt or personal responsibility whatsoever he doesnt know that there is difference between good and bad behavior 9 he supports and approves of only destructive downstat and criminal groups and attacks constructive ones 10 he approves of destructive actions and disapproves of good actions he says it is probably good thing that we had the war because 11 helping others is an activity that drives him nearly berserk however activities that destroy in the name of help are closely supported the idea is to get rid everybody or to make them all miserable 12 he has bad sense of property he thinks that the idea that people own things is pretense made up to fool people nothing is ever really owned to the sp delusions of grandeur and desires to dominate have nothing to do with suppressiveness the concept of ones own importance does not have any bearing here an sp may or may not have the feeling of being very important as may nonsp there is nothing wrong with dominance this is not the same as suppression it is what person does with dominance that counts an auditors skill depends on his recognition of the situation in which he finds himself auditing when you manage to isolate series of characteristics that give you certain expectancy knowledge of this data becomes valuable if you can see several characteristics on an sp in person you can predict the rest and unload this is an ethics case an auditor should know that there could be more than one sp on the case he should locate the other sps if the first s and d doesnt get permanent results even though it was well done you could do successful s and d and at much later date the pc could find another sp and rollercoaster from that
