relief and recovery with the completion of action on hr 2638 the 110th congress brought its consideration of the regular appropriations acts for fy2009 to close early in the next session however the 111th congress will have to address the issue of funding the nine regular appropriations acts for the remainder of the fiscal year according to the congressional budget office actment of the consolidated appropriations act for fy2009 brought total discretionary budget authority for the fiscal year to 10896 billion including 9937 billion in nonemergency spending and 959 billion in

bioshield provided and adjusted in earlier laws on an annualized basis continuing appropriations for fy2009 provided in the act amounted to 4200 billion including 3909 billion in nonemergency spending and 290 billion in emergency spending continuing appropriations were provided only through march 6 2009 so the annualized amounts may differ from the final amounts for the fiscal year depending on subsequent funding actions total budget authority for the three regular appropriations acts included in the act amounted to 6696 billion including 6028 billion in nonemergency spending and 669 billion in emergency spending mostly from the bridge fund provided in pl 110252 continued economic turmoil prompted congress and the president to enact an economic stimulus measure early in the 2008 session

the form of regular appropriations acts as well as continuing and supplemental appropriations acts1 discretionary spending which accounts for more than onethird of total federal spending is spending that is under the control of the house and senate appropriations committees for the most part discretionary spending funds the routine operations of the federal government it is distinguished from direct spending which is controlled by the legislative committees in substantive law and funds such mandatory programs as social security and medicare2 discretionary spending and direct spending together make up total federal spending the number of regular appropriations acts had been fixed at 13 for several decades3 realignment of the house and senate appropriations subcommittees at the beginning of the 109th congress reduced the number of regular appropriations acts considered each year to 11 and 1 for background on the appropriations process see crs report 97684 the congressional appropriations process an introduction by sandy streeter 2 funding for some mandatory spending programs such as medicaid and veterans compensation is provided in annual appropriations acts but the spending levels for these prog rams are controlled by the substantive law that established them even though the funding is provided in annual approp riations acts it is not considered to be discretionary spending 3 for information on changes in the number of regular appropriations acts over the years see crs report rl31572 appropriations subcommittee structure history of changes from

increased the number to 124 over the past several decades recurring difficulties in enacting many of the regular appropriations acts as freestanding measures have led to innovative changes in legislative practices beginning in the late 1970s continuing appropriations acts sometimes took the form of omnibus legislation in some instances incorporating the full text of multiple regular appropriations acts for fullyear funding instea d of providing shortterm funding by formula 5 in more recent years the house and senate sometimes have combined multiple regular appropriations acts into omnibus appropriations measures termed consolidated appropriations acts to bring action on appropriations measures to close at the end of session6

with action on regular appropriations acts both for fy2007 and fy2008 several aspects of the process that was employed for the two fiscal years including the postponement of final action on appropriations measures for one fiscal year unti l the next session and the use of an unfinished regular appropriations act as vehicle for consolidated appropriations act to wrap up action proved to be harbingers of the process congress would employ in 2008 in addition president bush and the democratic leadership in the house and senate differed markedly over the appropriate level of total discretionary spending especially for fy2008 the president largely was successful in pressuring congress especially through veto threats to hold the total level of nonemergency discretionary spending for fy2008 to the level that he recommended which was roughly 20 billion less than what could have been accommodated under the fy2008 budget resolution the disagreement between the president and democratic congressional leaders over the appropriate levels of total discretionary continued into the 2008 session

appropriations acts for fy2007 before the lameduck session ended in early december and congressional leaders decided to defer further action until the 110 th congress 4 in the 109th congress the

leaders in congress signaled their intent to consider an omnibus appropriations act in december that would split the difference with regard to 22 billion in additional spending to which president bush objected10 on december 8 office of management and budget director jim nussle issued statement indicating that the president would veto the omnibus appropriations act being developed in part because according to press reports it would include 18 billion in additional domestic and emergency spending above the presidents budget11 in response to the veto threat the democratic leaders abandoned their split the difference plan and developed an omnibus appropriations act that adhered to the presidents limit of 933 billion with limited additional emergency funding12 8 crs report rl33681 fy2007

used to wrap up action in late 2007 on the remaining 11 regular appropriations acts as well as emergency funding for military operations in iraq and afghanistan13 the measure hr 2764 originated as the stateforeign operations appropriations act for fy2008 which pa ssed the house in june and the senate in september of 2007 in deciding to use hr 2764 as the wrap up vehicle for fy2008 appropriations congressional leaders also decided to avoid conference procedures that often are used to bring the house and senate into final agreement on measure instead congressional leaders decided to reach final agreement by means of an exchange of amendments between the two chambers which occurred between december 17 and december 1914 president bush signed the bill into law on december 26 2007 as pl 110161

for fy2009 president bush requested total nonemergency discretionary budget authority for the fiscal year of 9876 billion counting an advance appropriation of 22 billion for bioshield provided in prior legislation the total request for nonemergency discretionary budget authority for fy2009 amounted to 9898 billion with respect to emergency discretionary budget authority the president requested 758 billion including 700 billion for the global war on terror and 58 billion for gulf coasthurricane recovery 15 combining both emergency and nonemergency spending the presidents request for discretionary budget authority for fy2009 totaled 10656 billion the presidents fy2009 request was reestimated by the congressional budget office cbo in march at 9916 billion in nonemergency discretionary budget authority16 the cbo reestimates did not change the additional amount of emergency discretionary funding 758 billion requested by the president in total cbo estim ated the presidents request for discretionary budget authority at 10674 billion according to cbo the presidents request for nonemergency discretionary spending reflected varying rates of growth or decline by category if funding for operations in iraq and afghanistan was excluded from the comparison discretionary budget authority under the presidents proposals would grow by 38 percent or 37 billio n from 2008 to 2009 appropriations for defense would increase by 72 percent and funding for homeland security activities would rise by 78 percent other appropriations would decline overall by 05 percent 17

2008 president bush indicated topline request of 9916 billion in discretionary spending for fy2009 reflecting modest adjustments to his original request18 two days after submitting the midsession review the president reiterated his request to congress that discretionary budget authority for fy2009 excluding emergency spending not exceed 9916 billion statement of administratio n policy sap on the military construction veterans affairs appropriations act for fy2009 which included conditional veto threat against other fy2009 appropriations acts stated the administration supports discretionary limit of 9916 billion in fy 2009 which is 50 billion or 53 percent increase over the fy 2008 enacted level if congress believes additional spending is needed that funding should be offset with reductions to lowerpriority programs without adding to the governments burden on taxpayers instead the appropriations committees spending allocati ons exceed the presidents discretionary spending levels by nearly 25 billion if congress increases va funding above the presidents request and does not offset this increase with spending reductions in other bills the president will veto any of the other bills that exceed his request until congress demonstrates path to reach the presidents topline 19

annual appropr iations acts and other budgetary legislation within constraints established in yearly budget resolution required by the congressional budget act of 1974 as amended budget resolution policies are enforced in large part by points of order that may be raised during house and senate consideration of spending revenue and debtlimit legislation20 with regard to total discretionary spending for the upcoming fiscal year the house and senate appropriations committees are given an allocation in the joint explanatory statement accompanying the conference report on the budget resolution as required by section 302a of the 1974 act pursuant to section 302b of the act the two committees then subdivide their allocations among their subcommittees in this way the cost of each annual appropriations act developed by subcommittee and reported by the full committee can be compared to its section 302b suballocation of discretionary spending to determine compliance with the budget resolution on occasion overall budget policies reflected in budget resolution may be modified by agreements or understandings reached between congressional leaders and the president agreements or understandings that call for more discretionary spending than the budget resolution recommends may be accommodated during legislative action mainly through the use of waivers of points of order or

the senate adopted the conference report on june 4 by vote of 4845 and the house adopted it on june 5 by vote of 214210 like the previous year the budget resolution for fy2009 recommended total level of non emergency discretionary spending that was more than 20 billion above the presidents request21 media accounts typically cited nonemergency discretionary budget authority of 1016 billion for fy2009 reflecting adjustments for advance appropriations and other factors the amount was about 245 billion above president bushs request22 taking into account both emergency and nonemergency spending the fy2009 budget resolution recommended total discretionary spending for fy2009 of 1088447 billion23

g3g140g157g156g561 the timing of initial house and senate action on the regular appropriations acts for fy2009 was influenced largely by the consideration of two other measures24 first the two chambers devoted considerable attention to hr 2642 the supplemental appropriations act for fy2008 the bill originated in 2007 as the military construction and veterans affairs appropriations act for fy2008 passing the house in june and the senate in september funding for the military construction and veterans affairs appropriati ons act was included in the consolidated appropriations act for fy2008 and congressional leaders decided to use hr 2642 as the vehicle for supplemental appropriations and other matters various complex and controversial issues were addressed during consideration of hr 2642 provoking veto threats from president bush and complicating action on the measure through an exchangeofamendments procedure that occurred between the two chambers during may and 21 for

in emergency funding for military operations in iraq and afghanistan for fy2008 and bridge fund for fy2009 but also more than 20 billion in nonmilitary emergency funding for fy2008 63 billion for veterans education benefit over multiyear period and 8 billion for 13week extension of unemployment benefits25 president bush signed the measure into law on june 30 2008 as pl 110252 122 stat 23232416 the second measure affecting the timing of action on the regular appropriations acts was the fy2009 budget resolution sconres 70 the budget resolution set in place the blueprint for house and senate action on budgetary legislation affecting fy2009 and later years and determined the total allocation of discretionary spending to the appropriations committees house and senate action on sconres 70 was co mpleted on june 5 2008 marking the first time that budget resolution was agreed to in an election year since 2000 shortly after final agreement was reached on the fy2009 budget resolution the house and senate appropriations committees approved the section 302b suballocations on june 18 and june 19 respectively and began the process of marking up individual regular appropriations acts with the intent of reporting all 12 of them continued disagreement between democratic congressional leaders and president bush over discretionary spending levels and the impending presidential election toward the end of the session however made the issue of house and senate floor action on the appropriations acts unclear democrats dont plan to finish work on the spending bills before the election unless president bush agrees to negotiate over spen ding the white house earlier this year said bush would veto spending bills that exceed his requestmirroring the stance that created last years appropriations standoff democrats who eventually capitulated to bushs demand at the end of the year dont want to go through the same exercise again and are hoping they can complete the process next year under democratic president bush has proposed total of 9916 b illion in discretionary spending with an effective freeze on domestic programs while the final democratic budget adopted last week would allow an add itional 211 billion in fiscal 2009 discretionary spending inclu ding cap adjustments plus 35 billion more than bush proposed in advance appropriations the democrats add itional funding would be used for domestic programs both house and senate appropriations intend to mark up and report each of the 12 fiscal 2009 spending bills however in order to set the stage for later completion of the process those bills will reflect funding priorities that democrats can point to before the november elections and they are expected to become the base for final appropriations action early next year when democrats believe they will have larger majorities in both chambers but its uncertain how many bills will be considered by the full chambers 26 the house appropriations committee

policy the house and senate versions of the second stimulus measure originated in the appropriations committees and entailed appropriations of roughly 60 billion for such matters as infrastructure projects energy development unemployment compensation job training and medicaid and food stamps assistance senate majority leader harry reid indicated that the senate would meet in lameduck session on november 17 to continue consideration of second stimulus proposal and it was considered likely that the house would convene as well31 in the interim the senate continued to convene periodically in pro

measures developed in late september32 the senate met on november 17 and began the consideration of several legislative proposals including an extension of unemployment compensation benefits that had

in infrastructure spending and wide range of other stimulus and recovery activities congressional leaders have indicated that they w ill again turn to the issue of economic stimulus in january 2009

available to review them 53 as provided for under section 426 of the 1974 act the point of order was disposed of when the house voted on whether to consider hres 1488 the house agreed to consider the resolution by vote of 242168 thereby rejecting the point of order at the conclusion of debate the house ordered the previous question on hres 1488 by vote of 231198 and agreed to the resolution by

to amendment number 5670 and submitted cloture motion on his motion to concur55 the amendments were pro forma in nature and changed the effective date of the act by one to two days the intent of these

the senate completed action on the motion to concur in the house amendment56 upon successful vote 8312 to invoke cloture on the motion to concur amendment number 5670 was withdrawn and amendment

issued statement upon signing the bill indicating his concern with some of its features 57 first he criticized the inclusion of continuing appropriations for fy2009 i am disappointed that the congress passed longterm continuing resolution there is much work to be done and the congress should not adjourn for the year without finishing important business on spending taxes and free trade agreements second he stated generally his objection to the inclusion in the act of the kinds of provisions often carried in appropriations acts ie reporting requirements legislative vetoes and similar provisions that he regards as undermining his constitutional authority58 finally this legislation contains certain provisions similar to those found in prior appropriations bills passed by the congress that might be construed to be inconsistent with my constitutional responsibilities to avoid such potential infirmities the executive branch will interpret and construe such provisions in the same manner as i have previously stated in regard to similar provisions 55 see the congressional record daily ed of september 26 2008 at pp s9850s9851 earlier in the day the senate took comparable actions with

omb in the implementation of appropriations acts involves the apportionment of funds which is intended mainly to prevent agencies from using all of the funds appropriated to their accounts before the fiscal year or other period of availability expires under the apportionment process omb makes appropriated funds available to an account in increments typically onequarter of the annual amount for each quarter of the fiscal year 59 because continuing appropriations acts commonly provide funds for portion of the fiscal year omb usually issues special instructions to agencies regarding apportionments whenever such measure is enacted on september 30 2008 omb issued bulletin 0802 apportionment of the continuing resolutions for fiscal year 2009 instructing agencies with respect to apportionments for continuing appropriations provided in division of pl 11032960 the bulletin supplemented instructions regarding apportionments under continuing resolutions provided in section 123 of omb circular a1161 in the bulletin omb director jim nussle indicated that with limited number of exceptions appropriations for accounts included under division would be apportioned automatically based on the annualized amount multiplied by the lower of the percentage of the fiscal year covered by the act 4301 or the historical seasonal rate of obligations for the period of the year covered by the act62 thus an account with an annualized appropriation of 100 million for fy2009 under the act automatically would be apportioned 43010 million or lesser amount if the historical seasonal rate of obligations so indicated through march 6 2009 59 the apportionment process was established pursuant to the antideficiency act for more discussion of the process and the antideficiency act see 1

in accompanying committee report language or other documentation on the basis of specified projects activities entities or geographic areas and typically at the request of the president or one or more members of congress has been regular feature of the annual appropriations process for many years during the 110th congress after several congresses in which the use of earmarks increased significantly the house and senate adopted new rules governing their use63 the appropriations cycle for fy2008 was marked by contention between president george w bush and congress over the number and dollar amount of earmarks the consolidated appropriations act for fy2008 brought action on the regular appropriations bills for that fiscal year to close64 president bush signed the measure into law on november 13 2007 as pl 110 161 121 stat 18442456 upon signing the bill he issued statement indicating his concern with some of its features including the inclusion of nearly 9800 earmarks that total more than 10 billion according to his estimates65 on january 28 2008 in his state of the union address to congress president bush indicated that he would veto future annual appropriation acts if the number and cost of earmarks were not reduced substantially66 on the next day he issued executive order 13457 entitled protecting american taxpayers from government spending on wasteful earmarks67 in general eo
