congressional hearings are the princi pal formal method by which committees collect and analyze information in the early stages of policy making whether legislative oversight investigative or combination of these all hearings share common elements of pr eparation and conduct house rule xi sets down many of the regulations to which committee hearings must conform including the quorum requ irement advance submission of witness statements the opportunity for minority pa rty members to call witnesses of their choosing the fiveminute rule for questioni ng witnesses witness rights the process for issuing subpoena the procedure for closing hearing to the public and the broadcast of hearings and media behavior committees have broad latitude in how they hold hearings in part because they adopt their own rules of procedure these rules may amplify and supplement house rules but cannot contravene them customs of committees not embodied in rules also vary considerably among committees committees usually plan extensively for hearings early planning activities commonly include collecting background information from sources within and outside the house preparing preliminar hearing memorandum for the chair and members discussing the scope of the h earings and the expected outcome and scheduling and giving public notice of h earings carefully selecting witnesses determining the order and format of th eir testimony and preparing questions or talking points for committee members to use in questioning are all important considerations other arrangements incl ude preparing briefi ng books determining if and how the hearings will be broadcast and attending to the many administrative matters such as schedulin g an official reporter on the day of hearing committee needs quorum to conduct business while most hearings are open to the public committee may vote to close hearing for reason specifically stated in house rules representatives typically make opening statements at the beginning of hearing then witnesses are introduced and may be sworn by the chair witnesses present oral testimony in accordance with the arranged format this verbal testimony generally is summary of the written testimony submitted in advance the question and answer period that follows is an opportunity for committee to build public record on matter and gather needed information to support future actions house rules give each committee member five minutes to question each witness but i ndividual committees determine the order in which their members will question witnesses and may allow extended questioning by committee members or staff following hearing committee staff may prepare summary of testimony draft additional questions for the days witne sses and begin to ready the hearing transcripts for printing and publishing to th web transcripts generally are printed along with supplemental materials appr oved by the committee although printing is not

rules adopted by the committees of the house of representatives committee print 109th cong 1st sess washingt on gpo 2005 hearings in the hous of representatives guide for preparation and procedure1 introduction coverage and organization of the report under house rules each committee has aut hority to hold hearings whether the house is in session has recessed or s adjourned house rule xi clause 2m1a committees may hold hearings in washington or hold field hearings elsewhere within the united states whether legislative oversight investigative or combination of these all hearings share common elements of preparation and conduct this report emphasizes these shared elements the report describes provisions of house ru that pertain to hearings citations to these rules are included for reference while house rules generally apply to committees and subcommittees it is house rule xi that contains many provisions specific to hearings house rules set the general framework in which committees hold hearings each committee is required to adopt nd publish written rules of procedure which must be consistent with house ru but which may expand upon them house rule xi clause 2a1 committees rules generally apply to its subcommittees although some contain specific procedures for subco mmittees house rule xi clause 1a1a the rules of many committees contain provisions pertaining to hearings this report gives examples from 109th congress committee rules2 these examples are illustrative intending to show the variation in particular areas in some cases multiple committees have the same or similar provisions but only one committee provides an example thus this report doe s not attempt to list comprehensively all provisions of committee rules that apply to hearings further the summaries of both house and committee rules are not intended to capture every nuance and detail of the ru themselves members and staff are advised to consult the text of the appropriate house or committee rule httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30539crs2 in addition to house and committee rules this report covers common committee practices in planning and holding hearin gs given that each committee has its own rules and practices hearing procedures may differ significantly among committees members and staff needing comprehensive information on the hearing practices of particular committee are advised to consult the committee this report is organized into four main sections the int roduction addresses not only coverage and organization but also the role of hearings in the committee process and the various types of hearings committees plan extensively for hearings section 2 preparation for hearings discusses how committees carry out these activities among other issues this section covers deciding whether to hold hearing sources that assist committees with hearings procuring supplemental sta ff by contract or detail holding joint hearings scheduling and giving public notice of hearings selecting witnesses and determining the order and format of testimony securing advance written testimony from witnesses written statements of nong overnmental witnesses procedures for issuing subpoe nas and taking depositions preparing briefing books for committee members procedures for broadcasting heari ngs and techniques for attracting and managing the media and administrative arrangements section 3 conducting hearings covers how hearing is held among other matters it discusses quorum requirements closing hearing to the public the rights of witnesses opening statements by members introducing and swearin g in witnesses oral testimony by witnesses and the question and answer peri od following oral testimony finally section 4 posthearing activities describes activities committees often undertake following hearing fo r instance committee staff may prepare summary of testimony or dr aft additional questions for witnesses or print the hearings transcript along w ith supplemental materials hearings in the committee process hearings are the primary informationgathering technique committees use in policy making and oversight hearings ma be held on issues in the absence of specific legislation but many examine on par ticular legislative proposals in either case hearings serve variety of purposes hearings inform members staff and thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30539crs3 3 walter j oleszek congressional procedures and the policy process 6th ed washington cq press 2004 p 93public about measures and issues and he lp assess the intensity of support for proposals hearings serve to monitor government programs and activities and expose problems that congress can later correct hearings give citizens an opportunity to participate in the policy pro cess and help build the public record for measure or issue for number of reasons house committ ees act only on minority of the measures introduced and referred to them for instance committee often receives many proposals in each major policy area w ithin its jurisdicti on but ultimately may choose to act on only few m easures in each such area if any committees usually send bill to an appropr iate subcommittee for initia l consideration although committees do not uniformly require such referral committee may decide to send bill to subcommittee for initial scrutiny because of the technical nature of the issue the history of prior handling of the matter or political factors among other reasons when committee or subco mmittee considers measure it generally takes four actions when subcommittee initiates some of the four actions the extent to which the full committee repeats some of these steps varies among committees and from issue to issue the sequence of actions assumes the committee favors measure but at any time the committee may discontinue action first committee may seek agency comment by sending copy of the measure to the executive departments or agencies having relevant policy expertise and soliciting their written evaluation of the proposal the executive agency typically sends copy of the measure to the offi ce of management and budget omb for determination as to consistency with the presidents program second committee may decide to hold one or more hearings further committee action without hearings is the exception alt hough hearings have been bypassed to move measures expeditiously through committee or because of action on related bill in the previous congress the importance of this action has been noted by congressional scholar walter j oleszek the decision to hold hearing is often critical point in the life of bill measures brought to the fl oor without first undergoing the scrutiny of hearings will likely receive sharp criticism the importance of the committee stage is based on the assumption that the experts the committee members carefully scrutinize proposal and hearings provide demonstrable record of that scrutiny3 third committee will meet to mark up or recommend amendments to the legislation based in part on information received at hear ings markup is the critical stage where the committee decides how the nguage of the bill should appear when it is presented to the house for consider ation while bill can be subsequently amended on the house floor committees have the important prerogative of shaping legislation before considera tion by the full chamber httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30539crs4 4 for more information on committee reports see crs report 98169 house committee reports required contents by judy schneider 5 senate committees also hold hearings on appr oving treaties and on confirming presidential nominees in fulfillment of the senates advice and consent responsibility under the constitution because the house does not have this constitutional duty its committees do not hold confirmation hearingsfourth the full committee will report the legislation to the floor subcommittees must report to their parent committees when committee reports measure it is also required to issue written report that typically describes and explains the measures purposes and provisions and lls members why the measure should be passed the report also may summarize any re levant hearings that were held this reporting requirement may be waived4 types of hearings all hearings share common elements of pr eparation and conduct some of these are governed by house rules particularly house rule xi at the same time hearings differ for number of reas ons first each committee must adopt its own rules of procedure for each congress house rule xi clause 2a12 these must be consistent with house rules but may also expand or elaborate on them committee rules often contain provisi ons regulating hearings second customs not necessarily refl ected in committee rules vary among committees for example some committees do not routinely enforce the fiveminute rule when examining witnesses rule that generally allows member to question each witness for five minutes until every member of the committee has had this opportunity house rule xi clause 2j2 third hearings are held for different purposes depending on the purpose hearings can be grouped into three br oad classes legisl ative oversight or investigative5 sometimes one hearing has dual purposes such as both legislative and oversight while in general there are separate house rules governing each type of hearing some rules are invoked more frequently at particular types of hearings for instance rule xi cl auses 2k3 and 5 contain provisions particularly applicable to investigative hearings such as protections for the rights of witnesses also committees power to subpoena house rule xi clause 2m1b usually is used to obtain docum ents for investigative hearings or to require the testimony of w itnesses at these sessions committees hold legislative hearings on measures or policy issues that may become legislation sometimes committ ee holds hearings on multiple measures before ultimately choosing one vehicle for further committee and chamber action most often the goal of legislative hearing is the consideration of measure for enactment into law these hearings pr ovide forum where facts and opinions on legislation can be presented by witn esses with diverse backgrounds including members of congress and othe r government officials re presentatives of interest groups and academia and from additional c itizens affected by the proposal httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30539crs5 6 for more information on select committees see crs report rs21243 ad hoc select committees use in the house of representatives by judy schneideroversight hearings review or study law an i ssue or an activity often focusing on the quality of federal programs and th performance of government officials hearings also help ensure that the execution of laws by the executive branch complies with legislative intent and that administrative policies reflect the public interest oversight hearings often seek to improve the efficiency economy and effectiveness of government operations on march 16 2005 for instance the house subcommittee on space and aeronautics of the committee on science held an oversight hearing on the future of aerona utics at nasa many committees also oversee existing programs in the context of hearings on related legislation or routinely perform oversight when it is time to reauthorize program or agency investigative hearings share some of the characteristics of legislative and oversight hearings the difference lies in congresss stated determination to investigate usually when there is spicion of wrongdoing on the part of public officials in governmental operations or of private citizens in business or other activities congress has exercised its investigative function since the earliest days of the republic and its most famous inquiries are benchmarks in american history credit mobilier teapot dome armymccarthy watergate and irancontra in some cases select committees have been created to conduct investigations6 at other times the standing committees have investigated matters within their jurisdictions investigative hearings may lead to legi slation to address any problems uncovered judicial proceedings may precede or follow congressional inquiries committee hearings are mostly held in washington but sometimes committee will decide there is need to hold hearing elsewhere field hearings may be held for variety of reasons field hearing brings congress to the people committee can hear from witnesses who might find it inconvenient or be unable to travel to washington to testify field hearing also can present information to citizens who are directly affected by government program or issue it can enhance committees oversight activities by providing the opportunity to evaluate progra ms on site it can orchestrate public support for and enhance the visibility of an issue field hearing can reinforce committee chairman or other committee members relationship with hi s or her constituents it can provide an opportunity for local regional and sometimes national media coverage field hearings are often held in geographic area where the subject matter of the hearing is particularly relevant for example on august 13 2005 the subcommittee on energy and mineral resources of the house committee on resources held field hearing in port fourchon louisiana on the benefits of offshore oil and gas development regulations in the house forbid official travel for political or campaign purposes field hearings cannot be employ ed for explicitly political or electoral purposes the formal authority for field hearings is implicit in house rule xi clause 2 which states in part that committee is authorized to sit at such times and places within the united states whether the house is in session has recessed or hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30539crs6 adjourned and to hold such hearings as it considers necessary house rules do not otherwise distinguish field hearings from those held in washington preparation for hearings preliminary issues committee considers variety of issues in deciding whether to hold hearing committee must define the information it needs evaluate the policy matters or the political message it wishes to communicate and then determine whether hearing is the best method of achieving its goals hearing agenda is influenced by several factors including timing of the hearing the salience of issues to the nati on the importance of policies to inte rest groups and matters of si gnificance to the president house leaders and other representatives programs under comm ittees jurisdiction that need to be reauthorized generally receive committee scrutiny as do instances of reported waste fraud or abuse each committee receives dozens or even hundreds of proposals for possible examination and studies matters not embodied in specific legislation in the context of this overall workload committee must decide whether holding particular hearing is the best use of staff and f unds committee also considers whether and how hearing would fit into its overall schedule it may be particularly difficult for committees with broad jurisdictions to jus tify the allocation of limited resources to hearing or even to find time in its crowded schedule in order to obtain approval for hearing committee staff often prepare preliminary hearing memorandum for the chair that includes information such as the scope and purpose of the hearing the ex pected outcome possible witnesses how many hearing days are planned and pe rhaps the views of the minority party informal discussion with committee members and staff may suffice sources of outside assistance numerous governmental and nongovern mental resources are available to committees to assist with hearings given that most hearings focus on government programs or potential programs executive agencies often are major providers of information committees may request inform ation directly from specific offices or may place requests through an agencys c ongressional liaison an office established to respond to congressional requests for information each of the three congressional support agen cies can assist with hearings the congressional research service crs can assist in framing the agenda for hearings preparing background and policy studies preparing bibliographies and conducting database searches providing information on positions of interest groups and other key players httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30539crs7 suggesting witnesses and drafting questions for members to ask them making its experts available on nonpartisan basis as witnesses analyzing testimony preparing

us economy the federal budget nd federal programs it assists committees by preparing cost timates of legislati on its assistance to congress in carrying out the congressiona l budget act provides framework and useful background and analysis for committ ee hearings its responsibilities include estimating the fiveyear budgetar costs of legislation tracking congressional budget actions against targets established in budget resolutions scorekeeping estimating costs to state local and tribal governments of carryin g out mandates to be imposed by legislation making periodic forecasts of economic trends and baseline projections of spending and reve nue levels against which proposed changes in taxing and spendi ng policies can be measured conducting studies of pr ogrammatic or policy issu that affect the federal budget and preparing an annual report on spe nding and revenue options for reducing the federal deficit nongovernmental organizations provide wealth of resources for committees knowledgeable individuals in universities policy research institutes law and consulting firms and trade and other nonprofit associations often are willing to assist committees with data analysis nd testimony interest groups with public policy concerns become involved at the h earing stage in an attempt to frame the issues early in the legislative process studies indicate that lobbyists believe testifying at congressional hearings is an important and effective technique for influencing legislation in addition to c onsulting policy experts and special interest groups committees seek information and ssistance from ordinary citizens who havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30539crs8 7 us congress committee on house administration committees congressional handbook available online at httpchahousegovservicescommitteehandbookhtmdirect experience with proposed policy or whose lives will bear the impact of congresss eventual decision supplemental staffing committees may find it useful on occasion to supplement their staff to assist with hearings committees may hire consultants or employ staff detailed from any government agency or department with the permission of the committee on house administration committees may also accep t temporary services of fellows regulations governing consu ltants detailees and fellows are contained in the committees congressional handbook 7 the services of individual consultants must be intermittent or temporary not to exceed 12 months or the end of congress whichever occurs first contract first must be approved by majority of the committee that seeks consultant services information including the proposed contr act the need for th contract the amount to be paid and the consultants resume are then submitted for approval to the committee on house administration contracts for services which are the regular and normal duties of committee staff will not be approved by the committee on house administration the chair of committee seeking to have an employee detailed from department or agency should submit writte n request to the head of the appropriate agency or department an detail cannot exceed one year or the end of congress whichever comes first if the agency agrees to loan an employee the committee chair submits an authorization request with copy of the detailing agreement to the committee on house administration writte n approval of the committee on house administration is needed before an employee may be detailed in the 109th congress committee generally may use detailees from government agencies on reimbursable or nonreimbur sable basis the total number of non reimbursable detailees at one time must remain at or below 10 of the committees staff ceiling as established by the speaker committees must reimburse agencies for detailees above this limit although committee must reimburse the government printing office for all detailees the house office of the legislative counsel assists in drafting legislation works closely with committees and sometimes assigns staff to work directly with committee staff also may be available from the many fellowship internship and volunteer programs that place individuals with committee or member offices these programs can provide staff ranging in expertise from high school and college students with little or experience to trained professionals and subject specialistshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30539crs9 8 joint hearings in the house are also commonly conducted by two different subcommittees of the same standing committee 9 joint session of congress occurs upon the adoption by both chambers of concurrent resolution the house and senate meet in jo int session primarily to hear remarks by the president the presidents annual state of the union address is an example joint meeting is held when both chambers declare themselves in recess by resolution or unanimous consent congress holds joint etings to receive addresses from foreign dignitaries and to commemorate events joint hearings each panel has the discretion to hold hearings jointly with another committee or subcommittee panels meeting jointly must agree on common rules of procedure and determine logistical questions such as meeting rooms sometimes two house panels meet jointly for example on july 19 2005 the committee on financial services and the committee on resources held joint hearing on improving land title grant procedures for native americans8 sometimes house and senate panels hold joint hearing for instance on july 24 2003 subcommittees of the house committee on science and the senate committee on commerce science and transportation held joint hearing on commercial human space flight some observers view joint committee sessions as an efficient use of time and resources joint hearings bring together the expertise and differing perspectives of panels they may reduce the difficulties and delays that arise from contradictory actions and proposals joint committee ssions however tend to be infrequent some members believe that separate perspectives and approaches provide significant benefits to congress separate hearings increase avenues of access for witnesses and opportun ities for influence and exposure of committee members and leaders further coordinating meeting times between two panels may present greater scheduling difficulties scheduling house committees may hold hearings at any time except during joint session or meeting of the house and sena house rule xi clause 2i9 any member may try to persuade committee to hold hearings but the chair generally controls the schedule paramount in scheduling for many committees is choosing date and time convenient for committee leaders the co mputerized scheduling service of the house information resources office hir allows committee to coordinate its schedule with that of other committees to minimize scheduling conflicts for its members in order to maximize memb er participation the rule s of the house republican conference provide that committee rule s should seek to avoid overlapping scheduling of subcommittee sessions the rules of many committees thus contain provisions requiring coordination in scheduling hearings among committee and its subcommittees httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30539crs10 examples of several committee rules regarding scheduling follow subcommittee chairs of the house committee on the judiciary set dates for hearings after consultation with each other nd with the full committee chair each subcommittee chair of the house committee on government reform may set hearing dates only with the approval of the chairman of the full committee in order to assure availability of meeting rooms and to avoid scheduling conflicts on the house committee on rules the chair of each subc ommittee schedules hearings only after consultation with the full committee chair and subcommittee can meet at the same time as the full committee notice under house rules the chair of committee except rules must give at least one weeks public notice of the date place and subject of hearing house rule xi clause 2g3 hearings may be held with less than one weeks notice if either the chair with the concurrence of the ranking minority member or the committee by majority vote determines need when this happens the notice should be given as soon as possible notices of hearings ppear in the daily digest section of the congressional record and in the houses computerized committee scheduling service of hir often committee sends announcements of hearing to all its members both well in advance of and immediately before the hearing some committees also require that particular information be sent to their members or made available to the public for instance the rules of the house committee on financial services direct the chairman to provide members of the committee concise summary of the subject of the hearing at least three days in advance the house committee on resources provides its members with tentative witness list and memorandum explaining the subject of the hearing as soon as practi cable after the announcement of the hearing additionally the chair makes available to committee members any official reports from departments and agencies on the subject matter of the hearing the house committee on education and the workforce generally requires its chair to make public the final list of witnesses 48 hours before hearing convenes choosing and inviting witnesses choosing witnesses is often one of the most important issues in planning hearing committees pay careful attention to which viewpoints will be represented who should testify and the order nd format for presenting witnesses in some cases committee will strive to make sure that all reasonable points of view are represented while in other cases witnesses expressing only particular points of view will be invited house rules allow the minority party members of committee to call witnesses of their choice on at least one day of hearing if majority of these members makes this request to the committee chair before completion of the hearing house rule xi clause 2j1 in lieu of this formal option the minority sometimes works inform ally with the majority to invite witnesses representing its views httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30539crs11 in order to testify witness must be invited by the committee before officially inviting witness committee staff iden tify and often interview prospective candidates when suitabl witnesses are found the committee chair typically sends formal letter of invitation this lette r generally gives the witness some basic information including the purpose subject date time and place of the hearing in addition to specifying the portion of meas ure or issue the witness should address the letter may contain limitation on the length of the witnesss oral testimony the committee may send the witness additi onal information this information may include list of committee members the committees rules the measure under consideration and material fro m the media relating to the issue often staff contact is indicated staff will sometimes meet with witnesses before hearing to answer questions and to review procedure committee may reimburse witness for expenses related to testimony and if reimbursement is expected the letter of invitation may address this point under guidelines of the committee on house ad ministration reimbursement of travel expenses incurred by witness is descri bed as an extraordinary measure the committee chair must specifically authorize the payment house rules set the rate of pay to be the same per diem amount as authorized by the committee for members and employees of the house and actua l expenses for travel however per diem is paid to witnesses who are summoned at the place of the examination house rule xi clause 5 advance written testimony letter of invitation also may request that the witness send the committee biographical information and an advance copy of written testimony house rules require each witness insofar as is practi cable to file with the committee an advance copy of written testimony and then to limit oral remarks to brief summary of his or her statement house rule xi clause 2g4 the individual rules of committees often state how far in advance of the h earing testimony should be filed usually between 24 and 72 hours the rules some times also require submission of multiple copies and specify to whom the tes timony should be delivered for example the committee on financial services requires sufficient copies of written testimony two business days in advance including copy in electronic format the committee on rules asks for testimony 24 hours in advance the committees on house administration sma ll business ways and means and education and the workforce ordinarily re quire testimony 48 hours before hearing the committee on small business calls for 100 copies of testimony with one copy to furnished directly to the ranking minority member of the committee the committee on education and the workforce also calls for brief summary of written testimony permanent select committee on intelligence witnesses generally must file statements 48 hours in advan ce in written and electronic form committee has authority to decide when it is impracticable to require advance written testimony for instance when witness is invited with too little notice the house committee on appropriations does not apply the requirement for advance written testimony and subsequent oral summary of the testimony for witnesses athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30539crs12 hearings on the overall federal budget in most cases however committees assert their right to receive advance copies of testimony for several reasons before the hearing committees may want to summarize or outline the testimony draft questions tailored to each witnesss statement and photocopy the statement for distribution to the press and others committee rules sometimes sti pulate that testimony be submitted in both written and electronic form electronic submission can facilitate printing the testimony as part of the hearing record and making testimony available to the public online the committee on armed services for instance asks that prepared statement be submitted in electronic form at the time the written statement is submitted similarly for matters of original jurisdiction th committee on rules requests each witness to file statement of proposed testimony in written and electronic form to the maximum extent practicable statements of nongovernmental witnesses the advance written statements of nongovernmental witn esses must contain particular information in addition to resume the statement must contain the amount and source of any federal grant or contract received by the witness or the organization being represented during the curre nt or previous two fiscal years house rule xi clause 2g4 the truth in testimony rule as it is commonly called was adopted at the beginning of the 105th congress it is intended to provide committee members and the public with in formation on witnesss education experience and receipt of grants and contracts so as to assist members in evaluating the witnesss views and remarks the rules of the committee on science state explicitly that witnesses should provide info rmation on grants or contracts which are relevant to the subject of the testimony committee rules rarely compel additional specific information to be included in witness testimony notable exception is the committee on ways and means which requires hearing witness who submits statement for the record or written response to published request for comments to include list of all clients persons or organizations on whose beha lf the witness appears format and order of witness testimony committees determine the format and order of presenting witnesses according to one traditional format witness summarizes his or her written statement and then takes questions from committee members before second w itness testifies committees have used different format s recently and it has become common to present witnesses with diverging viewpoints as panel the usual practice in this case is for all witnesses on the panel to make statements then for committee members to pose questions to the panel some observers believe that this format produces more stimulating debate and more effectively elicits pertinent information committees have experimented with several other formats for gathering information which may not ways be considered formal hearings for instance committees have held seminars consisting of briefings by experts with informalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30539crs13 opportunities for asking questions and roundtable discussions where committee members and staff have freeflowing dialogue with knowledgeable outsiders the order in which witnesses testify is arranged at the discretion of the committee protocol dictates that member of congress or highranking executive branch official will generally testify before other witnesses celebrity witnesses are carefully placed in the line up because they of ten generate significant media and public attention they often are scheduled to appear at times of high attendance by committee members and viewing by the public such as at the beginning of the hearing academics representatives from interest groups and other private citizens are arranged in way that most favorably presents information and communicates the intent of the committee for example committee may arrange its witnesses to allow one individual to refute argu ments made by nother witness subpoenas and depositions most individuals respond favorably to an invitation to testify believing it to be valuable opportunity to communicate and publicize their views on question of public policy if however if person will not come by invitation committee may require witness to appear through s ubpoena house rule xi clause 2m1b committees also may subpoena any rele vant books records correspondence memoranda papers and othe r documents subpoenas are used infrequently and most often at investigative hearings under house rules committee may aut horize and issue subpoena with majority quorum present however co mmittee may delegate this authority to its chair under any limitations it establishe s many committees currently require majority approval to issue subpoena but have adopted additional procedures for instance the house committee on agriculture requires that notice of meeting to issue subpoena be sent to all members by 5 pm on the day preceding the meeting several committees including energy and commerce allow the chair to issue subpoena during any adjournment of the hous for more than three days the house committee on energy and commerce chair must notify the committee of this action as soon as possible in case later than one week after service of the subpoena if request for subpoena has not been previously rejected by the committee on transportation and infrastructure or one of its subcommittees the full committee chair may issue the subpoena after consu ltation with the ranking minority member the chair must then notify all committee members of the action other committees have delega ted general subpoena authority to the chair the rules of the committee on small business allow the chair to issue full committee subpoena although the ranking minority member must be promptly notified further the chairs of small business subcommittees are authorized to issue subpoenas for their panels but require the approval of majority of the subcommittee and the full committee chair committee issuing subpoena can obtain the appropriate form from the clerk of the house subpoenas usually are deliv ered by authorized committee staff or by the us marshals office compliance with subpoena can be enforced only at the direction of the house under one met hod of enforcement committee could reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30539crs14 resolution citing for contempt of congre ss an individual who did not respond to subpoena if approved by the house the reso lution would be sent to the office of the us attorney for prosecution committee staff commonly consult with experts to gather information in preparation for hearing more form means of obtaining information for investigative hearings in particular is through the use of depositions under this method committee staff may take tes timony in private in some cases from individuals who also appear as witnesse s the testimony is sometimes taken under oath and transcript may be prepared individuals often are accompanied by counsel and respond to prepared questions given that house rules do not expressly authorize committees to take depositions on occasion the house has granted specific authority for such action by resolution in such cases the committee us ually has adopted procedures expanding on its authority to take depositions as an example the house in 1997 approved resolution authorizing staff of the committee on government reform to take depositions in the study of alleged politi cal fundraising improprieties and possible violations of law hres 167 105th congress agreed to june 20 1997 briefing books committees often ask staff to prepare mmary and background material for use by their members before and during hearing this information is sometimes assembled into briefing books or folders to present issues in systematic uniform way briefing books might include variet of items including description of the subject scope and purpose of the hearing for legislative hearings copy and explanation of each measure under consider ation and comparison of all measures to be discussed are useful background mate rial might include re levant statutes and regulations court decisions press articles agency reports academic studies and chronology of major events in order to assist members with witnesses the books might contain list of witnesses in their order of appearance copy or summary of written testimony and biographical inform ation briefing material might also include questions or talking points for committee members to use in opening statements and in examining witnesses before hearing committee staff sometimes brief members and other staff staff may conduct oral briefing s in addition to or in lieu of preparing briefing books these sessions provide an opportunity to di scuss matters of par ticular interest to individual committee members publicity and media considerations committees goal in holding hearing often is not narrowly limited to collecting information for policy development the goal may include publicizing an issue or problem to focus attention on it public exposure of problem at an oversight or investigative hearing can be particularly effec tive technique public officials often seem responsiv to correcting program defici encies when an issue has been broadly publicized hearings also are used to build support for proposalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30539crs15 among the public generally or certain sectors thereof members and witnesses make arguments that form part of the public record in support of future committee action such as reporting measure house rules influence how committee plans for media coverage and other publicity matters for example house rule s require that hearings be open to the public as well as to radio television and still photography coverage unless committee votes to close hearing house rule xi clause 2g2a hearings may be closed only for limited and specific reasons for example to deal with information that could compromise national security see closing hearing below detailed provisions of house rules dealing with broadcasting committee hearings point up the importance to congre ss of television covera ge house rule xi clause 4 among the issues covered are the following radio and television coverage ca nnot be used as partisan political campaign material to promot or oppose persons political candidacy coverage must be in strict conformity with and observance of the acceptable standards of dignity propriety courtesy and decorum traditionally observed by the house hearings open to the public must be open to coverage by the media although in november 1997 the h ouse removed language in rule xi clause 4 that previously allo wed subpoenaed witnesses to request that television lenses be c overed microphones used for media coverage be turned off and still cameras not be used once chair determines the number of cameras that will be permitted in hearing the executive committee of the radio and television correspondents galleries determines how those cameras will be allocated among the television media neither television cameras nor s till photographers can be positioned between the witness table and members of the committee and photographers may not position themselves where they might unnecessarily obstruct cove rage by other media television cameras must operate from fixed positions and cannot unnecessarily obstruct c overage of the hearing by other media television and radio equipment must be in place before the hearing begins and cannot be installed or removed from the hearing room while the committee is in session technicians may install additional lighting in hearing or meeting room in order to raise the ambient lighting level in hearing to the lowest level necessary to provide adequate television coveragehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30539crs16 otherwise additional lighting such as spotlights and strobelights is not permitted preference in allocating the numbe r of still photographers permitted by committee chairs must be given to photographers from the associated press photos nd united press international newspictures if requests are made by more media than permitted by the chair pool coverage is arranged by the standing committee of press photographers individuals providing media coverage must be accredited to the radio and television correspondent s galleries or the press photographers gallery the house committee on ways and means is one of the few committees with rules expanding upon these provisions the committee forbids interviews in the hearing room while the committee is in ssion and individual in terviews must take place before the gavel falls to convene meeting or after the gavel falls for its adjournment the media must notify the committee one day in advance of planned electronic coverage committee press aides usually are responsib for planning media coverage for hearing and they typically employ number of diverse techniques for attracting and managing the media in some cases press aides in memb ers personal offices take similar actions on behalf of individual committee members often an early objective is to seek the assistance of the house press gallery the periodical press gallery and the radio and television correspondents ga llery the mission of the gallery staffs is not only to facilitate coverage of house activities on behalf of the media but also to assist member and committee staff with their media responsibilities gallery st aff can assist committees in variety of ways by distributing press releases and witness st atements resolving differences involving camera crews and making pool arrangem ents for maximum television coverage including setting cables for broadcasting some committees routinely inform the media of upcoming events the information typically includes list of hearings and description of each emphasizing why the hearing is important for each hearing these calendars provide the date time and location as we ll as staff contact press releases are standard format for informing journalists of newsworthy committee activities in addition to the committees press list press releases also can be distributed to committee and member offices and the house press galleries language from press releases can be used to draft dear colleague letters and member statements for use in committee and on the floor committee staff often put together media packets prior to hearings the packets can include variety of material such as statements by the committee chair and other members list of witne sses and copies of writte n testimony and background material such as press clippi ngs and support agency studies httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30539crs17 as the day of hearing approaches reporters often will seek out staff for information many committees prefer that j ournalists discussions with staff be on background and not for attribution speak ing for attribution usually is limited to committee members press conferences are common technique for personally informing interested journalists of important issues in an upc oming hearing and for clarifying issues immediately following hearing some committee members prefer to meet informally with reporters in the hallway out side the hearing room others prefer more structured environment in the hearing room or the members office administrative matters dozens of administrative arrangements n eed to be made before hearing and these usually are the responsibility of th committees administrative staff two important administrative matters are 1 reserving hearing room and 2 arranging for an official reporter early in the planning stage if committees own hearing rooms are unavailable it may try to use room of another committee in the past it has also been possible to use rooms within the jurisdiction of the speaker and other leaders and officers by contacting the per tinent offices upon request the office of official reporters clerk of the house will provide reporter to transcribe hearing many administrative details concern the physical setup of the hearing room these may include arranging furniture and equipment setting up items on the dais such as nameplates writing materials wate r and ice supplying the chair with gavel block and timer providing the chair and other members with materials not included in the briefing books such as copies of committee and house rules reserving seats for the press staff witne sses or other individua ls and arranging for turning on audio consoles mic rophones and lighting suffi cient copies of relevant materials such as member and witn ess statements should be provided for distribution at the hearing security during hearings is provided by the us capitol police if hearing deals with sensitive or volatile issues or there is unusually great public interest multiple uniformed or plain clothes officers may be assigned the capitol police may take any law enforcement actions that become necessary during the course of hearing such as responding to disturba nce or making an arrest of an unruly spectator the capitol police also provide security for protected witnesses such as the attorney general and other hi ghranking government officials field hearings field hearing presents planning c onsiderations different from those for washington hearings these include identifyi ng the city district or state and the specific location for ex ample federal building school or private venue where the hearing will be held it may be necessary fo r staff to travel to the field location day or more before the hearing to ensure that arrangements are to the committees satisfacti on including the specific layout of tables and chairs for committeehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30539crs18 members witnesses and th public and the availability of sound system and the technicians to operate it security personnel also need to be arranged when field hearings involve oversight of federal agency it may be possible under committees oversight authority to request that the agency provide transportation for committee members and staff usually such requests require letter from the committee chairman to the agency head expenses incurred by representative or staff aide attending fiel d hearing including transportation meals and incidentals such as parking charges are reimbursable by the committee holding the hearing automobile rentals are also reimbursable provided that the car is used only to transport members or staff authorized by the committee for travel regulations printed in the house administration committees committees congressional handbook cover several matters specific to field hearings committees are authorized to rent commercial space when public space is not available or suitable if committee has to lease private space fo r field hearing it may be asked to provide certificate of insurance the house does not carry private insurance policy and generally doe s not permit the use of committee funds to pay for private insurance policy house regulations also stipulate that the office of official reporters to committees will either send an official reporter or arrange for stenographic reporter from commercia l firm at the location of the field hearing conducting hearings as previously noted hearings involve ex tensive preparation by the day of the hearing important requirements of h ouse rules such as publicly announcing hearings have been met critical decisions such as choice and format of witnesses have been made necessary research has been conducted and relevant materials assembled in briefing book briefing s may have been prepared for committee members staff witnesses and the press administrative issues such as arranging for an official reporter have been atte nded to as result of thorough and careful preparation many hearings proceed wit hout surprises committees must however occasionally confront unanticipated events that require change in plans such as calling additional witn esses or closing session to the public quorum each committee can determine the number of members required for its hearings but house rules require minimum quorum of two members at any hearing house rule xi clause 2h2 while most committees have adopted this minimum there are variations for example the co mmittee on ways and means requires quorum of two but its rule requires that every effort be made to secure the presence of at least one majority and one minority party member the rules committee operates with different hearings quorums for different purposes the quorum is five for full committee testimony on requests for rules three for measures or matters of original jurisdiction before the full committee and two for testimony before subcommitteeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30539crs19 committee staff often poll members before the start of hearing to determine who plans to attend some times staff also obtain info rmation on where members can be reached in case they are needed to meet the quorum requirement committees sometimes proceed with hearings without quorum for instance committee may work through roll call vote on the floor by leaving only one member presiding over the hearing while others vote the first committee member to return from the floor may replace the member presiding who then leaves to cast his or her vote if however if any member makes point of order that quorum is not present the committee cannot continue to conduct busin ess until the presence of quorum is established closing hearing the vast majority of committee hearings are open to the public as required under house rules but house rules permit committees to close hearing for specific reasons and outline the procedure for doing so house rule xi clauses 2g2 and 2k5 hearing may be closed to the public because disclosure of testimony evidence or other matters to be consider ed would endanger the national security would compromise sensitive law enforcement information or would violate any law or rule of the house of representatives in order to close all or part of hearing committee must vote by roll call in open session and with majority present when quorum is present for taking testimony however committee may vote to close hearing 1 because the anticipated testimony at an investigative hearing may tend to defame degrade or incriminate any person or 2 solely to discuss whether there is reason to continue the hearing in closed session house rules permit most committees to close hearing on specific day and on one subsequent day of hearings the committees on appropriations armed services and intelligence however may vote to close their hearings for five additional consecutive days of hearings members of the house gene rally may attend but not pa rticipate in hearings of committees except the committee on standard s of official conduct on which they do not serve nevertheless the house may vote to authorize committee to use procedures for closing hearing to the public to close hearings to members not on the committee as well witness rights in 1955 the house first adopted rules to pr otect the rights of witnesses these rules responded to criticism about the treatment of w itnesses particularly at investigative hearings such as those to explore communist party activities in the united states today severa l protections for witnesses especially at investigative hearings are contained in house rules hous rule xi clause 2k for example witnesses are provided copy of the rules of the committee and house rules applicable to investigative hearings th ey may be accompanied by their own counsel to advise them of their constitutional rights further if evidence will tend to defame degrade or incriminate person the committ ee may vote with quorum present for taking testimony to meet in closed session the committee may proceed in openhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30539crs20 session only if with majority present it determines that the evidence will not have these effects on this person in either case the committee will give the person an opportunity to appear as witness nd will take requests from the individual to subpoena additional w itnesses in other instances the chair receives and the committee disposes of requests to subpoena witnesses witnesses also are protected by the constitution in particular the fourth fifth and first amendments while committees need to obtain answers to questions the fourth amendment prohibits unreasonable s earch and seizure to obtain information under fifth amendment protection agains t selfincrimination witnesses cannot be compelled to give evidence against themselves unless granted immunity the first amendment protects witnesses who may seek to refuse compliance with committee subpoena by claiming that the committee infringed on the witnesss right to free speech assembly or petition opening statements when present the committee chair ordina rily will preside over its hearings house rules allow each committee chair to signate majority party member to be the vice chair of the full committee or subcommittee and stipulate that the vice chair presides in the temporary absence of the chair house rule xi clause 2d if both the chair and vice chair are absent the most senior majority party member present presides in order to begin the hearing the ch air usually makes an opening statement introducing the subject and purpose of the session the chair ma describe important events leading to the hearing and key contemporary issues he or she also may outline the committees approach to the matter how interruptions such as for roll call votes will be handled and the schedule of future hearings when finished the chair generally recognizes the ranking nority party member to make an opening statement and may then recognize other members not all committees allow opening statements by all committee members the rules of the committee on resources for instance preclude opening statements unless the chair or designee makes statement in which case the ranking minority member or designee also may make statement in practice chairs of other committees sometimes discourage opening statements in the interest of time perhaps asking that interested members instead submit opening statements for the printed hearing record where opening statements are permitted they usually occur under the five minute rule which allows member to speak for five minutes when recognized by the chair this is not always the case however while the committee on energy and commerce chair and ranking minority memb er or designees may speak for five minutes other committee members are limited to three minutes each the committee on science attempts to restrict the total time of opening statements its rules generally provide that after consultation with the ranking minority member the chair limits the total time for opening statements by members to more than 10 minutes the time is equally divided among members present who wish to make an opening statementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30539crs21 introducing witnesses and administering the oath following any opening statements the chair generally introduces each witness in accordance with the arranged order nd format committee member other than the chair might introduce witness in some cases the committee on resources for instance permits committee member to introduce witness who is constituent house rules authorize the chair or any member designated by the chair to administer the oath to witness house rule xi clause 2m2 in practice most committees rarely require testimony under oa th swearing in of witnesses appears to be more common at investigative hearings and hearings dealing with sensitive subject matter for instance under the rules of the permanent select committee on intelligence the chairman may require tes timony of witnesses to be given under oath or affirmation further the rules of few committees prescribe particular oath if witnesses are sworn the rules of th committee on armed services contain the following do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony you will give before this co mmittee or subcommittee in the matters now under consideration will be the truth the whole truth and nothi ng but the truth so help you god oral testimony of witnesses under house rules each co mmittee requires witnesses to limit their oral testimony to brief summary of their argument insofar as is practicable house rule xi clause 2g4 in the interest of time and because writte n testimony generally is available to the committee in advance it is usually not necessary or desirable for witness to read his or her entire written statement on some committees the chair has the discretion to determine how long witness may speak on the committee on agriculture witnesses may be limited to brief summaries of their statements within the time allotted to them at the discretion of the chair other committees have adopt ed rules stipulating how long witness may speak typically for five minutes for instance each witness before the committee on resources and the committee on science is restricted to five minute summary of his or her wr itten remarks resources committee witnesses may be granted additional time by the chair in consultation with the ranking minority member and science com mittee witnesses may receive additional time from the chair fiveminute rule fo r questioning witnesses the question and answer period which fo llows witnesss opening statement presents an opportunity for committee to build public record and to obtain information to support future committee actions committee staff sometimes prepare questions or talking points for committee leaders and other members in some cases the expected line of questioning is di scussed in advance with witnesses house rules generally accord committee mbers five minutes to question each witness until every member s had this opportunity house rule xi clause 2j2 in practice many committees allow an extension of time by unanimous consent andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30539crs22 few committees such as veterans affairs specify this in their rules after the first round of questioning under the fiveminut rule committees can determine how to dispose of any additional time some committees rules specify procedure for using additional time for exampl the rules of the house committee on international relations provide for second round of questioning under the fiveminute rule while rules of the committee on agriculture allow the chair to limit the time for further questioning extended questi oning of witnesses house rules allow committee to extend the time for questioning witnesses by adopting rule or motion to allow an equal number of its majority and minority party members to question witness for period not to exceed one hour in the aggregate house rule xi clause 2j2b similarly committee may adopt rule or motion allowing its majority and minority staff to question witness for equal periods of time not to exceed one hour in the aggregate house rule xi clause 2j2c several committees have adopted proce dures allowing extended questioning the rules of some committees for instance the committee on agriculture give only members this authority they state that the chair and ranking minority member may designate an equal number of members from each party to question witnesses and that unless majority of the committee or subcommittee determines otherwise staff may not interrogate witnesses the source of the authority for extended questioning differs among committees on the committee on government reform the chair with the concurrence of the ranking minority member or the committee by motion may permit members or staff to question witnesses for an extende d period on the committee on veterans affairs the chair after consultation with the ranking minority member may designate members or authorize st aff to conduct extended questioning further few committees specify when any extended questioning may occur for instance the chair of the committee on veterans affairs cannot recognize member for extended questioning until all members have had chance to question witnesses under the five minute rule the rules of the house committee on government reform allow ex tended questioning at the di scretion of the chair only after all members have had an opportunity under the five minute rule few committee rules also detail how the time for extended questioning is to be allocated on the committee on government reform the chair determines how to allocate the time permitted for extended questioning by majority members or staff and the ranking minority member determines how to allocate the time for minority members or staff the chair or the ranking minority member as applicable may allocate the time for extended questioning by staff to members httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30539crs23 order of quest ioning witnesses each committee has discretion to determine the order in which its members may question witnesses common procedure allows alternating between the parties in order of seniority by contrast the socalled early bird rule permits members to question witnesses ba sed on members order of arri val at the hearing some committees use combination of these tw methods the rules of many committees contain provisions granting their chairs flexibility in recognition to take into consideration the ratio of majority to minority members present in practice committee chairs may entertain requests to proceed out of order to accommodate the schedules of i ndividual members committee rules covering the order for questioning witnesses vary on the committee on house administration questioning begins with the chair and ranking minority party member then alternates between the majority and minority parties further the chair is to take into consideration the ratio of majority to minority members present in order not to disadvantage the majority the chair may accomplish this by recognizing two ma jority party members for each minority member recognized in the case of the committee on armed services all members present at the start of hearing will be recognized in order of seniority and thereafter members are recognized in order of appearance however the committee chair also must take into consideration the ratio of majority to minority members present and the chair and ranking nority member take precedence upon their arrival relevancy of debate and questions house rules require members speaking on the floor to confine themselves to the question under debate house rule xvii1 b while this rule is generally applicable to debate in committee some committee rules apply it explicitly to hearings in questioning witnesses members of the committee on transportation and infrastructure are limited in their remarks to the subject matter under consideration the committee on armed services requires questions put to witnesses to be relevant to the measur or matter under consideration the house committee on government reform requires that questions put to witnesses at investigative hearings be relevant to the subject matter before the committee and that the chair rule on relevance of questions put to witnesses on the committee on agriculture members are limited in debate to the subject matter under consideration unless permission is granted by unanimous consent to extend remarks beyond the subject in addition questions put to witn esses must be germane to the matter under consideration questioning by other than committee or subcommittee members house rules allow committees to adopt rule or motion per mitting majority and minority staff to question witnesses for equal periods of time see extended questioning of witnesses committee rules sometimes give additional authority for staff to question witnesses the permanent select committee on intelligence forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30539crs24 example allows witnesses to be interrogated by such committee staff as are authorized by the chairman in c onsultation with the ranking member several committees permit their members to participate in the hearings of subcommittees of which they are not mbers although the specific provisions differ in some cases this prerogative appears to be restricted to the chair and ranking minority member of the full committee for instance many committees allow the chair and ranking minority member to serve exofficio on all subcommittees which presumably allows them to participate in subcommittee hearings the rules of the committee on appr opriations make explicit that the chair and ranking minority member may sit as members of all subcommittees and may participate in subcommittee work their participation may include voting by contrast the committee on education and the workforce allows any committee member to attend subcommittee hearings and question witnesses other committees explicitly bar nonsubcommittee members from engaging in certain activities while presumably allowing them to question witnesses any member of the committee on veterans affairs for ex ample may sit w ith any s ubcommittee during any hearing or meeting but may not vote be counted for quorum or raise point of order relatedly even if hearing is closed to the public all members of the house generally may attend but not participate in hearings of committees except the committee on standards of official conduc t on which they do not serve house rule xi clause 2g2c committee may however use the procedures for closing hearing to the public to close hearings to members not on the committee if the house so authorizes by vote posthearing activities after examining the last witness the committee chair closes the hearing the chair may summarize what has been lear ned about the issue and comment on the future committee schedule or expected action after day of hearings staff may be as ked to prepare summary of testimony the summary may be distributed to committee members and the press and become part of any published hearing followup questions can be prepared and submitted to witnesses for written replies to clear up points not resolved during the hearing if the hearing is investigative the committee can prepare and issue its report if the hearing is legislative the committee may proceed to mark up and report measure to the house finally committees attend to administrative details following hearing such as restoring the hearing room to its original condition and sending thankyou letters to witnesses committees generally are protected on the house floor from points of order against actions that occurred during their h earings under house rules in general point of order cannot be raised on th floor against measure reported by committee on the grounds that the committee had not complied with provisions inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30539crs25 house rules concerning hearings house rule xi clause 2g5 member of the reporting committee may however make such point of order on the floor if the point of order was made in committee in timely manner but was improperly overruled or not prope rly considered printing hearings committees are required to keep transcripts of their hearings most committees regularly ask the office of official repor ters clerk of the house to provide reporter to transcribe hearing transcripts must be substantially verbatim house rule xi clause 2e1a only technical grammatical and typographical corrections authorized by the pers on making the remarks are allowed further committees usually publish their transcripts although publication is not required house rules encourage committees to publish their hearings on reported measures in general if hearings have been held on any measure or matter reported by committee the rules require the committee to make every reasonable effort to have the hearings printed and available to members before floor consideration house rule xiii clause 4b general appropriations b ills may not be considered in the house until printed hearings have been available for at least three calendar days excluding saturdays sundays and gal holidays except when the house is in session on such day house rule xiii clause 4c in add ition testimony taken in executive session may not be released or used in public sessions without the consent of majority of the committee majority being present house rule xi clause 2k7 the rules of some committees address the authority to print hearings transcripts of budget committee hearings may be printed if the chair so decides or if majority of the members so requests the appropriations committee requires that transcript of all hearings on the federal budget as whole be printed and distributed to members each committee may establish procedures for correcting its transcripts and some committees have rules to expedite this process the committee on ways and means for example requires each witness to correct and return the transcript and members must correct their testimony and re turn the corrected tr anscripts as soon as possible further the committee chair can order transcript printed without the corrections of member or witness if the chair determines that reasonable time has elapsed and that further delay woul d impede the legislative process each committee also has discretion to print supplemental materials as part of the printed hearing for example in its printed hearing committee might include written statements of witnesses charts and research materials prepared by committee staff and letters and testim ony from individuals who did not appear as witnesses printed hearing also might include witne ss responses to questions posed during the hearing that the witness could not answer on the spot or witness responses to follow up questions the rules of some committees address the printing of supplemental material or information for instance the co mmittee on agricultures hearings must include the attendance of memb ers during the hearings httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30539crs26 house rules require that to the maximum extent feasible committees are to make their publications available to the public in electronic form house rule xi clause 2e4 this rules change in the 105th congress was intended to encourage committees to make printed public material s available on the internet while number of committee rules restate this house rule those of the committee on small business expressly state that the proposed testimony of witnesse s must be provided to the public in electronic form since the 106th congress most committees have made written testimony andor hearing transcripts available online see httpwwwhousegovhousecommitteewwwshtml house rules require that committees hearings records and other documents be kept separate from the pe rsonal office records of the chair and generally allow all members of the house access to committees records house rule xi clause 2e2 the legislative reor ganization act of 1946 pl 601 79th
