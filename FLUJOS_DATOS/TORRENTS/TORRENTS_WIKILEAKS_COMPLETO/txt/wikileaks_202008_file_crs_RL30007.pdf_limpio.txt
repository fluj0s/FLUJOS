major changes in federal individual marginal income tax rates the tax reform act of 1986 the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 and the working families tax relief act of 2004 all changed the marginal income tax rate structure the marginal income tax rate structure for 2006 consists of six statutory marginal rates 10 15 25 28 33 and 35 although these acts changed the tax rate structure they maintained in slightly modified form the policy of tax indexation introduced in 1981 under current law the personal exemptions standard deductions earned income tax credit the personal exemption phaseout threshold the itemized deduction limitation threshold the tax rate brackets and other components of the tax structure are indexed for inflation tax indexation helps prevent inflation from producing automatic tax increases and unintended changes in the distribution of the tax burden this report is updated annually to reflect the most recent indexation adjustments

federal individual marginal income tax rates the tax reform act of 1986 tra86 created an individual marginal income tax rate structure that consisted of two statutory tax rates 15 and 28 however tra86 also legislated 5 surcharge on the taxable income of certain upperincome households which effectively created third marginal tax rate of 33 the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 obra90 eliminated the 5percent surcharge and created marginal tax rate structure consisting of three statutory marginal tax rates of 15 28 and 31 however obra90 also contai ned provision that limited the amount of itemized deductions that upperincome households could claim and provision that modified the phaseout of the tax benefits of personal exemptions for upperincome households the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 obra93 added two new marginal income tax rates 36 and 396 at the upper end of the income scale it also delayed indexation of the two new tax brackets for one year in addition obra93 made permanent the limitation on itemized deductions and the phaseout of the tax benefits of the personal exemption the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra 2001 created new 10 marginal income tax bracket it also reduced the top four marginal tax rates to 25 28 33 and 35 with the changes phasedin over the period 2001 through 2006 the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 jgtrra 2003 accelerated to 2003 the phasein of the tax rate reductions originally enacted in egtrra 2001 the working families tax relief act of 2004 extended through 2010 most of the tax changes enacted as part of the 2003 act the following sections of this report describe the changes in the marginal tax rate structure over the past several years in addition the reasons for tax indexation and the mechanics of tax indexation are briefly explained the final section contains the tax rate schedules exemption amounts and standard deductions for joint single and head of household returns for tax years 1989 through 2007 1 g22g138g161g561g20g142g143g152g155g150g561g3g140g157g561g152g143g561g343g351g350g348g561 prior to 1986 there were approximately 14 marginal income tax rates ranging from 11 to 50 for tax years after 1987 the tax reform act reduced the marginal tax rate structure to two statutory tax rates of 15 and 28 although the tax reform act specified that there were only two statutory individual marginal income tax rates it also adopted 5 surcharge on the taxable income of certain upperincome households this surcharge effectively created third marginal tax rate of 33 28 statutory marginal tax rate plus 5 surcharge and produced an anomaly in the tax code that came to be known as the tax rate bubble 1 this report concentrates on statutory marginal income tax rates which are the rates of tax applicable on an increment of taxable income average tax rates on the other hand are tax liability expressed as percentage of income httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30007g11g151g141g146g159g146g141g158g138g149g561g11g151g140g152g150g142g561g22g138g161g561g20g138g157g142g156g497g561g343g351g350g351g561g157g145g155g152g158g144g145g561g344g342g342g349g561

tax rates rose to 33 but then fell back to 28 hence the tax rate bubble the surcharge was adopted so that the 1986 act would not change the distribution of the income tax burden relative to its distribution under pre1986 tax law would meet the needed revenue targets and yet allow the 1986 act to be characterized as having only two statutory marginal tax rates the surcharge was designed to phase out the tax benefits of the 15 tax bracket and the tax benefits of the personal exemptions for upperincome households for joint returns in 1990 the phaseout of the tax benefits of the 15 tax bracket started when taxable income exceeded 78400 and ended when taxable income reached 162770 for single returns the phaseout of the 15 tax bracket occurred over the taxable income range of 47050 to 97620 for heads of households the phaseout occurred over the taxable income range of 67200 to 134930 to demonstrate how the 5 surcharge worked to phase out the tax benefits of the 15 tax bracket consider the following example based on joint returns for 1990 the difference between taxing the first 32450 of taxable income at 28 instead of 15 was 421850 five percent of the difference between the upper and lower phaseout limits was also 421850 162770 less 78400 multiplied by 5 hence assessing the 5 surcharge on taxable income between 78400 and 162770 was equivalent to having taxed the first 32450 of taxable income at 28 rather than 15 the 5 surcharge produced identical results for both single and head of household returns this surcharge effectively raised the marginal tax rate on taxable income within these ranges from 28 to 33 28 statutory marginal tax rate plus 5 surcharge 5 surcharge was also used to phase out the tax benefits of the personal exemption for upper income households in 1990 each personal exemption was worth 2050 and produced tax savings for household in the 28 marginal tax rate bracket of 574 2050 times 28 to recapture this tax savings 5 surcharge was assessed against 11480 of taxable income for each personal exemption claimed 5 surcharge against this amount of taxable income increased tax liability by 574 11480 times 5 which exactly offset the tax savings from the personal exemption the phaseout of personal exemptions started i mmediately after the phaseout of the 15 tax bracket and the phaseout of each exemption occurred sequentially this meant that the taxable income range over which the 5 surcharge applied depended on the number of personal exemptions claimed on the tax return for example on joint return claiming two personal exemptions the 5 surcharge would apply to taxable income between 162770 and 185730 162770 plus two times 11480 on joint retu rn with four personal exemptions the 5 surcharge would apply to taxable income between 162770 and 208690 162770 plus four times 11480 as was also the case with the phaseout of the tax benefits from the 15 tax bracket the phaseout of the personal exemption effectively raised the statutory marginal tax rate from 28 to 33 28 regular tax rate plus 5 surcharge as noted the income range over which the effective marginal tax rate was 33 depended on the number of personal exemptions claimed g17g150g151g146g139g158g156g561g4g158g141g144g142g157g561g20g142g140g152g151g140g146g149g146g138g157g146g152g151g561g3g140g157g561g152g143g561g343g351g351g342g561 the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1 990 obra90 created threetiered statutory marginal income tax rate structure with rates of 15 28 and 31 effective in tax years

table 5 obra90 also eliminated the tax bubble by repealing the 5 surcharge that was instituted under the tax reform act of 1986 tra86 although the 5 surcharge was repealed it was replaced with limitation on itemized deductions and new approach to phasing out the tax benefits of the personal exemption for upperincome households obra90 also reintroduced taxrate differential on capital gains income provisions in the 1986 act had eliminated the preferential tax treatment of capital gains income and hence capital gains income was treated as ordinary income and taxed at regular rates of up to 33 obra90 contained provision which limited the tax on capital gains income to maximum of 28 this provision was effective starting in tax year 1991 the obra90 limitation on itemized deductions worked as follows for tax years starting in 1991 otherwise allowable deductions were reduced by 3 of the amount by which taxpayers adjusted gross income agi exceeded 100000 except in the case of married couples filing separate returns where the agi limit was 50000 for example in 1991 if taxpayers agi were 110000 then his otherwise allowable itemized deductions would be reduced by 300 110000 less 100000 times 3 this provision effectively raised the marginal income tax rate of those taxpayers affected by approximately 1 perc entage point dollar of income in excess of 100000 was taxed as if it were 103 since in addition to the extra dollar of income the taxpayer lost 03 of itemized deductions allowable deductions for medical expenses casualty and theft losses and investment interest were not subject to this limitation for tax years after 1991 the 100000 threshold was indexed for inflation this provision was originally scheduled to expire after tax year 1995 the phaseout of the tax benefits of the personal exemption worked as follows each personal exemption was phased out by factor of 2 for each 2500 or fraction of 2500 by which taxpayers agi exceeded given threshold amount in 1991 the threshold amount for joint return was 150000 for single return the threshold was 100000 and for heads of households the threshold was 125000 for example in 1991 joint household whose agi was 183000 would lose 28 of their total personal exemptions claimed the agi amount in excess of the threshold in this instance would be 33000 183000 agi less 150000 threshold limit the 33000 excess divided by 2500 would produce factor of 132 which when rounded up would equal 14 this figure is multiplied by 2 to arrive at the final disallowance amount of 28 hence if the family had claimed two personal exemptions which at 2150 each would total 4300 they would only be allowed to deduct 3096 4300 total personal exemptions less the 1204 disallowance which is 28 of the total for tax years after 1991 these threshold amounts were indexed for inflation this provision was also scheduled to expire after tax year 1995

tax rate bracket was

obra93 was enacted in august of 1993 the increase in the top marginal tax rates was made effective retroactively to january 1 1993 affected taxpayers however were not assessed penalties for underpayment of 1993 taxes resulting from the tax rate increase and they were also allowed to pay any additional 1993 taxes in three equal installments over twoyear period second obra93 delayed indexation of the new top marginal income tax brackets for one year hence the nominal dollar tax brackets for the 36 and 396 marginal tax rates will remain at the same level for both tax year 1993 and 1994 finally obra93 made permanent both the itemized deduction limitation and the phaseout of the tax benefits from the personal exemption

g152g143g561g344g342g342g343g561 the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra made three major changes to the individual income tax rate structure first it created new 10 marginal income tax bracket for portion of taxable income that had been taxed at the 15 marginal tax rate the new 10 marginal income tax rate bracket applied beginning in tax year 2002 to the first 12000 of taxable income for married couples filing jointly the first 10000 of taxable income for heads of households and the first 6000 of taxable income for single individuals in 2008 the 6000 amount for single individuals was scheduled to be 7000 and the 12000 amount for married taxpayers filing joint returns was scheduled to be 14000 starting with tax year 2009 these marginal tax rate bracket amounts are scheduled to be indexed for inflation second the 2001 act reduced the top four marginal income tax rates over the 2001 through 2006 time period under prior income tax law the marginal tax rate structure for individuals consisted of five rates 15 28 31 36 and 396 the 2001 act reduced the top four marginal income tax rates over sixyear period to 25 28 33 and 35 respectively finally the act increased the width of the 15 tax bracket for married couples filing joint returns to twice the width of the 15 tax bracket for single returns this provision was scheduled to be phasedin over fouryear time period starting in 2005 the end point of the 15 tax bracket for joint returns was scheduled to be 180 of the end point of the 15 tax bracket for single returns in 2005 187 in 2006 193 in 2007 and 200 in 2008 and subsequent years 2 in addition to these changes that directly affected the tax rate structure the 2001 act made several other changes of note it increased the standard deduction for joint returns to twice the size of the standard deduction for single returns with the change scheduled to be phased in over five year period 2005 to 2009 egtrra also repealed the limitation on itemized deductions and personal exemptions for highincome taxpayers with the repeal scheduled to be phased in between 2006 and 2010 2 for more information on these changes see crs

g344g342g342g345g561 the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act jgtrra made several changes to the individual income tax rate structure first it accelerated to 2003 the tax rate reductions originally enacted as part of egtrra that were scheduled to occur between 2004 and 2006 second it accelerated the scheduled expansion in the 10 tax bracket for single and joint returns to tax years 2003 and 2004 in 2005 the 10 bracket reverts to the levels as scheduled under egtrra third it accelerates the scheduled widening of the 15 tax bracket for joint returns to twice the width of the 15 tax bracket for single returns this change would be effective for tax years 2003 and 2004 in 2005 the 15 bracket for joint returns would revert to its levels as scheduled under egtrra fourth jgtrra accelerated the scheduled increase in the standard deduction for joint returns for tax years 2003 and 2004 the standard deduction for joint returns will be twice the size of the standard deduction for single returns in 2005 the standard deduction for joint returns reverts to the levels as scheduled under egtrra

passed the working families tax relief act of 2004 wftra wftra extended several tax provisions that were scheduled to expire at the end of 2004 these expiring tax reductions were enacted under jgtrra which had accelerated implementation of tax reductions originally enacted in 2001 under egtrra among other things wftra extended marriage penalty relief standard deduction and 15 tax bracket for joint returns set at twice the level as those for single returns through 2008 in 2009 and 2010 egtrra provisions apply maintaining the level of the standard deduction and 15 tax bracket for joint returns the 2004 act also extended the increase in the 10 income tax bracket through 2010

in the united states the federal individual income tax is progressive that is as incomes increase income tax liabilities when measured as percentage of income also increase part of this progressivity is achieved through marginal tax rates that increase as taxable income increases in addition the income tax is structured on the basis of nominal dollar amounts some examples of nominal dollar amounts in the income tax are the personal exemption the standard deduction and the earned income tax credit during periods of inflation under an unindexed tax system the progressive nature of the marginal tax rates combined with nominal dollar amounts produces automatic tax increases and unintentional changes in the distribution of the tax burden the effects of inflation on real income tax liabilities can be illustrated in the following manner consider the case of fourperson family with 30000 income who filed joint return in 1989 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30007g11g151g141g146g159g146g141g158

used the standard deduction then its taxable income would have been 16800 30000 less standard deduction of 5200 and four personal exemptions at 2000 apiece income tax liability on taxable income of 16800 would have been 2520 which translates into an average tax rate of 84 2520 income tax liability divided by 30000 income see table 1 for 1989 tax rates now consider what would happen if inflation averaged 5 in 1990 in order to maintain the same real gross income that it had in 1989 the family would have to earn 31500 in 1990 in other words income would have to rise by 1500 for the family to maintain the same real purchasing power that it had in the previous year assuming there is indexation the familys taxable income would be 18300 31500 less the standard deduction of 5200 and four personal exemptions at 2000 apiece income tax owed on taxable income of 18300 would be 2745 which translates into an average tax rate of 87 as can be seen from this example under an unindexed tax system inflation increased this familys real income tax burden by 03 of percentage point between 1989 and 1990 if the tax system had been indexed for the assumed 5 inflation the family would have experienced increase in their real tax burden for instance under an indexed system the value of the standard deduction for joint return would have increased from 5200 in 1989 to 5460 in 1990 the personal exemption would have increased from 2000 to 2100 under these circumstances the familys 1990 taxable income would have been 17640 31500 income less standard deduction and personal exemptions based on this taxable income their income tax liability would have been 2646 which translates into an average tax rate of 84 thus under an indexed tax system the family would have experienced change in their real income tax liability between 1989 and 1990 g22g145g142g561g15g142g140g145g138g151g146g140g156g561g152g143g561g11g151g141g142g161g138g157g146g152g151g561 provisions originally contained in the economic recovery tax act of 1981 and later amended by the tax reform act of 1986 the omnibus budg et reconciliation act of 1990 and the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 specify that certain components of the individual income tax system will be indexed for inflation these components include the standard deductions the additional standard deductions for the elderly and the blind the personal exemption the earned income tax credit eitc the income breakpoints between the various tax rate brackets the income level at which the limitation on itemized deductions becomes effective and the income level above which the tax benefits of the personal exemptions are phased out the adjustment for any given tax year is to be based on the percentage amount by which the average consumer price index for all urban co nsumers cpiu for the twelve month period ending on august 31 of the preceding year excee ds the average cpiu during specified twelve month base period the base period varies depending upon the tax component under consideration with the exception of the eitc inflation adjust ments are rounded down to the nearest multiple of 50 although rounding down affects the accuracy of any given years inflation adjustment the effect will not be cumulative since each years adjustment will be calculated to reflect the entire amount of inflation that has occurred between the adjustment year and the base period httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30007g11g151g141g146g159g146g141g158 g138g149g561g11g151g140g152g150g142g561g22g138g161 g561g20g138g157g142g156g497g561g343g351g350

g349g561for example the adjustment factor for the standard deductions in 2002 was calculated as follows the average cpiu for the base period september 1986 through august 1987 was 11198 the average cpiu for the period september 2000 through august 2001 was 175875 given these amounts the inflation adjustment factor for 2002 was 15705 17587511198 this inflation adjustment factor was then applied to the base year values of the standard deductions to determine their values for 2002 for instance the standard deduction for joint returns in the base year was 5000 multiplying this amount by the inflation adjustment factor pr oduces 2002 value of 7852 rounding down to the nearest 50 multiple results in 2002 standard deduction for joint returns of 7850 this same process was applied to all of the other indexed components of the tax code to determine their values in terms of 2002 dollars
