report examines the various concepts being consid ered and describes the issues for congress this report will be update d as events warrant background airships and aerostats have been used historically for military surveillance and anti submarine warfare unlike fixedwing aircraft or helicopters aerosta ts and airships are lighterthanair lta typically using helium to stay aloft airships are traditionally manned and use engines to fly aerostats are tethered to the ground by cable that also provides power as many as 32 companies ar involved in the design or manufacture of more than 100 commercially available airships and aerostats in eu rope asia and north america1 the navy disbanded its last airship unit in1962 and since then military use of lighterthanair platforms has been limited to air force custodianship of dozen aerostats2 however number of developments have combined to draw increased attention toward lta platforms first us aerospace dominance in military conflicts since 1991 has been overwhelming making thr eats to lta platforms appear to be very low by historical standards second the militarys demand for persistent surveillance function for which aerostats appear to be well suited is growing networkcentric warfare approaches increased emphasis on homeland security and growing force protection demands in urban environments all call for dominant

peditionary operations has spawned studies on using airships as heavy lift vehicles fourth growing budget pressures have encouraged the study of potential solutions to military problems that may reduce both procurement and operations nd maintenance spending lta platforms may fit into this category finally recent advances in unmanned aerial vehicles suggests that future airships may also be remotely piloted or fly autonomously current operations and programs operations the most well established lta platform today is the tethered aerostat radar system tars that has been operating since 1980 along the southern us border and in the caribbean currently tars primary mission is surveillance for drug interdiction each aerostat can lift 2200 lb s of sensors to height of 12000 feet and can detect targets out to 230 miles th aerostat can stay aloft for months3 in response to ongoing threats to us tr oops deployed to afghanistan and iraq the army has deployed small aeros tats equipped with ground surv eillance sensors to those countries the rapidly evated aerostat plat form reap was jointly developed by the navy and the army this 25foot long aeros tat is much smaller than tars and operates at 300 feet above the battlefield it is design ed for rapid deployment and carries daytime and night vision cameras4 the army has also deployed rapid aerostat initial development raid system to afghan istan iraq and kosovo this aerostat is approximately twice the size of reap and operates at pproximately 1000 feet it also carries suite of day and nigh t cameras for force protection5 the

ontrolquality tracks and unlik an aerostat haa could move to avoid weather or change radar coverage the haa would operate at high altitudes and has been likened to low flying and relatively inexpensive satellite this altitude might enable small number of airships to surveill the entire united states7 the haa program seeks to demonstrate prototype by 2010 that could fly for 30 days at

congress generally at issue is whether the operational need for airships and aerostats and their ability to satisfy this need outweigh the costs of developing and fielding them the debate is perhaps most effectively engaged by dividing lighterthanair platforms into three distinct categories aerostats highaltitude airships heavy lift airships aerostats the operational need for aerostats and their ability to satisfy this need appears the most mature of the three distinct lighterthanair platforms these systems are currently fielded and their capabilities and limitations appear welldocumented the role that they appear most suited for is persistent surveillance aerostats primary advantages over other platforms capable of providing elevated persistent surveillance manned aircraft and uavs appear to be low life cycle cost and long dwell time11 the primary operational concerns with employing aerostats appear to be vulnerability to weather and enemy ground fire us and foreign aerostats have been lost to severe weather as have manned aircraft and uavs aerost ats tend not to fail in benign weather however while aircraft and uavs which are more complex and dynamic systems suffer accidents caused by factors such as human error and mechanical failure12 the vulnerability of aerostats to enemy ground fire is debated opponents argue that aerostats are big targets within range of many enemy weapons proponents argue that despite their large size aerostats are survivab because of low radar cross section and their ability to endure numerous punctures before gradually losing altitude low flying aircraft and uavs are also vul nerable to enemy ground fire for landbased applications technology issues relate d to surveillance aerostats appear to pertain more to networking and exploiting their sensors than to the balloon itself one nontraditional aeros tat application that may wa rrant study is replacing or augmenting navy e2c hawkeye surveillance aircraft with aerostats replacing carrier air wings 34 e2cs with single or pair of aerostats could potentially improve surveillance by providing 24 hour coverage of the battle group and could increase the wings striking power by making room on the carrier for 68 more fighter aircraft high altitude airships haa the operational need and utility of haas is less well understood than it is for aerostats dod the department of homeland security dhs and other agencies are likely to need considerable time and study to determine exactly what these platforms can do how th ey might be exploited and whether these concepts offer new capabilities longrange aerial surveillance communications relay internet services relay and ser weapon relay for missile defe nse and forest fire warning are just some of the roles that haa advocates would like examined the haas potential operational environment and long ndurance goals present technological challenges for haas that appear much greater than those experienced by aerostats because the atmosphere is very thin at 70000 feet it will require very large volume of helium to sustain even modest pa yloads it is estimated that the haa actdshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21886crs5 13 rfi response to mda airship ma nagement services inc june 28 2004 14 ibid 15 michael sirak fixedwing unmanned airc raft are air forces best nearspace option defense daily february 15 2006goal of 500 lb payload will require an airs hip over 500 feet long and capable of holding over 5 million cubic feet of helium this airship would be the largest of its kind attempted in the last 60 years13 this payload constraint is likely to be limiting factor for military applications some hope for example that haas could deploy very large sensor arrays that could use low frequency radar to detect small targets like cruise missiles however large radars tend to be heavy the radar th at was being developed for the air forces now cancelled e10a surveillance aircra ft for example weighs 11000 lbs while producing 500 foot long airships is achievable their handling characteristics may be challenging operating at high altitudes may be an atmospheric sweet spot for these large aerostats but they still must successfully ascend and descend through relatively stormy altitudes operating these large airships for months or even years at time may also prove tec hnological challenge many potential power sources such as microwaves are in their infancy and weight and longevity will be at premium equipment will have to be light and energy efficient further all systems on an haa will require uncommon levels of reliability if they are to operate for months or years at time with maintenance this high level of reliability will likely come at increased cost final issue pertains to schedule mda hopes to field prototype by 2006 have already slipped to 2010 confirmin g the belief of many that th is programs schedule is too aggressive14 in february 2006 the air force scie ntific advisory board also cast doubt on this schedule when it reported that l ongendurance fixed wing uavs offer more promise than lighterthanair vehicles in conducting surveillance from nearspace altitudes15 the republic of korea initiated haa program that spans 10 years of research and development considering th is experience has dod established realistic timelines milestones and budgets to solve tec hnological challenges mitigate risk and field useful haa plat form alternatively has mda blished partnerships or other relationships with researchers in korea and japan which have been working on haa concepts for over six years heavy lift airships heavy lift airships may raise some questions regarding need and feasibility heavy lift airship advocates be lieve that these platforms can fill void between sea lift ships that carry very larg payloads slowly and aircraft which carry smaller loads quickly skeptics may argue that there may not be void to be filled by airships because the transport momentum payload x speed x nnual utilization of both sealift ships and airlift aircraft are very ffective and these transport media complement each other well another claim by advocates that might invite study is that heavy lift airships would require much less infrastructure than airlift ai rcraft this may be true for conventional airships which dont need long runways and can moor to simple and inexpensive structures because hybrid airships use aerodynamic lift however they will takeoff and land much like conventional ai rcraft some estimate that 1000 tonclass hybrid

england 17 crs report rl32305 authorization and appropria tions for fy2005 defense will require 5000 footlong runways16 along with loading offloading equipment and facilities these runways app ear to constitute infrastructures like those required by conventional aircraft an ttendant issue for hybrid airships is one of safety what happens when 1000 ton semirigid airship s an engine failure during takeoff while the take off speed may not be great the inertial forces of such mass would be prodigious when conventional aircraft suffers from mishap it is towed from the runway and flight operations resume it appears unlikely th at disabled 1000 ton airship could be moved quickly and the airstr ip could be bloc ked indefinitely another issue that must be studied is how compatible 1000 ton airships would be with dods distributed and just in time logi stical concepts delivering brigadesized payload directly to theat er of conflict sounds attrac tive from conventional wisdom point of view but large payloads take longer to consolidate load and unload than smaller payloads and the th eir delivery must be tightly scheduled also dod operates on an all weather day or night 247 timetable airships will be more vulnerable to the effects of weather than are conventional airc raft how severe or how manageable is this shortcoming how will an airship capable of lifting 1000 tons of payload return to the united states once its cargo is offloaded woul d it require very large ballast or means of suppressing its buoyancy to be able to fly home vulnerability to attacks is another issue that may warrant study airships would fly at an altitude within reach of many rfacetoair weapons lta proponents say that airships have small radar cross section and degrade gracefully if hit this may be true for the balloon but brigadeworth of equipm ent would have large radar cross section also while the united states is relatively unchallenged in airtoair combat 1000 ton airship with brigadeworth of equipment could constitute very high value target for enemy aircraft it is likely that dod would find it prudent to protect these airships with fighters how many fighters would be required and what would be the costs final issue that pertains to all of the lta concepts addressed above is cost and budget the life cycle costs for many unmanne d lta concepts could be notably less than manned aircraft and satellites and potentially uavs but can dod find room in its budget for another procurement program according to some perennial issue in defense policy is whether future defense budg ets will be large enough to finance all the weapon acquisition programs that are in the pipeline17 this budget pressure coupled with competition from well blished constituency for conve ntional aircraft represent challenges to fielding lta programs
