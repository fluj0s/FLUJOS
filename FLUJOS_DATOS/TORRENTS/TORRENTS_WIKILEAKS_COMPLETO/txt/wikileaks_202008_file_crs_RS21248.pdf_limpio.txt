legislative attorney american law division summary electronic commerce enables companies to access markets with which they have few physical legal or traditional connecti ons an important question for company deciding whether to engage in ecommerce is whether establishing an internet presence will subject it to litigation in foreign jurisdictions while the constitutions due process rights protect companys liberty interests in being subject to suits only in those forums with which it has meaningful contacts ties or relations it is not clear to what extent electronic connections with state are sufficient to warrant jurisdiction in state or federal court this report reviews due process limitations on assertions of personal jurisdiction by state and federa l courts and examines how wer courts have applied that law to claims involving the inte rnet this report will be updated i introduction with the proliferation of internet tec hnologies company can forge electronic connections to states with which it has few physical legal or traditional ties as congress seeks to increase the number of small and mediumsized companies engaged in ecommerce1 courts are grappling with whether company doing business on the internet is subject tobeing sued in their jurisdiction the issues f acing congress and the c ourts are related since the risk of defending lawsuits in distant ju risdictions may inhibit small and mediumsized businesses from establishing presence on the internet 2 to adjudicate case against defendant fe deral or state court must have personal jurisdiction over the defendant

it also gives company with contacts fair warning that its activities in state may subject it to suit in that state4 and thereby allows it to alleviate the risk of burdensome litigation by procuring insurance passing the expected costs on to customers or if the risks are too great severing its connection with the state5 the extent to which electronic contacts ties or relations subject firm to the personal jurisdicti on of state and federal courts is an open question this report provides primer on the law of personal juri sdiction and examines how the lower courts have applied that law to internetrelated cases ii personal jurisdiction primer as noted above whether court has jurisdic tion is defined by statute state law authorizes the jurisdiction of state courts wh ile congress apparently could authorize federal courts to exercise personal ju risdiction over anyone with appr opriate contacts with the nation as whole under existing law jurisdiction is proper only over those who could be subjected to jurisdiction in the courts of the state in which the federal court sits6 therefore federal or state court may assert juri sdiction over nonresident defendant if the laws of the forum state confer jurisdiction and if the constitution pe rmits the exercise of jurisdiction states long arm statute the law that defines whethe r state courts and therefore whether federal courts have jurisdiction over nonresident defendant generally confers the maximum amount of jurisdiction allowed under the constitution7 thus in most cases court will generally have jurisdiction ove r nonresident defendant so long as it does not offend the fifth or fourteenth amendments subjecting defendant to the binding judgme nts of foreign jurisdictions with which it has few contacts may infringe on these rights while due process does not require non resident defendants to ve physical ties in the forum state it does require 1 that defendants have certain minimum contacts with the forum state8 and 2 that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice9 we now discuss these two requirements httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21248crs3

jurisdiction over nonresident defendant genera l jurisdiction is established when the defendants contacts are unrelated to the cause of acti on but are continuous and systematic10 the constitutional requirements of specific jurisd iction demand lower quantum of contacts and are satisfied when the defendants contacts with the forum state arise out of or are related to the cause of action11 the supreme court has explained that the quality and nature of these contacts must have basis in so act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conductin g activities within the forum state thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws12 traditionally when an entity intentionally reaches beyond its boundaries to conduct business with foreign residents it benefits from the laws of the foreign state and therefore is subject to the regulation and sanctions of that state for the consequences of those contacts13 thus personal jurisdiction is proper wh ere company delivers products to state with the expectation that they will be purchased and used by residents of that state14 or where company forms interstate contractual relations and creates continuing relationships and obligations in the forum state15 under the effects doctrine personal jurisdiction is also proper where tort has been committed by nonr esident defendant and its effects are felt in the forum state16 plurality opinion of the supreme court c ontrols cases where defendant has placed product in the stream of commerce whic h through unpredictable currents or eddies eventually sweeps the product into state in which the defendant has other contacts17 the split is over the proper measure for determining whether company has purposefully availed itself of forum18 one approach understands due pr ocess to allow an exercise of personal jurisdiction to be based on the nake d act of placing product in the stream of commerce19 this point of view was articulated by justice brennan who argued that once goods are placed in the stream of commerce the defendant benefits economically from the retail sale of the product as it moves from state to state and thereby indirectly benefits from the states laws that regulate and facilitate commercial activity20 the other approach requires that the fendants action be purposefully directed at the forum state21 this point of view was articulated by justice oconnor w ho argued that defendants awareness that the stream of commerce may or will sweep th product into the forum state does not

traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice23 this is caseby case determination and will depend upon an eval uation of several fact ors including the burden on the defendant the inte rests of the forum state nd the plaintiffs interest in obtaining relief24 iii personal jurisdiction and electronic commerce in cases where courts jurisdiction depends upon defendants internet presence the outcome has depended primarily on whether defendant has sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state while the forum states long arm statute and the constitutions requirement of fair play and substantial justice have played only minor roles25 regarding minimum contact issues some courts adopt an approach resembling justice brennans loose purposeful availment standard to measur minimum contacts while others courts adopt an approach resembling oconnors strict purpos eful availment standa rd the approach of the majority of courts however falls in between these approaches measuring minimum contacts on sliding scale on which the exercise of jurisdiction is d irectly proportionate to the nature and quality of the commercial activity that an tity conducts over the internet26 we will now discuss the brennan the slid ing scale and the oconnor approaches justice brennans approach in case involving an internet domain name dispute federal dist rict court in connecticut deter mined that defendants web site established minimum contacts with connecticut to warrant personal jurisdiction27 the plaintiff owner of the federal trademark inset objected to the defendants use of

any employees or ffices in connecticut nor did it conduct business there on regular basis its only contact w ith connecticut was its web site which was relatively passive merely containing information

jurisdiction over hong kong defendant w hose internet advertisements were not directed at the forum statecompany information were continuously availabl to internet users in connecticut few cases apply this interp retation of due process28 the sliding scale approach in cases involving electronic contacts ties or relations with forum state the majority of courts measure companys minimum contacts by using sliding scale on which the exercise of jurisdiction is direc tly proportionate to the nature and quality of the comme rcial activity that an entity conducts over the internet29 if companys presence is established by passive web site that merely provides information accessible to users in the forum st ate personal jurisdiction is not likely to be established30 on the other hand jurisdiction is established when company is clearly doing business over the internet by entering in to contracts with residents of the forum state and by repeatedly transmitting computer files to that forum31 these are not absolute categories however vast grey area lies in between these extremes where court must scrutinize the level of inte ractivity and commercial nature of web site in order to determine whether jurisdiction is warranted32 at least three states have adopted or cited with approval this approach33 as have many federa l courts including the fifth sixth ninth and tenth circuit courts of appeals34 we now discuss passive and interactive sites as well as sites where company is clearly doing business passive sites passive web sites are accessible over the internet but do not allow interaction between the host of the web site and visitor to the site passive web sites do not conduct business offer goods for sale or enable person vi siting the web site to order merchandise services or files instead they merely provide information to person visiting the site number of courts have found jurisdiction lackin g in cases where defendants contacts with the forum state was established solely through these sites35 for instance in mink v aaaa development llc the fifth circuit found that vermont defendant did nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21248crs6 36 190 f3d 333 336337 5th

over an italian business for merely advertising on the internetestablish minimum contacts with texas by adve rtising posting printable order forms and posting its telephone number and mail address on its web site36 interactive sites interactive web sites enable user to exchange information with the defendants computer and may or may not support the exercise of jurisdiction whether they do will depend on the level of inte ractivity and the nature of the information jurisdiction was found not proper in case that involved web site that provided company information allowed customers to enter personal contact information and provided for the submission of resumes by potential employees37 in that case the court held that the level of interactivity did not serve to confer jurisdiction since there was evidence that the company specifically targeted potential customers in the forum or that any resident of the forum contacted the company through its web site38 however jurisdiction was appropriate in case involving web site that provided company information and allowed users to apply for loans print out applications send email nd chat online with employees39 clearly doing business in cases where courts ve found personal jurisdiction in cases involving internetrelated disputes the defendants at issu were clearly doing business over the internet and therefore clearly invoked the benefits nd protections of its laws the forum state for instance the sixth circuit upheld finding of personal jurisdiction over nonresident defendant who entere d into written contract to access the forum state market transmitted 32 software files to servers located in the forum state and received money from residents of the forum state40 justice oconnors approach in case where defendant was not clearly doing business over the internet but was operating an interactive web site the us court of appeals for the district of columbia appare ntly applied oconnors purposeful availment standard and rejected interactivity as an appropriate measure for measuring minium contacts41 according to the court interactivity does not allow web site operator to reasonably anticipate where it will be subject to suit since interactivity merely describes the nature of web site not the nature of th operators connection w ith particular forum42 therefore the test fails to place web site operators on fair notice of where they will be subject to suit the primary goal of due pro cess instead the dc circuit only exercises personal jurisdiction over defendants that engage in activity specifically targeted at its forum however it did not elaborate on this standard43 other cases have applied similarly strict due process standard44
