was introduced as hr 4890 and s 2381 on march 7 2006 hearings were held by two house committees the following week2 instead of allowing congress to ignore pr esidential recommendations for rescissions expedited rescission would re quire at least one house to vote on his proposals if one house disapproves the request the other house need take action because approval by both houses would be necessary to make th rescission permanent in contrast enhanced rescission briefly available under the line it em veto act of 1996 altered the rescission framework to create presumption favoring the president3 under enhanced rescission spending reductions identified in speci presidential messages were to remain permanently cancelled unless congress enacted disapproval bill likely requiring twothirds majority in both chambers to override presidential veto expedited rescission bills focus on procedural changes in congress and typically contain detailed schedule to ensure immediate introduction of measure to approve the presidentss rescission request prompt reporting by committee or automatic discharge special limits on floor amendments and debate and so on under expedited rescission congressional approval w ould still be necessary to cancel the funding but the fasttrack procedures would help to ensure an upordown vote on the presidents message major provisions in the legislat ive

the presidents request the lliva would grant the president considerable flexibility in the submission and packaging of the special messages there are time constraints and single message may include any number of rescissions further the lliva does not stipulate that special message be confined to single public law therefore one message may encompass budget authority or items of direct spending

lliva states that its provisions are severable for purposes of judicial review this mean s that if court found portion of the measure to be unconstitutional the remainder of its provisions would remain in force the act would become effective upon signing and would pply only to spending or tax provisions contained in bills enacted after its passage expedited rescission bi lls previously passed in the house the expedited rescission approach as seen in the lliva has attracted support over the years because it is generally regarded as transferring less power from congress to the president than most other approaches that would modify the ica framework in 1992 1993 and 1994 the house passed an expe dited rescission bill each year4 in the 102nd congress hr 2164 passed by the house in 1992

for expedited consideration of rescissions substitute as reported by the appropriations committee to provide an alternative to the presidents package in the second session of the 103rd congress hr 4600 came to the floor and passed the house in 1994 with substitute amendm ent characterized by its supporters as strengthened expedited rescission hr 4600 as approved by the house would have allowed submission of special rescission message at any time the housepassed version of hr 4600 however retained the requirement to prepare separate special message and accompanying draft bill fo r each appropriations subcommittee having jurisdiction over accounts in given appropr iations act from which rescissions were requested further hr 4600 as passe d in 1994 would have authorized special messages from the president proposing the repeal of any targeted tax benefit within 20 days following enactment during floor bate under the expedite d procedures motion to strike any proposed rescission or repeal of targeted tax benefit would have been in order if supported by 50 mbers in the house or by 15 in the senate other expedited rescission bills in the 109th congress similar bills are pending in addition to hr 4890 and s 2381 an omnibus budget reform measure hr 2290 sponsored by representative jeb hensarling and others contains provisions for expedited rescission in section 311 enhanced consideration of certain proposed rescissions the provisions would authorize the president to propose rescission of any budget authority in an appropr iations act that he identifies as wasteful along with the proposed rescission the president could also propose to reduce the appropriate discre tionary spending limits for new budget authority and outlays under the balanced budget and emerge ncy deficit control act of 1985 by an amount not exceeding the proposed rescission provisions for th special message and accompanying draft approval bill are similar to those in the lli va however hr 2290 would have just one message for each appropriations act unless the act included accounts falling within the jurisdiction of more than one appropriations subcommittee in which case the president would send separate special message and accompanying draft bill for accounts within the jurisdiction of each subcommittee5 representative mark udall has introduced th ree expedited rescission measures in the 109th congress6 the most recent of which is hr 4699 the stated purpose of hr 4699 the stimulating leadership in cutting expend itures act or slice act of 2006 is to enable the president to require congress to debate and vote on certain presidentialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22425crs5 proposals for reducing spending the provi sions for special messages and expedited procedures in hr 4699 would apply to any budget authority provided in an appropriations act or in pl 109 59 119 state 1144 the omnibus transportation authorization act as seen in previous measures the president would submit more than one special message and appr oval bill if the appropriations act contained accounts under the jurisdiction of various appropriations subcommitt ees for messages proposing rescission of funds provided in the transportation act the dr aft bill would be broken down into sections corresponding to specific projects senator john kerry has introduced s 2372 th expedited budget item veto review act of 2006 this bill is simila r in coverage to the line item veto act of 1996 s 2372 would allow the president to suspend nd propose for cancellation 1 any dollar amount of discretionary budget authority 2 any ite m of new direct spending and 3 any limited tax benefit not later than three calendar days after the date of enactment of the applicable law the president could submit special message pr oposing such cancellations and draft bill for each item to be cance lled provisions for identifying limited tax benefits also reflect those in the 1996 law expedited procedures would seek to ensure vote on final passage of an approval bill by the close of the 10th legislative day following its introduction items proposed for cancella tion in special message would be made available for obligation or ta ke effect on the date upon wh ich the draft bill accompanying the special message were to be defeated in either the house or the senate legislative line item veto act of 2006 in perspective the provisions for expedited considerati on of special messages from the president proposing rescissions of funds have remained quite simila r over the years various versions of expedited rescission bills pending in the 109th congress all seek to ensure vote on final passage of the approval bill within 10 days after its introduction in the chamber in the early 1990s there were bills with provisions to allow for consideration of substitute package of rescissions reported by the appropriations committee as an alternative to the presidents package or to allow motion to strike particular rescission from the approval bill with sufficient support none of the exped ited rescission bills in the 109th congress contains such provisions expedited rescission bills have differed in scope of coverage over the years some earlier bills confined the special messages to proposed rescissions of discretionary budget authority appropriations subsequently items of direct spending entitlements and limited or targeted tax benefits were added in the 109th congress hr 4699 would add certain transportation projects to the univers of possible cancellations available to the president the lliva arguably would grant the president among the most expansive scopes of coverage seen in an expedited rescission bill by encompassing rescission of any dollar amount of discretionary budget authority or the rescission in whole or part of any item of direct spending with respect to dir ect spending the line item veto act of 1996 and s 2372 would limit potentia l cancellations to any new item of direct spending emphasis added the lliva along with some other measures would also cover targeted tax benefit provisions in comparison with other expedited rescission bills over the years the lliva would grant the president greater flexibility in the submission and packaging of special messages for example it stipulates deadline for submission of special messagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22425crs6 7 for further discussion of policy deferrals s ee crs issue brief ib89148 for further discussion of possible constitutional issues see crs report rl33365 line item veto constitutional analysis of recent proposals by morton rosenberg following the signing of an appropriations act special messages are generally confined to single appropriations act with separate messages and approval bills to be prepared for each appropriations subcommittee with ju risdiction over accounts affected by the rescission proposals the lliva has such s tipulations so special message could include proposed cancellati ons from several laws the lliva as developed by the adminis tration contains some provisions not previously seen in expedited rescission bills the new components would allow the president to withhold funds proposed for re scission or to suspend the execution of an item of direct spending for up to 180 days supporters of these provisions contend that they would provide for temporary wit hholding or suspensi on until congress had chance to consider presidents request and that such mechanism is necessary so that congress would have the opportunity to act on presidents rescission proposal received just before an extended rece ss or period of adjournment others see these provisions as subject to abuse and unnecessary with th expedited procedures in lliva usually ensuring final vote on the presidents request within month in their view period considerably shorter than 180 days would ffice to give congress the opportunity to act on special message critics of the 180day withholding mechanis m may view the provisions arguably as sanctioning the return of polic deferrals originally provide d for in the ica subject to onehouse veto but invalidated by the ins v chada 462 us 919 1983 and city of new haven v united states 809 f2d 900 dc cir 1987 decisions as well as the statutory provisions in pl 1001197 supporters of the 180 day provision stress that this is the maximum period that the funding coul d be deferred and the bill language would allow the president to release the funds earlier if the president determines that continuation of the deferral would not furthe r the purposes of this act the language however would not require early release of funds even if one chamber voted to reject the approval bill the line item veto act of 1996 with its enhanced rescission framework was considered even by some of its supporters to have possible constitu tional flaws and the measure contained provisions fo r expedited judicial review in contrast observers tend to view the expedited rescission approach at least as applied to items of discretionary spending as passing muster on constitutiona l grounds the severability provision in the lliva creates further statutory insulati on if one provision were to be found unconstitutional the remainder of the act would not be affected for example if one type of cancellation such as targeted tax benef its were to be overt urned the presidents authority to submit special rescission messa ges for expedited c onsideration covering items of discretionary budget au thority or direct spending mig ht continue to be available
