existing dod buildings offer little protection against such terrorist attacks or the threat of chemical biological or radiological attacks by applying the guidanc in this appendix the opportunity for

countermobility all sites should have physically secured perimeter that includes continuous barrier that marks the perimeter boundary and that provides physical obs tacle to vehicle penetration u if threat analysis does not i dentify moving vehicle bomb tactic these barriers need not provide physical resi stance to stop vehicles only make it difficult to cross the boundary without drawing attention the aggressors goal in the stationary vehicle bomb tactic is to rema in covert until the device is detonated b u the barriers on the secured perimeter must be designed to stop the moving vehicle where vehicle approach to t he perimeter is possible vehicle weight maximum attainable velocity and angle of impact will be considered when selecting crash rated perimeter barrier s calculate requirements by using procedures in refs and b c u perimeter security and control of entr to site consi der protecting the installation by perimeter security fenc through which access is controlled at an established access control point effective secu rity lighting at the entry points to support the security check and inspections must be ddressed at the design stage installations with perimeters adjacent open water will take appr opriate steps to prevent unauthorized access and water borne threat s from this direction fouo fouo c84 1 u the access control point must be able to process vehicles in such way that during increased fpcon entry is not impeded thus impairing traffic flow the reason for this is twofold u to prevent personnel awaiting entry from becoming vulnerable to attack and b u to prevent pressure being put on the guards to forgo security checks in order to speed up traffic flow 2 u the control of entry system should include provisions for visitor parking pass office search areas guard positions and turning area where unauthorized vehicles may be turned around and ej ected from the faci lityinstallation without gaining access 3 u where indicated by threat analysis provide shielding or hardening of the guard structure to pr otect access control point gu ards against driveby attacks using small arms the access control point should employ active vehicle barriers appropriate for the threat and integrated with the passive pe rimeter barriers to ensure there are weak spots in the perimeter however professional advice should be sought before installing some active barrier s such as popup barriers in order to ensure that the proposed equipment is operationally effective d u access roads consider main headquarters building and area sites where large numbers of pers onnel congregate away from local roads outside the perimeter and away from pr imary access roads onto the fa cility this will reduce vulnerability to vehicleborne explosive devices and standoff attack u protected areas consider the incor poration of protec ted areas pa pa is specifically designated area within building where vulner abilities from blast effects of an explosion are minimized it is location where occupants are advised to go in the event of bomb threat warning consider this at the design stage for new construction in existing buildings prof essionally qualified stru ctural engineers with experience of explosive effects should underta ke pa identification pa should meet the following minimum criteria 1 u away from windows exter nal doors and external walls 2 u toward the center of the building 3 u generally not in stairwells or ar eas having access to an elevator shaft since blast overpressures are likely to propagate into these areas 4 u locate in areas surrounded by full height masonry or concrete walls if possible eg internal co rridors internal toilet areas etc fouo fouo c85 5 u the size of the rooms must be ch that it will provide minimum of 09 square meters 10 square feet of space for each person who will occupy the room f u location of hrp offices consider locating hrp offices away from overlooking points these offices should t be sited in areas that would make the hrp vulnerable to standoff attack office yout should also bear this in mind consider the use of bullet resistant glass where possible co ver or protect the arrivaldeparture area for hrps to increase their safety at this vulnerable stage of movement g u searchscreening areas consider the incorporation of separate searchscreening areas at entry points to facilities that w ould be attractive targets of terrorists eg headquarters buildings searchscreening areas should provide place where personnel desiring entry who are not preaut horized could be taken and searched if necessary searchscreening area also provides an area where person can wait until hisher credentia ls are confirmed separate area for this function relieves the pressure on the securi ty guard force performing routine pass and identification checks h u personnel alerting systems pas consider the incorporation of building and installation pas so that per sonnel can be warned via audible alarm and given directions as to what to do in t he event of an attack or emergency by voice messaging pas systems should be capable of warning and directing personnel for various emergencies such as bomb attack mortar attack fire and earthquake 3 u nncj4 will plan for and participate in cip related programs as well as assist ncj34 to coordinate and make recommendations on unresolved at facility

plann ing considerations u threat terrorist may try to destroy disrupt or exploit key us military capabilities threats include 1 u chemical terrorists may exploit myriad of toxic industrial chemicals tics available in all parts of t he globe these substances are not likely to create as many actual casualti as warfarestrength agents but are still lethal or highly toxic chemical agents can be dispersed using mortars sprayers and improvised explosive devices chemicals can last from minutes to weeks at the site of release and create larger initial hazard area than c onventional explosives further chemicals often create temporary downwind vapor hazard 2 u biological biological hazards pose unique challenges because they are relatively easy to produce and difficult to detect after rele ase examples of terrorist biological weapons include small amounts of anthrax or smallpox dispersed using nonexplosive point source or spra tank the duration of agent virulence and the size of the downwind hazard area are largely dependent on environmental conditions and dissemination efficiency at t he time of the attack the potential psychological impact and relative low cost of bi ological hazards make them an attractive alternative to explosives offensive biol ogical programs can be easily concealed and production does not always require specialized equipment effective medical intervention is possible for many bacteria but other pathogens eg viruses fungi toxins can be much more difficult to treat 3 u radiological lowlevel radiological mate rial is available from large number of industrial sources worldwide terrorists able to gain access to this material could exploit it using lowyield explosive devices s pecific examples of terrorist radiological hazards include iridium cesi um and highly enriched uranium heu as the core of radiological disper sal device although rarely lethal in the near term the fouo fouo c93 deliberate dissemination of radioactive ma tter can cause considerable immediate psychological harm and enormous remediationrestoration 4 u nuclear terrorists with sufficient finances will seek out those willing to sell both information and materiel regarding nuclear weapons besides the extremely high explosive nature of nuclear weapons other effects include highaltitude electromagnetic pulse hemp emp that can degrade unpr otected and vulnerable military and civilian electronics 5 u explosive virtually every country subnational group and terrorist organization has access to explosive devices traditionally these have been the weapons of choice to terrorists because they are readily available cheap easy to use and their effects are reasonably predict able although there is considerable psychological impact with terrorist use of an explosive devise most actual casualties are created in the immedi ate area of the blast 6 u usnorthcom will utilize the s ense shape shield and sustain 4s construct as outlined in ref ff for cbrne preparedness however the at community uses slightly diffe rent terms to discuss their pr eparedness capabilities the at community uses detect and assess as opposed to sense report as opposed to shape prevent deter and defend as opposed to shield and recover as opposed to sustain provi ded below is an overlay depicting how the four principles for installation cbrne preparedness and the at principles paral lel each other fouo fouo c94 figure c92 u sense the ability to maintain awareness of the current cbrne situation by detecting and identif ying cbrne hazards in the air water food or soil on personnel equipment or facilitie s and determining the physica l state of those hazards solid liquid gaseous this principle in cludes the capability to quantify and sample cbrne hazards sense is the key enabl er using knowledgebased human and state oftheart detection equipment for shaping the installation comm anders understanding of the hazard sense categories are as follows 1 u sense 1 standoff detection and reconnaissance u standoff detectors can increase the effectiveness of early warning of cbrne hazards and assess large areas for potential co ntamination thus allowing the commander to make rapid dec isions on active defense evacuation shelterinplace and other protective meas ures the employment of these sensors calls for careful placement to provi adequate coverage and often can require specialists to operate b u reconnaissance if an installation or facility lacks the ability to perform standoff or automated point detec tion it may fall to dedicated cbrne specialists or installation emergency res ponders to reconnoiter the hazard area with specialized equipment as the incident unfolds fouo fouo c95 2 u sense 2 automatic point detection and medical surveillance u automatic and manual point detectors offer installation personnel tools to detect identify quantify and sample cbrne hazards to provide decision makers with critical information since point detectors by their nature only inform personnel in the immediate vicinity of potential hazards it is crucial that these detectors be emplaced at critical site s on the installation and networked into the emergency operations center if the use of automatic detectors at critical sites is not feasible option the installation comm ander may need to utilize emergency responders with appropriate manual detectors and communica tions equipment the intent is not to employ 247 monitoring capability but rat her to allow automatic detection and identification capability in times of increased threat conditions b u medical surveillance alt hough medical surveillance is broad area supporting force health protection in ge neral the reporting of nonbattle disease injuries is critical function combined with local civilian health surveillance and worker absentee data the medi cal specialists should note and report trends in health that may be indicative of bw terrorist attack b u shape the ability to provide the capability to characterize the cbrne hazard for the installation commander cbrne hazard characterization is the process by which the installation comm ander develops clear understanding of the current and predicted cbrne hazard situation envisions critical mission end states and develops the sequence of events that moves the installation from its current state to those end states by manually and automatically collecting and assimilating cbrne hazard information from civilians military personnel host nation as applicable and localstatefederal response assets in near real time the commander is able to observe actual and potential effects of cbrne hazards and to make timely decisions shaping categories consist of 1 u decision support tools utilize existingfuture command and control systems and resources to ensure ccurate assessment and dissemination of cbrne hazards to the installation populatio n and with military loca l state and federal emergency operations center s installation command centers require cbrne preparedness decision support tools that access and assimilate cbrne hazard data from throughout the installation hazard prediction tools must reside with command and control equipment that is ideally interfaced with automated sensors on an installation in addition these tools must include the ability to input meteorological medical and terrain data that influences the cbrne hazard effects on nearreal time basis as well as for predictive analysis allowin g the installation commander to determine the risk associated with various courses of action 2 u mass alert notification inst allations must have the capability to notify within 10 minutes all personnel on an installation as well as affected military personnel and dependents offsite of an impending or actual cbrne hazard incident signals and notifications must be clear and unambiguous to avoid confusion fouo fouo c96 additionally installations must ensure that their warning system can pass alerts to local regional response systems in order to ert surrounding communities to hazards c u shield the installation commander shields hisher personnel when by providing appropriate levels of physi cal protection trai ning and medical pre treatment to the extent possible t he installation commander relies on first responders as the second tier of shielding in stallation personnel this is accomplished through the rapid response assessment and in itial recovery operations undertaken to safeguard personnel from continued hazards to control contamination and to initiate steps to restore the area to its preincident conditions 1 u shield 1 mission essential personnel protection will provide the appropriate level of protection necessary to support mission

m ilitary elements remains within military channels the installation s hould establish agreements to address the use of other military personnel and local reso urces that clearly delineate jurisdictional limits the agreements will likely evolve into the installation having respons ibility inside the wire or installation perimeter and the cal authorities having responsib ility outside

u sample risk assessment u 1 u the sample risk assessment ra provided describes the methodology dod element commandersdirectors or designated representatives can use to assess risk the ra combines criticality threat and vas in order to provide more complete picture of the risks to an asset or group of assets in the proceeding paragraphs the ra process described does not dictate how to conduct the assessment but rather it outlines what type of information to colle ct and how to organize and display the information for decisionmaking ra will assist to provide clear picture of the current at posture and identifies those areas that need improvement 2 u the ra is logical stepbystep met hod and shall require the participation of the entire staff in starting the ra process thr ee elements should be examined u threat the threat is determined through proper and thorough threat assessment ta the ta should identify the likelihood and severity of the terrorist to inflict injury to person or damage to fa cility or asset by considering terrorist capability intent and objectives effort should also concern specific type of weapons or acts the terrorist will use to initiate the event assassination bomb etc 1 u the ta focuses on the full range of known or esti mated terrorist capabilities in commanders area of in terest including wmd commanders annually integrate threat informat ion prepared by the intelli gence and law enforcement communities technical information from security and engineering planners and information from other sour ces to prepare their ta b u asset criticality critical assets are determined by both the term and the measure of importance to t he operational mission areas that encompass multiple critical assets are referred to as critical areas the criticality assessment provides information to prioritize assets and allocate resources to special protective actions 1 u the completed information may be compiled into criticality matrix this information is then combined with the threat and vulnerability information to assess the at risk c u vulnerability thorough va will highlight the susc eptibility of person group unit facility or sset to damaging incident vas should also address the capabilities of response elements to plan those ac tivities that support the ability to either deter andor respond to terrorist threats for example va might reveal weaknesses in an organizations security system fi nancial management processes computer networks or unprotected key infr astructure such as water supplies bridges and tunnels 1 u local vas should be conducted at least annually but there should be means to adjust the assessment as the threat changes fouo fouo c152 3 u during the ra process commanders must consider of all the aforementioned elements to make wellinformed dec isions when planning fpcon measure implementation and terrorist incident response measures 4 u assessing risk assessing the risk presumes the threat vuln erability and asset criticality assessments have been completed u in addition to isolated assets areas can be assessed in terms of the criticality of the assets located within it and its vulnerability to spec ific threats the assessment team will rate each asset for every type of threat identified in the ta 1 u the process begins by creating an asset ra table 2 u determine what asset to be examined 3 u determine the attack means met hod by which the asset would be attacked different groups may present veral different attack methods based on what weapons they possess and the methods they use 4 u determine the vulnerability of the cr itical asset from the attack methods identified b u sample ra 1 u installation command post 2 u various groups may present several attack methods to include small arms fire cartruck bomb chemical weapons cw and biological weapons bw 3 u vulnerabilities for the command post include constructed 12 concrete walls has windows and the ventilation syst em is not filtered redundant command post exists however several hours would be required before it could be fully operational 4 u ra analysis the command post is nec essary to carry out the mission criticality is 9 out of 10 the vulnerability is 1 of 10 from small arms fire because small arms are unlikely to penetrate 12 of concre and windows exist to shoot into the vulnerability from cartruck bomb is higher because there is traffic flow control around the building the cw and bw atta ck means are both high vulnerabilities because the ventilation system is unfilter ed example
