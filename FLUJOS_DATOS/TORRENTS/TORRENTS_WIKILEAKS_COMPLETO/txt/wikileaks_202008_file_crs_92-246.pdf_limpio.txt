concealment of material fact or by willful misrepresentation23 various acts occurring after naturalization are by law evidence of misrepresentation or suppression at time of naturalization fo r example if naturalized citizen joins subversive organization with in five years of becoming citizen and membership in that group would have precl uded eligibility for na turalization under the ina then the joining of the organization is held to be rebuttable presumption that naturalization was obtained by concealing or misrepresenting how attached to the united states the citizen was when naturalized24 similarly if naturalized citizen begins to permanently reside abroad within one year of naturalization taki ng that residence is deemed rebuttable presumption that the citizen concealed lack of requisite attachment to the united states at the time of naturalization25 except for acts that bear on the integrity of the naturalization process itself however citizenship through naturalization is as secure as citizenship at birth also the united states longer conditions retention of citizenship at birth abroad on subsequent residence in the united states by specified age 6 are there provisions for dual citizenship if so under what circumstances the united states does not categorically forbid its citizens from holding dual nationality nor does it expressly require dual nationals to make an election of citizenship as such at any point at the same time congress has enacted citizenship rules that militate against acquiring dual nationality after birth individuals who acquire united states c itizenship under the constitution by virtue of being born in the united states may lose that citizenship only by committing an act of expatriation under the ina citizen ses united states citizenship on voluntarily obtaining naturalization in foreign country with an intent to relinquish united states citizenship26 the requisite intent to relinquish need not be express rather it may be inferred from the circumstances including the ta king of an oath of allegiance as part of the foreign naturalization process27 while citizen may lose citizenship through voluntary naturalization abroad the voluntary naturalization of childs parents abroad longer results in the childs expatriation even if the child derivatively becomes foreign national expatriation aside citizenship acquired at birth abroad under rules set in statute remains subject to congre ssional regulation however congress longer conditionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs92246crs6 retention of united states citizenship at bi rth abroad on subsequent residence in the united states or otherwise part of the process for becoming united states citizen is the taking of an oath absolutely and entirely renouncing any alle giance or fidelity to any other country united states naturalization in combination w ith the oath of absolute allegiance may result in loss of foreign nati onality under the pertinent foreig n laws furthermore united states naturalization may be revoked if illegally or fraudul ently obtained any exercise of foreign citizenship subsequent to united states naturalization may be evidence of misrepresentation in taking the oath of allegiance and thus potential grounds for denaturalization
