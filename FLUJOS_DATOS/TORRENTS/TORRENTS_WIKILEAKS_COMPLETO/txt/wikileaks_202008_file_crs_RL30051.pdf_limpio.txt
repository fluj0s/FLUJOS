thereafter of about 66 billion in mid1997 secretary of defense william cohen called for two new rounds of base closures and realignments he explained that while four previous rounds had achieved significant savings it was importa nt to continue the process of closing underutilized facilities spite dod pressure most members of congress were reluctant to support authorization of new base closure legislation at least for theforeseeable future the reasons given included among others grassroots oppositionfrom communities likely to be affected and president clintons intervention in the1995 base closure commissions recommenda tions regarding mcclellan and kelly air force bases of the two chambers the house of representatives expressed thestronger and more united opposition in the senate proponents of new base closure rounds have attempted to attach amendments to each ears defense authorization bill since 1997 achieving success only toward the end of 2001 the principal advocates in congress for new base closures have been senator john mccain and senator carl levin on february 27 2001 they introducedlegislation s 397 to authorize tw new closure rounds in 2003 and 2005 on august 3 2001 the secretary of defense submitted his own proposal to congress calling for one additional round in 2003 on september 6 2001 the senatesdefense panel incorporated elements of both proposals and passed the measure by vote of 17 to 8 later in senate floor debate september 24 2001 thelevinmccain initiative passed by margin of 53 to 47 however many members of the house were reluctant to support s 397 thus creating an impasse in the conference phase that delayed final passage of the fy2002 defense legislation finally on december 12 2001 the conferees reached acompromise they agreed to authorize one new round of base closures in 2005 they also added language that revised vari ous aspects of previous base closure law the most notable of which perhaps will be the enhanced role and influence of the secretary of defense in the base closure selection process president bush signed the defense authorization bill into law pl 107107 on december 28 2001 this report

case in earnest on may 19 1997 secretary ofdefense william cohen released long awaited report the quadrennial defense review qdr in the report major re view of military strategy and capabilities he called for two more rounds of closures one in 1999 and the second in 2001 heexplained that despite four previous round s the downsizing of dods base structure had fallen behind the downsizing of its

significant savings that would allow dod to fund adequatelyfuture readiness and weapons acquisition programs he stated that without thesavings from new rounds of closing dod would be hardpressed to fulfill its missions and responsibilities in the future closures and the 105th congress secretary of defense cohens plan to be gin new rounds of closures within the next five years was met with decided lack of enthusiasm on capitol hill many members expressed deep concern over the likely economic and political fallout intheir districts from any such new rounds both defense committees of the

over depot privatization highly contentious aspect of the ba closure debate involved president clintons actions concerning the last of the four rounds the 1995 base closurecommission had recommended the closing of two of the air forces five majormaintenance depots at mcclellan air force base ca and kelly air force basetx the recommendation had been justified on the grounds that all five depotswere operating at under 50 capacity and th at significant savings could be achieved by transferring mcclellans and kellys wo rkloads to the three remaining depots in utah oklahoma and georgia 10 president clinton vigorously opposed closing mcclellan and kelly depots arguing that california and texas had already suffered disproportionately fromeffects of the three previous closure rounds 11 he moved to prevent further loss of jobs in california and texas by directing that private firms be allowed to assume the work on site otherwise known as pri vatizationinplace opponents of the president however were quick to charge him with unprecedented political meddlingin the base closing process they accuse d him of trying to curry favor with the people of voterich california and texas vital in his bid for reelection 12 legislators from oklahoma georgia nd utah opposed the privatization plan believing that it deprived their local populations of jobs that would have beenotherwise created under the initial recommendation of the 1995 base closurecommission also they knew that the existing privatization plan if permitted toproceed left their depots highly vulnerable to closure whenever the next round ofbase reductions occurred 13 resentment among some members over president clintons 1995 intervention persisted until the end of his second term his action was repeatedly cited bycongressional opponents as reason for their opposition to any new base closurerounds 14 some members sought to block dod from proceeding with plans to privatize depot maintenance work at mccle llan and kelly air force bases on june 5 1997 the house military readiness subco mmittee approved an amendment to the fy1998 defense authorization bill prohibiting privatization at the two depots unless the secretary of defense certified that th three remaining depots were operating at an efficient 80 capacity these other pots as mentioned above were operating at approximately 50 capacity the full

congressional budget office submitted its review of dods base realignment and closure report on july 1 199821 it stated that the report provided most but not all of the information that the congress had requested it founddods estimates of savings from previous closure rounds as fully implemented consistent with its own estimates 56 b illion as compared to 5 billion however cbo explained that the firm measures of brac savings requested by the congress do not and cannot exist it elaborated as follows brac savings are really avoided costs costs that dod would have incurred if brac actions had not taken place because those avoided costs are not actualexpenditures dod cannot observe them and record them in its financial records as result dod can only estimate savings rather than actually measure them in its review cbo observed that dods report had provided clear and coherent summary of why future base closure rounds would produce significant savings it noted however that dod provi ded little analysis of those data or insight into the number and types of installations that might be closed in the eventof future brac rounds other significant cbo findings included an analysis of the likely impact of future base closures on local communities cannot be attempted until the specific co mmunities are identified even then it would be very difficult to do dod was unable to locate some of the requ ested data including the original cost and savings estimates that it gave to the brac commissions estimates of brac costs and savings would be more accurate if they included dods

the four previous brac closure rounds would resu lt in substantial net savings it noted however that dods report should be vi ewed as providing rough approximation of costs and savings rather than precise accounting it pointed out that dods data systems do not capture all savings associated with brac actions nor has dodestablished separate system to track brac savings other significant
