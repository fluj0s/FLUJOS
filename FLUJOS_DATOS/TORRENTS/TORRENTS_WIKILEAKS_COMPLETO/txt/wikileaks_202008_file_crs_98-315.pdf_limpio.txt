day after the opening prayer the approval of the journal and the pledge of allegiance is conducted either by unanimous consent or as privileged interruption of the daily order of business various rules of the house give privilege to specific kinds of measures and matters most important is clause 5a of rule xiii which grants certain co mmittees the leave to report at any time on certain kinds of bills and resolutions those bills and resolutions are privileged under this ru privileged business includes general appropriations bills reported by the committee on appropriations and continuing resolutions reported by the same committee after september 15 budget resolutions and reconciliation bills reported by the committee on the budget amendments to the houses rules and resolutions affecting the order of business special rules reported by the committee on rules and resolutions concerning the offic ial conduct of members and staff reported by the committee on sta ndards of official conducthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98315crs2 other kinds of legislative bus iness derive their privilege from other house rules or from wellestablished precedents among other privileged matters are resolutions making committee assignments questions of personal privilege or the privileges of the house resolutions of inquiry resolutions seeking documents or facts from the executive branch certain motions to send bills to conference conference reports senate amendments to which the house has disagreed and bills that the president has vetoed and returned to congress the house can consider any one of these privileged matters at any time that the house is not acting on something else in practice though the choice of the day and time for considering privileged measure is made through discussions involving the majority party leadership and the committee chairman usually in consultation with the committees ranking minority member among the privileged measures listed above only general ppropriations bills continuing resolutions and budget reconciliation bills can be enacted into law in addition some laws grant privile ge to particular kinds of jo int resolutions that congress can pass usually by using expedited pro cedures within limited time period and usually for the purpose of disapproving some action that the president or an executive branch official plans to take or has taken this kind of measure may be privileged even if the committee to which it was referred has not reported it other bills are privileged therefore the chairman of committee cannot simply rise on the floor and call up for consideration some other kind of bill that his or her committee has reported the chairman cannot do so because house rules do not empower the chairman or any other member to inte rrupt the daily order of business for that purpose instead nonprivileged bills are brought to the floor in one of three ways by unanimous consent under the terms of special rule which itself is privileged or by one of several special procedures that are pr ivileged orders of busin ess on certain days as provided under house rule xv these procedur involve 1 motions to suspend the rules 2 motions to discharge committees from further consideration of bills referred to them 3 consideration of district of colu mbia business 4 the call of the private calendar for considering private bills 5 the call of the corrections calendar for considering bills the speaker has placed on that calendar and 6 the call of the committees on calendar wednesday when committees can call up nonprivileged bills they have reported in prac tice the house considers lmost all nonprivileged bills by unanimous consent pursuant to special rules or under motions to suspend the rules the alternative procedures are used infrequently for additional information see the parliame ntarians notes accompanying clause 5a of rule xiii and clause 1 of rule xiv in the house rules and manual pp
