agencies immediately assisting the president have been located in an enclave known as the executive office of the president eop within these entities are many if not most of the presidents closest advisers and assistants on matters of policy politics administration and management some of these eop components have been creations of the president others have been established by congress while some have endured others have been brief experiments some have been transferred to other quarters of the executive branch others have been abolished with successor in large measure the tenure and durability of an executive office agency is dependent upon its usefulness to the president as managerial or coordinative auxiliary national symbol or haven of political patronage among other considerations assessing the historical record former presidential aide and student of the presidency theodore sorensen once quipped that some presidents use the executive office as farm league some use it as source of experts and implementers and some use it as elba1 the executive office of the president represents an institutional response to needs felt by every occupant of the oval office beginning with george washington who of course served before there even was white house primarily these were and remain needs for advice and assistance undoubtedly there have always been many who are ready and more than willing to offer the president their advice however what has probably always been desired by presidents in this regard were few loyal and intelligent individuals who would offer counsel when asked and would keep such consultations confidential loyalty competence and ability to keep confidences were also qualities to be sought in individuals providing immediate assistance with correspondence and records maintenance appointments and scheduling bookkeeping and in time many more sophisticated tasks executive office agency precursors the first experiments with special institutions to assist the president occurred during the administration of president woodrow wilson and the initial term of president franklin d roosevelt2 the council of national defense was established 1 theodore c sorensen watchmen in the night cambridge ma mit press 1975 p 100 2 this statement does not overlook the existence of the cabinet rooted in the presidents article ii section 2 constitutional authority to require the opinion in writing of the principal officer in each of the executive departments upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices but otherwise without legally specified composition duties or recognition crs2 by congress with wilsons concurrence in 19163 in announcing the formation of the council the president indicated its chief functions would be coordination of all forms of transportation and the development of means of transportation to meet the military industrial and commercial needs of the nation and extension of the industrial mobilization work of the committee on industrial preparedness of the naval consulting board complete information as to our present manufacturing and producing facilities adaptable to manysided uses of modern warfare will be procured analyzed and made use of4 the councils members included the secretaries of agriculture commerce the interior labor the navy and war the cabinet minus the attorney general secretary of state postmaster general and vice president its statutory mandate also provided that the council was to be assisted by presidentially appointed advisory commission consisting of not more than seven persons each of whom shall have special knowledge of some industry public utility or the development of some natural resource or be otherwise specially qualified for the performance of the duties provided5 during us involvement in world war i the council and its advisory commission organized large number of shifting subunits largely composed of prominent persons who placed their services at the disposal of the federal government without compensation6 the result was network for the exchange of information and advice between executive branch leaders of the american war effort and counterpart leaders in industry business science and engineering certainly the president and his subordinates benefitted from this advisory structure as well as from the additional staff made available by the existence of the council with the close of hostilities in europe the council began to curtail its operations council appropriations for fy1922 were denied and

mobilization efforts few months later the office for emergency management became the principal mobilization coordinator ultimately the councils functions were unofficially usurped by the national security council in 1947 authority continued crs3 in combating the great depression president roosevelt seemingly preferred to assign newly created emergency programs to agencies freshly established rather than to existing departments to effect executive branch coordination he chartered temporary executive council with eo 6202a of july 11 1933 the panels 24 members inclusive of the entire cabinet the director of the bureau of the budget and the heads of the various economic recovery agencies met at the white house on tuesday afternoons roosevelt himself presided over the sessions he was assisted by the councils executive secretary frank c walker who performed such duties as may be prescribed him by the president and was the only professional staff assistant serving the panel walkers role was purely administrative and was limited to the activities of the council when fdr was absent from council meetings the senior cabinet officer present presided after few months the panel in one estimation proved too cumbersome for effective discussion8 the weakness of the council was its limited staffing and lack of power to coordinate department and agency efforts at combating the depression however it was useful forum for the exchange of ideas by the president department heads and the leaders of the new emergency agencies indeed the council meetings provided valuable information and advice and walker ably assisted fdr as behindthescenes trouble shooter9 recognizing the deficiencies of the executive council roosevelt established another coordinating organization with more limited membership on november 17 1933 he issued eo 6433a setting up the national emergency council composed of the secretaries of the interior or administrator of public works agriculture commerce and labor the administrators of agricultural adjustment and federal emergency relief the chairman of the home owners loan corporation the governor of the farm credit administration and representative from the consumers council the national emergency council had field directors in each of the states to coordinate federal relief efforts furthermore responsibility for the dissemination of information and guidance to the public about federal recovery and relief activities was vested in the council10 like the executive council the national emergency council met every tuesday but at twoweek intervals the agenda was set by the executive director in consultation with the president the member agencies submitted progress reports to inform other participants and reduce misunderstandings and conflicts in administration with the president presiding disputes might be settled at his decision frank walker initially acted as the councils executive director 7 continued for

national emergency council for coordinating the activities and administration of new deal programs in the area of relief and unemployment the president with eo 6889a of october 31 1934 consolidated the executive council the national emergency council and national recovery administration oversight panel called the industrial emergency committee the executive director of the reorganized national emergency council was given sweeping new authority but it could only be effectively exercised with the full support of the president slipping into decline after december of 1935 the council held its last meeting on april 28 193611 subsequently on september 16 1937 roosevelt issued eo 7709a abolishing the panel at the end of the year he then changed his mind however thinking the council might be useful for dealing with the recession that had become widespread by november and he extended the life of the panel fdr thought the emergency council experience wonderful essay in democracy he called it new england town meeting that gave everybody chance to blow off by his own admission he learned things that some of his subordinates wouldnt have liked to know anything about eventually roosevelt admitted the council became too big to do much actual work at the end he was he said making stump speeches when he would have preferred to be receiving advice12 nonetheless it has been observed that fdrs experience with such supercabinet entities may well have convinced him that the coordination he desired could be better achieved through strengthened presidential staff rather than collegial bodies of department and agency leaders13 toward an executive office fdr turned to group of planners after his supercabinet experiments failed to result in the kind of coordination he wanted shortly after the federal emergency administration of public works was established in june of 193314 harold ickes as the head of the new program had created the national planning board to establish evaluation criteria and advise him on project selection its members included political scientist charles merriam economist wesley c mitchell succeeded by george yantes and city planner frederick delano who was the presidents uncle as roosevelt became familiar with the boards work and as the boards members became increasingly aware of the lack of adequate information available for use in planning the development and application of the nations resources it was agreed that permanent broadly based planning body was needed the result was the conversion of the national planning board into the national resources board and advisory committee an independent cabinet committee with eo 6777 of june 30 1934 when this new entity lost its statutory charter due to supreme court 11 see ibid pp 5466 seligman

functions of the nrc17 eventually however continued congressional unhappiness with the nrpb resulted in its abolition with successor in june of 194318 the original members of the national planning board were suggested to ickes by one of his consultants louis brownlow who was the director of the public administration clearing house in chicago brownlow became frequent informal participant in the boards deliberations and meetings with ickes during the spring and summer of 1935 the planning group had progressed to having white house meetings with roosevelt who took keen interest in merriams concept of planning and its relation to the presidency at fdrs request merriam with brownlows assistance prepared memorandum on the subject19 subsequently reproduced in brownlows autobiography this october 1935 memorandum stressed the importance of management and administration for national planning of natural and human resources turning to the presidency merriam called for greater development of the presidents capabilities for management and administrative supervision of the government he acknowledged that some steps in personnel budgeting and planning had been taken in this regard but thought some analysis of the situation should be made and called for study directed toward the institutional arrangements general understandings and practices which would most effectively aid the executive in the double task of management plus political leadership and direction merriam indicated that such study of administrative management might be undertaken by the public administration committee of the social science research council chaired by brownlow this committee merriam pointed out was already engaged in an assessment of the administration of the works progress administration and it might be persuaded to broaden the scope of its inquiry20 15 schechter poultry corporation v united states 295 us 495 1935 16 53 stat 1423 17 53 stat 927 at 931 18 57 stat 169 see generally

instead sought his own study committee instructed by the president the result was the presidents committee on administrative management announced on march 22 1936 and consisting of merriam brownlow and luther gulick21 its task as revealed in the presidents letter to congress would be to make careful study of the organization of the executive branch of the government with the primary purpose of considering the problem of administrative management fdr went on to stress that many new agencies have been created during the emergency some of which will with the recovery be dropped or greatly curtailed while others in order to meet the newly realized needs of the nation will have to be fitted into the permanent organization of the executive branch22 little concern with efficiency and economy through government reorganization was evident in the presidents letter instead the emphasis was upon structuring the chief executives authority for effectively executing his constitutional responsibilities the brownlow committee reported approximately ten months later among its recommendations was proposed addition of six assistants to the presidents staff and vesting responsibility in the president for the continuous reorganization of the executive branch23 released to congress on january 12 1937 the report soon became lost in high politics three weeks after submitting the brownlow committees report to congress fdr announced he wanted to enlarge the membership of the supreme court his court packing plan not only fed congressional fears of presidential power grab but also so preoccupied congress that the brownlow committees reorganization recommendations were ignored the brownlow committees report made recommendation for an executive office of the president what was sought was modest enlargement of the number of congressionally authorized presidential assistants the president had initially been granted funds in 1857 to employ private secretary24 in 1929 congress was persuaded to add two more secretaries and an administrative assistant to the presidential payroll25 the current situation in the view of the brownlow committee called for more the president needs help his immediate staff assistance is entirely inadequate he should be given small number of executive assistants who would be his direct aides in dealing with the managerial agencies and administrative departments of the government these assistants probably not exceeding six in number would be in addition to the present secretaries who deal with the public with the congress and with the press and radio these aides would have 21 see karl executive reorganization and reform in the new deal pp 37165 22 samuel i rosenman ed the public papers and addresses of franklin d roosevelt 1936

presidents in any sense their function would be when any matter was presented to the president for action affecting any part of the administrative work of the government to assist him in obtaining quickly and without delay all pertinent information possessed by any of the executive departments so as to guide him in making his responsible decisions and then when decisions have been made to assist him in seeing to it that every administrative department and agency affected is promptly informed their effectiveness in assisting the president will we think be directly proportional to their ability to discharge their functions with restraint they would remain in the background issue orders make decisions emit public statements men for these positions should be carefully chosen by the president from within and without the government they should be men in whom the president has personal confidence and whose character and attitude is sic such that they would not attempt to exercise power on their own account they should be possessed of high competence great physical vigor and passion for anonymity they should be installed in the white house itself directly accessible to the president in the selection of these aides the president should be free to call on departments from time to time for the assignment of persons who after tour of duty as his aides might be restored to their old positions26 while this particular recommendation did not attract fervent opposition in congress the forces of resistance carried sway and roosevelts hopes for executive branch reforms died in the 75th congress creating the executive office although efforts at gaining legislative approval of the brownlow committees recommendations lay in ruin in the spring of 1938 the buoyant chief executive had not deserted the cause by july fdr was meeting with brownlow merriam and gulick their committee would not be officially reassembled but he wanted each mans help with reorganization authority proposal roosevelt sought out the democratic congressional leadership to discuss the new reorganization measure legislative strategy was set in early december 1938 by roosevelt merriam gulick brownlow was convalescing from heart attack and senator james byrnes the chairman of the senate select committee on government organization and manager of the reorganization legislation byrnes asked that the bill be initiated in the house where debate could be limited and the senate would be free to pursue pending business of the moment the resulting measure hr 4425 empowered the president to propose reorganization plans subject to veto by majority vote of disapproval in both houses of congress and to also appoint six administrative assistants after three days of discussion and debate the house adopted the bill on march 8 1939 twelve days later the senate began considering the proposal following two days of sparring over amendments the senate adopted the bill quick 26 us presidents committee on administrative management report of the presidents committee p 5 crs8 conference cleared the measure for roosevelts signature on april 327 earlier fdr had asked brownlow merriam and gulick to return to washington and assist with the preparation of his initial reorganization plans28 following consultations with budget director harold d smith the brownlow group presented two reorganization proposals to roosevelt on april 23 plan 1 submitted to congress on april 25 indicated that certain agencies were transferred to the executive office of the president but offered explanation of that entity29 in plan 2 the national emergency council was abolished and most of its functions were transferred to the executive office30 while both plans were acceptable to legislators their effective dates were troublesome in terms of accommodating fiscal calendar necessities by joint resolution congress provided that both plans would be effective on july 1 193931 following this action the president on september 8 issued eo 8248 formally organizing the executive office and thereby defining it in terms of its components32 brownlow who drafted the initial reorganization plan viewed the executive office as the institutional realization of administrative management and the effective coordination of the tremendously widespread federal machinery he called the initial version little thing compared to its later size it grew under roosevelt and it continued to expand and was further regularized by statute by appropriation acts and by more reorganization plans during the succeeding years33 composition and growth the executive office organized by eo 8248 was to consist of the white house office the bureau of the budget the national resources planning board the office of government reports which assumed the information responsibilities of the defunct national emergency council the liaison office for personnel management and in the event of national emergency such office for emergency management as the president shall determine the office for emergency management was created by an administrative order on may 25 1940 and its functions were further specified in an administrative order of january 7 194134 it subsequently served as parent unit for number of subordinate emergency management bodies its functions were largely assumed by the office of war mobilization and reconversion 27 53 stat 561 28 richard polenberg reorganizing roosevelts government cambridge ma harvard university press 1966 pp 184187 29 53 stat 1423 30 53 stat 1431 at 1435 31 53

war ii but it was never abolished and remains an inactive executive office unit35 at the time of roosevelts death the united states government manual indicated six principal eop units plus the council of national defense however the office for emergency management which it was explained is primarily framework within the confines of the executive office of the president within which framework various civilian war agencies have been established counted 16 major agencies at the end of his first term as president harry s truman had an executive office of eight principal units as well as the council of national defense and the office for emergency management had two subsidiary agencies new executive office units created by congress included the council of economic advisers the central intelligence agency the national security council and the national security resources board36 at the end of his second term truman had 11 executive office units but the office for emergency management was dormant manuals for the presidency of dwight d eisenhower indicate eight executive office components at the end of his first administration and nine at the conclusion of his second term at the time of his assassination john f kennedy also had nine executive office entities and lyndon b johnson counted 11 such units at the conclusion of his oval office tenure when richard nixon resigned the presidency he left behind 15 executive office agencies his successor gerald ford also had 15 eop components when he departed from the white house but the next president jimmy carter had reduced total of 11 entities at the end of his term ronald reagan finished both of his administrations with nine executive office units george h w bush had 11 such agencies when he completed his term and william clinton had ten eop entities during his presidency37 profiles of the major entities within the executive office during the 19392000 period are presented in appendix i of this report and their chronological location in the eop is portrayed in appendix ii among the more enduring constructs of the executive office are the white house office and the office of management and budget formerly the bureau of the budget which were among the initial eop structures the council of economic advisers established in 194638 and the national security council created in 194739 also appear to hold permanent status both the office of the special representative 35 see herman m somers presidential agency cambridge ma harvard university press 1950 36 while the central intelligence agency could be considered subunit of the national security council it is treated here as principal unit of the executive office of the president until 1981 when the united states government manual for that year listed it as an independent establishment 37 the staff office of the vice president though sometimes for some purposes is considered to be an executive office component it was not so regarded in these counts 38 60 stat 24 39 61 stat 496 crs10 for trade negotiations and the council on environmental quality have endured for over two decades it also seems unlikely that the presidents administrative support staff unit known as the office of administration will soon be eliminated if such did happen its functions would most likely have to be assumed by the white house office which would increase both its personnel and budget indeed the office of administration was created in part in response to criticism that the white house staff was too large and too costly the number of units within the executive office of the president has not been serious issue over the years congress respecting the constitutions separation of powers has allowed the president to exercise free hand with regard to the executive office he may create temporary eop body and use appropriated discretionary funds to finance such unit however it is expected that the creation and functioning of this entity at minimum will not contravene prevailing statutes and that its continued existence will be subject to congressional approval through the legislative or appropriations process congress routinely appropriates funds directly or indirectly for all executive office agencies when controversy has risen it has usually involved resources for and the powers of executive office entities as noted earlier congress was suspicious of roosevelts national planners the national resources planning board came to be seen as meddlesome threat to traditional political relationships and waste of money so it was abolished40 concerned that the director of the office of war mobilization unit of the office for emergency management created by eo 9347 of may 27194341 was becoming too powerful congress created replacement agency the office of war mobilization and reconversion and made its director subject to senate confirmation gave him twoyear term and specified his authority42 more recently during the 1970s congressional concern about the growth of the staff of the executive office ultimately resulted in an authorization statute setting personnel ceilings for the white house office the vice presidents office the presidents domestic policy staff and the office of administration43 in the summer of 1981 the house committee on appropriations denied the budget request of the office of policy development in its entirety because witnesses from the agency refused to appear at subcommittee hearing to discuss their funding after the subcommittee markup occurred said the committee report the head of that office met informally and off the record with the subcommittee to discuss the matter additional information on the legal basis for refusing to appear was to be provided but because it was not subsequently received the committee took its action44 the office of policy development and other segments of the federal government were funded shortly thereafter through an emergency resolution continuing appropriations 40 57 stat 169 41 3 cfr 19381943 comp pp 12811282 42 58 stat 785 43 92 stat 2445 44 us congress house committee on appropriations treasury postal service and general

appropriations subcommittee in his 1958 autobiography louis brownlow commented that he was quite certain that fdr when creating the executive office had not in his wildest dreams envisioned the expansion that later occurred46 indeed brownlow himself was surprised he might also be surprised that administrative management stressed by the brownlow committee has not been major concern of many of the men succeeding franklin d roosevelt as president the past two decades have seen little awareness of or demonstrated interest in administrative management on the part of the men occupying the oval office this situation is reflected in their public remarks the relatively unchanging composition of the executive office and the general absence of executive branch reorganization activities or plans however significant changes in the composition and staffing of the executive office other than an isolated addition of new unit or few personnel could occur depending upon the approach future presidents have toward administrative management considerations for the execution of the duties of the presidency47 45 95 stat 958 46 brownlow passion for anonymity the autobiography of louis brownlow second half p 417 47 it might be noted in this regard that while the initial 1993 report of the national performance review npr offered dozen major recommendations concerning the organization and operations of the executive office none of these were of an administrative management character furthermore neither the 1993 npr report nor president clinton indicated governance theory of
