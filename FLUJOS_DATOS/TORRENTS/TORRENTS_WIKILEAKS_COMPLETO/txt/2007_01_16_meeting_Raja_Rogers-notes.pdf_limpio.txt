parents maharishi has even sent people home from raja training to do so 100 hr push to get the central univ at the brahmastan of america farmer spent 30 yrs leveling and terracing the land to the east theres lot of silence in kansas maharishi wants to offer 8 for 7 yr bond to get this bond we have the collateral of the land there we also have inaugurated building on broad st in manhattan near stock exchange two kinds of people being sought 1 those who want to give dona tion 2 those who want to buy bond will need 25 worth of bond for example for 1 million in funding 75 paid by bonds and 25 by dona tions etc maharishi really wants campus for each of the 50 states would be nice to have some small amt of funding from each state whats going to happen to mvc and mum it will continue to grow central univ will be more specialized univ how can we do something in very remote place 15 yrs ago i was sitting with maharishi talking about building center for perfect health and world peace which is now mvc maharishi said you build it and i will fill it when we were in the brahmastan of india last yr at this time i remembered that delegation was there 78 yrs before that and nothing was there now there are hund reds of buildings so wherever maharishi puts his attention things happen can happen slowly or quickly we want to help it happen quickly bevan said that maharishi said that it is really the sattva created on the inv america course that has allowed this next step of sequential unfoldment maharishi had world plan many yrs ago and now the plan is unfolding rapidly the plan is to use the vastu pts brahmastans of india and of america as leverage to bring enlightenment peace to the world we are few in number so we need to use as much leverage as we can so that is the importance of helping maharishi manifest this university as quickly as possible now they are putting in some infrastructure we are broadcasting from there and we have nice little tm center in smith center the property is about 6 miles from smith center wonde rful area you can feel the silence as you approach the brahmastan maharishi is also focused on raising the gcwp flag in every country jeff murphy
