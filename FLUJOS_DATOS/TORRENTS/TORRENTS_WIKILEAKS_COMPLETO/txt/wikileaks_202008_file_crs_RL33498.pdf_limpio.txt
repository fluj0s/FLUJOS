antiterrorism efforts yet the outcomes of us policies toward pakistan since 911 while not devoid of meaningful successes have seen failure to neutralize antiwestern militants and reduce religious

leading opposition figure benazir bhutto who had returned to pakistan from selfimposed exile only months earlier these developments led many washingtonbased critics to more forcefully question the

of impeachment in august the bush administration called his fate matter of internal paki stani politics abandoned by many political allies and perhaps even by his military successor musharraf made the decision to resign the presidency and exit pakistans political stage on august 18 within one week of the resignation islamabads ruling parliamentary coalition fractured there are indications that antiamerican sentiments are widespread in pakistan and that significant segment of the populace has viewed years of us support for president musharraf and the pakistani military as an impediment to rather than facilitator of the process of democratization there underlying the antiamerican sentiment is pervasive but perhaps malleable perception that the united states is fighting war against islam2 the bush administration continued to proclaim its ongoing support for musharraf even after his imposition of emergency rule and the later sweeping rejection of his parliamentary allies by pakistani voters however in 2008 the administration showed signs of shift in its longstanding pakistan policies in particular on the issue of democratization as articulated by deputy secretary of state john negroponte in march the united states is committed to working with all of pakistans leaders on the full spectrum of bilateral issues from fighting violent extremism to improving educational and economic opportunities the united states looks forward to engaging pakistans new government on how best to promote economic growth and reduce poverty the united states will continue to help the pakistani people build secure prosperous and free society 3 still many pakistanis are resentful of perceived us interference and pressure in the words of one senior pakistani commentator and former army general in trying to impose its will against the wishes of pakistani people the bush administration further heightens antiamerican sentiment discredits the war on terror and makes it more difficult for the new civilian government to stabilize air strikes by us forces in the tribal belt threats of more to follow and washi ngtons fierce opposition to peace agreements also lead to widespread resentment and instability 4 many in pakistan are hopeful that the incoming administration of presidentelect barack obama will be less overbearing in its dealings with islamabad and will also do more to nurture pakistans nascent democratic institutions5 in 2008 islamabads new civilian ruling dispensation has been welcomed by us leaders in july president george w bush hosted prime

unprecedented ruling coalition including the countrys two leading mainstream parties proved fragile and collapsed almost immediately upon the resignation of president musharraf without having enacted any major policies on the security front pakistan is the setting for multiple armed islamist insurgencies some of which span the border with afghanistan and contribute to the destabilization of that

neotaliban insurgency in the scenic swat valley just 100 miles northwest of the capital where radical islamic cleric maulana fazlullah and up to 5000 of his armed followers seek to impose sharia law fazlullah also known as maulana radio for his fiery and unlicensed fm broadcasts moved to create parallel government like that established by protaliban militant baitullah mehsud in south waziristan some 2500 frontier corps soldiers were deployed to the swat valley and the army soon took charge of the counterinsurgency effort at the request of the provincial governor massing about 15000 regular troops by yearsend most militant elements in the area were reported to be in retreat and the pakistani government claimed victory 26 yet in 2008 with militants still active in swat government

government security forces and re ligious militants also flared anew in the fa ta in 2008 shortly after bhuttos december 2007 assassination the pakistan army undertook major operation against militants in the south waziristan agency assumed loyal to baitullah mehsud fierce fighting continued in that area throughout the year according to one report nearly half of the estimated 450000 residents of the mehsud territories were driven from their homes by the fighting and live in makeshift camps28 the nwfp governor has claimed mehsud oversees an annual budget of up to 45 million devoted to perpetuating regional militancy most of this amount is thought to be raised through narcotic s trafficking although protaliban militants also sustain themselves by demanding fees and taxes from profitable regional businesses such as marble quarries the apparent impunity with which mehsud is able to act has caused serious alarm in washington where officials worry that his power and influence are only growing29 the tehrikitaliban pakistan ttp emerged as coherent grouping in late 2007 under baitullah mehsuds leadership this pakistani taliban is said to have representatives from each of pakistans seven tribal agencies as well as from many of the settled districts abutting the fa ta there appears to be reliable evidence that the ttp receives funding from external states the groups principal aims are threefold 1 to unite disparate protaliban groups active in the fa ta and nwfp 2 to assist the afghan taliban in its conflict across the durand line and 3 to establish talibanstyle islamic state in pakistan and perhaps beyond as an umbrella group the ttp is home to tribes and subtribes some with longheld mutual antagonism it thus suffers from factionalism mehsud himself is believed to command some 5000 militants in august 2008 the islamabad government formally banned the ttp due to its involvement in series of suicide attacks in pakistan the move allowed for the freezing of all ttp bank accounts and other assets though these are not known to exist in any official context and for the interdiction of printed and visual propaganda materials 30

the conclusions of the us intelligence community qaeda has been able to retain safehaven in pakistans fata that provides the organization many of the advantages it once derived from its base across the border in afghanistan albeit on smaller and less secure scale the fata serves as staging area for qaedas attacks in support of the taliban in afghanistan as well as location for training new terrorist operatives for attacks in pakistan the middle east africa europe and the united states 32 the number of qaeda suspects estimated killed or captured in pakistanapproximately 700 has remained essentially unchanged since 2004 qaeda appears to be increasing its influence among the myriad islamist militant groups operating along the pakistanafghanistan border some pakistani and western security officials see islamabad losing its war against religious militancy and qaeda forces enjoying new areas in which to operate due in part to the pakistan armys poor counterinsurgency capabilities and to the central governments eroded legitimacy at an april hearing on qaeda panel of nongovernmental experts agreed that the ongoing hunt for qaedas top leaders was foundering 33 in

an ongoing taliban insurgency in afghanistan and its connection to developments in pakistan are matters of serious concern to us policy makers it is widely held that success in afghanistan cannot come

onethird of the attacks on coalition troops in afghanistan38 cia director hayden said in march 2008 that the situation on the pakistanafghanistan border presents clear and present danger to afghanistan to pakistan and to the west in general and to the united states in particular he agreed with other top us officials who believe that possible future terrorist attacks on the us homeland likely would originate from that region39 afghan officials continue to accuse pakistani officials of aiding and abetting terrorism inside afghanistan pakistani officials have sought to allay afghan leaders fears that truces in the tribal regions would lead to more crossborder attacks assuring them that islamabad makes distinction between pakistani and afghan interests on this issue40 yet afghan president karzai has asserted his countrys right to defend itself and cross the border and destroy terrorist nests he has specifically named baitullah mehsud and maulana fazlullah among the antiafghan militants he wishes to see neutralized islamabad rejected the regrettable comments and vowed to defend its sovereign territory when asked about the exchange president bush said our strategy is to deny safe haven to extremists who would do harm to innocent people and thats the strategy of afghanistan it needs to be the strategy of paki stan the us president offered that improved dialogue between islamabad and kabul revival of the crossborder jirga process and better intelligence cooperation among all concerned countries could ameliorate the situation 41 pakistans mixed record on battling islamist extremism includes an ongoing apparent tolerance of taliban elements operating from its territory42 the kandahari clique reportedly operates not from pakistans tribal areas but from populated areas in and around the baluchistan provincial capital of quetta many analysts believe that pakistans intelligence services know the whereabouts of these afghan taliban leadership elements and likely even maintain active contacts with them at some level as part of hedge strategy in the region reports continue to indicate that elements of pakistans major intelligence agency and military forces aid the taliban and other extremists forces as matter of policy such support may even include providing training and fire support for taliban offensives see also questions about pakistans main

afghanistan at least one senior us senator has questioned the wisdom of providing us aid to group that is ineffective at best and may even be providing support to terrorists44 as pressure on islamabad to curtail the crossborder attacks has increased pakistani officials more openly contend that the problem is essentially internal to afghanistan and has its roots in the inability of the kabul government to effectively extend its writ and in the lack of sufficient afghan and western military forces to defeat the taliban insurgents this view is supported by some independent analyses 45 pakistani leaders insist that afghan stability is vital pakistani interest they ask interested partners to enhance their own efforts to control the border region by undertaking an expansion of military deployments and checkposts on the afghan side of the border by engaging more robust intelligence sharing and by continuing to supply the counterinsurgency equipment requested by pakistan islamabad touts the expected effectiveness of sophisticated technologies such as biometric scanners in reducing illicit crossborder movements but analysts are pessimistic that such measures can

officers oversaw cooperative efforts to train and supply afghan freedom fighters who were battling the soviet army yet mutual mistrust has been everpresent and in the summer of 2008 longstanding

warn that neither adding more us and western troops in afghanistan nor increasing cross border attacks into pakistan is likely to improve the regional security situation instead they argue for political and diplomatic initiatives that would distinguish between local militants and global jihadists such as qaeda offer inclusion to wide array of reconcilable insurgent elements in both afghanistan and pakistan and include major development initiative to boost living standards there they view us policy of pressuring pakistan to be inherently flawed in the absence of efforts to address islamabads fundamental sources of insecurity 134 one carnegie endowmentbased analyst offers fivepoint strategy for the next us presidential administration urging it to 1 strengthen islamabad s civilian government so as to consolidate democracy and convey respect for the wishes of the pakistani people 2 invest in improving pakistan s human capital and support its civil society with focus on

concerns about soviet expansionism and pakistans desire for security assistance against perceived threat from india prompted the two countries to negotiate mutual defense assistance agreement in 1954 by 1955 pakistan had further aligned itself with the west by joining two regional defense pacts the south east asia treaty organization and the central treaty organization or baghdad pact as result of these alliances islamabad received nearly 2 billion in us assistance from 1953 to 1961 onequarter of this in military aid making pakistan one of americas most importa nt security assistance partners of the period president dwight d eisenhower famously called pakistan americas most allied ally in asia differing expectations of the security relationship long bedeviled bilateral ties however during and immediately after the indopakistani wars of 1965 and 1971 the united states suspended military assistance to both sides resulting in cooling of the pakistanus relationship and perception among many in pakistan that the united states was not reliable ally in the mid1970s new strains arose over pakistans efforts to respond to indias 1974 underground nuclear test by seeking its own nuclear weapons capability us aid was suspended by president jimmy carter in 1979 in response to pakistans covert construction of uranium enrichment facility however following the soviet invasion of afghanistan later that year pakistan again was viewed as frontline ally in the effort to block soviet expansionism in 1981 the reagan administration pledged for islamabad fiveyear 32 billion aid package pakistan became key transit country for arms supplies to the afghan resistance as well as home for millions of afghan refugees many of whom have yet to return despite this renewal of us aid and close security ties many in congress remained troubled by pakistans nuclear weapons program in 1985 section 620ee the pressler amendment was added to the foreign assistance act requiring the president to certify to congress that pakistan does not possess nuclear explosive device during the fiscal year for which aid is to be provided with the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan pakistans nuclear activities again came under intensive us scrutiny and in 1990 president george hw bush again suspended aid to pakistan under the provisions of the pressler amendment most bilateral economic and all military aid ended and deliveries of major military equipment ceased in 1992 congress partially relaxed the scope of sanctions to allow for food assistance and continuing support for nongovernmental organizations among the notable results of the aid cutoff was the nondelivery

later the united states agreed to compensate pakistan with 325 million cash payment and 140 million worth of surplus wheat and soy but the episode engendered lingering pakistani resentments us disengagement from pakistan and afghanistan after 1990 had serious and lasting effects on pakistani perceptions even retired army chief and us ally president musharraf himself repeatedly voiced narrative in which pakistan joined the united states to wage jihad in afghanistan in the 1980s only to see disaster follow when the military victory was bungled up and the united states then left the region abandoned totally when combined with ensuing sanctions on us aid this left many pakistanis with the sense they had been used and ditched 136 the new pakistani president asif zardari has taken up similar narrative telling the general assembly in september 2008 that the world turned its back on afghanistan after the soviet defeat leaving pakistan with three million afghan refugees in camps that soon became breeding grounds for intolerance and violence we were left to deal with the consequences 137 during the 1990s with us attention shifted away from the region islamabad further

musharraf to resign rather than further polarize the country prime minister gillani expressed confidence that the military leadership was prodemocracy and would not intervene to protect musharraf154 cynical observers saw the two major party leaders valuing their own political fortunes over the health of the pakistani nation such cynicism only deepened with the later news that zardari would present himself as candidate to be pakistans next president155 the first major aspect of the federal coalitions plan to remove the president involved passing antimusharraf resolutions in each of the countrys four provincial assemblies the punjab assembly overwhelmingly passed the first such resolution the nwfp sindh and baluchistan assemblies followed within days with signs that the military brass would not come to his aid the besieged president appeared to have allies remaining and flood of reports indicated that musharrafs resignation was imminent 156 on august 18 president musharraf delivered resignation address to the nation in which he claimed responsibility both for turning around pakistans economy and for introducing the essence of democracy there he blamed the new civilian government for the countrys current economic and political instability rejected the charge sheet that had been brought against him xplained his decision to resign as an effort to avoid confrontation

serious rifts again appeared in the ruling coalition with nawaz sharif reportedly delivering an ultimatum to the ppp that the chief justice be restored to office within 72 hours or the pmln would withdraw support moreover the ppps announcement that zardari himself would be candidate for the presidency violated sharifs understanding that the new president would be nonpolitical figure 158 on august 25 sharif responded to what he saw as series of broken promises by withdrawing his partys support for the ruling coalition and joining the opposition benches in parliament the end of the fivemonth long accommodation between the ppp and pmln did not lead to new elections as zardaris party collected enough smaller party support to remain in power yet the development triggered wide array of analysts to predict even more political instability in islamabad in the foreseeable future and the fractiousness of pakistans governance setting cast further pall over prospects for the countrys

single most important interlocutor in islamabad musharrafs resignation presented yet another challenge for us officials in their dealings with pakistan despite the bush administrations official noninterference posture many reports had the us government urging soft landing for musharraf still in the end the bush administration watched quietly as its key pakistani ally was marginalized apparently concluding that musharrafs time was up and that any further overt us support for the discredited exgeneral would only stoke visceral antiamerican sentiments in pakistan 175 upon musharrafs

british india into two successor states in 1947 and the unresolved issue of kashmiri sovereignty have been major sources of tension both countries have built large defense establishments at significant cost to economic and social development the kashmir problem is rooted in claims by both countries to the former princely state divided since 1948 by military line of control loc into the indian state of jammu and kashmir and pakistanheld azad free kashmir india blames pakistan for supporting violent separatist rebellion in the muslimdominated kashmir valley that has taken up to 66000 lives since 1989 pakistan admits only to lending moral and political support to the rebels and it criticizes india for human rights abuses in i ndianoccupied kashmir new delhi continues to blame pakistan for maintaining an infrastructure of terror and for actively supporting terrorist groups that are held responsible for attacks inside india 177 for many analysts efforts to ameliorate pakistans obsession with india could be key to normalizing south asian politics and ending islamabads historic and ambivalent links to religious extremism178 some call on new delhi to reach out to the new islamabad government with conciliatory gestures that could facilitate the consolidation of democratization in pakistan179 india held pakistan responsible for late 2001 terrorist attacks in kashmir and on the indian parliament complex in new delhi the indian response massive military mobilization was mirrored by pakistan and within months some one million heavilyarmed soldiers were facing off at the international frontier during an extremely tense 2002 another fullscale war seemed real and even likely possibility and may have been averted only through international diplomatic efforts including multiple visits to the region by top us officials spring 2003 peace initiative brought major improvement in the bilateral relationship allowing for an autumn ceasefire agreement initiated by pakistan the process led to january 2004 summit meeting in islamabad and joint agreement to reengage composite dialogue to bring about peaceful settlement of all bilateral issues including jammu and kashmir to the satisfaction of both sides 180 since this new peace effort was launched numerous midlevel meetings normalized diplomatic relations and increased peopletopeople contacts have brought modest but still meaningful progress toward stable relations regular dialogue continued in 2005 and third round of composite dialogue talks was held in 2006 notable confidencebuilding measures have been put in place in particular travel and commerce across the kashmiri loc for the first time in decades and bilateral trade has increased yet militarized territorial disputes over kashmir the siachen glacier and the sir creek remain unresolved and pakistani officials regularly express 177 while levels of violence in kashmir declined significantly in 2007 as compared to the previous year

the already slow moving process however after meeting on the sidelines of nonaligned movement summit in cuba president musharraf and indian prime nister singh announced resumption of formal peace negotiations and also approved implementation of joint antiterrorism mechanism the composite dialogue then resumed after fo urmonth hiatus progress was made on outstanding territorial disputes and india is not known to have presented evidence of pakistani involvement in the 711 bombings but the two officials did give shape to the proposed joint antiterrorism mechanism notable step came in late 2006 when the two sides agreed to conduct joint survey of the disputed sir creek region in january 2007 foreign minister kasuri hosted his indian counterpart pranab mukherjee in islamabad for the first such visit in more than year the two men gave favorable review to past progress and planned fourth composite dialogue round in february two bombs exploded on an indian segment of the samjhauta friendship express train linking delhi india with lahore pakistan resulting fires killed 68 people most of them pakistanis days later kasuri traveled to new delhi where he and mukherjee reaffirmed bilateral commitment to the peace process despite the apparent effort to subvert it the new joint antiterrorism mechanism met for the first time in islamabad in march 2007 producing joint statement in which both governments agreed to use the forum for exchanging information about investigations of andor efforts to prevent terrorist acts on either side of the shared border hopes that the samjhauta train bombing would provide fitting test case were dashed however when india declined to share relevant investigative information moreover indian officials were unhappy with islamabads insistence that the freedom struggle underway in kashmir should not be treated as terrorism under this framework still the engagement even after major terrorist attack was widely viewed as evidence that the bilateral peace process had gained sturdy momentum new round of dialogue was then initiated when the two foreign ministers met again in islamabad new agreements were reached but both officials lauded improved bilateral relations and held the most sustained and intensive dialogue ever on the kashmir problem 181 political turmoil and uncertainty arose in islamabad around that same time however and led to slowed progress in the bilateral peace process fourth round of bilateral talks on economic and commercial cooperation ended in august 2007 with agreements to facilitate importation of cement from pakistan and tea from india among others pakistani and indian officials also held technicallevel talks on the modalities of cross border movement and separate talks on the tubal navigation

appeasement in western tribal areas near the afghan border by seeking accommodation with protaliban leaders in these areas the musharraf government may inadvertently have allowed foreign largely arab militants to obtain safe haven from which they can plot and train for terrorist attacks against us and other western targets moreover many observers warn that an american preocc upation with iraq contributed to allowing qaedas reemergence in pakistan 209 the head of the us central intelligence agency michael hayden has portrayed qaeda as being on the defensive in south asia claiming that its leadership is losing the battle for hearts and minds in the muslim world some independent analysts agree that qaedas grand project of establishing militant islamic caliphate has been resounding failure but warn that the group remains potent and serves as model for jihadi groups around the world 210

president musharraf made an unprecedented show of force by moving 25000 pakistani troops into the traditionally autonomous fa ta on the afghan frontier the first half of 2004 saw an escalation of pakistani army operations many in coordination with us and afghan forces just across the international frontier213 kabuls october 2004 elections were held without major disturbances apparently in part due to musharrafs commitment to reducing infiltrations yet concerns sharpened in 2005 and by the middle of that year afghan leaders were openly accusing islamabad of supporting insurgents and providing their leadership with safe haven islamabad denied the charges and sought to reassure kabul by dispatching additional troops to border areas bringing the total to 80000 still 2006 was the deadliest year to date for us troops in afghanistan and at years end there were growing indications that islamabads efforts to control the tribal areas were meeting with little success former president musharrafs carrot and stick approach of offering amnesty to those militant tribals who surrendered and using force against those who resisted clearly did not rid the region of islamist

damage and alienating local residents islamabad in 2004 began shifting strategy and sought to arrange truces with waziri commanders first at shakai in south waziristan in april 2004 then again in february 2005 officials in islamabad recognized that the social fabric of the fa ta had changed following its role as staging and recruiting area for the war against the soviet army in afghanistan during the 1980s the traditional power base was eroded as the influence of religious elements had greatly increased president musharraf lambasted the creeping talibanization of the tribal areas and sought to implement new scheme shifting over time from an almost wholly militarized approach to one emphasizing negotiation and economic development in the fa ta as well as re elevating the role of tribal maliks who would work in closer conjunction with federal political agents the aim then became restoration of kind of enhanced status quo with limited state writ maliks would enjoy more pay and larger levies and the reduction and ultimately full withdrawal of army troops the us government offered cautious initial support for the new strategy 214

to live in peace and honor the pact 215 news of the truce received lukewarm reception in washington where officials took waitand see approach within weeks there was growing concern among both us government officials and independent analysts that the truce represented pakistani surrender and had in effect created sanctuary for extremists with the rate of taliban activities in neighboring afghanistan much increased still islamabad pressed ahead with plan to extend similar truce to the bajaur tribal agency only hours before such deal was to be struck on october 30 2006 82 people were

instability in the fa ta only increased in 2007 with large trust deficit between government forces and tribal leaders and conclusion by top us officials that president musharrafs strategy of making truce deals with protaliban militants had failed in january the director of the us defense intelligence agency lt gen michael maples told senate panel that tribal leaders in waziristan had not abided by most terms of the september 2006 north waziristan truce216 in march undersecretary of defense for policy edelman reported to the same panel that there was an almost immediate and steady increase of crossborder infiltration and attacks just after that agreement had been reached some reports even describe anecdotes of the pakistani military providing fire support for taliban units operating in afghanistan the nowdefunct september 2006 peace deal clearly failed to curb violence and religious militancy in the region and had apparent effect on the continued crossborder movement of protaliban forces into afghanistan many analysts insist that any such future agreements of this nature are doomed to similar failure in the absence of substantive changes in pakistans fundamental regional and domestic policies 217 by the close of 2007 us intelligence analysts had amassed considerable evidence that islamabads truces with religious militants in the fa ta had given taliban qaeda and other islamist extremists space in which to rebuild their networks behindthescenes diplomatic effort to prod the islamabad government on its counterterrorism strategy was ramped up during the course of the year but it may have only been through more public and stronglyworded us criticisms of pakistan in july that islamabad was convinced to be more energetic in its militarized efforts 218 spate of militant attacks on pakistani military targets during that month apparently in retaliation for the governments armed assault on islamabads radical red mosque led musharraf to further bolster the armys presence in the region top bush administration officials suggested the tack of seeking accommodation with regional extremist elements should be abandoned219 many analysts insist that only by bringing the tribal areas under the full writ of the pakistani state and facilitating major economic development there can the fa ta problem be resolved

in 2005 the state department announced renewal of f16 sales to pakistan after 16year hiatus subsequent october 2005 earthquake in northern pakistan put the f16 purchase program on hold and led to sharp reduction in the number of aircraft requested by pakistan which originally had been 75 in june 2006 the pentagon notified congress of possible foreign military sale to pakistan worth up to 51 billion the deal involves 18 newlybuilt f16 block 5052 aircraft along with related munitions and equipment and represents the largestever weapons sale to pakistan islamabad later d eclined an option to pur chase 18 additional new aircraft associated munitions for new f16s and for midlife upgrades on others include 500 amraam airtoair missiles and thousand s of both gravity and smart bombs 232 congressional concerns about the sale and displeasure at the bush administrations apparently improper notification procedures spurred july 2006 hearing of the house international relations committee during that session many members worried that f16s were better suited to fighting india than to combating terrorists some warned that us military technology could be passed from pakistan to china the state departments lead official on politicalmilitary relations sought to assure the committee that the sale would serve us interests by strengthening the defense capabilities of key ally without disturbing the regional balance of power and that all possible measures would be taken to prevent the onward transfer of us technologies hjres 93 disapproving the proposed sale was introdu ced in the house but died in committee secretary of state rice subsequently informed congress that f16 combat aircraft or related equipment would be delivered to pakistan until islamabad provided written security assurances that us technology will not be accessible by third parties islamabad has denied that any extraordinary security requirements were requested however congressional concerns appear to have been satisfactorily addressed after further negotiations on specifics including payment process that requires major outlay from the pakistani treasury the united states and pakistan signed september 2006 letter of acceptance for the multibillion dollar f16 deal since then several major us defense corporations have won contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars to supply f16 parts

national funds for the bulk of such upgrades the proposal was met with anger and dismay by some in congress who said the move would do little to enhance pakistans counterterrorism capabilities state department spokesman asserted that islamabad sought and was granted the consideration so as to provide muchneeded financial relief to the pakistani government two senior house members concerned that the proposal would divert funds from more effective counterterrorism tools requested hold be placed on the planned reprogramming and proposed that congress provide 200 million in budgetary support to

sensitive pakistani nuclear materials and technologies have been transferred illicitly to third parties press reports in late 2002 suggested that pakistan assisted pyongyangs covert nuclear weapons program by providing north korea with uranium enrichment materials and technologies beginning in the mid1990s islamabad rejected such reports as baseless and secretary of state colin powell was assured that such transfers were occurring under us law if such assistance is confirmed by the us president all nonhumanitarian us aid to pakistan may be suspended although the president has the authority to waive any sanctions that he determines would jeopardize us national security in early 2003 the bush administration determined that the relevant facts do not warrant imposition of sanctions under applicable us laws press reports during 2003 suggested that both iran and libya benefitted from pakistani nuclear assistance islamabad denied any nuclear cooperation with tehran or tripoli although it conceded in december 2003 that certain senior scientists were under investigation for possible independent proliferation activities the investigation led to the february 2004 public humiliation of metallurgist abdul qadeer khan known as the founder of pakistans nuclear weapons program and national hero when he confessed to involvement in an illicit nuclear smuggling network khan and at least seven associates were said to have sold crucial nuclear weapons technology and uraniumenrichment materials to north korea iran and libya such technology may have included complete blueprints for an advanced nuclear weapon design 240 president musharraf citing khans contributions to his nation issued pardon that was later called conditional241 the united states has been assured that the islamabad government had knowledge of such activities washington called the decision to pardon an internal pakistani matter some independent observers insist that khans activities were in fact well known to top pakistani authorities and that elements of the us government turned blind eye to the proliferation while seeking pakistans continued cooperation with other foreign policy efforts 242 khan himself has alleged that at least one illicit shipment of uranium enrichment equipment to north korea was supervised by the pakistani army with the consent of thenarmy chief mushar raf spokesman for musharraf called the allegations lies243 while president musharraf did promise president bush that all information learned about khans proliferation network would be shared pakistan has refused to allow any direct access to khan by us or international investigators in may 2006 days after releasing from detention nuclear scientist and suspected khan collaborator mohammed

2006 islamabad appeared to launch public relations effort aimed at overcoming the stigma caused by khans proliferation activities the effort included dispatching to washington the chief of the countrys strategic plans division khalid kidwai retired lieutenant general who attempted to make more transparent pakistans nuclear command and control structure and who acknowledged that pakistans past proliferation record had been poor and indefensible250 among the most urgent concerns of us officials has been the security of pakistans nuclear weapons and materials which could be degraded as instability persists while the danger of islamist extremist gaining possession of nuclear explosive device is considered remote the risk of rogue scientists or security officials seeking to sell nuclear materials andor technology is seen to be higher in setting of deteriorating security conditions pentagon officials backpedaled from expressions of concern immediately following the november 2007 emergency imposition in pakistan saying they believed the countrys nuclear arsenal was under the appropriate control the united states reportedly has spent nearly 100 million since 2001 on classified program to help secure pakistans strategic weapons islamabad claims the amount is closer to 10 million and it emphatically rejects suggestions that the countrys nuclear arsenal is anything but fully secure 251 most analysts appear to have concluded that the security of pakistans nuclear weapons and facilities is much improved in recent years some note that periods of interstate crisis between pakistan and india can be particularly dangerous in the context of nuclear security when pakistans warheads are more likely to be mobilized and so are outside of their heavilyguarded storage sites252 more worrisome many claim is the possibility that pakistans nuclear knowhow or technologies could remain prone to leakage253 in his february 2008 threat assessment for the senate armed services committee director of national intelligence mcconnell offered the conclusions of the us intelligence community we judge the ongoing political transition in pakistan has not seriously

to pakistans nuclear weapons falling into the hands of extremist elem ents unsurprisingly the islamabad government angrily rejects such fears as unrealistic but even some pakistani commentators aver that such warnings should not be dismissed256 pakistan reportedly has since 2005 been employing multilayered system of checks that most prominently includes personnel reliability program modeled after that used by the united states the program carefully vets and monitors potential and serving employees at the countrys nuclear facilities with particular emphasis on religious sentiments other aspects

npt as nonnuclear weapon states and it offers official recognition of their nuclear weapons capabilities which exist outside of the international nonproliferation regime during the latter years of the clinton administration the united states set forth nonproliferation benchmarks for pakistan and india including halting further nuclear testing and signing and ratifying the comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt halting fissile material production and pursuing fissile material control treaty negotiations refraining from deploying nuclear weapons and testing ballistic missiles and restricting any and all exportation of nuclear materials or technologies the results of us efforts were mixed at best and neither pakistan nor india are signatories to the ctbt or the npt the bush administration quickly set aside the benchmark framework however concerns about onward proliferation fears that pakistan could become destabilized by the usled counterterrorism efforts in afghanistan and concern

1989 tensions were extremely high in the wake of the kargil conflict of 1999 when an incursion by pakistani soldiers led to bloody sixweeklong battle throughout 2000 and 2001 crossborder firing and shelling caused scores of both military and civilian deaths july 2001 pakistanindia summit meeting failed to produce even joint statement reportedly due to pressure from hardli ners on both sides major stumbling blocks were indias refusal to acknowledge the centrality of kashmir to future talks and pakistans objection to references to crossborder terrorism

jammu and kashmir state assembly building later that month was followed by december assault on the indian parliament in new delhi both incidents were blamed on pakistanbased terrorist groups india mobilized some 700000 troops along the pakistanindia frontier and threatened war unless islamabad ended all crossborder infiltration of islamic militants this action triggered corresponding pakistani military mobilization under significant international diplomatic pressure and likely also the threat of indias use of force president musharraf in january 2002 gave landmark address in which he vowed to end the presence of terrorist entities on pakistani soil and he outlawed five militant groups including those most often named in attacks in india lashkaretaiba and jaishe mohammed 259 despite the pakistani pledge infiltrations into indianheld kashmir continued and may 2002 terrorist attack on an indian army base at kaluchak killed 34 most of them women and children this event again brought pakistan and india to the brink of fullscale war and caused islamabad to recall army troops from patrol operations along the pakistanafghanistan border intensive international diplomatic missions to

coolingoff period hand of friendship offer to pakistan by the indian prime minister in april 2003 led to the restoration of full diplomatic relations yet surging separatist violence that summer contributed to an exchange of sharp rhetoric between pakistani and indian leaders at the united nations casting doubt on the nascent peace effort new confidencebuilding initiative got pakistan and india back on positive track and november 2003 ceasefire was initiated after proposal by pakistani prime minister zk jamali president musharraf later suggested that pakistan might be willing to set aside its longstanding demand for plebiscite in kashmir proposal welcomed by the united states but called disastrous shift in policy by pakistani opposition parties although militant infiltration did not end new delhi acknowledged that it was significantly decreased and combined with other confidencebuilding measures relations were sufficiently improved that the indian prime minister attended january 2004 summit meeting of the south asian association for regional cooperation in islamabad there pakistan and india issued joint islamabad declaration calling for renewed composite dialogue to bring about peaceful settlement of all bilateral issues including jammu and kashmir to the satisfaction of both sides 261 major confidencebuilding development came in april 2005 when new bus service was launched linking muzaffarabad in pakistani kashmir and srinagar in indian kashmir and summit meeting produced an agreement to addr ess the kashmir issue in forward looking manner for final settlement still many kashmiris reject any settlement process that excludes them even as the normalization of indiapakistan relations moves forwardand likely in reaction to their apparent marginalization in the face of this developmentseparatist militants have continued their attacks and many observers in both india and the united states believe support for kashmiri militants remains pakistani state policy yet many indicators show positive long term trends steadily reduced rates of infiltration may be attributed to the endurance of the pakistanindia dialogue moreover president musharraf made notable efforts to exhibit flexibility including late 2006 statements that pakistan is against independence for kashmir and his offering of fourpoint proposal that would lead to selfgovernance falling between autonomy and independence 262 this was seen by many analysts as being roughly in line with new delhis kashmir position indeed the indian prime minister welcomed musharrafs proposals prospects for governmenttogovernment accommodation may thus be improved however political and security crises in pakistan slowed the process in 2007 following the seating of new

countrys land area but only 5 of its population the us military has made use of bases in the region to support its operations in neighboring afghanistan the province is the proposed setting for pipeline that would deliver iranian natural gas to both pakistan and india project which if brought to fruition could bring hundreds of millions of dollars in annual transit fees to islamabads national treasury but conflict in baluchistan reduces the appeal to investors of building pipeline across the province the presence in baluchistan of jundallah transborder militant group that claims to fight on behalf of baloch rights has caused friction between islamabad and tehran more broadly such problems raise serious questions about pakistans internal stability and national cohesion 263 over the decades of pakistani independence many of the ethnic baloch and some of the pashtun tribes who inhabit this relatively poor and underdeveloped province have engaged in armed conflict with federal government forces variously seeking more equitable returns on the regions rich natural resources greater autonomy under the countrys federal system or even outright independence and formation of baloch state that might include ethnic brethren and some territories of both afghanistan and iran nonbaloch mostly punjabis have been seen to benefit disproportionately from provincial mineral and energy extraction projects and indigenous baloch were given only small role in the construction of major new port at gwadar many baloch thus complain of being marginalized group in their own homeland longstanding resentments sparked armed conflicts in 1948 1958 and 1973 the latter insurrection which lasted four years involved tens of thousands of armed guerillas and brought much destruction to the province it was put down only after major effort by the pakistan army which made use of combat helicopters provided by iran some 8000 rebels and pakistani soldiers were killed

baluchistan army camp during visit to the site by president musharraf baloch separatist group claimed responsibility and the pakistani military began major offensive operations to destroy the militants camps in the midst of increasingly heavy fighting in january 2006 musharraf openly accused india of arming and financing militants fighting in baluchistan new delhi categorically rejected

spurred major unrest across the province and beyond with hundreds of arrests in the midst of largescale street demonstrations bugtis killing was criticized across the spectrum of pakistani politicians and analysts with some commentators calling it pakistani army miscue of historic proportions264 days of rioting included numerous deaths and injuries but the more dire predictions of spreading unrest and perhaps even the disintegration of pakistans federal system did not come to pass by october 2006 pakistans interior minister wa s claiming normalization and decrease in violence in baluchistan although lowintensity insurgency continued and the overarching problem remained unresolved 265 president musharraf called baloch rebels miscreants and terrorists the islamabad government officially banned the separatist baluchistan liberation army as terrorist organization in 2006 and at times suggests that baloch militants are religious extremists yet most rebel attacks are taken against military and infrastructure targets anddespite an apparent government campaign to link the two movementsislam appears to play little or role as motive for baloch militancy 266 pakistans new civilian dispensation has undertaken some efforts to peacefully resolve the baluchistan dispute in may 2008 the islamabad government freed baloch nationalist leader and former provincial chief minister akthar mengal who had been imprisoned for two years the move was seen as peace gesture toward the troubled province yet major mid2008 skirmishes between baloch militants and security forces left several dozen people dead and subsequent reports suggest that the government has failed to keep promises made to the baloch people dashing expectations and leaving the troubled province even less secure 267

impression in pakistan is that america wants war 278 pew poll taken shortly before pakistans catastrophic october 2005 earthquake found only 23 of pakistanis expressing favorable view of the united

has asked religious leaders to help isolate these by openly condemning them 286 global attention to pakistans religious schools intensified during the summer of 2005 after pakistani officials

to crack down on the more extremist madrassas in his country there continues to be little concrete evidence that it has done so287 some observers speculate that president musharrafs alleged reluctance to enforce reform efforts was rooted in his desire to remain on good terms with pakistans islamist political parties which were seen to be an important part of his political base288 when asked in late 2007 about progress in reforming the countrys madrassa system musharraf made rare admission of lack of achievement but went on to call the registration campaign and efforts to mainstream the

especially among those analysts who view representative government in islamabad as being prerequisite for reducing religious extremism and establishing moderate pakistani state there had been hopes that the october 2002 national elections would reverse pakistans historic trend toward unstable governance and military interference in democratic institutions such hopes were eroded by ensuing developments including president musharrafs imposition of major constitutional changes and his retention of the position of army chief international and pakistani human rights groups continued to issue reports critical of islamabads militarydominated government throughout the musharrafdominated era in 2008 and for the ninth straight year the oftencited freedom house rated pakistan as not free

general musharrafs assumption of the presidency ostensibly was legitimized by controversial april 2002 referendum marked by evidence of fraud292 in august 2002 musharraf announced sweeping constitutional changes to bolster the presidents powers including provisions for presidential dissolution of the national assembly the united states expressed concerns that the changes could make it more difficult to build democratic institutions in pakistan the 2002 elections nominally fulfilled musharrafs promise to restore the national assembly that was dissolved in the wake of his extraconstitutional seizure of power the promilitary pmlq party won plurality of seats while coalition of islamist parties made surprisingly strong showing the civilian government was hamstrung for more than year by fractious debate over the legitimacy of constitutional changes and by musharrafs continued status as army chief and president surprise december 2003 agreement between musharraf and the mma islamist opposition ended the deadlock by bringing the constitutional changes before parliament and by eliciting promise from musharraf to resign his military commission before 2005

deference to president musharraf musharraf shuffled prime ministers to seat his close ally finance minister shaukat aziz aziz was seen to be an able financial manager and technocrat favored by the military but he had political base in pakistan in the final month of 2004 musharraf chose to continue his role as army chief beyond the stated deadline moreover nominally nonparty 2005 municipal elections saw major gains for candidates favored by the pmlq and notable reversals for islamists but were also marked by widespread accusations of rigging the bush administration made public comment on reported irregularities one senior pakistani scholar offered critical summary of the countrys political circumstances under president musharrafs rule the musharraf model of governance is narrow and suffers from crisis of legitimacy its major features are concentration of po wer in the presidency with backup from its armyintelligence and bureaucratic affiliates induction of retired and serving military officers into important civilian institutions and thus an undermining of the latters autonomy cooption of section of the political elite who are given share of power and patronage in return for mobilizing civilian support on president musharrafs terms reluctant partnership with the islamic parties especially the mma and softpeddling towards islamic groups and manipulation of the weak and divided political forces and exclusion of dissident political leaders 293 many analysts have opined that despite being selfprofessed enlightened moderate musharraf in practice strengthened the hand of pakistans islamist extremist forces and that despite rhetoric about liberalizing pakistani society his choice of political allies suggested he was not serious 294 in the meantime the pakistan army fu rther entrenched itself in the countrys corporate sector generating billions of dollars in annual profits from businesses ranging from construction to breakfast cereal one estimate has this milbus military business accounting for fully 6 of the countrys gross domestic product295 some observers argue that much of the criticism leveled at president musharraf was unfair and that he had been relatively benign military dictator such analyses will for example point out that musharrafs policies visàvis india allowed for reduction of bilateral tensions and an ongoing peace dialogue that he appeared to have an extent clamped down on kashmiri militancy and that he did not come under fire for corruption as did bhutto and other civilian leaders296 during their years of marginalization the leadership of the countrys leading moderate secular and arguably most popular partythe pakistan peoples partysought greater us support for pakistani democratization and warned that the space in which

while the united states maintains keen interest in pakistani democratization the issue was widely seen as having become secondary consideration as counterterrorism concerns grew after 2001 as stated by assistant secretary of state boucher in december 2007 statement before senate panel the united states wants to see pakistan succeed in its transition to an elected civilianled democracy to become moderate democratic muslim nation committed to human rights and the rule of law all of our assistance pr ograms are directed toward helping pakistan achieve these goals this is longterm undertaking that will require years to accomplish299 bush administration officials repeatedly have emphasized that democratization is key to the creation of more moderate and prosperous pakistan however many critics of administration policy assert that the islamabad government was for more than five years given free pass on the issue of representative government in part as means of enlisting that countrys continued assistance in usled counterterrorism efforts300 us congressional committees long expressed concern with the slow pace of the democratic development of pakistan srept 10996 and the lack of progress on improving democratic governance and rule of law there hrept 109 486 secretary of state rice argued that str ong us support for pakistans democratization process has been very well kept secret and she rejected as untrue claims that the us supported military government in islamabad without attention to democracy301 many commentators criticized the bush administrations perceived overemphasis on relations with president musharraf and the pakistani military at the expense of positive ties with the broader pakistan society as articulated by scholar who would later become

overall us policy toward pakistan until very recently gave serious attention to encouraging democracy in pakistan numerous other former us officials have opined that the bush administrations

political figures in islamabad warned that unconditional us support for musharrafs military dominated government contributed to an antiamerican backlash among pakistans moderate forces yet others

sanctioned by the state according to the department of state the islamabad government is known to limit freedoms of association religion and movement and to imprison political leaders the departments most recent country report on human rights practices issued march 2008 determined that the human rights situation in pakistan worsened during 2007 due primarily to president musharrafs sixweeklong imposition of emergency powers and the attendant suspension of the constitution and dismissal of supreme and high provincial courts along with concerns about these antidemocratic practices the report lists extrajudicial killings torture and disappearances widespread government and police corruption lack of judicial independence political violence terrorism and extremely poor prison conditions among the major problems 305 the most recent state department report on trafficking in persons issued june 2008 again said pakistan does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking however it is making significant efforts to do so it again placed pakistan at tier 2 due to islamabads limited efforts to combat trafficking in persons over the last year particularly in the area of law enforcement306 in june 2007 the house appropriations committee hrept 110197 expressed concern about the pakistani governments apparent lack of respect for human rights senate reports have aired similar concerns the human rights commission of pakistan and international human rights groups regularly issue reports critical of pakistans lack of political freedoms lawlessness in many areas especially the western tribal agencies and of the countrys perceived abuses of the rights of women and minorities for example in reviewing the countrys human rights circumstances the

hudood ordinance promulgated during the rule of president general zia ulhaq is widely criticized for imposing stringent punishments and restrictions under the guise of islamic law among its provisions the ordinance criminalizes all extramarital sex and makes it extremely difficult for women to prove allegations of rape those women who make such charges without the required evidence often are jailed as adulterers in 2006 the hudood laws were amended in the womens protection act president musharraf supported the changes and the ruling pmlq party joined with the opposition ppp to overcome fierce resistance by islamist parties the step was viewed as landmark in efforts to create more moderate pakistani state however in 2008 the state department while acknowledging that the womens protection act had improved conditions noted that rape domestic violence and abuse against women such as honor crimes and discriminatory legislation that affected women remain serious problems reported acts of

excessive spending without sufficient revenue enhancement efforts325 serious environmental degradation also retards growth 2007 world bank report conservatively estimated that at least 6 of pakistans gdp is lost to illness and premature mortality caused by air pollution both outdoor and indoor diseases caused by inadequate water supplies sanitation and hygiene and reduced agricultural productivity due to soil degradation 326 attempts at macroeconomic reform historically have floundered due to political instability but the musharraf government had notable successes in effecting such reform

assistance efforts and large amounts of external aid flowing into the country according to the asian development banks outlook 2008 improved economic fundamentals have enhanced the resilience of the economy and helped it absorb shocks including higher global oil prices and 2005s devastating earthquake but growth has generated heavy imbalance in the external current account which could affect economic momentum the current account deficit has been financed largely by strong incoming foreign investment external sources have also been employed increasingly to finance the fiscal deficit issues of longterm sustainability therefore arise especially in context of high global oil and commodity prices and domestic political uncertainties 327 2008 report from the world bank urged major efforts to strengthen pakistans water power and transport infrastructure finding that major inefficiencies were costing the country several percentage points in economic growth each year even as the bulk of

are not sustainable he also faults islamabad for maintaining weak regulatory stru cture that has not constrained private sector expansion nor regulated emerging monopolies thus spurring sharp price

contend that many of the stated institutional and development goals of us assistance to pakistan remain largely unmet in part due to perceived us overreliance on securityrelated aid one major study found that only about onetenth of us aid was being directed toward development governance and humanitarian programs354 for numerous pakistanwatchers policy of enhanced cooperation and structured inducements is viewed as likely to be more effective than policy based on pressure and threats 355 many argue that it could be useful to target us assistance programs in such way that they more effectively and more directly benefit the countrys citizens some analysts call for improving americas image in pakistan by making us aid more visible to ordinary pakistanis356 costly downside of the perceived focus on securityrelated aid is that it can empower illiberal forces in pakistan namely the countrys military and intelligence agencies which are seen to have stunted the growth and development of democratic institutions and the rule of law one idea commonly floated by analysts is the conditioning of aid to pakistan perhaps through the creation of benchmarks for example in 2003 task force of senior american south asia watchers issued report on us policy in the region that included recommendation that the extent of us support for islamabad should be linked to that governments own performance in making pakistan more modern progressive and democratic state specifically the task force urged directing twothirds of us aid to economic programs and onethird to security assistance and conditioning increases in aid amounts to progress in pakistans reform agenda 357 some commentators emphasize that to be truly effective conditionality should be applied by many donor countries rather than just the united states and should be directed toward the pakistani leadershipespecially the militaryto the exclusion of the general public358 in the wake of political crises and

further us assistance in lieu of improvements in these areas359 many analysts however including those making policy for the bush administration contend that conditioning us aid to pakistan has past record of failure and likely would be counterproductive by reinforcing pakistani perceptions of the united states as fickle and unreliable partner from this perspective putting additional pressure on an already weak islamabad government might lead to significant political instability in pakistan 360 one senior washingtonbased analyst who advocates against placing conditions on us aid to pakistan instead offers an admittedly modest and not entirely satisfying approach that would modify current us policy through more forceful private admonitions to islamabad to better focus its own counterterrorism efforts while also targeting taliban leadership increased provision of us counterinsurgency technologies and training to pakistani security forces and the establishment of benchmarks for continued provision of coalition support funding 361 private admonitions are considered by some analysts to be meaningless in the absence of public consequences however for pakistanis themselves aid conditionality in us congressional legislation can raise unpleasant memories of 1985s pressler amendment which led to neartotal aid cutoff in 1990 islamabads sensitivities are thus acute in 2007 the pakistan foreign ministry said aid conditions legislated in the implementing the 911 commission recommendations act of 2007 pl 11053 cast shadow on existing uspakistan cooperation and create linkages that did not serve the interest of bilateral cooperation in the past and can prove to be detrimental in the future 362 calls for further conditionality from some in congress led islamabad to again warn that such moves could harm the bilateral relationship and do damage to us interests nevertheless the state department reported being comfortable with congressional conditions and confident that required reports could be issued 363 analysts have also issued criticisms of the programming of aid to pakistan within the security related portions foremost among these are assertions that the pakistani military maintains an institutional focus on conventional warfighting capabilities oriented toward india and that it has used us security assistance to bolster these capabilities while paying insufficient attention to the kinds of counterinsurgency capacity that us policy makers might prefer to see strengthened for example of the nearly 16 billion in foreign military financing provided to pakistan from fy2002fy2008 more than half has been used by islamabad to purchase weapons of limited use in the context of counterterrorism these include maritime patrol aircraft antiarmor missiles surveillance radars upgrade kits for f16 combat aircraft and selfpropelled howitzers counterarguments contend that such purchases facilitate regional stability and allow pakistan to feel more secure visàvis india its more powerful neighbor 359 see for example senate leader wants bush to pressure pakistan reuters january 10 2008 democrat questions us aid to pakistan associated press may 27

government to minimize its footprint when providing aid in certain regions especially the fa ta region bordering afghanistan this has meant that some projects are conducted in ways similar to covert operations under the cover of pakistani government agencies although such an approach facilitates delivery of aid public diplomacy gains can be sacrificed when aid beneficiaries are unaware of the origin of the assistance they are receiving because development of pakistans tribal areas is identified as key us national security goal in and of itself such costs may be considered acceptable instability in pakistan has led to increased calls for more and betterspent us assistance there while support for the bidenlugar plan s 3263 is widespread among analysts some warn that pakistans
