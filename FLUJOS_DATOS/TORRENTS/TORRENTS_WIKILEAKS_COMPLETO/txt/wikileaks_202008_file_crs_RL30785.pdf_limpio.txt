development block grant ccdbg is the primary source of federal funding dedicated solely for child care subsidies for lowincome working and welfare families1 the program is administered by the department of health and human services hhs and provides block grants to states according to formula wh ich are used to subsidize the child care expenses of families with children under age 13 in addition to providing funding for child care services funds are also used for activities intended to improve the overall quality and supply of child care for families in general the ccdbg originally authorized as component of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 was reauthorized in 1996 through 2002 and substantially amended by the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act pl 104193 commonly referred to as welfare reform legislation the ccdbg as amended by the 1996 law also consolidated three federal child care programs previously serving lowincome working and welfare families under the former federal welfare program known as aid to families with dependent children afdc the 1996 law significantly changed federal child care policy by giving states more flexibility to design child care policies for lowincome families the child care provisions in the 1996 law were developed to achieve several purposes as component of welfare reform the child care provisions were intended to support the overall goal of promoting selfsufficiency through work however separate from the context of welfare reform the legislation attempted to address concerns about the effectiveness and efficiency of child care programs the previous four separate child care programs the original ccdbg and the three afdc programs had different rules regarding eligibility time limits on the receipt of assistance and work requirements consistent with other block grant proposals considered back in the 104 th congress the child care provisions in pl 104193 were intended to streamline the federal role reduce the number of federal programs and conflicting rules and increase the flexibility provided to states pl 104193 also created cash welfare block grant called temporary assistance for needy families tanf to replace afdc in addition to amounts provided to states for child care under the ccdbg states are allowed to transfer up to 30 of their tanf block grant into their ccdbg program both the ccdbg and tanf were originally au thorized through fy2002 and for fiscal years 20032005 the mandatory portion of child care funding as well as tanf funding were continued at the fy2002 rates through series of temporary extensions mandatory child care and tanf funding for fy20062010 was eventually included as part of budget spending reconciliation bill s 1932 109 th congress and signed into law pl 109171 on february 8 2006 funding for the discretionary portion of the ccdbg has been appropriated without an authorization through the annual appropriations process each year since fy2002 federal funding levels for child care assistance have been and continue to be source of debate in the context of increased work requirements for single welfare mothers

childhood education and care remain active concerns of congress g9g152g138g149g156g561 the 1996 law established five goals for the ccdbg they include allowing states maximum flexibility in developing their child care programs promoting parental choice encouraging states to provide consumer education information to parents helping states provide child care to parents trying to become independent of public assistance and helping states implement health safety licensing and registration standards established in state regulations g3g141g150g146g151g146g156g157g155g138g157g146g152g151g561 at the

child care funding provisions was passed into law pl 109171 the law provides 2917 billion annually for each of fiscal years 20062010 the secretary must reserve between 1 and 2 of entitlement funds for payments to indian tribes and tribal organizations after this amount is reserved remaining entitlement funds are allocated to states in two components first each state receives fixed amount each year equal to the funding received by the state under the child care programs previously authorized under afdc in fy1994 or fy1995 or the average of fy1992fy1994 whichever is greater this amount equals 12 billion each year and is sometimes referred to as guaranteed mandatory funds state match is required for these funds which may remain available for expenditure by states with fiscal year limitation second remaining entitlement funds following distribution of the guaranteed portion and up to the total amounts listed above are allocated to states according to each states share of children under age 13 states must meet maintenanceofeffort and matching requirements to receive these funds specifically states must spend all of their guaranteed federal entitlement funds for child care described above plus 100 of the amount they spent of their own state funds in fy1994 or fy1995 whichever is higher under the previous afdcrelated child care programs further states must provide matching funds at the medicaid matching rate to receive these additional entitlement funds for child care if the secretary determines that state will not spend its entire allotment for given fiscal year then the unused amounts may be redistributed among other states according to those states share of children under age 13 beginning in fy1997 the treatment of ccdbg funding in the appropriations process was changed to reflect states actual obligation of money for the program prior to fy1997 the funds appropriated for the ccdbg only became available for obligation by the states in the last month of the year in which they were appropriated as result most of given years appropriation was actually obligated during the next fiscal year with the enactment of the fy1997 appropriations law that practice was changed so that the ccdbg was officially advance funded by an entire year in other words the fy1997 appropriation became available for obligation at the beginning of fy1998 rather than the end of fy1997 as result of this change only 19 million was appropriated in fy1997 specifically for fy1997 this amount was added to funds previously appropriated and available for obligation at the end of fy1996 the bulk of the fy1997 appropriation937 millionwas to become available in fy1998 this practice of advance funding continued in fy1999fy2001 and is shown in table 1 t able 1 funding t r ends in

states that children eligible for services under the ccdbg are those whose family income does not exceed 85 of the state median however states have the discretion to adopt income eligibility limits

families who are receiving public assistance under tanf families who are trying to become independent of tanf through work activities and families who are at risk of becoming dependent on public assistance in their state plans states must demonstrate how they will meet the specific child care needs of these families of their remaining child care funds including discretionary funds states must
