provisions in budget reconciliation updated october 18 2006 emilie stoltzfus specialist in social legislation domestic social policy division congressional research service the library of congress child welfare foster care and adoption assistance provisions in budget reconciliation summary on february 8 2006 president bush signed the deficit reduction act of 2005 into law pl 109171 as enacted the deficit reduction act includes two child welfare provisions intended to reduce federal foster care spending under title ive of the social security act those provisions sometimes called the rosales provision and candidates provision respectively would 1 clarify individual eligibility for federal foster care and adoption assistance programs title ive of the social security act and 2 limit certain kinds of state claims for federal reimbursement of administrative costs under the federal foster care program the congressional budget office cbo estimated that together these changes will reduce federal spending under the foster care program by 554 million over five years and by almost 13 billion over 10 years as enacted the deficit reduction act also includes several child welfare provisions that will increase federal child welfare spending and make other limited changes to federal child welfare policy these provisions were added during conference negotiations and were not included in either of the earlier senate or house versions of the budget reconciliation bill s 1932 that passed in november 2005 those provisions 1 increase the fy2006 mandatory funding authorization under the promoting safe and stable families program title ivb subpart 2 of the social security act to 345 million from current 305 million 2 appropriate 100 million in mandatory funds over five years fy2006fy2010 to improve state courts handling of child welfare proceedings 3 require court and child welfare agency collaboration and 4 clarify confidentiality rules with regard to open child welfare court proceedings cbo estimated that the first two of these provisions will increase federal budget authority for child welfare purposes by 300 million over five years as enacted the deficit reduction act also includes provisions related to federal reimbursement of costs for targeted case management tcm under the medicaid program title xix of the social security act these provisions were included in both the house and senate reconciliation bills as they were passed in november 2005 and may limit the ability of state child welfare agencies to use medicaid tcm for children in foster care cbo estimated the net federal savings for this change all of which would be to medicaid and not all of which would affect financing of services for children in foster care at 760 million over five years and 21 billion over 10 years finally as enacted the deficit reduction act does not include house and senate proposals that would have 1 extended the authority of the us department of health and human services hhs to grant child welfare waivers 2 amended the higher education act to improve higher education access for youth leaving foster care and 3 authorized discretionary student loan forgiveness

february 8 2006 president bush signed the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 the bill was cleared for the presidents signature earlier that month after the house voted to accept the changes made by the senate in december 2005 to previously agreedupon conference agreement hrept 109362 primary purpose of budget reconciliation is to make statutory changes that reduce direct or mandatory spending out of the federal treasury1 the largest child welfare programs receive mandatory federal funding and certain changes to these programs would be made by the deficit reduction act of 2005 some of these were initially provided for only in the house version of the reconciliation bill and some were in neither the initial senate nor house version of the reconciliation legislation s 1932 as it was passed in november 2005 these were added during the december 2005 conference agreement negotiations the federal foster care and adoption assistance programs are openended entitlement programs this means that the statutory language contained in title iv of the social security act commits the federal government to reimbursing states for every eligible claim submitted on behalf of an eligible child receiving foster care maintenance payments or an adoption assistance subsidy because of the openended nature of this mandatory spending any statutory changes that redefine who is eligible to receive foster care or adoption assistance or what kind of costs state may submit as eligible for reimbursement should have direct effect on the level of federal spending in the program in fy2004 the most recent data available federal spending on the foster care and adoption assistance programs combined was approximately 61 billion the federal promoting safe and stable families program title ivb subpart 2 of the social security act provides capped mandatory funds and also authorizes discretionary funds for states to offer services aimed at maintaining or reuniting families and promoting and supporting adoption setaside from the programs funding is used for grants intended to help state courts assess and improve their handling of child welfare proceedings for fy2005 mandatory funding of 305 million for the safe and stable program was increased by discretionary funding of 986 million for total program funding of 404 million 1 for more information on the budget reconciliation process see crs report rl33132 budget reconciliation legislation in 2005 by robert keith crs2 the rosales provision or clarifying eligibility for federal foster care and adoption assistance as proposed by the president in his fy2006 budget request and included in the house reconciliation bill hr 42412 the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109 171 as enacted rewrites the eligibility provisions for federal foster care under title ive of the social security act it also made related changes to the adoption assistance eligibility provisions also contained in title ive this change is sometimes called the rosales provision because as intended it makes moot 9th circuit us court of appeals decision rosales v thompson 321 f 3d 835 the congressional budget office cbo estimates that this provision will reduce federal outlays to the foster care program by 380 million over five years fy2006fy2010 and 863 million over 10 years fy2006fy20153 the senate did not include the rosales provision in the reconciliation legislation it approved in early november however after an effort on the senate floor by senator conrad to strike this language from the final conference agreement failed the provision remained in the conference agreement approved in both chambers and was enacted in pl 1091714 explanation of the change this provision of pl 109171 restates eligibility for federal foster care in manner intended to clarify the longstanding interpretation of those provisions by the us department of health and human services hhs and thus to effectively overturn 2003 court decision that disagreed with that interpretation changes to the adoption assistance eligibility criteria were made to conform with those foster care changes and to somewhat simplify the eligibility test as included in the enacted legislation the change does not prohibit payment of foster care maintenance payments to foster children living with 2 throughout this report the version of the reconciliation bill as it passed the house on november 18 2005 is referred to as hr 4241 this is done as an easy way to distinguish that bill from the budget reconciliation legislation that passed the senate on november 3 2005 and was number s 1932 technically however as part of preparing for the conference on these bills the house adopted the provisions of hr 4241 in their own version of s 1932 and thus the conference report refers to an agreement on differing versions of s 1932 3 outlays measure the amount of money the federal government is expected to pay out in the given years whether the obligation to make the payment was incurred in the current or previous fiscal year the cbo may also estimate budget authority or the amount of money the law authorizes to be spent on given program in the current or future fiscal year the cbo budget authority savings estimate for this provision is 410 million over five years and 895 million over 10 years 4 congressional record december 21 2005 p s140202s140206 senator conrad sought to use provision of the congressional budget act commonly called the bryd rule which allows senator to use point of order to seek to remove any extraneous provisions in reconciliation bill such extraneous provisions may include those that produce change in federal spending that is merely incidental to nonbudgetary aspects of the provision in this particular case the senate parliamentarian apparently found that the budgetary impact of the rosales provision was more than merely incidental to the legislative change see congressional budget act section 313b1d crs3 grandparents however it may make it less likely that children who lived with non parent relative before they were formally brought into foster care and who are in one of the 9th circuit states will be eligible for federal foster care assistance eligibility for title ive foster care and adoption assistance is multifaceted but with limited exceptions for adoption assistance includes link to the income deprivation and resources tests as they were included in states aid to families with dependent children afdc program as that program existed on july 16 1996 congress repealed the afdc program as part of the 1996 welfare reform legislation that became pl 104193 hhs has historically maintained that the afdc income deprivation and resource tests must determine whether or not foster child was or would have been considered needy if that child had still been living in the home from which he or she was removed for safety reasons generally the home of the biological parents however this hhs interpretation of how to apply the afdc eligibility tests was challenged in california and in march 2003 the 9th circuit court of appeals rosales v thompson 321 f 3d 835 ruled against hhs the 9th circuit court interpreted the law to permit in some instances state to determine whether foster child would have met the afdc tests while living in the home of relative instead of in the home of the parent eg grandmother or aunt who informally cared for the child because the parents were unfit or unwilling under afdc program rules child living with nonparent relative is virtually always considered needy because the afdc income resource and other tests are applied only to the child this means that whether the nonparent relative is very wealthy or very poor is not consideration in determining childs eligibility for federal foster care assistance only the childs personal income is considered therefore this reading of the law permits expanded eligibility for federal title ive foster care assistance if child lived with nonparent relative before being formally placed in foster care provided the child lives in 9th circuit state5 hhs chose not to appeal the decision of the 9th circuit instead it notified the nine states in the 9th circuit alaska arizona california hawaii idaho montana nevada oregon and washington that they should amend their title ive state plans to follow the eligibility logic of the rosales decision at the same time hhs notified all other states that they must continue to determine title ive foster care eligibility based on the traditional hhs reading of the law finally the department sought statutory change to bolster its longstanding interpretation of title ive foster care and adoption assistance eligibility rules and to restore their uniform application in all states effect of provision all states in the 9th circuit have amended their state title ive plans to provide for expanded title ive foster care eligibility as permitted by the rosales decision enactment of the statutory eligibility clarifications in the deficit reduction act however means that states will have to 5 subsequently the us district court for the northern district of georgia in ruling that cited the rosales decision harris v martin 2004 us dist lexis 17384 held that the hhs interpretation of how the afdc test should be applied was also too restrictive for determining adoption assistance eligibility crs4 redo those plans again because children entering foster care in the 9th circuit states are again required to meet the eligibility criteria currently used in all states outside the 9th circuit6 in june 2006 hhs issued an information memorandum that permits 9th circuit states to continue to make title ive foster claims for children who were federally eligible solely because of the rosales definition of eligibility only until the annual redetermination of that childs title ive foster care eligibility in addition those states may longer apply the rosales eligibility criteria for children entering foster care instead all children must now qualify under the more narrow eligibility criteria7 accordingly states in the 9th circuit may see decline in the share of children in their caseloads for whom they may receive federal reimbursement for foster care costs these states would then need to support larger share of foster care children using state dollars only or possibly some other capped source of federal funding such as the temporary assistance to needy families or tanf block grant the exact effect of this provision in each of the 9th circuit states is unknown8 finally the provisions included in the final budget reconciliation bill pl 109 171 restate certain adoption assistance eligibility requirements to conform with the foster care eligibility clarifications and somewhat simplify the eligibility determination process for adoption assistance prior policy provided that in cases where adoption assistance eligibility rests in some part on afdc eligibility the afdc eligibility criteria must have been met at two points 1 when the child was removed from his or her home and placed in foster care and 2 when adoption proceedings were initiated pl 10971 as had previously been passed by the house hr 4241 would eliminate the second afdc test this change was expected to simplify adoption assistance eligibility determination while having little to effect on the number of children found eligible the candidates provision or limiting eligibility for federal matching of foster care administrative costs as enacted the deficit reduction act pl 109171 will also limit the ability of states to claim federal reimbursement of certain costs related to administering their title ive foster care programs in january 2005 the administration published notice of proposed rulemaking nprm that proposed regulations similar to the 6 see us department of health and human services administration for children and families acyfpi0606 deficit reduction act state plan amendments august 23 2006 httpwwwacfdhhsgovprogramscblaws_policiespolicypipi0606htm 7 us department of health and human services administration for children and families acyfim0602 deficit reduction act rosales june 9 2006 httpwwwacfdhhs govprogramscblaws_policiespolicyimim0602htm 8 california is the only state where retroactive claims under this decision were permitted the state submitted additional rosalesrelated claims for 19982003 that totaled 97 million in federal expenditures other than these retroactive claims additional claims made eligible under the rosales decision are not reported separately by the affected states for discussion of estimated effects of the rosales provision on states in the 9th circuit request crs congressional distribution memorandum estimated effect of the rosales provision by state by emilie stoltzfus crs5 statutory changes included in pl 1091719 those statutory changes were included in the house budget reconciliation bill hr 4241 but were not part of the reconciliation bill that passed the senate in november in sum this provision puts in statute definition of candidate for foster care that is more narrow than previous hhs policy and which consequently limits the ability of states to receive federal reimbursement for foster care administrative costs made on behalf of certain children cbo estimated that these provisions will reduce federal outlays for the title ive foster care program by 174 million over five years fy2006fy2010 and 405 million over 10 years fy2006fy2015 explanation of the change under current law states are permitted to seek federal reimbursement 50 match for any eligible administrative costs necessary for the proper and efficient operation of their foster care programs among other things title ive administrative costs are defined to include payment for time spent by social worker finding and making foster care placement as well as ensuring that the childs placement setting and permanency goal eg reuniting with family or adoption are reviewed at federally specified intervals and that other federal case review protections are afforded each child in foster care in general these administrative costs may only be reimbursed if the child on whose behalf the costs are incurred meets the federal title ive eligibility requirements for foster care maintenance payments those eligibility requirements include stipulation that the foster child must be living in family home or other eligible child care institution that is licensed by the state to provide foster care however some states previously made title ive administrative claims only for costs incurred on behalf of children who meet all of the title ive foster care eligibility requirements except that they are placed in an unlicensed setting this kind of administrative claim was specifically permitted by 1993 memorandum from hhs which suggests that these children could be considered candidates for title ive foster care because the possibility existed that they might be moved to an eligible setting10 more recently however hhs argued that the 1993 memorandum was too broadly interpreted and that parts of it are inconsistent with the statute specifically hhs asserted that child already placed in foster care may never be considered candidate for foster care in the january 2005 nprm however the administration conceded that complete prohibition on title ive administrative claims for placement of otherwise eligible foster children in homes of unlicensed relatives might be contrary to the 9 us department of health and human services administration for children and families administrative costs for children in title ive foster care 70 federal register 4803 january 31 2005 number of these proposed changes were originally made by the administration as part of policy announcement acyfcbpa0102 issued july 3 2001 after many states objected to the characterization of the changes as clarification arguing that instead they represented reversal of current policy the administration delayed the implementation of the most controversial policies included in that announcement and said that it would use the formal regulatory process to achieve the same end 10 the 1993 memorandum is briefly discussed in acyfcbpa0102 issued july 3 2001 crs6 federal lawpolicy that encourages states to place foster child with relatives further in recognition of the fact that states cannot be expected to have ready pool of relatives licensed to provide foster care hhs proposed to allow continued title ive administrative claims for otherwise eligible children placed in unlicensed relatives homes but only for the length of time it normally takes the state to license foster family home as enacted the deficit reduction act of 2005 adopts this language except that it provides that states may make such claims only for as long as the length of time it normally takes state to license home or up to 12 months whichever is shorter like the nprm the statutory language included in pl 109171 also stipulates one additional instance in which state may continue to make title ive administrative claims but not title ive maintenance payments on behalf of an otherwise eligible foster care child placed in an ineligible setting these administrative claims may be made on behalf of child placed temporarily in setting such as juvenile detention home or certain psychiatric hospitals ineligible settings under title ive but only for one calendar month and only if the child is subsequently moved back to an eligible setting finally the changes included in pl 109171 restate current title ive administrative claims policy which permits states to make claims on behalf of children who are not yet in foster care but who are considered at imminent risk of removal from their homes such children are now considered by hhs as true candidates for foster care and in need of preplacement services required under title ive to prevent their removal from their homes however the new law as proposed in hr 4241 and the nprm newly provides that in order to make these title ive administrative claims the state must redetermine less often than every six months childs status as candidate for foster care11 effect of the provision the primary federal savings from this change are expected to come from states reduced ability to make administrative claims for children placed in unlicensed relatives homes states that previously made such claims on an indefinite basis now need to use state funds to meet these administrative costs or to license relatives homes in which case they will be able to continue to claim federal matching funds for administrative costs and will also be able to claim federal matching funds for their foster care maintenance payments states and some child welfare advocates argue that many relatives do not wish to subject themselves to the governmental intrusion necessary to receive foster care license all foster family home licensing requirements are established and maintained by state authorities and typically include requirements related to the physical and family environment of home as well as training requirements under current federal child welfare policy states are required to apply the same licensing standards to both relative and nonrelative foster homes however they are permitted but 11 some states have sought to make title ive administrative claims for more general population of children who were not yet placed in foster care however over the past number of years hhs has moved to disallow this kind of title ive claim and in this instance the departments view of true candidates has prevailed see for instance hhs departmental appeals board appellate division decision 1899 november 25 2003 regarding disallowance of title ive administrative claims made by the missouri department of social services crs7 only on casebycase basis to waive given licensing requirement if doing so will not endanger the child eg state may waive requirement that bedroom be of certain size or that foster child have his or her own bedroom the exact number of states affected by this new statutory provision is not known however the degree of impact is expected to vary widely by state in survey of the states conducted by the hhs administration for children and families acf close to half of the states 24 indicated that such policy would have an annual financial impact ranging from 200000 at the low end to 79 million at the highest 15 states indicated there would be little or financial impact and 2 states were uncertain if there would be any impact information was not available from the remaining states total of 16 states responded to survey by the american public human services association aphsa eight states estimated an annual financial impact of 80000 to 20 million two states estimated that the impact could range as high as 21 million to 100 million annually five reported anticipated impact and one reported uncertain impact12 increase mandatory funding for the promoting safe and stable families program the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 increased the fy2006 mandatory funding authorization level for the promoting safe and stable families program to 345 million from the previous level of 305 million if congress appropriates the full mandatory funding level for the program now authorized for fy2006 this money combined with the 89 million in discretionary funds appropriated for the program in fy2006 would bring the programs total fy2006 funding to 434 million13 neither the house nor the senate version of reconciliation legislation proposed this funding increase while the deficit reduction act increased the mandatory funding authorization for fy2006 only under cbo budget scoring rules this higher level of mandatory funding authority is assumed in future baselines thus the fiveyear cost of this provision totaled 200 million further if congress chooses to reauthorize the promoting safe and stable program before its fy2006 expiration mandatory funding 12 these surveys are cited at 70 federal register 4806 january 31 2005 also at the time of the july 2001 policy announcement which would have made changes similar to those included in hr 4241 14 states submitted formal objection to hhs including legal analysis of the proposed policies those states az ca il ia ks mn mo oh sd va wa and wi might be among those that expect to experience loss of federal funds if this legislative change were enacted 13 pl 109149 appropriated 90 million in discretionary funds for the safe and stable program and 305 million in mandatory funds however the discretionary amount will be reduced to an estimated 891 million by the 1 acrosstheboard cut in discretionary accounts required by pl 109148 the provisions regarding fy2006 safe and stable funding in the deficit reduction act do not change the fy2006 discretionary funding available for the program crs8 of 345 million would be available for the program in each fiscal year without scoring additional costs14 grants to strengthen court handling of child welfare proceedings the deficit reduction act also amended the court improvement project authorized under section 438 of the social security act to provide funding for two new grant programs aimed at strengthening the performance of courts on behalf of children who have been abused and neglected these provisions were not included in the house or senate version of the reconciliation bill however grant programs with similar or related purposes were proposed by the bipartisan pew commission on children in foster care in its may 2004 report and in legislation introduced earlier in 2005 s 1679 by senators dewine and rockefeller and hr 3756 by representative schiff the statutory language appropriates 100 million for these grants out of which 10 million is available for each of the two new cip grants in each of fy2006fy2010 purposes of the grants the court improvement program cip previously allowed state highest courts to receive grants to assess and improve their handling of child welfare proceedings generally this grant program is authorized through fy2006 and the deficit reduction act pl 109171 does not extend this authorization15 however under the provisions of pl 109171 for fy2006 fy2010 state highest courts may also choose to apply for separate cip grants aimed at 1 improving their timely and complete action on behalf of foster children via improved data collection and 2 providing training to judges attorneys and other legal personnel in child welfare proceedings applications under the enacted provisions of the deficit reduction act state highest courts are required to apply separately for one or more of these grants and need to meet both general and specific application requirements an application for any of the three grant programs must demonstrate meaningful and ongoing collaboration between the courts the state child welfare agency or any other agency under contract with the state child welfare agency to administer child welfare programs authorized under the social security act and indian tribes where applicable further as is required for receipt of current cip funds in each of the grant applications state highest court must supply any additional information or assurances that hhs chooses to require separately in order to receive funding specifically related to improving timely and complete actions on behalf of children state highest court must include description of how the court and the child welfare agencies on the local and state 14 for more information on this program and reauthorization issues see crs report rl33354 the promoting safe and stable families program reauthorization in the 109th congress by emilie stoltzfus 15 however congress may choose to reauthorize funding for this grant in this session for more information see crs report rl33350 child welfare the court improvement program by emilie stoltzfus crs9 levels jointly plan for the collection and sharing of all relevant data and information and finally state highest courts seeking training funds under the court improvement program must submit an application demonstrating that at least part of the grant funding would be used for crosstraining initiatives jointly planned and carried out with the state child welfare agency or an agency under contract with the state agency to administer child welfare programs funding and state match in addition to the court improvement program funding contained in prior law setaside out of regular promoting safe and stable families funds16 the conference agreement to the deficit reduction act provides 100 million in mandatory funds for court improvement over five years fy2006 fy2010 the two new grants would each be funded at 10 million in each of those years and has been the case with cip grants in the past the state highest court is required to supply at least 25 of the funds used for the purpose of each grant formula and entitlement under prior law each state highest court with an approved application under the cip grant program was entitled to receive minimum grant of 85000 and portion of any of the remaining setaside funds that was equal to its states share of individuals under 21 years of age compared to all states with an approved application for the grant the conference agreement to the deficit reduction act maintains this formula for the prior grant and also applies it to each of the new grants under the cip thus if state highest court successfully applies for all three grants in fy2006 it would receive three minimum allotments of 85000 and share of the remaining funds for each grant program based the size of its population under 21 years of age relative to all states whose highest court has an approved applications for each of the grants requirement to demonstrate collaboration between courts and agencies in child welfare programs the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 requires as condition of eligibility for funding under the child welfare services program title ivb subpart 1 of the social security act that state demonstrate substantial ongoing and meaningful collaboration with state courts in developing and implementing the state plan for child welfare services the state plan for the promoting safe and stable families program title ivb subpart 2 of the social security act the state adoption assistance and foster care plan under title ive of the social security act and any program improvement plan17 that may be required this provision was not initially included in either the house or senate versions of the reconciliation legislation but was proposed by the bipartisan pew commission on children in 16 current law authorizes through fy2006 court improvement setaside of 10 million out of the mandatory safe and stable funding plus 33 of any discretionary funds appropriated for that program in fy2005 little more than 13 million was made available for the court improvement program 17 program improvement plan pip must be developed and implemented by state if federal review of that states child welfare practice via the child and family services review cfsr indicates that the state is not in substantial conformity with all of federal child welfare policy crs10 foster care in its may 2004 report further legislation introduced in 2005 s 1679 by senators dewine and rockefeller sought similar legislative changes use of child welfare records in court proceedings the deficit reduction act also amends the state plan requirements for foster care and adoption assistance section 471 in title ive of the social security act to clarify that required confidentiality provisions related to information about the children served do not limit the ability of state to determine its policies regarding public access to court proceedings on child abuse and neglect or other child welfare related court proceedings except that the policies must at minimum ensure the safety and wellbeing of the child parents and family this provision was not included in either the senate or house version of the reconciliation bill but it is consistent with similar clarifying language added to the child abuse prevention and treatment act capta in 200318 and is substantively identical to language introduced this year in the senate s 1679 by senators dewine and rockefeller targeted case management services under medicaid the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 includes statutory language previously included in both the house and senate versions of the reconciliation bill that intends to clarify when states may make medicaid claims related to optional targeted case management tcm services the statutory clarification extends to claims made on behalf of any medicaideligible individual who may also be served by another federal or state program eg juvenile justice foster care or special education but it provides special details regarding unallowable claims on behalf of medicaideligible foster care children the newly enacted law further provides that hhs must issue formal regulations to implement this clarification neither the house nor senate version of the reconciliation bill required hhs to issue regulations the administration called for clarification with regard to tcm claims in its fy2006 budget request and in legislative language it later sent to congress for consideration however the language included in the pl 109171 is significantly different from that offered by the administration and it appears to be less restrictive to state tcm claims cbo estimated that the changes will shift some costs to the federal foster care program increasing federal title ive foster care spending by 350 million over five years fy2006fy2010 and 940 million over 10 years fy2006fy2015 this increased foster care spending would offset savings to the medicaid program the net federal savings are consequently estimated at 760 million over the same five years fy2006fy2010 and 21 billion over 10 years fy2006 fy201519 18 the amendment was made by the keeping children and families safe act pl 10836 19 the administration estimated savings to medicaid of 20 billion over five years for its proposal to limit tcm claims in addition it estimated savings of 1 billion over five years from proposed reduction in the federal matching rate for tcm services this matching rate reduction was not included in either the house or senate reconciliation bill and is not continued crs11 what is medicaid tcm medicaid title xix of the social security act is an openended entitlement to states states may seek federal matching payments for medical assistance offered to medicaideligible individuals children who are eligible for federal foster care title ive eligible are automatically deemed eligible for medicaid and most other foster children nontitle ive eligible are presumed to qualify for medicaid under other lowincome andor disabilityrelated medicaid eligibility criteria further under medicaid law case management is an optional benefit that states may offer medicaid beneficiaries and it includes services to assist them in gaining access to needed medical social education and other services the term targeted case management or tcm refers to situations in which these case management services are not provided statewide to all medicaid beneficiaries but rather are provided only to specific classes of individuals or target groups eg people with aids or those with developmental disabilities children who are abused or neglected or children in foster care for fy2002 across all states the estimated total federal share of tcm expenditures for all targeted groups was 13 billion of which 1715 million was reimbursed on behalf of costs incurred for 165265 foster care children20 states varied widely in the use of tcm services for children in foster care nine states including the district of columbia showed tcm claims for foster care children in fy2002 among the states that did submit medicaid tcm claims for foster care children the estimated federal share was under 1000 in two states more than 1000 but less then 100000 in 11 states and more than 100000 but less than 1 million in 10 states among the remaining 19 states the federal share of tcm claims for foster care children ranged from 11 million in west virginia to 389 million in texas21 explanation of change the prior law definition of tcm was broadly written and there have been conflicting policy directives in regard to how tcm claims may be made on behalf of medicaideligible individuals particularly if an individual might also be able to receive relatedsame services under another state or federal program the provisions included in the deficit reduction act were inteded to enact policies outlined in january 19 2001 letter to state medicaid directors and which was cosigned by federal medicaid and child welfare administrators the policy letter which explicitly addressed only the issue of title ive eligible foster care children and allowable tcm claims has now been written into statute by pl 109171 in way that would address tcm claims for variety of populations including nontitle ive eligible foster care children the provisions however continue to give special attention to foster carerelated claims generally the deficit reduction act pl 109171 provides more detailed definition of tcm that includes assessing persons need for services developing care plan 19 continued in the conference agreement 20 fy2002 medicaid statistical information system msis the definition of foster care children for msis includes children in foster care and those receiving adoption assistance 21 ibid crs12 referring individuals to services and monitoring and followup of service use it reiterates that tcm services do not include reimbursement for any of the underlying services costs eg mental health counseling and further that in the specific case of foster care tcm does not include services that are part of the direct delivery of foster care the legislation like the policy letter it codifies provides illustrative examples of these foster care services research gathering and completion of documentation required by the foster care program assessing adoption placements recruiting or interviewing potential foster parents serving legal papers conducting home investigations providing transportation administering foster care subsidies and making placement arrangements additionally the provisions assert that medicaid can be billed only for case management or tcm where there are other third parties liable to pay for such services including as reimbursement under medical social education or other program finally the statutory language in the enacted legislation pl 109171 stipulates that states may use accepted federal cost allocation methods to ensure costs are appropriately billed to the proper program under the bush administration cms had backed away from the tcm policies in the january 2001 letter and increasingly suggested via denials of state plan amendments seeking to provide tcm services to foster care children or abused and neglected children broadly that the kinds of services provided by medicaid tcm are integral to the foster care program and therefore the financial responsibility of the child welfare agency rather then medicaid effect of this provision this provision of the deficit reduction act asserts that states may allocate costs of medicaid tcm services to children in foster care this is contrary to current cms policy as provided in the state medicaid manual which does not allow states to use cost allocation when making claims related to medicaid services but is in keeping with the january 2001 policy letter on tcm claims for title ive eligible foster care children in this sense the newly enacted language seems to clarify conflicting policy statements in way that supports rather than limits tcm claims for foster care children at the same time the new statutory provision asserts that medicaid may not be billed for tcm services if there is another party liable for the cost of such services including as reimbursement under medical social education or other program exactly how this thirdparty liability language would be implemented which primarily restates general thirdparty liability provisions under current medicaid law is unclear in his brief statement regarding proposed but failed amendment to strike the tcm provisions from the budget reconciliation bill that passed the senate in november 2005 senator reed expressed the concern that the language would force payment for tcm services by third parties states or others resulting in reduced services and increased costs to states in response senator grassley said that the legislative proposal simply sought to codify policy originally proposed by the crs13 clinton administration22 the final bill did not significantly alter the third party liability language included in the earlier house or senate bills23 the cbo estimate of savings for this provision is based on the assumption that states with regard to foster care and other programs eg juvenile justice have too broadly billed the provision of tcm services to medicaid this is in keeping with the administrations assertion that states have been shifting costs from foster care and certain criminal justice and education programs to medicaid in particular cbo believes that some states will move some of the claims they previously or currently bill as medicaid tcm to foster care administrative claims under title ive however as cbo also estimates net savings to the federal treasury 760 million over five years 13 billion over 10 years it apparently does not believe that all of these claims may be made under title ive in sum the effect of this new provision is uncertain but is believed as is suggested by net cbo savings to reduce access to medicaid tcm claims for range of populations including particularly medicaideligible foster care children proposals not included in the final legislation reconciliation legislation passed initially in the senate s 1932 and the house hr 4241 also included several other provisions relevant to child welfare and for which significant budget effect savings or cost was estimated or expected these provisions which would have extended the authority of hhs to issue waivers of federal child welfare policy through fy2010 house bill only authorized federal student loan forgiveness program for child welfare workers and others house bill only and amended the higher education act in ways intended to encourage greater access to youth aging out of foster care primarily included in the senate bill were not included in the final conference agreement brief summary of the deleted provisions follows extend child welfare waiver authority the authority of hhs to approve new waivers of some federal child welfare program requirements included in title ivb or title ive of the social security act expired with march 31 2006 this is not expected to affect previously approved andor implemented waivers but means that hhs is longer authorized to approve additional waivers waivers are intended to allow states to demonstrate innovative programs for the delivery of foster care and other child welfare services congress previously temporarily extended this waiver authority numerous times as part of shortterm reauthorizations of the temporary assistance to needy families tanf block grant including most recently in pl 109161 signed by the president on december 30 2005 however 22 see discussion of amendment 2409 in the congressional record nov 3 2005 p s12321 23 however unlike either the house or senate versions of the reconciliation bill the conference agreement stipulates that the new language does not affect the prior law application of third party liability with regard to programs or activities of the indian health services act or those carried out under title xxvi of the public health services act crs14 while the deficit reduction act reauthorized the basic tanf block grant through fy2010 it did not similarly extend child welfare waiver authority past march 200624 as initially passed the house reconciliation bill hr 4241 would have extended through fy2010 hhs authority to grant child welfare waivers would have removed the limit on the total number of demonstration programs hhs may approve in any given year set at 10 by current law and would have made other changes related to the approval of waiver projects and availability of information about the projects25 these provisions were not in the senate reconciliation legislation nor the conference agreement and were thus not part of the deficit reduction act as enacted pl 109171 student loan forgiveness for child welfare workers hr 4241 would have authorized the department of education to repay up to 5000 in student loan debt if an individual has worked fulltime for five years in one of several areas of national need defined to include child welfare workers26 this provision was not in the senate reconciliation legislation and was not included in the enacted deficit reduction act of 200527 educationrelated services and aid for foster children and those aging out of foster care both the house and senate reconciliation bills using slightly different language would have amended the higher education act to clarify that youth in foster care or formerly in foster care on hisher 18th birthday are included in the definition of independent student the definition is used for purposes of determining eligibility for federal student financial aid this clarifying change was not included in the deficit reduction act as it was finally enacted28 proposed trio program amendments the higher education act authorizes range of grant programs collectively called the federal trio programs 24 these temporary reauthorizations have also been used to continue mandatory funding of the national random sample study of child welfare section 429a of the social security act the study has been implemented by hhs as the national survey of child and adolescent wellbeing nscaw as enacted the deficit reduction act appropriated funds for the national random sample study of child welfare through fy2010 25 the child welfare waiver provisions of hr 4241 were identical to those included in hr 240 omnibus welfare reform legislation proposed in the house earlier this session and incorporated into hr 4241 earlier this year the senate finance committee reported welfare reform legislation s 667 that would extend through fy2010 hhs authority to grant child welfare waivers but would make other changes to this waiver authority 26 several other bills introduced in this congress would provide separate loan forgiveness programs for child welfare workers andor for attorneys practicing in the field of child and family law these include hr 127 s 1431 s 1679 and hr 3758 27 in late march 2006 the house again passed this same student loan provision as part of the college opportunity and access act hr 609 that legislation which would reauthorize the higher education act is pending in the senate 28 the house has subsequently repassed its provision regarding the definition of independent student as part of the college opportunity and access act hr 609 that legislation which would reauthorize the higher education act is pending in the senate crs15 these programs are designed to identify potential postsecondary students from disadvantaged backgrounds to prepare these individuals for postsecondary education to provide certain support services to them while they are in post secondary education and to train individuals who provide these services collectively the programs are authorized to provide wide range of services such as tutoring financial aid personal or career counseling mentoring exposure to cultural activities and educational institutions academic advising and financial literacy training the senate reconciliation bill would have amended number of these programs to help ensure that youth in foster care and those leaving the foster care system because of their age typically the 18th birthday are served by these programs these changes were not included in the deficit reduction act as it was finally enacted for
