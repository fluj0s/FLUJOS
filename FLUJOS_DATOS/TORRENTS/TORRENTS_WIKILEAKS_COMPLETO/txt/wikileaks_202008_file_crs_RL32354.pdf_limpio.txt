states financial services action plans regulatory reform issues summary the financial services action plan fsap is the european unions eu blueprint approved by the european parliament to transform the 25 member countries financial markets into single market this planned european regulatory reform raises number of regulatory issu for american firms operating in europe partly because significant part of us and eu financial services transactions are conducted through european fi nancial institutions onsite in the united states and american institutions onsite in europe the house financial services committee has held hearing on fsap successful integrati on of eu financial services is expected to increase europes economic growth european commission study suggests that the resulting competitive and flexible markets would cause 11 permanent increase in the european gross domestic pr oduct more cost reduction should result when the single european payments ar ea sepa is created upon completion in 2010 this electronic payments system w ill allow individuals and corporations to make electronic payments throughout the eu rozone as efficiently and as safely as such payments are being made on the nationa l level today the european parliament had scheduled december 12 2006 vote on th payment services directive but because of disagreements on regulatory issues the vote was not taken the fsap sets out several directives which call for national governments to adopt laws to regulate th eir financial services indus tries in addition member countries are expected to adopt related in ternational standards like the international accounting standards and the basel ii capital accords for financial institutions the directive on investments aims to establish regulatory framework for securities that is expected to promote efficiency and tr ansparency in this marketplace however the eu transparency requirements are very costly to american firms in europe consequently some in the us secur ities industry warn that us firms will withdraw from europe if this directive is not changed the directive was changed the purpose of the conglomeration directive is to contain and supervise risks arising in crosssector business groups containing securities firms credit institutions and insurance companies as part of the fsap accounting standards are critical tools in enforcing supervisory control over fina ncial services institutions on january 1 2005 all 7000 eulisted companies began following the international accounting standards board accounting principles in drawing up their consolidated financial statements the european union has implemented basel ii at the same time it is implementing the financial services action plan the acc ounting standards regula tions were resolved in time for the eus january 1 2005 deadline but regulatory issues concerning basel ii remain on the national level despite these financial services firms lingering concerns about fsap and basel ii their regulators belie ve that higher rate of economic growth will more than pay for the cost of these reforms consequently the eu is moving forward with these financial services reforms this

the financial institutions of member nations of the european union u have had long history of providing financial services to their customers on both sides of the atlantic significant part of this business banking insurance nd securities is conduc ted through european financial institutions on site in the united states and american institutions on site in europe the regulation agreed to for governing foreign institutions hosted in europe and the united states is called national treatment national treatment mandates that the host country extend to foreign financia l institutions the same regulations and supervision that they apply to their own institutions the longstanding national treatment agreement is being changed with the european unions reform of its various national financ ial services regulatory and s upervisory structures the eus financial services reform now opens up the possibility that instead of us financial services firms being hosted by 25 separate countries they may have to deal with only one paneuropean regulatory framework at this stage american authorities and financial services firms expect to share in the potential benefits the reform offers on the other hand they realize that the eus financial services re form could adversely affect us financial services firms profitability in europe that was one reason the financial services committee of the house of representatives held hearing on eus financial services ac tion plan fsap on may 22 2002 the reform is being conducted throug h an overarching financial services action plan fsap under this blueprin

markets frequently asked questions eu institutions press releases ip021706 continuedbackground the european union is in the process of transforming its 25 member countries financial markets into sing market through directives laws to be adopted by member countries regulating financial services only the 15 existing member nations are voting on these directives however th 10 new members are expected to adopt these directives in time the purpose of th directives is to make the european financial system more efficient by modernizing and providing greater uniformity for the member countries financ ial regulatory and supervis ory regimes this would enable them to operate as one integrate d financial system for example the new framework would among other things assure regulatory equivalence in all member countries and allow one countrys financ ial institutions to operate in anothers marketplace as if they were based in that host country with additional layers of supervision this new coordinated superv isory system would replace the divided and often anachronistic existing system when implemented the directives are expected to promote competition in financial services by removing barriers to intraeu trade in financial services at the same time the new system is intended to ensure the safety and soundness of the overall eu fi nancial system by protecting it from systemic risk successful european union financial integration would have significant impact on us financial institutions operating in europe and eu financial institutions operating in the united states considering only the banking industry there were 34 us banking organizations operating in the european union as of september 30 2003 with aggregate assets of 747 billion on the other side there were 68 eu banking organizati ons with assets in their us offices of 18 trillion of which 937 billion were banki ng assets while 871 billi on were nonbanking assets1 overall the us financial firms banks securities insurance and others appear to view the eu financial integration efforts as winwin for the european and world economies us financial firms which are among the leading players in the global financial market are expected to be major beneficiaries of eu integration the integration of financial services regulations is expected to increase europes economic growth study by the european commission suggests that the resulting competitive and flexible markets would pool europewide liquidity which would benefit the equities and corporate bond ma rkets that alone is estimated to permanently reduce the costs of equity cap ital by 05 triggering 05 increase in investment and employment which w ould result in 11 increase in european gross domestic product2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32354crs3 2

the overall framework to integrate europes capital markets by the middle of this decade now approved by the european commission fsap seeks to modernize prudential supervision and regu lation of financial services providers through 42 complex measures it would tablish single apparatus intended to be capable of the following responding to new regulatory challenges eliminating capital market fragmentation promoting closer coordination among supervisory authorities and developing an integrated eu infrastructure for wholesale and retail financial services the fsap measures include stateofthe art prudential rule s and supervision which the european commission considered to be much needed in some member countries the plan also addresses disp arities in tax treatment and is intended to establish an efficient and transparent lega l system of corporate governance capital adequacy and protection ag ainst money laundering the us perspective us officials and business interests are generally supportive of the eus financial services ac tion plan us officials want the fsap to become reality that is consistent with an open global financial system in which eu markets reward the most efficient fi rms operating matter what their country of origin earlier in the process some americans suggested that the europeans model their system after the united states which arguably has the bestfunctioning capital market in the world but afte r the enron worldcom and other recent scandals the europeans considered the us framework as not the most transparent disclosure regime in the world and have developed some alternative mechanisms leading to some us concerns the tr ansparency requirement s would require firms to publish annual and halfyear ly reports including conso lidated financial statements based on international accounting standards american securities firms assert that these transparency requirements would be co stly and difficult for us firms to apply in the eu financial services marketplace3 in addition some us analysts point out that onsite examinations of financial institutions are not emphasized in the fsap while these examinations are critical part of the us financial services regulatory structure because of the lack of onsite examinations of the financial institutions operations they are concerned that regulato ry enforcement could be applied with bias against american firms the eu perspective political backing of the fsap in the eu is very strong and widespread the main reasons are that the governments of the member countries believe that the plan is feasible and th at it could help boost eu economic growth inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32354crs4 4 see crs report rl30375 major financial services legislation the grammleach bliley act pl 106102 an overview by f jean wells and william d jackson 5 regulatory roundup american banker feb 12 2004 p 5 the long run many europeans believe that the dismantling of barriers to financial services could result in the eu becoming significant rival to us financial firms in the global financial market the challenge for the european parliament and the council of financial mini sters is to transpose the plan into the national laws of the member countries given the huge diversity that currently exists in the member countries financial regulatory architectur the eu is expected to allow some flexibility in implementing the plan however this flexibility could lead to enforcement difficulties later if significan t regulatory differences remain because national legislatures insist on maintaining special privileges for certain firms the financial conglomerate directive fd one of the primary proposals under the fsap is the directive on the consolidated supervision of financial conglomerates this directive would establish minimum requirements for groupwide superv ision of financial conglomerates and mixed financial holding companies firms with financial services as well as commercial operations doing business in the european union this form of financial institution is more common in europe than in the united states where until recently such mixes were prohibited4 the purpose of this directive is to contain and supervise the risks arising in crosssector business groups containing securities firms credit institutions and insurance companies it imposes prude ntial supervision on groupwide basis of financial conglomerates and mixed financial holding companies in short it attempts to address concerns that there could be threat to the eus financial stability if any firm within large financial conglomerate were to experience financial difficulty the us perspective the financial conglomerates directive is somewhat controversial because it requires eu au thorities to determine whether noneu parent financial conglo merate is subject to equivalent consolidated supervision in its noneu home country if equivalent superv ision is not confirme d the directive sets out several requirements to ensure appropr iate supplementary s upervision american firms argue that these requirements would ra ise their cost of doing business in the european union for example if the eu authorities found equi valent supervisor they could impose additional capital requirements levy more regulatory scrutiny on the risk profiles of the group or test th qualifications of key personnel the american firms would prefer us supervisory authorities to play role in deciding whether or not there is supervisory equi valency the eu commission and the sec agreed that for companies with recognized federal regulator the sec would be designated their federal regulator5 the eu perspective unlike the american rulebased financial supervisory framework the europeans are in the process of setting up single supervisory framework that is mainly based on principles not rules they expect this new financial services regulatory framework to be capable of

efficient market environment for better decisionmaking under this framework regulatory cooperation among supervisory authorities is critical to ensure even handed enforcement the american type rules system leaves less room for interpretation and is therefore less flexible for most eumember countries regulatory rule s are expected to play an increasingly important role in their financial framework6 the investment services directive isd the investment services directive is another critical directive and is the legislative framework for the regulation of fi rms in the securities industry an earlier version of this framework was adopted in 1993 it established the conditions under which authorized investment firms and ba nks provide specified services in other member countries on the basis of home country authorization europeanwide national treatment or the one passport framework howeve r it left standing most restrictions to crossborder investment services activities in europe the new directive as reviewed by the committee of european securities regulators cesr and now approved by the eur opean parliament prescribes set of flexible market oriented principles that are expected to deliver increased innovation and competition7 the committee believes that parts of the european capital market are still too fragmented into national securities markets that do not allow international competition in addition in recent years more investors have become active in these markets offering more complex range of financial services and instruments like the other regulatory directives this new directive on investments aims to establish uniform regulatory framework for securities that is expected to promote efficiency and transparency in this marketplace to accomplish this the eu plans to develop 25country integr ated financial trading infrast ructure for securities and to establish mechanisms through which th necessary cooperation among supervisory authorities will be possible furthermore greater emphasis than in the past is being placed on protecting investors and fostering market integrity while the scope of the isd is broad covering 25 countries the di rective pays great deal of attention to details it includes principles for polic ing conflicts of interest organizational requirements for multifunction firms and tr ading facilities and requirements for clientorder handling and large dealerb rokers making public their bid and offer prices for specific transactions the us perspective us authorities broadly welcome the european unions investment

active in cooperating with the european commission on developing this directive us businesses also welcome this directive and have commented extensively on the documents themselves the american chamber of commerce commented that the directive was too detailed c overing provisions that we re functionally unnecessary to illustrate the directive places blanket pretrade transparency requirement on brokers the chamber of commerce argued that this requirement does not give the brokers the necessary flexibility to work order execution most efficiently for their customers some in the us securities indus try have even suggested that us firms will withdraw from europe if this directive is not changed they argue that the regulations will be costly difficult to apply and could drive business out of europe9 the eu perspective the european union is trying to establish comprehensive regulatory regime governing the execution of transactions of financial instruments regardless of tr ading methods or country of trade origination the europeans believe that it would provide coherent risksensitive framework for regulating orderexecution arrangements in all eu financial markets however in order to get agreement on this framework it must be flexible because the existing national regulations of ten serve to protect narrow local interests consequently the directives emphasis on market integrity and investors prot ections are its main selling points among participants in the european marketplace but the fact that exemptions to already agreedupon provisions are given to certain financial services sectors by the european commission is an indication that the eu is not fast approaching agreement on the isd the directive on insurance di national insurance regulations are still in place in the eu even though there are several recently adopted eu insurance dir ectives in early 2002 the european union adopted two directives increasing solvency margin requirements for both life and nonlifeinsurance firms in an update of pr eviously adopted directives work has just started on fundamental review of the insurance solvency system dubbed solvency ii according to the europ ean commission which in itiates legislation in the eus legislative process the reviews objectives will parallel those of the revisions of the basel capital accord the framework directive was to be presented in early 2005 but has yet to be presented in late 2002 the european union adopted life assurance directive which simplified in to single text all previous directives in the area of life assurance but there are still disagreements among the eu members10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32354crs7 the us perspective even though the us financial services industry as whole has not expressed concern with the final version of the new directive there may be cost provisions related to th guarantee fund and solvency margin requirements that would limit some us companies interest in taking advantage of the new provisions while the directives language is worrisome to many us firms it has been standard language in many of the eu financia l services directives since the late 1980s it has never been invoked other than as negotiating tool in the global financial services negotiations however it is taken seriously as possibility particularly because of the considerable di fferences in insurance regulatory structures between the united states and european ion us insurance regulation is carried out at the state level with only rough c oordination through the statebased group the national association of insurance co mmissioners naic by contrast eu regulation is at the nationa l level and increasingly th rules are set in paneu framework financial conglomerates dir ective would require regulation in every eu country under single supervisory coordinator if an insurance entity operates within financial conglomerate but there has been little new movement on this reform package the eu perspective the insurance directives provide individual members with more powerful means to retaliate against noneu countries who do not provide national treatment to eu insurance firms the insurance directives include reciprocal national treatment clause providing for procedures in the event that eu firms are determined to be denied comp arable competitive opport unities under rules set out in the directives possible actions range from negotiations with the third country to seek national tr eatment by the european commission on behalf of the european union to placing restrictions on firms from that country in the eu market until the situation for eu firms in its hom country is resolved consequently denying one eu member na tional treatment could cost the denying countrys insurance companies opportun ities in all eu countries international accounting standards ias accounting standards are critical tools in enforcing supervisory control over financial institutions particularly in terms of corporate governance the european union made january 1 2005 the deadline by which all estim ated 7000 eu listed companies must follow the international accounting standards board accounting principles in drawing up their consolidated financial statements at the same time that deadline was set the us financial accounting standards board and the international accounting standards board pledged cooperation in achieving convergence of us and international accounting rules on march 12 2004 the european commission announced that the us securities and exchange commission sec would recognize foreign companies use of the international accounting standards ias when reporting financial results however the sec and european commission are in ongoing accountin g standards talks the united states uses generally accepted accounting principles gaap in contrast to the european unions countrymodified ias the main di fference is that gaap is rulebased and ias is

perspective even though the sec has agreed to accept ias for eu companies listed on the us stock exchanges the sec would like to see more discrete rules concerning the acc ounting for financial derivatives12 us financial services firms expect to benefit from the uniform ias in the eu both us and eu firms are currently incurring additional costs to doing business in the european financial markets because of multiple accounting standards the eu perspective currently national financial services markets in europe have uniform accounting standards cons equently the adoption of the ias for all listed companies in the eu from 2005 onward helped to eliminate barriers to cross border trading in securities by ensuring that company accounts throughout the eu are more transparent and can be easily compar ed this automatically increases market efficiency by reducing the cost of raising capital for firms but the european banking and insurance industries earlie r refused to comply with ias board rules concerning fair value accounting principles for deri vatives and european commission and the sec were willing to exempt european companies from compliance with these rules but on november 19 2004 the eu commi ssion gave final approval to the controversial internal accounting standards dealing with financial instruments such as derivatives while some american firms argued that the eu has instituted weaker standard than what is being applied in the united states they consider it significant step forward13 the basel ii capital accord basel ii is separate set of capital requirements for financial institutions which could be adopted by any fi nancial business in the world the european union however intended to implement basel ii14 at the same time it implements the financial services action plan however the eu wound up implementing basel ii first while plans moved ahead after the eu ropan parliament voted to move to basel ii on september 28 2005 all eu financia l

httpwwwfederalreservegovboarddocsspeeches2003200306102 17 ibidbasel ii is new financia l supervisory framework th at regulates the amount of capital that the owners of financial institution must set aside as their financial institution takes on additional risk the acco rds are rules based on the notion that financial institution is less likely to fail if its owners are required to put more of their own money at risk as the institution takes on additional risk basel ii is generally seen as an improvement over basel i which is the capital framework most developed countries financial institutions are curre ntly operating under the improvement in basel ii comes from more comprehensive risksensitive measurement framework that is able to adjust capital adequacy more rapidly than basel i basel ii relies more heavily on financial institution managements and regulators judgments of the methods used in determining risk and re quired capital than the set formula approach of basel i the us perspective as with the eu directives there are concerns for some mostly small us financial institutions if us regulators join the eu and require all us fi nancial institutions to operate under base l ii the smaller institutions would face significant cost s in setting up and ope rating capital models that could pass supervisory scrutiny and are widely expected to remain under the simpler rules of the older basel i accord in the united states16 the blanket application of basel ii to eu financial institutions is intended in part to assure at least minimum uniformity across what are otherwise very unlike institutions with respect to capital standards that positi on is different from the one taken in the united states the united states inte nded limited adoption of basel ii has created some friction with eu regulators us financial regulators headed by the federal reserve fed intend to require basel ii for only the most important internationally active institutions and presume that other major institutions mainly banks will also join the system the fed expects 20 large banks will be operating under basel ii by the implementation date at the end of 2008 those 20 banks account fo r about 99 of the foreign assets held by the top 50 domestic banking organizations and approximately twothirds of us domestic banking assets17 regulators will allow othe r banks to choose whether or not to apply basel ii or retain the basel i standards because of the cost and complexity of basel ii especially for smaller banks this regulatory decision implies that the overwhelming majority of the r oughly 8000 us banks are not likely to be operating under basel ii instead these sm all banks are likely to be operating under basel i or under basel ia new capital sta ndard which is more sensitive than basel i but not as costly or complicated as basel ii the regulators are reviewing comments from the industry on the basel ia proposal since us implementation will follow the europeans implementation nd since the basel ii and ia is expected to use capital more efficiently the european basel ii banks will enjoy the benefits ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32354crs10

banks at disadvantage until the united states implements its capital standards at least year later in 2008 than the europeans the eu perspective as mentioned above the european union is planning to issue revised capital requirement directive due to come in force at the end of 2006 to parallel the basel ii imp lementation all fi nancial institutions in the eu will eventually be required to operate under basel ii regu lations the financial institutions of austria belgium finla nd france germany greece ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands portugal and spain are currently operating under basel i and will convert to ba sel ii quickly it is not clear however that cyprus czech republic estonia hungary tvia lithuania malta poland slovak republic and slovenia currently comply with basel i as result the european union is now reviewing capital standards and adequacy in all member countries particularly the 10 new members as part of the eu financial services action plan18 the main objective of the review is to bring the existing regulatory frameworks of these countries into line with the rest of the european union eventually the aligned system under basel ii is expected to fo ster comprehensive risksensitive management environment thr oughout the european union several reasons are given for planning to universally adopt basel ii for all banks and other financial firms first the eus monetary authorities believe basel ii is superior to basel i second basel ii is relatively easier for the european union to adopt than for the united states there are fewer institutions in the eu for example in most eu countries fewer th an 10 banks account for more than 90 of their banking assets furthermore almo st all eu banks conduct significant amount of international banking and many are owned or ope rated by foreign banks consequently most european financial institutions are international and basel ii is expected to help create level competitive playing field the payment services directive psd the european union is developing an electronic payments system to allow national financial serv ices providers to offer euwide electronic payment services this system could have implications for us banks mainly because it could cut us international banking costs sepa is exp ected to allow individuals and corporations to make electronic payments throughout the eurozone as efficiently and as safely as in the national context today sepa is to have similar unifying effects in electronic payments as the euro banknotes and co ins have had since their january 2002 introduction because of that introduction businesses and individuals in the eurozone are able to make cash payments within and across 13 countries using single purse of currency since the use of paper checks and cash is significantly more costly that electronic payments the eu banking system is expected to be significantly more efficient and less costly with sepahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32354crs11 19 httpwwweuroparleuropaeuomksipade3pubrefep nonsgmlreport a6200602980docpdfv0 enlenlevel2navslstdocy 20 ibid p 27the european parliament had planne d to take december 12 2006 vote on the payment services directive that the european commission published in 200519 but because of disagreements on regulatory i ssues among the member countries the vote was not taken this directive is aimed at facilitating sepa by removing most of the legal and regulatory barriers in the euro zone the european commission found huge price differences in providing payment servi ces the difference was as high as eight times among member payments systems in addition in some eurozone countries the standard execution time for payments is one day while in others it takes up to three days20 the us perspective sepa is work in progress on number of fronts consequently it is difficult to know all th implications of its existence for us banks however if the rule to exclude noneuropean banks from the construction of the system is extended to nonmember us of the system itself sepa might have negatively impact us banks profits it is generally expected that sepa will offer us banks located in the eurozone leve l playing field to compete with european national banks due to the longstanding po licy of national treatment but since member states in the eurozone might amend the provisions of the directive to accommodate individual member countries infrastructures and practices us banking might be disadvantaged by resu lting modifications or amendments us banks eurozone operations could become mo re costly with sepa if us banking institutions are forced to provide 13 different sets of consumer notifications for example on the other hand since us ba nks are technologically competitive in the eurozone us banks might be capable of exploiting opportunities more quickly than their european competitors the eu perspective the european unions government in brussels supports sepa while the nati onal member states are divi ded in their support mainly because the national banking systems will have to make inve stments in advanced technology beyond what they are currently undertaking on the national level while the national governments are lik ely to benefits in the long run the shortrun costs are not being supported or subsidized by eu government in brussels from the european banking industrys perspective th strongest incentives to create sepa is the prospect that crossboarder paym ents will increase beyond the 3 that is occurring now at the same time sepa is expected to be more competitive allowing other national banks to compete in the nati onal payments markets thus established national banking institutions would be exposed to competition from other eu banking institutions even though mo re euwide transactions and more opportunities for banking busine ss and profits will exist some institutions are likely to be made worse off with sepahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32354crs12 conclusion the european union has initiated its financial services action plan in order to receive the economic benefits that are exp ected from removing the remaining barriers to intraeuropean trade in financial servi ces the europeans expect as much as 11 permanent increase in the european unions gross domestic product gdp as result of fsap united states regulators have generally suppor ted the regulatory reform mainly because us financial services firms have had longstanding business presence in europe consequently us businesses expect to share in the economic benefits that could result yet there are areas of the action plan about which american financial services firms ve some serious cerns the same is true for the electronic payments system sepa of highest concern is that these reforms are very likely to increase the costs for all financial services firms of doing business in the european union the costs are the results of compliance with the additional regulations of the reforms for example the reform calls for additional transparency in providing financial services some argue that the increased documentation could be significant expense for american firms especially when considering the multiple languages that are required in addition basel ii could require dditional capital from american firms doing business in europe the americans are also concerned that the european plan emphasizes cooperation among financ ial institutions regulators and flexibility in enforcing the provisions of the fsap throughout the plan the emphasis is on principles not rules many analysts believe that rules are more easily enforced than principles because rules are often less subjective than the application of principles to concrete situations the european union believes that the built in flexibility is more suited for the european union framework where financia l services regulati ons fall under different national and subnational ministr ies in order to get the directives adopted by the national governments the regulatory framework must be able to accommodate compromise through cooperative process because of this flexibility some americans are more skeptical about the european regulatory framework producing more level playing field for all financial services providers in europe for example under the international accounting standards board rules secur ities derivatives must be valued using certain methodology but the european commission has provided exemptions to those rules to many large eur opean financial services firms another example is that american and european financial services firms in the united states are subjected to onsite examinations onsite examinations do not play significant role in the fsap blueprint so far consequently enforcement of regulatory requirements is feared likely to be less stringent in the eu despite these concerns both the europeans and the americans regulators believe that the higher rate of economic growth and profits will more than pay for the cost of these reforms
