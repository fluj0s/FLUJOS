the largest major domestic entitlement programs in the us today during the 1980s and 1990s steadily rising medicaid costs were attributed to the economic incentive to provide more care under the traditional widespread feeforservice ffs delivery system in which provider payments are made for each unit of service delivered during that time following the lead in the empl oyer health insurance market many states began to turn to managed care for their medicaid programs the goal then and today is both to rein in medicaid costs by making payments on predetermined perpersonpermonth pmpm basis rather than for each unit of service rendered and to provide better coordinated system of care for beneficiaries with an emphasis on preventive and primary care services the reality of service delivery under medicaid is gradually moving along this path in terms of beneficiary participation managed care is the dominant delivery system in medicaid based on data from fy2003 the latest available for all states medicaid managed care is widely used by children and adults but less so among the elderly and those with disabilities however there is still significant penetration of managed care in these latter populations with special health care needs in terms of expenditures the ffs delivery system still dominates medicaid spending largely because more expensive longterm care services available under medicaid are seldom offered through managed care arrangements also many us ers of longterm care services the elderly and those with disabilities are not enrolled in manage d care programs one of the next big challenges for medicaid managed care is to develop and evaluate managed longterm care and holistic integration of primary acute and longterm care for special needs populations this report provides an overview of medicaid managed care it includes discussion of the major features of both the managed care and the traditional feeforservice delivery systems in medicaid the report also provides series of tables that illustrate the distribution of people services and dollars across both systems of care it concludes with summary of some of the current policy issues facing medicaid managed care and list of additional crs resources this report will be updated as legislative activity warrants

1965 medicaid is meanstested entitlement program that finances the delivery of primary and acute medical services as well as longterm care to nearly 60 million people at an estimated cost to the federal and state governments of roughly 333 billion in fy20061 making it as large as medicare the federal health care program for the elderly and certain individuals with disabilities among major domestic entitlement programs only social security costs more each state designs and administers its own medicaid program under broad federal guidelines for states it is the second largest spending item after education medicaid is expected to represent 25 of gdp in fy2006 2 the expenditure growth is even more striking program spending increased by more than 49 between 2000 and 2005 exceeding growth in general and medical inflation and the rates of growth in spending for both medicare and social security over the same period 3 medicaid spending has grown partly because medical care keeps getting more expensive and because over time federal law has been expanded significantly to cover more people and more benefits certain state financing mechanisms have also played role in increased spending under medicaid as medicaid entered the 1980s and 1990s more attentionand blamefor steadily rising medicaid costs was attributed to the economic incentive to provide more care under the feefor service ffs delivery system in which payments are made for each unit of service delivered under this system medicaid budgets were somewhat unpredictable and outlays were significantly affected by the quantity and types of care provided it was also unclear whether state medicaid programs were getting good value for their ever increasing medicaid dollars following the lead in the private sector among large employers many states began to turn to managed care for their medicaid programs the goal then and today is both to rein in medicaid costs by making payments on predetermined perpersonper month basis rather than for each unit of service delivered and to provide better coordinated system of care for beneficiaries with an emphasis on preventive and primary care services but medicaid managed care has not fully achieved either goal yet data from fy2003 most recent available indicate that while about twothirds of medicaid beneficiaries nationwide participate in some form of managed care the majority of expenditures still occur in the ffs setting mainly because expensive longterm care services are rarely offered through managed care in addition while there are some data suggesting improvements in the quality of care delivered in medicaid managed care commercial employerbased and medicare managed care plans continue to do better on some measures of effectiveness 1

specifics of how care is delivered under medicaid it is important to understand who is eligible for the program and the range of benefits that may be covered4 g7g149g146g144g146g139g146g149g146g157g162g561 the medicaid statute title xix of the social security act defines more than 50 distinct population groups as being potentially eligible some eligibility groups are mandatory meaning that all states must cover them others are optional to qualify for medicaid coverage applicants income eg wages social security benefits and often their resources or assets eg value of car savings accounts must meet program financial requirements these requirements vary considerably among states and different rules apply to different population groups within state medicaid eligibility is also subject to categorical restrictions generally it is available only to specific categories of people including the elderly persons with significant disabilities members of families with dependent children and cert ain other pregnant women and children other individuals eg childless adults with disability are not eligible for medicaid matter how poor they are unless they are covered under special waiver in recent years medicaid has been extended to additional groups with specific char acteristics including certain women with breast or cervical cancer and uninsured individuals with tuberculosis g21g157g138g151g141g138g155g141g561g4g142g151g142g143g146g157g156g561 medicaid benefits are identified in the federal statute and regulations as either mandatory or optional and include wide range of medical care items and services examples of benefits that are mandatory for most medicaid groups include 1 inpatient hospital services excluding services for mental disease 2 laboratory and xray services 3 physician services and 4 nursing facility services for persons age 21 and over in addition to prescribed drugs that are offered by all states other optional benefits covered by many states include for example 1 routine dental care 2 physiciandirected clinic services frequently for mental health care 3 therapies eg physical occupational and speech and 4 transportation in order to receive medical care in general most medicaid beneficiaries whether covered via mandatory or an optional eligibility group are entitled to all the standard mandatory and optional benefits offered by state medicaid program 5 g16g142g160g561g4g142g151g142g143g146g157g561g17g153g157g146g152g151g561 under the recently enacted deficit reduction act of 20056 dra pl 109171

these two approaches to delivering services to medicaid beneficiaries differ in important ways across several key dimensions including choice of providers for beneficiaries how much professional management and coordination of medical care is provided which entity has direct oversight responsibilities for service delivery how states pay providers for services rendered and assuring access to and quality of care in many cases these two delivery systems are not entirely independent approaches to providing medical care under medicaid in number of states there are hybrid models that combine various features of feeforservice and managed care for given population or set of interrelated services at given point in time beneficiaries may obtain all their services under single system of care or different sets of services under each system simultaneously eg primary and acute care under managed care arrangements and longterm care such as home health services or ongoing rehabilitative services under the feeforservice delivery system each of these features of delivery systems is described in more detail below httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33711g15g142g141g146g140g138g146g141g561g15g138

the feeforservice ffs delivery system was the predominant system of care both within and outside of medicaid until about the mid1990s under ffs beneficiaries have unrestricted provider choice that is they can seek services from any medicaid participating provider hence beneficiaries are largely responsible for their own medical care management and coordination the term feeforservice evolved as shorthand way to describe the method used to reimburse providers for services rendered for medicaid payment rates for each type of service are set by the state within broad federal guidelines the state directly or through fiscal intermediary pays each participating provider for each covered service received by medicaid beneficiary that is each individual service rendered is paid specified amount or rate in essence there is oneto one correspondence or match between payments and the quantity and types of care actually delivered

1990s states had to obtain waivers of certain medicaid rules to require that medicaid beneficiaries get their services through managed care for example authority provided by section 1915b of the social security act was used by many states to waive the requirements that services be available statewide so that managed care could be implemented in specific sub state regions and that beneficiaries have freedom of choice among all medicaid providers so that managed care enrollees could be required to receive certain services from specified subset of managed care providers section 1115 of the social security act provides additional flexibility to test benefit package and service delivery innovations this authority has also been used to implement managed care demonstrations in fy1998 nearly all states had at least one such waiver for some population subgroups or regions 7 the balanced budget act of 1997 bba97 pl 10533 eliminated the need for waivers that many states complained were unnecessarily complex and timeconsuming bba97 also included managed care provisions that established standards for quality and solvency and provided additional protections for beneficiaries described below g18g149g138g151g561g22g162g153g142g156g561g138g151g141g561g4g142g151g142g143g146g157g156g561 under medicaid managed care beneficiaries choose or are assigned to primary plan as medical home in turn these plans provide care coordination and management state medicaid agencies must contract with at least two plans or may offer one plan with choice of at least two plan providers comprehensive traditional plans like health maintenance organizations hmos make available to enrolled beneficiaries broad range of preventive primary and acute care services under primary care case management pccm plans primary care physicians provide basic medical care and serve as case managers or gatekeepers via referrals to specialty care eg mental health services dental care such

providers in the ffs delivery system phps may be limited to certain ambulatory services prepaid ambulatory health plans or pahps or specific types of inpatient care prepaid inpatient health plans or pihps beneficiarys choice of provider under managed care is restricted that is beneficiaries must seek care for specified services from specified list of plan providers between 1990 and 2002 states increased their use of comprehensive managed care contractors with primarily public enrollment ie more than onehalf of the plans enrollment was made up of medicaid medicare and schip enrollees and decreased the use of such plans serving primarily commercial population ie onehalf or less of the plans enrollment was comprised of medicaid medicare and schip beneficiaries8 as of june of 2004 data from cms show that despite these trends nationwide commercial mcos outnumbered medicaidonly mcos 156 versus 131 and more medicaid beneficiaries were enrolled in commercial plans than medicaid only

methods used under the ffs delivery system traditional managed care plans such as hmos agree to make available specified set of services for which the state medicaid agency pays fee on per member per month pmpm basis called premium or capitation rate these rates typically reflect the average ffs cost of providing care to specified groups or subgroups of beneficiaries expected to enroll in the plan such premiums are paid each month regardless of the quantity or types of contracted care actually rendered to enrolled beneficiaries because the pmpm rates and the number and type of beneficiaries to be enrolled are generally known in advance managed care expenditures for both the plans and the state medicaid agency are more predictable than ffs payments and budgets can be set accordingly phps also involve capitated payments but for limited benefit packages eg inpatient substance abuse treatment dental care transportation traditional managed care plans and phps must actively manage care for plan beneficiaries to control their financial risk such plans face financial loss if more care is rendered than the agreed upon capitation rate accommodates conversely if less care is rendered than is assumed in the premium the plan will experience financia l gain overall the economic incentive is to deliver less care or less costly care so long as beneficiary health is not compromised as result that incentive may be passed on to contracted medical providers such as physicians and hospitals via what is sometimes called subcapitation ie when plans pay their contracted 8 n kaye medicaid managed

other kinds of financial rewardspenalties for performance in contrast the payment methods under the pccm model are blend of both ffs and traditional managed care the majority of expenditures associated with pccm programs are ffs payments10 the case manager ie an internist or pediatrician is paid small preset monthly fee eg 2 to 3 per enrolled beneficiary to handle coordination of and referral for other services particularly specialty care in addition the case manager is typically paid on ffs basis for direct delivery of basic primary care to hisher enrolled beneficiaries as are the medical specialists to whom referral is made the pccm model of managed care has sometimes served as first step toward more traditional models of managed care such as hmos in addi tion pccm programs have been implemented in rural areas where traditional managed care plans operate given few potential beneficiaries pccm programs may also be used for populations that frequently need broad

medicaid agency the managed care plans and the plan providers the state medicaid agency has direct oversight of its contracted managed care plans and establishes payment rates for these entities as well as the parameters governing the amount duration and scope of benefits covered in these contracts in accordance with federal and state requirements similarly the managed care plans have direct oversight of the plan providers these plans set medical care and referral policies in accordance with the contractual agreement negotiated with the state medicaid agency the plans also determine payment methods and rates for plan providers the providers deliver or prescribe medically necessary care to plan beneficiaries within the guidelines specified by the managed care plan the specific details of given stateplanprovider arrangement may vary from this generic scenario also state medicaid agencies typically directly oversee pccm programs as well although some states contract with administrative service organizations asos to help administer these programs 11 under the ffs delivery system there is plan middle man generally the state medicaid agency deals directly with all medicaid partic ipating providers statewide in terms of both medical care policies eg amount duration and scope of covered benefits and setting payment methods and rates specific to different types of

assure access to and quality of care under both the medicaid ffs and managed care delivery systems some of these requirements are very general and broad while others particularly for nursing facilities are detailed and specific examples of such assurances include the following services must be provided in manner consistent with simplicity of administration and in the best interest of the recipients section 1902a19 states must assure that payments are consistent with efficiency economy and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care is available at least to the same extent that such services are available to the general population in the geographic area section 1902a30a medical evaluation and written plan of care is required for certain people and services section 1902a26 and states must regularly survey and certify nursing facilities to ensure that such care meets certain standards for staffing and service delivery as well as to assure that resident rights are protected section 1919 when bba97 was passed there was lot of concern that beneficiaries may be harmed under managed care without additional significant safeguards thus there are many additional requirements for assuring access to and quality of managed care under medicaid for example the federal statute includes provisions requiring plans to assure coverage of emergency services under managed care section 1932b2 have system in place to address grievances section 1932b4 demonstrate adequate capacity and services section 1932b5 and meet series of quality assurance standards section 1932c g25g145g152g561g20g142g140g142g146g159g142g156g561g25g145g138g157g561g21g142g155g159g146g140g142g156g561g138g157g561g25g145g138g157g561g5g152g156g157g156g561g139g162g561

607 among 444 million medicaid eligibles enrolled in june of 200413 counting the number of medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in various forms of managed care is difficult for several reasons beneficiaries may receive managed care services under multiple arrangements within one year for example some individuals may be enrolled in pccm program for part of the year then switch to an hmo for the remainder of the year other individuals may be enrolled in an hmo or pccm program for their primary care and simultaneously receive specialty services from one or more phps eg for mental health care andor dental services variety of other scenarios are also possible to obtain unduplicated counts of beneficiaries by type of managed care experience we examined personlevel patterns of payments using special fy2003 medicaid claims database provided to crs by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms the federal agency that administers the medicaid program in descending order of frequency among the roughly 52 million medicaid beneficiaries nationwide that had any payments made on their behalf in fy2003 64 333 million individuals had managed care expenditures 22 115 million beneficiaries had managed care payments made for hmos only 18 95 million people had managed care expenditures for both hmos and phps 11 59 million had managed care payments for pccms only 10 50

spending patterns und er medicaid the monthly fees paid to case managers for care management and coordination under pccm programs are counted as managed care expenditures however the medical services delivered by case managers are paid on ffs basis as are the payments made for related specialty care received as result of referrals by case managers the available data do not provide means to treat payments for pccmrelated primary and specialty care services as managed care expenditures with these data caveats in mind medicaid expenditure patterns are summarized below despite the fact that nearly twothirds of medica id beneficiaries have experience with some form of managed care expenditures for managed care services are dwarfed by benefit expenditures under the ffs delivery system as shown in the bottom row of table 5 in fy2003 total federal and state spending on medicaid services reached 2332 billion the vast majority of service spendingnearly 84was for care provided under the

categories of expenditures accounted for nearly 15 of total service spending all other ffs care mostly acute and primary care services eg inpatient and outpatient hospital physician services clinic care accounted for nearly onethird of total benefit expenditures managed care accounted for just 16 of total medicaid service expenditures in fy2003 as shown in table 5 in arizona nearly 85 of all medicaid benefit spending was for managed care unlike other states arizona has had statewide managed care waiver in place since the beginning of its medicaid program in 1982 in all remaining states

for longterm care services still largely occur in the ffs delivery system state variation in the proportion of beneficiaries and expenditures associated with managed care is the rule rather than the exception such variation is likely due at least in part to political geographic and market considerations unique to each state states continue to redesign their medicaid programs and experiment with managed care via waiver authority in addition states may rely on managed care delivery systems for the new medicaid benefit package option now available through dra described above recent examples include new programs in florida us ing section 1115 waiver authority and idaho kentucky and west virginia all using the dra benefit option whether via waiver or the dra option these new programs provide access to different set of tailored benefits for different groups of beneficiaries based on their anticipated health care needs rather than giving all beneficiaries access to the full range of medicaid services covered in each state groups participating in these new programs include not only healthy children and adults but in some cases also the elderly and individuals with disabilities living in the community and those needing institutional care most programs will start off in subset of counties some programs will allow beneficiaries to opt out of the new medicaid benefit plans and enroll in employer sponsored or private health insurance subject to capped payments eg florida kentucky or remain in traditional medicaid eg idaho incentives such as access to additional benefits or

encourage healthy behaviors all four states access to enhanced benefits may be subject to certain conditions such as signing member agreement to fully comply with recommended medical treatment and wellness behaviors eg west virginia all four states expect to use managed care delivery systems in these new programs although managed care under medicaid holds the potential for providing coordination and management of variety of medical and related health services for beneficiaries that potential has been largely limited to subpopulations of generally healthy adults and children significant challenges still remain for serving the elderly nd individuals with disabilities under traditional models of managed care most likely because of the wide range and intensity of services they require to meet their ongoing special health care needs relative to other services longterm care is expensive and an individuals need for such care may change repeatedly over time for states that want to save money on longterm care under medicaid these factors make setting adequate perpersonpermonth payment rates difficult in turn leading to an inability to attract managed care plans to this market in addition many mainstream managed care plans lack experience with both these special needs populations and with delivering longterm care services how successful has medicaid managed care been in reducing program costs and providing beneficiaries with better coordinated care this report is not intended to provide detailed review of this literature however there is some evidence that savings can be achieved through medicaid managed care for example in one analysis synthesizing results from 14 studies the lewin group 17 concluded that 1 comprehensive prepaid managed care plan models typically yield costsavings compared to program costs under ffs model 2 savings can be gained in programs that serve individuals with disabilities and 3 although cost savings is largely attributable to decreases in inpatient utilization some savings is also associated with moving prescribed drugs from the ffs setting into managed care there is also some evidence that medicaid managed care plans are not as effective as employer based or medicare plans but some improvements have been observed in recent years for example the national committee for quality ssurance ncqa regularly publishes reports for commercial ie employerbased medicare and medicaid managed care plans table 9 shows few examples of the 40 measures voluntarily reported to ncqa by more than 500 health plans for 2005 18 in general higher percentages represent greater effectiveness of care and member satisfaction on the selected effectiveness of care measures for preventive services acute medical care and mental health services the ratings for commercial and medicare plans exceed those for medicaid plans nonetheless very similar high ratings were observed for both medicaid and commercial plans on two acute care measuresappropriate treatment for children with upper respiratory infection and persistence of betablocker treatment after heart attack all three types of plans struggled with antidepressant medication manage ment probably reflecting the challenges of helping persons with severe mental illness regardless of the public or private sector health care system involved member satisfaction measures were consistently high for medicaid plans 17 the lewin group medicaid managed care cost savingsa synthesis of fourteen studies prepared for americas health insurance plans final report july

as are variations within each plan type eg among medicaid plans thus attaining high quality in managed care is an on going continuous process for medicaid commercial and medicare plans building on the reforms introduced in bba97 what additional role can congress play with respect to managed care under medicaid for example congress could elect to expand the use of medicaid managed care to address some of the issues identified in this report in particular with respect to managed longterm care and with holistic integration of primary acute and longterm care for special needs populations congress could also choose to monitor and evaluate access to and quality of medicaid managed care programs as well as assess the short and longterm costs and savings attributable to various forms of managed care for different subpopulations of medicaid beneficiaries g17g157g145g142g155g561g20g142g149g138g157g142g141g561g5g20g21g561g20g142g156g152g158g155g140g142g156g561 crs report rl33495 integrating
