safety security and control issues summary when the soviet union collapsed in late 1991 it reportedly possessed more than 27000 nuclear weapons and these weapons were deployed on the territories of several of the former soviet republics all of the nuclear warheads have now been moved to russia but russia still has around 5500 strategic nuclear weapons and perhaps as many as 12000 warheads fo r nonstrategic nuclear weapons many analysts in the united states nd russia have expre ssed concerns about the safety security and control over these weapons some of these concerns focus on russias nuclear command and control st ructure financial constraints have slowed the modernization and replacement of many aging satellites and communications links raising the possibility that russia might not be able to identify potential attack or communicate with troops in the field if an attack were underway some fear that the misinterpretation of an ambiguous event might lead to the launch of nuclear weapons some also expresse d concern that the year 2000 computer bug could affect russias command and control system but it did not some concerns are also focused on the safety and security of nuclear warheads in storage facilities in russia press reports and statemen ts by russian officials about possible missing warheads have added to th concerns however general eugene habiger former commanderinchief of th us strategic command stated that he had major concerns about security at russian nuclear storage facilities after he visited several storage site s in oct 1997 and june 1998 the united states and russia are coopera ting in many fora to improve the safety security and contro l over russias nuclear weapons and materials through the nunnlugar cooperative threat reducti on ctr

lost or stolen or that some might be launched by accident or without authorization by responsible officials many of these weapons were located outside russia but have since been returned to storage areas in russia the united states has offered through efforts such as the nunnlugar cooperative threat reduction program to enhance safety and security at nuclear facilities in russia concerns about the longterm effects of economic hardship and the increasing age of sovietera systems continue to prompt questions about the security of russias nuclear weapons and materials this report provides

in 1991 more than 80 of soviet stra tegic nuclear weapons including all ballistic missile submarines were deployed at bases in russia the remaining strategic nuclear weapons were deployed in ukraine belarus and kazakhstan by the end of 1996 these states had all return ed their nuclear warheads to russia and begun to eliminate the launchers for strate gic nuclear weapons under the terms of the start i treaty by the end of 1998 only ukraine still had sovietera strategic missiles in silos on its territory and it continued its efforts to eliminate these missiles and their silos the last ss19

prospective theaters of operation the weapons in eastern europe had reportedly been returned to russia by 1989 in late 1991 the majority of w eapons outside russia reportedly were in belarus ukraine and kazakhstan with pe rhaps less than 5 in georgia and the central asian states kirghizia tajik istan turkmenistan and uzbekistan according to officials in russia and thes other states all the weapons had been moved to storage areas in russia by the end of 1992 the command and control system for all soviet strategic and tactical nuclear weapons was centered in moscow as th soviet union dissolved in december 1991 russian president boris yeltsin replaced soviet president gorbachev at the top of the command authority but the rest of the system remained the

us department of defense concerns about command control safety and security many in the united states and russia have voiced concerns about safety security and control over nucl ear weapons in russia these concerns center on three general areas concerns about wea knesses in russias command and control system concerns about the possible loss of nuclear warheads due to lax security or accounting at nuclear weapons facilities nd concerns about the loss or theft of nuclear materials from the former sovi et unions nuclear weapons facilities russias nuclear command and control system russias nuclear command and control system consists generally speaking of early warning satellites and sensors that would warn of an imminent attack on russian territory the senior political and military leaders who would ssess the nature of the attack and if necessary authorize response usin g russias nuclear weapons and the communications links that these commanders would use to consult with each other and to transmit messages authorizing the use of nuclear weapons to commanders in the field these messages would contain the authorizing and enabling codes needed to unlock the permissive action links pals and othe r technologies used to make sure that nuclear weapons could not be armed and launched w ithout authorization from the central command authority5 analysts in the united states and russia have pointed to the degradation of russias early warning network of satellites and radars to note that russia mayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32202crs4 eventually lack the ability to monitor and react to strategic threats to its own territory in early 1997 russias defense minister r odionov stated that he feared loss of control over russian strategic nuclear forces in the future if additional funding were not available to maintain and modernize the communications links in the nuclear command and control structure furthe rmore in june and july 1998 both of russias geostationary early warning satellites failed leaving russia to rely on older satellites and gr ound radar stations for early warn ing of ballistic missile attacks these systems could not provide continuous coverage of us missile launch sites furthermore at the end of august 1998 tvia shut down the skrunda radar which had provided russia with early warning of ballistic missile attacks russia has since replaced some of these assets but concerns remain about potentia l gaps in coverage the us defense department has downplay ed concerns about loss of control over russias nuclear weapons noting that the central command structure remains in place but some analysts fear that ru ssia could respond to the degradation of the system by disseminating codes needed to launch nuclear wea pons to commanders in the field to make sure that these commanders could launch missiles in conflict this might increase the possibility of an accidental or unauthorized use of these weapons in addition according to russian press re ports strategic rocket forces personnel have faced serious financial hardship over the years some analysts fear that inadequate funding for traini ng and maintenance along with low morale could lead to an eventual breakdown of authority although problems with the troops probably would not lead to the unauthorized use of nuclear weapons they could make it difficult for russia to remain confident in the reliability and effectiveness of its nuclear deterrent the na tional intelligence council repor ted in february 2002 that these concerns had eased somewhat in recent years as the russian economy had improved and wages were rest ored russia has also imp lemented seve ral programs that screen troops responsible for nucl ear weapons for psychological drug and alcohol problems safety and security of stored nuclear warheads in the early 1990s russia withdrew most nonstrategic nucl ear weapons from deployment and placed them in secure storage areas russia s consolidated these weapons reducing from several hundred to perhaps less than one hundred storage facilities russian officials also contend that they have beg to dismantle these warheads at rate of around 2000 per year the united states doe s not have indepe ndent confirmation of this number and some analysts suspect that russia could still have 12000 warheads for nonstrategic nuclear weapons in its storage facilities many in the united states remain concerned about the level of security at these facilities and some fear that as result of poor secur ity and inadequate recordkeeping russia may not be able to keep track of all its warheads in september 1997 former russian secur ity council head and national security advisor alexander lebed alleged that ru ssian authorities could not locate 100 out of 250 small portable nuclear demolition munitions the russian defense ministry responded by noting that the russian sy stem of nuclear weapons safety keeps nuclear weapons under full control and ma kes any unauthorized transport of them impossible it also stressed that all nuc lear weapons had been withdrawn to russiahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32202crs5 from the former soviet republics other russian observers also discounted lebeds allegations in early october 1997 lebed appeared to withdraw his allegation stating that he had investigated the matter and had found evidence of missing nuclear weapons neverthele ss the debate in russia c ontinued with some alleging that russia never had such small munitions and others confirming that the munitions existed but denying that any are unaccounted for the white house stressed that the united states had credible informati on that any russian nuclear weapon has ever been available on the black market in late 1997 george tenet the director of central intelligence indicated that the united states remained concerned bout the possible loss or theft of nuclear weapons and materials in russia due to declining social and economic conditions he did not however offer any evidence that such losses had already occurred but conditions continued to dete riorate and some wages we nt unpaid for several months during the financial crisis that began in mid1998 as result many analysts have continued to express concerns about the human factor and the possibility that low morale and poor living conditi ons may combine to weaken security and controls over nuclear weapons general eugene habiger the former co mmanderinchief of the us strategic command visited nuclear weapons storage f acilities in russia to observe safety and security procedures on two occasions in october 1997 and june 1998 he stated that he was impressed with what he saw although he acknowle dged the tour only focused on strategic nuclear weapons and provided information about security procedures at storage facilities for nonstrategic nuclear weapons he also noted that russia lacked many hightech devices the united states used to maintain security at its nuclear bases and seemed to rely more heavily on added manpower but he stated that he did not have any serious concer ns about the security of russias nuclear weapons some in congress have also expresse d concern about russias stockpile of nonstrategic nuclear weapons the sena added an amendment to the fy1999 defense authorization act pl 105261 and the fy2000 defense authorization bill s 1059 calling on the president to press russia to reduce these weapons in accordance with its pledges from 1991 and 1992 the amendment also required that the secretary of defense submit report detailing the numbers types strategic implications and prolifera tion risks associated with russias nonstrategic nuclear weapons request for this report remained in the house and senate versions of the fy2001 defense authorization bill after the terrorist attacks in wash ington and new york in september 2001 russian officials reportedly increased security at nuclear weapons facilities they also denied on several occasions that an russian nuclear weapons were missing they insisted that terrorists had not gained access to russias nuclear arsenal former soviet nuclear facilities and materials concerns about the loss or theft of nuc lear materials from russia have grown since the september 11 attacks on the wo rld trade center and pentagon although more because of growing concerns about the

national intelligence council annual report to congress on the safety and security of russian nuclear facilities and military forces washington dc february 2002concerns about their security in russia for example some analysts and government officials have noted that osama bin den may have sought to acquire nuclear materials possibly to construct nuclear explosive device but more likely to construct dirty bomb with this type of weapon nuclear waste or other radioactive materials would be combined w ith conventional explosives and dispersed over wide area over the years there have been numerous reports of nuclear materials from facilities in the former soviet union appearing on the black market in europe in most cases the materials lacked the purity to be used to manufacture nuclear weapons however in several of the re ported cases the materials could have been useful to nation seeking to develop nuclear weapons in may 1999 the national research council an arm of the us nati onal academy of sciences issued report stating that security at russias nuclear materials facilities was worse than previously reported6 the report argued for sustained c ooperation between the united states and russia to improve security and prevent the diversion of these materials officials from the russian atomic energy ministry disputed these reports and argued that some safeguards are russian facilities were more stringent than those at us facilities the national inte lligence council also highlighted the risks of theft or diversion from facilities housin g nuclear materials in its report to congress in february 20027 the us department of energy doe estimates that there may be enough weaponsusable nuclear materials to pr oduce 40000 nuclear weapons at facilities in 8 countries that were once part of the soviet union the soviet union secured most of these facilities by placing them in closed cities or by using gates and armed guards but according to doe budget cuts and political upheavals have eroded this system many facilities lacked fences monitors alarms and comprehensive accounting systems to keep track of materials reports indicate that even those facilities with security and monitoring systems often disconnected them to save money on electric bills and to reduce false alarms they also have been unable to pay the guards and officers charged with maintaining security at the facilities deterioration of economic conditions and the decline in military spending displaced many scientists and engineers who worked in soviet nuclear programs although reports of scientis ts moving to other countri have waned the economic problems continue for example on ju ly 23 1998 several thous and staff members at arzamas16 one of russi as premier nuclear resear ch facilities stopped work during three hour strike they sought back payment for wages and budget allocations for 1997 and pay increase fo r 1998 nuclear workers from several of the closed cities

soviet states have cooperated in many ways over the years to address the concerns scribed above the ited states provides nearly 1 billion per year in assistance through programs in the state department energy department and defens department to help the former soviet states secure and eliminate nuclear chemical and biol ogical weapons to help secure and eliminate the materials used in these wea pons and to help pr ovide alternative employment for the scientists and engin eers who had been part of the soviet unions weapons complex these progra ms which have provi ded nearly 7 billion in funding in the past 12 years are signed to reduce the risk that weapons materials or scientists from the former s oviet union might provide useful to other nations seeking their own weapons of mass destruction they have met with many challenges over the years but most analys ts agree that these cooperative efforts have helped reduce potential threats from former soviet weapons of mass destruction the following section briefly descri bes some of these programs8 dods cooperative threat reduction ctr program in november 1991 congress allocated 400 million in departme nt of defense funds to help the former soviet republic s secure their nuclear weapons the funds were to provide russia ukraine belaru s and kazakhstan assistance in 1 the transportation storage safeguarding nd destruction of nuclear chemical and biological weapons and the dismantleme nt of missiles and launchers 2 the prevention of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and 3 the prevention of diversion of weaponsrela ted scientific expertise although some members have questioned the benefits and administrati on ctr program cong ress has consistently supported its central objectives allo cating between 300 and 475 million each year since the programs inception during its first decade the ctr program allocated most of its funds to projects that were designed to help russia ukraine belarus and kazakhstan eliminate strategic offensive nuclear weapons limited by the start treaty it has also helped improve the safety and security of nuclear warheads in transit and in storage the program has also provided funding to help russia build facility to dispose of its chemical weapons this project has proven far more controvers ial in congress than projects aimed at the elimination of st rategic offensive nuclear weapons for example congress denied funding for this project in fy2000 and fy2001 the bush administration conducted wi deranging review of us threat reduction and nonproliferation programs in russia during its first year in office many analysts expected this review to lead to reductions in funding and the elimination of some projects the admin istration however c oncluded that the programs did serve us national security interests it identified several efforts that would receive added funding at the sa time though the ad ministration alteredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32202crs8 the stated objectives of the program past legislation had stated that the ctr program should provide russia ukraine be larus and kazakhstan assistance in the transportation storage safeguarding nd destruction of nuclear chemical and biological weapons and the dismantlement of missiles and launc hers the prevention of the proliferation of wea pons of mass destruction and the prevention of diversion of weaponsrelated scientif ic expertise the programs new objectives are to dismantle weapons of mass struction and their associat ed infrastructure in the former soviet union conso lidate and secure weapons of mass destruction and related technologies and materials increase transparency and courage higher standards of conduct and support defe nse and military cooperation with the objective of preventing proliferation although these ne w objectives may not alter ctr priorities in the nearterm the potential exists for significant changes in the future in particular funding may shif t away from the transportati on storage and elimination of nuclear weapons towards efforts to s ecure and eliminate che mical and biological weapons furthermore the new emphasis on enc ouraging higher standards of conduct confirms that administrations added interest in conditioning us assistance on policies and activities pursued by the recipient nations this focus was evident in bush administration policies in early 2002 when the administration stated that it would not certify that russia was committed to its arms control obligations under the chemical weapons and biological weapons conventions the law states that this certification is necessary for recipient nation to receive assistance under the ctr program or the state depa rtment nonproliferation prog rams the administration indicated that russia had not cooperated fu lly with the united states in sharing information relevant to the implementation of these treaties it then asked congress to waive the requirement for the certifi cation so that the united states could emphasize its concern with russian complia nce without interrupting funding for the ctr program some observers criticized the administrations certification policy noting that even the administration agrees that these programs serve us security interests and that their suspension c ould undermine us nonpr oliferation policy state department programs the state department funds several nonprolifer ation programs in russia and the other former soviet st ates several of these are designed to help with border and export controls to reduce the risk that nuc lear materials might be smuggled out of the former soviet territory the state department also administers the international science and technology cent er in moscow and the sc ience and technology center in ukraine these centers are designed to provide research and peaceful employment opportunities for nuclear scien tists and engineers th centers began operations in 1992 and have thus far funded around 450 projects at cost of 145 million more than 17000 scientists and engineers have participated in istc projects many continue to work at their primary jobs in russias research facilities but because most have not received their full salaries at their primary jobs the grants from the istc permit them to support their familie s without contemplating selling their knowledge to nations seeking nuclear w eapons the bush administration has recommended expanding the science centers in part due to concerns about the potential risk that biological weapons scien tists might be lured to programs in other nations its budget for fy2003 contained 52 million for program that combineshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32202crs9 9

program in its early years focused on securing nuclear weapons it did incl ude some funding for materi als control and protection but governmenttogovernment negotiati ons with russia and the other

budget it had grown to more than 220 million per year by fy2003 these funds are used to help upgrade security and monitoring systems at facilities that house nuclear materials in russia and the ot her former soviet states and to help secure naval nuclear weapons in russia by early 2003 doe had helped upgrade security at buildings that contained bout 38 of the 603 metric tons that doe believed were at risk of theft these upgrades include the in stallation of improved security systems that use modern tec hnology and strict material control and accounting systems the program has also provided security training for russian nuclear specialists doe officials have noted that the program had has experienced some problems and results ve been limited because most of the materials are in russias closed nuclear cities and nuclear weapons complex minatom which is responsible for these facilities has been sl ow to provide doe with information about and access to these facilities because of th sensitive nature of the nuclear weapons complex the department of energy also implements two programs that are designed to discourage russian nuclear weapons scien tists from selling their knowledge to other nations the first of these the initiatives for proliferation prevention ipp program funds projects with nonmilitary applications that have commercial value for both the united states and the former soviet republics the program s coordinated labto lab contacts that sought to identify technol ogies at former soviet weapons facilities that might have commercial applications it also ma tches us government funds with funds provided by us companies in projects that seek to commercialize these technologies congress has authoriz ed approximately 2030 million for this program each year since fy19949 the second program the nuclear cities initiative nci is designed to bring commercial enterprises to russias closed nuclear cities so that scientists andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32202crs10 engineers will not be temp ted to sell their knowledge to nations seeking nuclear weapons it seeks to promote nonproliferati on goals by helping to redirect the work of nuclear weapons scientists engineers and technicians and to develop commercial opportunities in those cities for example it helped finance computing center in sarov formerly known as ar zamas16 that will produce so ftware for sale around the world the clinton administration had requested and received 30 million for nci in fy2001 the bush adminis tration however cut funding for the nci program sharply requesting 66 million for fy2002 w ith this low level of funding the program would have to withdraw from two of the three nuclear cities that participate the administration has also indicated that it would like to eliminate the nci program and merge its remaining projects into the ipp program in the conference report on the fy2002 defense authorization bill congress approved the merger of the two programs into new russian transition initiative but at the senates insistence required that doe continue to plan for and fund the nci programs separately it also increased funding fo r the combined program from the presidents request of 288 million to 42 million in the energy and water appropriations bill and an additional 15 million in the emer gency supplemental appropriations bill the bush administration has requested and received 39 million for this combined program in its budget for fy2003 it has requested approximate ly the same amount for fy2004 with 17 million allocated to nci and 23 million allocated to ipp however the nci program nded in late 2003 because the united states and russia have been unable to complete new imple menting agreement they remain at odds over liability protections agreement on the disposition of weaponsgrade plutonium i n september 1998 presidents clinton and ye ltsin agreed that each nation would convert 50 metric tons of weaponsgrade plutonium to form that could not be returned to nuclear weapons clinton ad ministration officials estimated that this amount was approximately half of the us stockpile and perhaps 25 of russias stockpile the agreement highlighted two means for converting the plutonium the parties could either c onvert it to fuel for nuclear power reactors or mix it with other nuclear wastes and dispose of it in way the would preclude its use in nuclear weapons this agreement is designed to ease concerns about the possible theft or diversion of weaponsgrade plutonium by na tions or others seeking to develop their own nuclear weapons congress allocated 200 million for this program in the omnibus appropriations act pa ssed at the end of the 105th congress after its review of us nonproliferation programs with russia the bush administration indicated that it would seek an alternative plan that would be less costly and less complex to address concer ns with russias stockpile of weaponsgrade plutonium under the new plan the two nations will each convert plutonium to mox fuel but us assistance to russia for the construc tion of its mox plant ended in late 2003 because the united states and russia have been unable to complete new implementing agreement they remain at odds over liability protections for us companies and individuals participating in the program bilateral meetings during the 1990s the united states and ru ssia also participated in bilateral discussions in several fora that sought to identify and resolve issues related to the potential loss of control over russias nuc lear weapons and materials the bushhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32202crs11 administration continues to pursue discussions among us and russian working groups even though it has continued the speci fic highlevel meetin gs on these issues the usrussian commission on economic and technological cooperation the goreche rnomyrdin commission in 1993 presidents clinton and yeltsin established the u srussian commission on economic and technological cooperation chaired by vice president gore and russias prime minister chernomyrdin vice president gore and prime minister chernomyrdin often used their meetings to address issues such as arms control and missile defense cooperation on the agenda for upcoming presidential summits for example in 1994 the commission announced that the two sides would coopera in building storage facility at mayak described bove for plutonium removed from russias nuclear weapons vice president gore and prime minister chernomyrdin also signed the agreement that established the program through which the united states will purchase 500 metric tons of uranium rem oved from russian nuclear weapons for use in nuclear power reactors the also signed an agreement requiring the shutdown of nuclear reactors that produce plutonium for nuclear weapons in russia beginning process that evolved over the years and remains on the agenda for us and russian cooperation during their june 24 1998 m eeting vice president gore and prime minister kiriyenko signed two agreements on nuclear issues the united states agreed to provide russia with assist ance in converting plutonium from nuclear weapons to fuel for nuclear reactors in the second agreement the united states pledged 31 million for 9 projects that are desi gned to help scientists in russias closed nuclear cities convert their effort s to peaceful civilian endeavors project known as the nuclear cities initiative the strategic stability working group sswg in late 1993 the united states and russia established an experts working group to discuss ways to improve strategic stability increase mutual confidence and relax the cold war nuclear force postures one of the first topics the sswg addressed was ballistic missile detargeting in an agreemen t that took effect on may 30 1994 the two nations agreed that country would be ta rgeted by any strategic forces on either side many observers praised this agreem ent as an overdue sign that the united states and russia longer consider each other enemies some also saw it as move away from the nuclear hairtrigger and concrete step to reduce the risk of accidental missile launches others however argued that its benefits were strictly symbolic because both sides could quickly retarget missiles during crisis many also noted that the measure was not verifiable so neither side could be sure that the others missiles were actually detargeted sharing early warning data as was noted above many analysts in the united states have expressed concerns about the possible inadvertent unch of russian nuclear weapons resulting from russias weakened ballistic missile early warning system in response to these concerns presidents clinton and yeltsin agreed in september1998 that the united states and russia would share early warn ing data for all sp ace launches and ballistic missile launches world wide they agreed to share data on continual basis in real time rather than providing it annually or biannually they agreed that data would include information on strategic theater and intermediate range missiles and onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32202crs12 space launches they agreed the data woul d be derived from ear ly warning satellites and groundbased radars and they agreed to establish mu ltilateral prelaunch notification system that would be open to ll nations who
