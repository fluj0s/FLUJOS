of predicate offense on the other hand does not preclude subsequent rico prosecution nor is either conviction or acquittal bar to subsequent rico civil action39

be related and not simply isolated events and 3 that they are committed under such circumstances that suggest either continuity of criminal activity or the threat of such continuity i predicates the first element is explicit in section 19615 pattern of racketeering activity requires at least two acts of racketeering activity the two remaining elements relationship and continuity flow from the legislative history of rico that history shows that congress indeed had fairly flexible concept of pattern in mind pattern is not formed by sporadic activity person cannot be subjected to the sanctions of rico simply for committing two widely separate and isolated criminal offenses instead the term pattern itself requires the showing of 37 18 usc 19611 paragraph 19611g simply states that

activity it is this factor of continuity plus relationship which combines to produce pattern40 ii related predicates the commission of predicate offenses forms the requisite related pattern if the criminal acts have the same or similar purposes results participants victims or methods of commission or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events41 iii continuity continuity is question of time party alleging rico violation may demonstrate continuity by proving series of related predicates extending over substantial period of time predicate acts extending over few weeks or months and threatening future criminal conduct do not satisfy this requirement42 but this does not mean that rico violation has occurred in the absence of continu ity often rico action will be brought before continuity can be established in such cases liability depends on whether the threat of continuity is demonstrated43 the court characterized pattern extending over period of time but which posed threat of reoccurrence as pattern with closedend continuity and pattern marked by threat of reoccurrence as pattern with openended continuity44 in the case of closedended pattern the lower courts have been reluctant to find predicate activity extending over less than year sufficient for the substantial periods of time required to demonstrate continuity45 whether the threat of future predicate activity is sufficient to recognize an openend pattern of continuity depends upon the nature of the predicate offenses 40 hj inc v northwestern bell telephone co

glance double jeopardy might appear to block any effort to base rico charge on crime for which the accused had already been tried by the same token ex post facto might appear to bar rico charge built upon predicate offense committed before rico was enacted or before the crime was added to the list of rico predicates on closer examination neither presents insurmountable obstacles in most instances the constitutions double jeopardy clause commands that person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb 90 in general terms it condemns multiple prosecutions or multiple punishments for the same offense the supreme court has long adhered to the socalled blockburger test under which offenses are considered the same when they have the same elements ie unless each requires proof of an element not required of the other91 rico defendants have raised three double jeopardy arguments none with much success the courts have held that prosecution for predicate offense does not bar prosecution for rico violation92 nor does it bar prosecution for both rico conspiracy and the substantive rico violation which is the object of the conspiracy93 nor successive rico prosecutions of the same defendant on charges of involving different predicate offenses enterprises or patterns94 g344g495g561g7g161g561g153g152g156g157g561g143g138g140g157g152g561 the ex post facto clauses preclude punishment of past conduct which was not crime when it was committed increased punishment over that which attended crime when it was committed and punishment made possible by

voidforvagueness doctrine requires that penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement97 vagueness became more common constitutional object to rico after justice scalia and three other justices implied its vulnerability to such an attack98 subsequent lower courts appear to have uniformly rejected the suggestion that rico is unconstitutionally vague either generally or as applied to the facts before them 99

constitutional bounds within which criminal sentences must be drawn under its directives fines may not be excessive nor punishments cruel and unusual 100 any more precise definition becomes somewhat uncertain majority of the supreme court appears to believe that the eighth amendments cruel and unusual punishment clause forbids sentences which are grossly disproportionate to the seriousness of the crimes for which they are imposed101 prior to harmelin the lower courts felt that at some point rico forfeitures might be so disproportionate as to constitute cruel and unusual continued fsupp 492 495

developments under the excessive fines clause the argument seems to have been rarely pressed since harmelin 103 the eighth amendments excessive fines clause is slightly more instructive historically the clause was only infrequently invoked the supreme court changed that when it identified the clause as one of the frontiers of permissible criminal forfeiture104 and indicated that the point at which forfeiture becomes grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the offense is the appropriate line of demarkation 105 the gravity of most rico violations however would seem to weigh heavily against most excessive fines clause challenges106 g344g495g561g8g146g155g156g157g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g561 alexander also raised first amendment issue the first amendment guarantees

constitutional right to have jury decide factual issues in rico forfeiture case but that nevertheless the constitutional standard for waiver of the right applied113 at least for criminal forfeitures in drug cases the supreme court concluded that the right was indeed not constitutionally based but that voluntary waiver was sufficient even if made without full knowledge of the waivers consequences114 after libretti had been decided the courts announced view of the role of the jury as fact finder changed somewhat first in apprendi then in blakely and finally in booker 115 there the court redefined the line between sentencing factors that the constitution allows to be assigned to the court and factors which the it insists be found by the jury as matter of right henceforth any fact other than prior conviction which is necessary to support sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by plea of guilty or jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved by jury beyond reasonable doubt 116 dicta in booker might be construed as an indication that property owners are still bound bound by the holding in libretti there is constitutional right to have jury decide factual questions in criminal forfeiture117 thus far the lower courts appear to agree118 g347g495g561g8g152g155g143g142g146g157g158g155g142g561g152g143g561g7g156g157g138g157g142g561 the forfeiture of estate argument was among the first constitutional challenges raised and dispatched article iii in its effort to protect against misuse of the law of treason empowers congress to set the punishment for treason but only with the understanding that attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture119 article iii speaks only of treason but due process would likely preclude this type of forfeiture of estate as penalty for lesser crimes as well rico forfeiture however is not properly classified as forfeiture of estate which attached to all of the defendants property regardless of the absence of any nexus between the property and the crime which triggered the forfeiture rico forfeiture is by contrast statutory forfeiture which turns on the relationship of the property to the crime and consequently is not forbidden by article iii 120 113 united states v robinson 8 f3d 418 42022 7th cir 1993right can only be waived voluntarily and knowingly 114 libretti
