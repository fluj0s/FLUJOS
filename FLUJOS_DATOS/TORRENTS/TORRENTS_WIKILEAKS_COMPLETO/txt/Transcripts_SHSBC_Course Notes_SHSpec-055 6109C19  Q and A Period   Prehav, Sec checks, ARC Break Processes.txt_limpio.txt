6109c19 shspec55 q and period prehav sec checks arc break processes details on prehav processes with the 5way brackets and different flows you are trying to knock off the pcs obsessive valence which hes stuck in by some stuck flow eg sergeant always orders troops one orders him thus he gets stuck flow and eventually does something weird like becoming troop or inability to accept orders from officers if someone kept giving orders it would unstick the flow eventually flows are the mechanism by which someone snaps terminals and gets valence closure you run body continually it never runs you so youre in body one day you get reaction from body and you succumb the stuck flow has snapped and is making the body and you succumb the stuck flow has snapped and is making the body run you if you start consciously driving car youve been driving unconsciously ie you start taking the car somewhere instead of just letting the car take you all sorts of weird things are liable to happen you might lose your ability to drive temporarily in driving the car unconsciously youve already succumbed to stuck flow we have the idea that skill should be unconscious so one doesnt have to think this is big reactive trap when one has run out all the flows on terminal that the pc has as an obsessive valence youll have discharged the pcs compulsion to be interiorized into it or to command it or be unconscious about it the overt act motivator phenomenon has to be part and parcel of this stuck flow phenomenon eg sergeant tells his troops theyre going for picnic when they get out in the field they find they have to build fortifications the lies and prevarications are part of what causes the valence closure if you start teaching student about scientology and pushed bunch of false or misinterpreted data on him that would be an overt in order for the stuck flow to come about you have to have an individuation and unease an unconscious reaction plus something unknown something hidden an overt in instruction at saint hill far instance on the auditor process beingness is in the middle of confusion so the process what are you willing to be what would you rather not be is limited process it picks the stable datum out of the confusion which is reverse auditing it is very good only on limited basis if you were going to run case with this youd have to run some 1a processes problems and sec check processes alternated see hcob 6jul61 routine 1a as part of the auditing commandsee also p 57 paragraph 4 for the theory behind this eg for long run use 1a what would you be willing to be b what would you rather not be 2a what would another be willing to be b what would another rather not be 3a what confusion could you confront b what confusion could another confront you can use problem or motion in the confront command instead of confusion whichever reads best to run whole case with it add two more commands the negative confront parts that could run the whole case to clear maybe after very long time if you ran it without the problems part it would run the pc right into engrams within few hours on withholds you first find some doingness eg fish around for anything he thought he should tell you that hes forgotten about clean up with 2wc if possible first asking what was it when was it what sort of thing would you find it hard to tell etc you could use peter williams version of ow think of something youve donewithheld for 3 or 4 cycles then is there anything youd care to tell to give the pc chance to get the withhold off you could use this latter after 2wc doesnt get it or you could use what is unknown about my reactions to shake it out clearing the auditor so the pc can talk to him you are not trying to run sec check on the pc however if you get read on withhold the pc tells what it was and it still reads you release it with to whom wasnt that known to whom shouldnt that be known this is the nastiest withhold process ever dreamed up this process cleans up basicbasic on the arc break chain what didnt an auditor do when what werent you able to tell an auditor when you can clean up the immediate session arc break with what werent you able to tell when or shorter process what didnt i do when what werent you able to tell when this is the final descendant of the discovery that communication is the most important corner of the arc triangle as long as you run recall its perfectly safe to run what werent you able to say but dont put it in the present or future or it will be an outofarc process eg what wouldnt you be able to say this could even be unanswerable you can use the past tense process with specific terminals eg what werent you able to tell your mother psychotics have gone sane on think of communicating with somebody run for 25 hours despite the stuck flow aspect but it wasnt communication that aberrated anybody it was the notcommunications so recall on the notcommunications operates as very powerful process to round it out as total valence process get the other flow what wasnt terminal able to tell you when that would be powerful valence splitter so skip prehav 13 as way to clean up ptps with present time environment terminals run the above prehav 13 is process which combines overt running with prehav assessment and running of brackets relative to list of charged terminals see tape 6106c21 shspec17 theres booster to this the pc is in position where he is expecting somebody to do something because he is depending on somebody to do something if somebody doesnt do it hes left in she soup so in session for an auditor not to have done something and for him not to have been able to tell the auditor is frequent source of arc breaks running that out picks up all the times he wasnt in session and cleans up past sessions to make long run out of this use what didnt an auditor do when what didnt you do when and what werent you able to tell an auditor when what didnt an auditor tell you when that would made wellbalanced process to clean up the pcs auditing track she full dress parade would be to assess all the people who the pc is having arc breaks with take the best reading one and run it in the above commands this moves the valence out dont run it very long on any of these terminals or its dangerous use it especially on terminals who are connected to the pc but object to scientology if you put ritual ahead of getting auditing done you would be wrong every time form can get in your road the time for using perfect form is when everything is going well the whole world of diplomacy is world of form rather than doingness the idea that the safe thing to do is to adhere to ritual because then you are not responsible is the whole basis of diplomacy if you think form will get you out of trouble where you need wit you are wrong always put getting the job done ahead of doing it by the rules the rules will only fit majority of cases being well trained to use form doesnt excuse you from being clever when necessary staying within the auditors code
