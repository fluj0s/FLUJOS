bridge publications inc newsletter date why did man stop being god now i dont know of very many more routes of understanding that were punitively followed or pursued beyond mysticism magic magic by the way is very precise study most people think of magic in terms of stage magicians or something of the sort its not magic is not it is method of producing effects by using for cause the supernatural and theres spiritualism as something which is not mysticism these are routes routes routes and what are all these people studying and where are they trying to go and what are they trying to get theyre trying to get the source of man and trying to discover the extent of and recover the use of all of his latent powers of personality and that actually is the complete goal in this search not necessarily to uncover the gods and shake them by the right hand lets recover man and find out if man ever was god and if he was why did he stop being god l ron hubbard excerpted from the scientology milestone one lectures duplicate bodies on the same theta line an article by l ron hubbard from the scientology milestone one lectures the only conflict here is the fact that youre accustomed in the mest universe to arithmetic and of course when youre dealing with something which is out beyond the mest universe you are not dealing with arithmetic arithmetic is based on the mest universe mathematics apply to this universe and nothing else now here you have this operation this body line then may go out as two bodies you could actually track somebody back and find him living twice through the same age period you can find him living twice in the past through the same years but more importantly more important to you as an auditor you can find preclear living in four or six or ten entities right here on this universe at this moment and you can demonstrate it in any way you want to demonstrate it and even write letters to the other identities if you want to go that far and tell them what they had for breakfast for instance every once in while youll find preclear who will sit around and listen to advice from somebody he will hell sit around and hell get inspirations or hell get something from somebody else or something else and what hes doing there is about the same equivalent but much differenta mindreading act sort of hes over on the other side taking tips from what somebody else knows and he says this is inspiration this is my intuition at work and heres some other fellow sitting over someplace working like mad working something out and figuring something out well thats where hes getting the data whats quite remarkable about all of the research in which i have been engaged is it hasnt flashed up anyplace else and thats remarkable it has not come up anyplace else on earth on earth but this jealousy of identities was such actually that in the early days when i was working on this i was experiencing terrific anxiety i knew the next five minutes somebody was going to appear on the stands with this first book i wrote on the subject you see i knew somebody else knew i knew somebody else was working on it too and they were but not here on earth anyway there are probably as many as four or five fellows on earth that are almost my duplicate for instance physiologically almostpoor fellows now one of these fellows used to get in trouble all the time i walked up the steps of the cuban embassy one day andin washington dc and there was spaniard coming down the steps and he said ay pedrito cómo and i said im very sorry im afraid i dont know you and oh thats all right pedrito i wont tell anybody youre here and i said well thats fine he said well you can even pretend you dont remember its still all right pedrito im your friend and so forth and i hope everything comes out all right and i said well thank you and went on into the embassy i forgot about it until one time i was in puerto rico and i was trotting down trail and three braziliansbrazilian engineerswere coming up the trail on horses they took one look at and they said ay pedrito cómo and threw their horses across my path and they wouldnt let go anyplace and then this stuffyou can tell us we wont write anybody we wont let anybody know we saw youa big routine and they finally had cornered so tightly that nothing would do but what i went over and drank brandy with them and played chess and they sure figured out i was putting on good act to this day none of those fellows would do anything but claim that i was putting on good act well little more time went byin another place down in latin america and fellow walked up to i was sitting in bar he reached in his hip pocket and if i hadnt kicked hard at his shins i probably would have been dead man they threw him out promptly and i scratched my head and i said im not in trouble with anybody down here that i can think of till all of sudden i remembered by golly i bet that fellow would have jumped if i had said i was pedrito well fine fine until one time in panamaone time in panama girl took one look at the most scathing scorching look you ever saw in the street sniffed put her nose very high in the air and crossed the street diagonally so i said pedros been here i finally found out who pedro was hed undoubtedly run into too i finally found out who he was he was the of rich brazilian family and he had the wrong political color and he had gone bad in an awful hurry down in brazil and he was being looked for by the police of about five or six countries as well as the parents of several girls and during the warduring the war i got report that i had reported in at place where i hadnt been and my ears went up like foxhounds hahahaha because pedrito was nazi and my picture was on file with the fédération aéronautique internationale as an international pilot and those were in france and full records of were captured when the germans took paris and of course all they had done was backtrack look up take ahold of pedrito and cross orders i dont know what happened to pedrito i often wondered what would have happened if id ever met pedrito in the line of duty during the war i am sure though to this dayto this day that there is more there than just physiological resemblance now possibly many of you have had this experience youve probably seen people who looked like you or who acted like you or something of the sort oddly enough when you meet them you are apt to be little bit cross about it it is almost byword that people who have the same name will be hostile to each other people who have the same looks may be hostile to each other if they meet themselves accidentally and it is just in that wise thatits just in that wise that people who have or are operating from the same theta line become jealous of each other they will actually flick across and louse each other up i am sorry to have to report that because all should be sweetness and light but you every once in while will run into somebody on the theta line through the preclear and if i didnt tell you this could happen then i would not be doing well by you at all i would be hiding something which you might need to have
