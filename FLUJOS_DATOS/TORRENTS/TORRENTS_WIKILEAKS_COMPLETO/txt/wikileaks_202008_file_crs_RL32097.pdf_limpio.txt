and conventional weapons they may have conditioned their consent on the conduct of other stat and may be able to revoke their consent in accordance with any such conditional agreement while secret

acquisitions and exports of wmdrelated materials jurisdiction under international law the concept of sovereignty lies at the heart of the international political system nationstates states are considered the international persons who are both the creators and the subjects of internati onal law each state is independent and has supreme authority over its territory and general authority over its citizens the term jurisdiction refers to the authority of the state to affect the legal interests of individuals and entities jurisdiction may describe states authority to make its law applicable to certain actors events or th ings jurisdiction to prescribe states authority to subject certain persons or things to the processes of its courts jurisdiction to adjudicate or states authority to compel compliance with its laws and punish transgressors jurisdiction to enforce39 the ability to interdict seize and destroy weapons would most significantly implicate the jurisdiction to prescribe and enforce under international law states ability legally to assert jurisdiction over persons and things within its reach depends on principles of international law designed to prioritize the rights of various states which may have claim to jurisdiction over matter historically the most commonly asserted basis for jurisdiction is the territoriality principle determining jurisdiction by reference to the place where the offense is committed40 other bases of jurisdiction include the nationality principle determininghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32097crs9 41see id 403 an evaluation of whether exercise of jurisdiction is reasonable or to determine which country has the greatest intere st in pursuing case includes the territorial link between the state and the regulated conduc t or its effects the connection between the state and the person principally responsible for the regulated conduct or the persons the regulation is designed to protect such as nationality or residence the relative importance for the state to regulate the ac tivity the extent to which another state may have an interest in regulating the activity and the likelihood of conflict with regulation by another state

reference to the nationa lity of the person accused of committing the offense the protective principle determining jurisdiction by reference to the national interest injured by the offense and the passive personality principle determining jurisdiction by reference to the nationality of the victim where more than one state can assert jurisdiction over particular matter the state with the greatest interest should prevail41 the right of each state to control its sovereign territory and the territorial waters extending more than 12 miles from its coas t territorial sea is wellrecognized in international law states may also exercise extraterrito rial jurisdiction under certain circumstances but in general this does not include the right to enforce laws on the territory of another state without th at states permission for certain crimes there may exist universal jurisdiction permitting state to try crimes that occurred outside of its territory that did not involve any of its nationals but the scope of universal jurisdiction is not wellsettled and may not include the authority to take enforcement action on the territory of anot her state without its permission at any rate the possession or delivery of wmd or related materials is not generally recognized as crime subject to universal jurisdiction like such international crimes as piracy or slave trade under international law the united states clearly has authority to regulate the possession or transfer of wm d materials within or acro ss its borders and subject to any right to innocent passage42 within its territorial waters and airspace the united states can also place restrictions on the conduct of u s citizens anywhere in the world43 with regard to wmd under the principle of nationality44 however that authority does not encompass right to carry out law enforcement activities in another state without its permission fu rthermore if us law enforcement or military forces encounter wmd trade

response such as the implementation of blockade or the use of armed force in self defense such response could draw reactions from other states and possibly escalate into fullblown armed conflict thus the permissibility of options ava ilable to combat the proliferation of wmd varies according to where the action takes place and whose laws are said to be broken while enforcement activity by sovereign power over its own territory has relatively few international implications actions in the territory of another state would implicate the sovereignty of that stat and would be subject to that

or ac quire chemical biol ogical or nuclear weapons and associated delivery systems or 2 transfers either selling receiving or facilitating of wmd their delivery systems or related materials127 the bush administration emphasized that the initiative is an effort to coordinate export control regimes that are already in place rather than major departure from the current nonproliferation regimes this statement may represent reconsideration of the initial goal of the psi in announcin g the initiative president bush explained that the psi would give member countries the capability to search planes and ships carrying suspect cargo and to seize ille gal weapons or missile technologies128 to the extent that the searches and seiz ures are carried out on the high seas the law of the sea would clearly allow psi nation warship to stop and search vessels flying its flag or flag at all or flying the flag of state that consents to searches of its ships for that purpose presumably the psi member states will allow ships flying their flags to be searched for wmd materials prohibited by their laws where reasonable suspicion exists and nonmember states could be asked to consent on an ad hoc basis however it appears unlikely th at states of proliferation concern such as the democratic republic of korea or ir an would consent to having their ships boarded and searched for wmd materials and even if consent were obtained there is clear legal authority under internationa l law as it currently stands for state to seize wmd materials it finds on board even if the flag state is member of the relevant nonprolifer ation treaty psi states carrying out interdiction activities at their port facilities have broad authority to inspect vessels and prescribe law restricting the kinds of cargo vessels are permitted to carry into port however for psi state to stop and search vessel traveling through its territorial sea could impede the vessels right of innocent passage according to the psi

as an effective suspension of the right of innocent passage the interdiction of aircraft suspected of carrying wmdrelated materials that occurs in national airspace raises fewer legal issues since

to trade but has the right to insist on the neutrals impartiality and noninvolveme nt in the conflict belligerents are prohibited from conductin g hostilities establishing base of operations or seeking sanctuar in neutral territory th neutral state is responsible for ensuring that its territory is not being used by the belligerents in manner inconsistent with its neutral status in the event

conflict there140 blurring the boundary between war and peace historically two different sets of rules applied regarding the use of force between states one set applied during war and another during peace however since the united nations charter commits member states to settling their differences peacefully and allows war only in selfdefen states have sometimes sought to carry out acts ordinarily lawful only in the context of war while at the same time maintaining that they are at peace consequently the boundary between peace and war has become blurred some comment ators argue that new paradigm is necessary to provide rules necessary for the protection of states interests in light of these changes in the character of international conflict the greater destructive power of modern weapons and the emergence of nonstate actors capable of mounting attacks against states the following s ections explore the uncertain legal boundaries concerning the use of military force short of war the right of self defense the right of selfdefense traditionally recognized in international law afford s state the right to take proportionate measures including the use of force that are necessary to protect itself from imminent harm141 traditionally that right included the use of force to forestall an anticipated attack as well as to respond to an attack as great britain argued in the caroline incident in 1837142 or more recently as israel contended in seizing ship filled with arms bound for palestine that traditional right could include not only thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32097crs26 14359 stat 1031 1945 art 39 et seq 144id art 51 145it might be noted that the traditional doctrin of selfdefense may be sufficient support for naval interdiction to the extent the goods being transported are related in some fashion to the terrorist attacks on the united stat of september 11 2001 public law 10740 specifically invoked the right of selfdefense as the justification for its authorization to the president to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations organizations or persons he determines planned authorize d committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on september 11 2001 or harbored such organizations or persons the president has used that authority to employ armed force against the taliban government in afghanistan and against the terrorist organi zation qaeda and its members although there may be argument over the extent to which the traditional rules regarding the use of armed force apply to nonstate act ors such as qaeda it seems clear that the us has had pursuant to its exercise of its right of selfd efense under international law legal right to visit search and possibly seize vessels owned or operated by the taliban government as well as those flying the flags of other states which have been carrying material aid to that government moreover it is tenable to contend that the us has similar legal right with respect to vessels owned or operated by qaeda its members or supporters and other vessels suspected of providing material aid to themvisit and search of vessel but also its izure or destruction however these issues remain unsettled the collective security provisions of the charter of the united nations to some extent have preempted the traditional right of states to use force aggressively143 but the charter specifically preserves the inhere nt right of individual or collective self defence if an armed attack occurs ag ainst member of the united nations 144 scholars and publicists argue about whethe r article 51 affirms the traditional right of states to act in selfdefense in its entirety or as literally read to allow it only after an armed attack has occurred yet even the more expansive reading still includes requirement that an attack be imminent and for some observers the possession of wmd does not constitute an armed attack others argue that the concept of imminence as applied to wmd may require some modification circumstances might be cited in whic h the transport of weapons of mass destruction poses threat serious enough to meet that test notably as claimed during the cuban missile crisis see infra but more commonly the threat of an attack with such weapons particularly if they are still in the process of development may be distant or inchoate to the extent that is the case the traditional doctrine of self defense may not provide firm support for the use of military means to stop merchant vessels transporting weapons of mass destruction or goods useful in the development of such weapons outside the context of an armed conflict145 pacific blockade an exception to the notion of the blockade as an act of war might be the socalled pacific blockade distinguished from the belligerent or wartime blockade pacific blockade is not intended as belligerent act and does not give rise to condition of belligerency unless the state against which the action is taken chooses to resist with force paci fic blockade consists of naval action taken in peacetime to apply pressure against another nation by preventing the ships of the blockading and the blockaded nation from

with respect to the ve ssels of the blockaded state interference with vessels of third state is generally considered impermissible though practice has varied147 some international legal scholars have re garded the pacific blockade as lawful only as reprisal ie an otherwise unlawful act of selfhelp by the blockading state in response to an unlawful act on the part of the target state for the purpose of achieving reparations or otherwise settling an international dispute148 the legitimacy of reprisals is said to depend on three conditions that the purpose was to obtain remedy for injury resulting from illegal ac tion that noncoercive methods to obtain such remedy had failed and that the measur taken were not out of proportion to the injury suffered the quarantine of cuba in 1962 in response to cubas procurement of offensive missiles from the soviet union did not conform to the traditional model of blockade belligerent or pacific the term quarantine was used to avoid the implication that the united states intended the move as an act of war while allowing the united states to assert that the vessels of third states were subject to the prohibitions the united states did not asse rt the right to self defense under article 51 of the charter as justification for its actions149 the strategy was successful in averting war at the time and appears to have been accepted as valid by the international community however the uphemistic quarantine does not appear to have been incorporated as new concep t in international law and it involves distinctive situation eg cuba was viewed as surrogate for its supplier the ussr some observers cite us reaction to the cuban missile crisis as an example of adapting international law to deal with new circumstances150 selfhelp

interpretation of whether their destruction comports with the purpose of the united nations to the extent that the elimination of wmd in the hands of perceived unstable state may be seen to enhance international peace and security by promoting disarmament some argue that an otherwise unlawful attack might be justifiable for example israels 1981 aerial bombardment of an iraqi nuclear power facility while condemned by the security council155 was viewed by some as justifiable under international law and the charter156 others argue however that the charter created the security council and entrusted collective security decisions primarily to that body leaving to member states the inherent right to defend themselves only in case of an armed attack157 according to that view the role of the security council under the char ter and selfdefense provi sion in article 51 seem to contradict narrow interpretation of article 24158 that would allow each state to decide for itself when contemplated use of force is within the purpose of the united nations some argue that whatever the original intent of the charter states practice since 1945 has shown the prohibition against the use of force to exist only on paper and voluntary compliance w ith nonproliferati on regimes cannot be counted on to rein in proliferant states and do not in any event apply to nonstate actors bent on

arguing psi is consistent with and step in the implementation of the security council presidential statementrelations in which nations with sufficien t strength were understood to have the power to take selfhelp measures including the use of force to right international wrongs and enforce compliance with international law159 under this view states would be justified in using preventive or preemptive force to deter plans to acquire wmd eliminate acquisition programs or stroy wmd components or sites at any stage in the acquisition effort160 the counterproliferation selfhelp digm is based on the assumption that nonproliferation has become so entrenched in international law that it has reached the status of customary norm161 binding on all states whether or not they have agreed by joining the relevant treaties to desist from developing or acquiring wmd162 under this view any state that persists in the development or acquisition of wmd or permits its c itizens and residents to do so with impunity is committing wrongful act under international law for which other states may demand redress thus although states partie s retained the right to w ithdraw from the treaties upon giving notice participation in the vari ous nonprolifererati on regimes under this view has become jus cogens mandatory and enforceable requirement of international law163 there is some evidence that

of the near universal support for them furthe rmore in making the argument that international law supports the psi the bush administration cited statement by the president of the security council in

role168 finally some suggest that the prolifera tion security initiative may also serve as evidence of the progression of international law with regard to wmd169 although it remains to be seen what actions it will tail and how other nations might react to its implementation however these internati onal developments may not provide evidence sufficient to prove that nonproliferation has emerged as nonderogable norm notably the statement by the security council ex cerpted above may be read as promise to take action but does not say what action the security council might take and does not authorize states to enforce treaty commitments on the part of other states it calls upon states to adhere to their treat commitments and coopera toward further international negotiations related to arms control moreover as statement rather than formally adopted resolution it s less binding force on member states under the charter finally states pr actice does not appear unambiguously to demonstrate that states cons ider themselves bound to halt all activity with regard to wmd testing production or transfer the argument that nonproliferation s achieved the status of customary international law seems more plausible with respect to chemical and biological wmd than with respect to nuclear weapons since the relevant treaties prohibit all possession trade and use of such

economic sanctions interdiction of weapons and the use of military force through the forces of member states177 it also has some options with respect to enforcement178 under its chapter vii authority it could authorize coalition of member states to organize and lead force to carry out specific mandate or it could au thorize an organization such as nato to enforce the action another option would entail the creation of military force similar to the mission to sierra leone179 in any case nine yes votes from the security council are needed with none of the five permanent members exercising their
