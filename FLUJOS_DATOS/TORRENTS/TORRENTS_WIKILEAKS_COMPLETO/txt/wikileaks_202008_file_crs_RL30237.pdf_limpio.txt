the increased volume of forfeiture numerous third parties have been drawn into forfeiture litigation coupled with the complexities of forfeiture litigation and the inconsistencies in the judicial decisions it has been difficult for the innocentthirdparty to justify hisher rights in the seized property prior to the passage of the comprehensive forfeiture act of 1984 all third parties whether asserting legal or equitable basis for relief from an order of criminal forfeiture were required to pursue the remedy of petitioning the attorney general for remission or mitigation of forfeiture1 the determination of these petitions was left entirely to the discretion of the attorney general and was not subject to judicial review2 however congress and the department of justice were not comfortable with this practice and they agreed to create limited exception which is as follows if third party can demonstrate that his interest in the forfeitured property is exclusive of or superior to the interest of the defendant the third partys claim renders that portion of the order of forfeiture reaching his interest invalid the senate judiciary committee strongly agrees with the department of justice that such third parties are entitled to judicial resolution of their claims3 as result congress provided two categories of third party standing to petition the courts to determine the validity of their claims to forfeited assets third party standing to petition the courts exists first where the petitioner had legal interest in the property that at the time of the commission of the acts giving rise to the forfeiture was vested in him rather than the defendant or was superior to the interest of the defendant or second where the petitioner acquired his legal interest after the acts giving rise to the forfeiture but did so in the context of bona fide purchaser for value and had reason to believe that the property was subject to forfeiture4 however for the majority of third parties who assert an equitable rather than legal basis for relief petitioning the attorney general for remission and mitigation remains the exclusive remedy5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30237crs2 6see

counsel the court may appoint counsel to represent that person with respect to the claim for claimants who are not provided with counsel the substitute amendment allows for the recovery of reasonable attorney fees and other costs if they substantially prevail on their claim 4filing deadlines under the current law claim in civil forfeiture action must be filed within ten days after the execution of process and an answer must be filed within twenty days after the filing of claim under hr 1658 and the substitute amendment the current law is retained but both extend the claimants time to file claim following the commencement of an administrative or judicial forfeiture action to 30 days the amendment also codifies current department of justice policy with respect to the time period for sending notice of seizure and establishes 90day period for filing complaint 5release of property for hardship the amendment would allow the property owner to hold on to his property pending the final disposition of the case if he can show that continued possession by the government will cause the owner substantial hardship such as preventing him from working and this hardship outweighs the risk that the property will be destroyed or concealed if returned to the owner during the pendency of the case hr 1658 has similar provision however unlike hr 1658 the substitute adopts the primary safeguards that property owners must have significant ties to the community to provide assurance that the property will not disappear and if certain property such as currency and property particularly suited for use in illegal activities are involved the hardship provision would not apply and the property would not be returned 6criminal proceeds in cases involving lawful goods or lawful services that are sold or provided in an illegal manner the term proceeds is defined in the amendment to mean the amount of money acquired through the illegal transaction resulting in the forfeiture less the direct costs incurred in providing the goods or services an exception is made for cases involving certain health care fraud schemes since it would allow those who provide unnecessary services to deduct the cost of those unnecessary services the amendment extends the governments authority to forfeit criminal proceeds under the civil asset forfeiture lawshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30237crs12
