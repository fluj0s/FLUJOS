taxation of capital income were adopted in the 2001 2003 period these provisions include lower individual tax rates bonus depreciation which allows part of the cost of equipment to be deducted upon acquisition and lower individual income tax rates on dividends and capital gains bonus depreciation has expired but there are some indications such provisions might be included as part of major tax reform the other provisions remain currently in effect this study measures their effect on tax burdens on income from different prospective investments differen tiated by physical type form of finance and sector further provisions of permanent nature enacted in 2004 in bill to eliminate the extraterritorial income eti provision ruled an illegal export subsidy by the world trade organization wto are also discussed effective tax burdens are determined by the statutory tax rate and value of depreciation deductions although the 1986 depreciation revision left income from equipment and structures investments taxed at close to the statutory rate now 35 for large corporations the fall in inflation and legislative changes led to growing differential between these assets with equipment taxed at 26 and buildings taxed slightly above 35 bonus depreciation widens that discrepancy lowering the equipment tax rate to 20 15 for 30 50 bonus depreciation the distortions between debt and equity finance within the corporate sector and between the corporate and noncorporate sector investment are narrowed but only slightly by the changes especially if tax exempt financial holdings through pensions and iras are considered this small effect occurs because bonus depreciation covers all types of equipment investment whether financed by debt or equity and regardless of sector and while dividend and capital gains relief benefits corporate equity individual rate cuts benefit noncorporate investment and debtfinanced corporate investment there is significant reduction in the differential rates on retained earnings and dividends however the reduction in the total tax rate on investment income in the economy is about two to four percentage points for all in dividual tax changes and two to four percentage points for 30 to 50 bonus depreciation the temporary provisions have mixed effects all changes reduce the total tax rate and the current favorable treatment of owneroccupied housing within the business sector the dividend relief provisions lead to more neutral tax system as well but the effects of bonus depreciation lead to less efficiency because the benefits are confined to equipment tax changes in the 2004 tax bill include provisions directed at the manufacturing sector the tax cuts directed at manufacturing would lower tax rates in that industry by about 15 percentage points but they would have negligible effect on the total tax rate lowering it by less than quarter of percentage point the bill also contains other provisions eg benefi tting foreign source investment which would lower tax rates but also include repeal of the eti which would raise rates for the aggregate economy these effects are small although the changes favor some assets and sectors over others this report will be updated for legislative changes httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32099g5g138g153g146g157g138g149g561g11g151g140g152g150g142g561g22g138g161g561g20g142g159g146g156g146g152

2001 tax cut 1 while bonus depreciation was explicitly enacted as temporary provision to stimulate investment in the short run proposals have been made for further extension the dividend and capital gains relief proposal was originally proposed by the president to be permanent and its temporary status like the temporary status of individual tax provisions may be reconsidered individual rate reductions enacted in the 2001 tax cut which were sunsetted but accelerated in 2003 would affect tax burdens of unincorporated businesses directly and of all businesses indirectly through their effects on interest income congress also enacted general corporate tax cuts in bill that terminated the extraterritorial income eti provision of the tax law that has been found to be an illegal export subsidy by the world trade organization wto the european union which brought the claim is currently levying countervailing tariffs on us goods imported into its member states if the tax provision remains 2 after number of proposals were introduced hr 4520 which phased out the eti provision and introduced deduction for manufacturing and certain other production activities this tax revision also included number of other provisions largely directed at business3 1 for summary of the 2001 and 2002 tax cuts see crs report rs20264 tax activity in the 107th congress by jane g gravelle for summary

corporate tax cut for domestic production cut that is larger the greater the fraction that domestic production is of worldwide production s 970 hollings wa s similar bill in the senate chairman thomas of the ways and means committee had proposed bill hr 2896 which would have extended bonus depreciation for year and provided for shorter useful lives for equipment used in manufacturing as well as make variety of changes benefitting firms that invest abroad an d small businesses sen hatch had introduced bill s 1475 that contained many of the provisions of hr 2896 this bill would not only extend bonus depreciation for year but would increase it to 100 then the finance committee chairman grassley and ranking member baucus introduced s 1637 which would among other provisions reduce the tax rate for manuf acturing by 9 through deduction the house bill hr 4520 eliminated the bonus depreciation and depreciation for equipment and substituted corporate rate reduction that had effects similar to the deduction but was limited to corporations the bill also defined eligible firms more broadly the final bill was based on the senate deduction but included the house bills broader industry coverage

number of issues are associated with these tax provisions many of them were directed at short term fiscal stimulus indeed bonus depreciation was expected to work more effectively because it was temporary encouraging firms to invest earlier than they might otherwise have done to take advantage of temporary tax benefit however standard way of evaluating the effects of permanent tax changes that affect the returns to investment is to examine their effects on the allocation of capital the method for examining this issue usually begins with measuring the effective tax rate on the returns to capital invested in different types of assets in the absence of external effects or other market failures capital is allocated most efficiently when all returns are taxed in at the same rate and when financial choices are not influenced by the tax code4 this report focuses on estimating the effects of these basic proposals on effective tax rate or tax burden on earnings and comparing the resulting tax rates across asset types organizational form eg corporations versus unincorporated businesses and source of finance effective tax rates presented in this report are estimated effective rates on income from prospective investments they take into account the timing of deductions and the fact that tax benefit received today is more valuable than tax benefit received in the future because of the time value of money ie money received today can be invested and yield more money in the future see appendix for more detailed explanation these effective tax rates can differ substantially from average tax rates in the economy because the timing of deductions has different and in the long run more powerful effect on tax burdens on new investment than is reflected in average tax rate measures indeed it is possible for effective tax rates on new investments to be negative while average tax rates are positive however it is the effective tax rates on new investment that affect the allocation and size of the capital stock aside from the statutory tax rate the main provision affecting the tax burden on new investment is how quickly the cost of the asset is recovered via depreciation deductions when tax depreciation matches economic depreciation the effect is to tax the return to capital investment income in each period and the effective tax rate is the statutory rate the same effect occurs as long as the present discounted value of depreciation deductions are equal to the present discounted value of economic depreciation deductions 5 two opposing forces can affect depreciation and therefore effective tax rates because depreciation is based on historical acquisition cost the real value of depreciation deductions is undermined by inflation thus higher inflation means higher effective tax rates6 this inflation effect other things equal raises the effective tax rate more for shorter lived in vestments than for longer lived ones however depreciation deductions are generally allowed more quickly than the rate that would be justified by economic decline and that tendency is particularly pronounced in the case of equipment which increases the deductions value and leads to lower effective tax rate most equipment assets for example have their costs deducted in five to seven years although they last much 4 market failure is technical term which indicates not that markets do not function but that they do not function perfectly so that prices represent true resource costs in practice market failures are numerous but in most cases are small or cannot be easily determined and quantified and thus make effective government intervention difficult or capable of worsening rather than improving the market failures 5 the present discounted value is the value of future dollar discounted by dividing it by 1rt where r is the interest rate and t is the time period for depreciation all of the values are summed up 6 higher inflation can however benefit debt financed investment if the tax rate of the firm is higher than the tax rate of the creditor because nominal rather than real interest is deducted

buildings are deducted over 39 years although residential structures are deducted over 275 years tax rates can be measured in different ways the tax rate at the corporate level on equity financed investment which is calculated in the next section shows the effects of depreciation rules across assets types eg computing equipment buildings effective corporate tax rates can also be measured as the total tax at both the corporate and personal level which also reflects the deductibility of interest by corporations and the imposition of individual income taxes on interest dividends and capital gains this measure indicates the change in the total burden on corporate investment it can also be compared with tax rates on noncorporate investment to measure the differential between the total tax on investment in the corporate and noncorporate sectors as well as federal income taxes on owneroccupied housing which tend to be around zero tax rates can also be separated into total rates on debt financed and equity financed investment to examine the degree of distortion that favors debt finance ta x rates also affect the dividend payout choice arising from differential treatment of retained earnings which give rise to capital gains and dividends finally the overall tax rate in the economy which requires weighting by asset type can affect savings decisions

the tax reform act of 1986 was to tax the earnings from different types of capital investment more evenly than had been the case in the past before 1986 with the statutory corporate income tax rate at 46 effective tax rates on earnings taking into account depreciation and statutory tax rates but not debt finance were less than 10 for most equipment assets while they were about 35 to 40 for buildings after the 1986 act the statutory rate was reduced to 34 but depreciation was altered and the investment tax credit repealed as result equipment tax rates were only slightly below the statutory rate about 32 and buildings slightly above it still about 35 to 40 oil and gas structural investments which include investment in the acquisition of reserves though purchase or lease and exploration and intangible drilling costs continued their favorable historical treatment 7 the rationale for equal taxation is straightforward private markets will allocate investment to different types of capital to produce the highest aftertax returns absent external effects these private market choices will lead to the most productive capital stock only if returns to assets are taxed at the same rates in that case the pretax or social rates of return will be equal across investments and increase can be achieved by shifting investment from one type to another in the ensuing 17 years since the passage of the 1986 act tax legislation and economic effects have reintroduced significant difference betw een tax burdens on earnings from investments in equipment and structures this differential is increased by bonus depreciation which would further favor the allocation of capital to equipment temporary subsidy should not have lasting 7 the beneficial treatment of mineral investment largely in oil and gas arises from provisions that allow much of the cost including unproductive tracts and wells as well as all intangible drilling costs supplies labor etc to be deducted immediately the deduction of losses while consistent with accounting rules is subsidy because the cost of unproductive tracts and wells is part of the cost of finding productive ones and should be in theory deducted over the useful life of productive properties httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32099g5g138g153g146g157g138g149g561g11g151g140g152g150g142g561g22g138g161g561g20g142g159g146g156g146g152

making bonus depreciation permanent legislative changes increased effective tax rates especially for buildings in 1993 the top corporate tax rate was increased by one percentage point relatively neutral change that raised most tax rates by approximately one percentage point the 1993 legislation also however increased the useful life for nonresidential buildings commercial structures and some industrial structures from 315 years to 39 years although this change was large in terms of the writeoff period its effect on effective tax rates on earnings from the affected assets was relatively small raising the tax rates of these assets by another percentage point tax rates on earnings for all assets fell however because of the decline in inflation which now averages around 2 but was projected to be around 5 in 1986 the fall in inflation rate reduces the effective tax rate on the return to short lived assets much more than on long lived assets and thus favors equipment thus while the corporate rate increase was relatively neutral the depreciation change penalized buildings and the drop in inflation while benefitting all assets benefitted equipment and shorter lived assets the most 8 the resulting effective tax rates reflecting permanent depreciation rules are shown in the first column of effective tax rates in tables 1 and 2 while buildings are taxed at rates slightly above the statutory rate equipment is taxed at rates well below it on average equipment effective tax rates are only 26 or about three quarters of the statutory rate structures overall are taxed at 32 but that average reflects favorable treatment for mining farm and public utility structures the latter are generally treated as equipment in the tax law buildings are taxed at rates in excess of the statutory rate tables 1 and 2 also illustrate the effects of the various levels of bonus depreciation the 30 bonus depreciation reduces effective tax rates for equipment on average from 26 to 20 the 50 bonus depreciation reduces the rate to 15 unlike incentives such as investment credits bonus depreciation cannot reduce tax rates on equity investment below zero 100 bonus depreciation leads to zero rate g22g145g142g561g6g142g139g157g561g7g154g158g146g157g162g561g6g146g156g157g152g155g157g146g152g151g561 another issue particularly related to dividend and capital gains relief is the differential tax treatment within the corporate sector of debt versus equity financed capital debt is favored at the corporate level because corporations deduct interest payments however equity is favored at the individual level because capital gains tax rates are lower taxes are deferred not due until the stock is sold and are never paid if shares are passed on at death individual taxes on the return to capital are also reduced because they are imposed on profits after the corporate tax and thus the corporate tax is effectively deductible from the individual tax base for an individual in the 30 tax bracket for example the tax on interest income is 30 for dollar of earnings but the 8 that the large shift in depreciation lives has relatively modest effect on structures and the inflation drop is more beneficial for short lived assets may seem counterintuitive however an absolute change in the present value of depreciation has larger effect on short lived assets tax burdens than on long lived ones one way of thinking about this is to consider that short lived asset has to be replaced more frequently and any burden or benefit repeated more often thus even though the effect of increasing useful life has significant effect on present value its effect on long lived asset is still limited similarly even though inflation reduces the present value of depreciation absolutely more for longer lived assets its effect on tax burden is still greater than for shorter lived assets

existence of tax favored forms of individual investment through pensions and iras where individual tax rates are effectively zero if these effects are taken into the account current tax rates are lower and the effect of changes in individual tax rates less important since these pension funds and ira account managers whether or not self directed can also choose between debt and equity the case

effects of bonus depreciation in each case in each case the debtequity distortion has been reduced but the reduction is small because both debt and equity benefit from lower individual tax rates and from bonus depreciation in comparing tax rates with large discrepancies and particularly negative rates more meaningful comparison is the tax wedge or the excess by which the pretax return must exceed fixed after tax return which is measured by t1t where t is the tax rate thus under current law without considering pension effects debt financed return must exceed the after tax return by 19 0161016

are smaller in fact negligible for the individual rate changes the initial gap change is about the same but the change is 2 which closes about one thirtieth of the gap the effect of bonus depreciation is about 5 and the combined effects about 11 if the pension and ira case is taken to be the most reasonable one then there is very minimal effect on the distortion between debt and equity due to individual rate changes not only because they benefit both debt and equity but also because the changes are quite small 9 not too much attention should be given to the precise measures as contrasted

treatment of retained earnings by lowering the tax rate on dividends to the tax rate on capital gains under permanent law the tax on dollar of dividends was the marginal tax rate of the individual which could be as high as 396 the top tax on capital gains is fixed at 20 for those in the permanent 28 or higher brackets 10 however the effective rate on gains is lowered because tax is deferred until the stock is sold deferring the tax by an estimated average of five years leads to tax rate of 1811 moreover since crs has found that approximately half of these gains are held until death and not taxed the rate is about 9 this spread is greatly narrowed by the dividend relief provision which lowers both rates to 15 the tax rate on capital gains falls to about 7 but the gap between the 15 dividend rate and the new 7 rate is much smaller than the gap between the 28 to 396 rates and the 9 rate in prior law however these preexisting distortions and the magnitude of the reduction due to the dividend rate would be reduced by half if the assets held in nontaxable accounts such as pensions and iras were included

which is ppropriate to compare with marginal dollar of dividends in calculating other tax rates in this analysis the tax rate on real inflation adjusted gains is used which is higher

manufacturing as well as favor manufacturing in general the overall effects on tax burdens are small however because these provisions would have covered only manufacturing equipment estimated to be about 20 to 25 of equipment assets and about 10 of combined equipment and structures for manufacturing overall equipment is about third of reproducible capital so the overall rate reduction in the industry is about 15 percentage points with bonus depreciation see appendix for data sources on asset allocation since manufacturing represents about 25 of the overall corporate capital stock the

lower effective tax rates but they do not apply to investment in general these provisions would reduce effective tax rates and there would also be an offset due to the repeal of the eti senator hatchs bill s 1495 was similar to hr 2896 but proposed 100 expensing which would reduce equipment investment tax rates to zero as in hr 2896 however this provision would be temporary extension bill cosponsored by representatives crane and rangel hr 1769 and similar senate bill s 970 hollings would have provided deduction of up to 10 percent of income from domestic production the deduction would have been multiplied by the share of the total business that is domestic thus the deduction for total income would be multiplied by the share domestic squared if 50 of firms output was domestic its effective rate for domestic earnings would be 5 and the effective deduction overall would be 25 10 x05 2 tax paid on foreign source income is often received by the foreign government rather than the

lower the tax rate on manufacturing by 9 or to approximately 32 and since it applies to domestic income will be similar to the rate in the crane and rangel bill reduction in corporate tax rate to 32 would reduce effective tax rates on manufacturing structures by close to three percentage point s it would reduce the rate on manufacturing equipment by about 25 percentage points with bonus depreciation and by 16 percentage points under 50 bonus depreciation for this industr therefore it would narrow the difference between equipment and structures while of course favoring investment in domestic manufacturing in general since about third of manufacturing assets are in equipment and third in structures the overall effect on manufacturing plant and equipment investment would be similar to the depreciation provisions in the 2003 thomas bill at the firm level investment in inventories would however also benefit at the same time the depreciation provision applies to debt financed investment but the rate reduction does not benefit debt overall manufacturing investment would have reduction in effective tax rate of about 15 percentage points about the same as the depreciation speedup thus as in the case of the depreciation provision the reduction in the total tax rate in the economy would be less than quarter of percent the final bill would have slightly larger overall reduction in tax rate in the economy because it would apply to broader range of productive qual ified production activities income is allowed deduction from taxable income of 9 3 in 20052006 6 in 20072009 the deduction cannot exceed total taxable income of the firm and is limited to 50 of wages production property is property manufactured produced grow n or extracted within the united states and includes domestic film energy and construction and engineering and architectural services the law specifically excludes the sale of food and beverages prepared at retail establishment transmission and distribution of electricity gas and water and receipts from property leased licensed or rented to related party the 50 wage limit excludes sole proprietorships where wages are paid in letter dated september 22 2004 to mark prator and patrick heck responding to query about the similar although slightly different senate version of the provision the joint tax committee indicated that three quarters of the benefit would have gone to corporations 12 would have gone to subchapter s firms smaller incorporated firms that elect to be treated as partnerships and cooperatives 9 would have gone to partnerships and 4 to sole proprietorships based on the revenue estimates 3 billion for 2006 and projected corporate tax receipts of 249 billion for that year the implication is that around third of corporate activity qualifies thus the overall effect on the economy is somewhat larger perhaps closer to ½ of one percent although still quite small the effects of these two approaches faster depreciation of equipment as compared to rate cut are similar in some ways they are about the same aggregate size and both relatively small for the economy as whole both provisions reduce taxes in the manufacturing sector and favor that industry over others but since manufacturing is largely corporate both measures reduce corporate taxes overall whether the corporate rate itself is specified or more general tax reduction allowed while the magnitudes of the bills reduction on manufacturing and on the economy in general are similar the approaches differ in some ways the accelerated depreciation for equipment increases the favoritism for equipment re lative to structures in this sector and does nothing to reduce the debtequity distortion while the corporate rate cut reduces the differences between tax rates across assets as well as reducing the distortion for debt the cranerangel bill would have also encouraged more investment in th united states relative to the other

would however be much easier to administer and would have more bang for the buck ie decrease tax burdens at smaller revenue cost because it would apply only to returns to new investment note however that this comparison relates only to these two aspects of the proposals the bills contained provisions in several other areas including repeal of eti the extension of bonus depreciation has already been noted but the 2003 house bill would also have reduced the depreciation period for leasehold improvements and restaurants which would lower tax rates on this group of structures investments which are cu rrently subject to relatively high rates these effects are difficult to measure but would be small this provision was included on temporary basis in the final legislation there were provisions in the 2003 house bill aimed at small business including lower inframarginal corporate tax rate and temporary increase in the amount of equipment investment that can be deducted on acquisition these provisions are inframarginal for some firms and would not have effects on investment the rate reduction would encourage investment in small corporations and the extension of expensing would favor investment in equipment for certain small businesses this extension of expensing was made on temporary basis in the final legislation but the lower corporate rate cuts were not to the extent that small businesses tend to be unincorporated the favorable treatment of the noncorporate sector would be increased as would the favorable treatment of equipment in those businesses there are number of provisions that would significantly reduce the tax on income from investment overseas foreign investments are currently favored in some cases and penalized in others and would address some tax shelter issues finally there are provisions affecting carryovers of losses application of the alternative minimum tax and temporary extension of the rd tax credit it is very difficult to quantify these effects s 1637 also contained additional provisions but the focus on more limited number of foreign tax revisions overall hr 2896 lost 128 billion over 10 years according to the joint committee on taxation while s 1637 is roughly revenue neutral the final bill was roughly revenue neutral and contained number of international provisions

mixed effect in that they magnify some existing distortions while reducing others 14 all capital income tax cuts reduce the distortion that favors consumption over investment although it is by means clear that tax cuts for capital income increase saving because of offsetting income and substitution effects15 and debt financed tax 13 this issue is beyond the scope of this paper but basically if the objective is to maximize us economic welfare provision to encourage domestic investment would help to achieve that objective if the objective is to maximize worldwide efficiency the incentive to invest abroad may or may not reduce efficiency depending on how heavily capital income is taxed abroad relative to its tax burden in the united states 14 distorting taxes may be considered appropriate to maximize economic efficiency if there are external effects that justified these interventions however there is little consensus that these effects are significant or can be determined in way that could inform policy full discussion is outside the scope of this paper but see the discussion of justifications for nonneutral taxation in jane g gravelle the economic effects of taxing capital income cambridge mit press 1994 pp 6073 15 while the higher rate of return with lower tax has pr ice effect that encourages individuals to substitute future consumption for present consumption the higher overall incomes allow both present and future consumption to increase the effect on savings is ambiguous in theory and has not been settled by empirical evidence

rate any capital income tax cut also reduces the favorable treatment of owner occupied housing in looking at the allocation of business capital the dividend relief provision seems most consistent with economic efficiency because it reduces distortions affecting payout choices choice of finance and sectoral allocation wit hout magnifying any existing distortions reducing individual tax rates magnifies existing distortions by favoring debt finance and noncorporate investment bonus depreciation if made permanent has aspects that detract from efficiency by expanding the favorable treatment of the returns from equipment investments relative to returns from investment in structures while doing little to reduce financial or sectoral distortions the revisions in the bills addressing the eti provision favor manufacturing and other eligible activities when accomplished via equipment depreciation they would have expanded the favorable treatment of equipment within that sector the overall effects outside of that sector are very small however of course there are other issues aside from the efficiency considerations that might be considered in making the temporary provisions permanent or in enacting new ones many of these provisions particularly bonus depreciation were originally aimed at short run stimulus of the economy an investment subsidy such as bonus depreciation is more effective stimulus if it is temporary and making it permanent might undermine the credibility of the government and hamper its ability to manage fiscal policy in the future that is the effectiveness of temporary investment stimulus depends on investors believing it to be temporary and if the government transforms the current temporary stimulus into permanent one firm managers may be less likely to believe that another temporary stimulus enacted in the future will actually be temporary capital income taxes play an important role in the revenue base and the overall distribution of tax burdens which might be considered some tax revisions may add to administrative costs while others reduce those costs and others such as changing rates are largely neutral for example tax rate cuts confined to manufacturing create classification issue for firms or related firms that engage in activities both within and without manufacturing these tax rate cuts require allocation rules that may add significantly to both administrative costs and opportunities for tax sheltering

are calculated by first determining given required aftertax return and an expected rate of decline in productivity of the asset due to depreciation how much the investment must initially produce in order for the sum of profits after tax over time discounted by the aftertax return to equal the individual investment outlay ie to break even then all of the tax payments and deduction are eliminated and the before profit flows are used to determine what pretax discount rate would sum the flows to original cost the effective tax rate is the pretax rate of return minus the after tax rate of return divided by the pretax rate discounting means dividing each flow by discount factor for flow earned year from now the discount factor is 1 r for flow earned two years from now 1 r 2 for flow three years from now 1 r3 where r is the discount rate in practice however the analysis uses continuous time method with continuous compounding the formula derived from this method is 1 r r d1 uz 1 u d where r is the pretax return r is the after taxdiscount rate of the corporation d is the economic depreciation rate u is the statutory tax rate and z is the present value of depreciation deductions discounted at r π where π is the inflation rate the effective tax rate for equity at the firm level is r r r when including individual level taxes and debt finance the tax rate is measured by determining r as above where r fi1 u π 1 fe where f is the share debt financed i is the nominal interest rate and is the real return to equity before individual tax but after corporate tax is equal to

the total tax rate is r r r for more complete description of the methodology and data sources including useful lives for depreciation purposes formulas for measuring z and the allocation of assets in the economy see jane g gravelle the economic effects of taxing capital income cambridge ma mit press 1994 for purposes of this analysis the following assumptions were made the interest rate is 75 the inflation is 2 and the real return to equity before individual taxes is 7 with 4 or 57 of real profits paid as dividends the corporate rate is 35 the average individual marginal tax rate on investment income is 26 under permanent law and 23 under the lower individual rates data consistent with calculations in the national bureau of economic research taxsim model tax rates on dividends fall from 26 to 15 and the statutory tax rate on capital gains falls from 20 to 15 one half of corporate stock is sold and the remaining half held until death the holding period is five years half of financial assets are held in tax exempt forms such as pensions and iras data to calculate domestic shares of income for purpose of analyzing the cranerangel bill data on receipts and assets for controlled
