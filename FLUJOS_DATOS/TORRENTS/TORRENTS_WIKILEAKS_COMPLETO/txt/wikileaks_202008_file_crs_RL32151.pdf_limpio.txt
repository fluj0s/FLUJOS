there are number of competing definitions of preciselywhattransformationisthetermgenerallyreferstoadramaticchangeora quantum leap ahead in military power due to technological advances new war fighting concepts and organizational cha nges or perhaps more precisely in this context transformation refers to the process whereby the us military seeks to remake itself by incorpora ting these new technologies or finding concepts andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32151crs6 organizational changes with the ultimate goal of generating dramatic increases in militarypower inrecentdecadesscholarshaveidentifiednumerousinstancesinhistorywhere militaryforceshavetransformedthemselvesandtherebysecuredmilitaryadvantage at least for time some commonly cited historical examples

cold war the question that the congress especiallyem phasized that the department of defense had to answer was is the same set of forces the same doctrine the same set of practices that characterize the cold war for the better part of half century appropriate to the challenges the united states will face in the decades ahead i think most people agree probably not that there will be some changes perhaps someverysubstantialchangesinallof theaboveasthedepartmentmovesforward one of the critical corollaries i would argue is that transformation is not let underscore not exclusively perhaps not

you couldnt just draft people and tell them what to do you actually had to get them to be enthusiastic by your leadership as to their task at hand the fact that today it is something that every major

department needs to contend to which it must react iwant to comment on thosein just asecond second in terms of taking stock i think one of the lessons one of the take awaysfromthepresentsituation themobilizationofthereserveforcesintheunited states is that the reserves are todaya complete volunteer force too the mind set that people may once have had about the r eserves these were somehow people evading military service wh ich was hallmark of the draft era people who were reluctantly serving there as opposed to on active duty thats not true of the reserves today and you can see it in the fact that we have mobilized well over 250000 americans often on short notice i nvariablyat great personal difficultyin terms of suddenly being uprooted from the ir family and civil life sometimes at substantial financial sacrifice we have not had im proud to say any significant issue raised by reserves being called to active duty speaking frankly weve had more issues with grumpyemployers writingand saying gee im little unhappy my person is being called up ive actua lly had situations where the person is pleading dont let my employer stan d in the way of my serving the country i
