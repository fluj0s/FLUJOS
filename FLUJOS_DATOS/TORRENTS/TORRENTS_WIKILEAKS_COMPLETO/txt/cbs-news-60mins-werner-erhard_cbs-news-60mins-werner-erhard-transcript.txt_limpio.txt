werner erhard produced by david gelber ed bradley since the 1970s some sevenhundredthousand people have signed up for selfimprovement called est or as its now called the forum est was the brainchild of former usedcar salesman named jack rosenberg back in the sixties rosenberg deserted his wife and four children in philadelphia changed his name to werner hans erhard and moved to california where he started another family and came up with the idea for est in nutshell erhards message was this if you are in rut the problem isnt your parents your boss or the system its you take responsibility erhard said and you can transform your life overnight who was the role model the living example of what the est training could do who else but werner erhard man some of his employees say thought of himself as god werner erhard lecture clip i didnt arrive at the opportunity to make the world work for everyone by figuring out how to do it dont you get that nothing transformational occurs that way ed bradley of course there were skeptics who wondered how salesman with checkered past and formal education past highschool could transform peoples lives but thousands believed they did benefit from erhards message one of them was emmywinning actress valerie harper valerie harper emmy acceptance speech thank you for loving rhoda and personal um personal thanks very private ones to someone who has profoundly influenced my life uh werner erhard thank you and good night ed bradley erhard was so popular in hollywood that someone once suggested studio be renamed werner brothers erhards empire grew to include highpowered corporate consulting business that charges some of the biggest companies in america fortythousand dollars year for each executive it trains werner erhard clip lecturing to executives organizations dont work because people dont know that the job in an organization is ninetynine bullbleeped ed bradley voiceover within his own organization erhard attracted an inner circle of people who were devoted to him wendy drucker was top manager who worked closely with erhard for nine years ed bradley did it feel like cult to you wendy drucker i would never have believed that i could be person who would wind up in cult i thought that those were the people down at the airport you know with the tambourines and yet certainly mind control was involved and if thats what cults do and they set up leader to be bigger than anybody else godlike figure i would say yes that was true in the organization ed bradley did he encourage you folks to think of him as something more than an ordinary man wendy drucker absolutely absolutely we were told to surrender to him as source i think thats idolatry ed bradley did he ever say things like that to you i am the source dr bob larzelere oh yes to the whole staff at staff meetings sure i am the source ed bradley voiceover dr bob larzelere was the head of erhards counseling staff for seven years during the 1970s dr bob larzelere now you could interpret that as i am the source of est which he of course he was he also made it clear that it was little more than that from time to time ed bradley how so dr bob larzelere i am god ed bradley i beg your pardon dr bob larzelere i am god he could he had he did say sometimes in staff meetings i cant document this and you know i took this i said i would do this interview so long as this wasnt about punishing werner and im not about punishing werner what im trying to point out is my willingness my absolute willingness to become his soldier the person who would do whatever he asked for his approval for his love thats how desperate i was and didnt really know it then ed bradley but you say he actually said i am god he didnt say im like god or im godlike dr bob larzelere i would not sign statement saying that he said exactly that it was the implication i am source and you know he mentioned the message was i am god wendy drucker this was not like being an employee this was like being servant or devotee ed bradley voiceover was erhard worthy of devotion after all he freely admitted hed once deserted his wife and children but then the story went by practicing what he preached he turned his life around he reconciled with his first family after thirteen years and brought them to san francisco in est publications erhard appeared to be caring father for all of his children one brochure featured loving portrait of erhard with his second wife ellen one of the selling points for est and the forum has been if erhards could turn his own life around then the forum could turn yours around too larry king clip from larry king live what is the forum werner erhard its program of inquiry into the things that concern people on very everyday basis like breaking through the ordinary barriers that just go along with children and your relationship with your children at certain ages ed bradley and what about his relationship with his own children celeste erhard i have been afraid deeply afraid of my father my whole life my whole life ed bradley voiceover celeste erhard is werner erhards oldest daughter from his second marriage celeste erhard crying its funny because you almost feel stupid that youre afraid of him but hes terrifying man he can be very terrifying ed bradley voiceover just how terrifying dawn damas was the familys governess and is still close friend she says she saw erhard assault his st john or sinjin as hes called when the boy was only twelve dawn damas he started to ask st john about school and started to notice st johns grades and got livid and went over to sinjin and started to slap him and hit him and picked him up and threw him on the ground and started to kick him in front of everybody and nobody moved everyone was paralyzed um and then said to st john if you ever get grades like this again ill break both of your legs with baseball bat ed bradley and one said word one made move to stop him dawn damas which is um hard for to believe except that i was there and i didnt either ed bradley voiceover werner erhard declined to talk to 60 minutes but he did speak to reporter john hubner of the san jose mercury news for an article in west the papers sunday magazine in the audiotaped interview erhard flatly denied he ever hit sinjin werner erhard audiotaped interview i hit sinjin john hubner not ever around in

but he told us the beating did take place and that he wasnt the only family member to be victim of werners abuse his mother was too erhard didnt live with his family but once month or so he would summon his wife and children to come here to his san francisco headquarters for meeting attended by his inner circle erhards daughter adair recalls time about thirteen years ago when at one of those meetings he launched into jealous rage toward his wife adair erhard he accused her of having an affair with this man which was totally untrue at one point someone picked up statue and hit her over the head um you know my dad constantly saying what arent you saying what arent you saying ed bradley and you saw your mom physically attacked by your father and others adair erhard mm hmm yeah he himself also got up and while she was on the floor and kicked her number of times ed bradley voiceover the assault on ellen erhard her daughters say went on for two nights ed bradley did you try to stop them celeste erhard at one point on the second night i did stand up and say please youre killing her youre killing her i mean my mother was blue her face was blue she had like drool coming out of the side of her mouth she was dying she was you know suffocating and all he said to was sit down or youll get more of the same and that is direct quote i remember every word and thats all he said and i sat

this consultant was the man who was doing the actual choking ed bradley and he worked for your father adair erhard yes ed bradley voiceover bob larzelere is the one who choked ellen erhard dr bob larzelere and finally he said somebodys got to volunteer to hurt ellen to punish her and make her talk and make her confess and nobody did until i thought oh my god this is an opportunity for finally to get werners total approval now i can be real soldier for him now i can make him proud of now i can get him to smile at now i wont have to be afraid of him anymore so i volunteered ed bradley why did you choke her dr bob larzelere to scare her into confessing its like you know why do people torture other people to get the truth ed bradley what did he say did he say bob youre going too far dr bob larzelere he didnt see he didnt stop i was doing what he wanted to do he didnt try to stop he didnt try to stop i mean at all ed bradley today what would you say to her dr bob larzelere that it was despicable thing to do and it took days to realize it afterward when i began to let myself feel again it was my god it was like nightmare that i could have gone that far with wanting to please wanting to get approval from wanting to get love from another human being to do that ed bradley voiceover according to several witnesses that ordeal didnt end ellens punishment her daughters say erhard wouldnt allow her to live with them for two years and thats not all adair erhard she had to come into our house and and be like the maid scrub the floors and we had to watch this and my dad made her do these things ed bradley she didnt live with you for two years adair erhard well you know she didnt live with us for two years but i saw her like when she came in to clean the house but we

whatever he said that she should do she had to do and that was part of the instructions yeah you have to be maid for your house ed bradley and what would you do then adair erhard sigh i dont even remember i just its like i wanted to say something so bad or just do something about it and theres its just so petrified all the time and theres just way i could be okay with myself to to tell anybody or to do anything about what was going on ed bradley voiceover at about the same time this was going on erhard was busy teaching thousands how to improve their relationships as for his daughters accusations of how he treated his wife back then erhard says it never happened werner erhard audiotaped interview essentially nonsense ellen was never maid ellen was my wife and i always treated her like my wife ed bradley voiceover ellen erhard divorced her husband two years ago as part of the divorce settlement shes agreed not to talk publicly about their marriage ed bradley does your mother know that youre talking to us adair erhard yeah um before we left tonight i talked to her and shes just you know she said i cant thank you enough for doing this for saying these things that need to be said and i know that she wishes she could do the same ed bradley voiceover deborah rosenberg is one of erhards daughters from his first marriage shes never spoken publicly about her father before but she told us that her father sexually abused her deborah rosenberg i dont have problem saying that it happened i dont like describing it um but i dont have problem admitting that he molested ed bradley how old were you deborah rosenberg i was sixteen ed bradley has your father ever sexually abused any of your siblings deborah rosenberg yes and it runs from i dont know maybe you want to call it pornography all the way to rape ed bradley rape deborah rosenberg yes ed bradley what happened deborah rosenberg um i wasnt there but i believe my sister when she says that my father raped her ed bradley she told you what happened deborah rosenberg yes ed bradley and what did she say happened deborah rosenberg she says that they were on trip together and um they had come back after dinner and he had very large suite and um they were reading magazine together and you know id rather not go specifically into you know the details but um he forcibly had sexual intercourse with her ed bradley this is incest youre deborah rosenberg yes i know that ed bradley voiceover deborah says her sister about eleven years ago while she was in her early twenties in his taped interview erhard brought up the rape issue and said it never happened werner erhard audiotaped interview ed bradley playing section of audiotape in front of deborah rosenberg just plain not true just plain not true and anybody who would say something it has got to be sick uh deborah rosenberg um that sounds like typical response um what he did say when i confronted him about it was that there had been sexual intercourse and that it had been nurturing experience for my sister ed bradley he admitted it deborah rosenberg he admitted that there was sexual intercourse and that it was nurturing experience he said that i did not rape her ed bradley youre very clear on this deborah rosenberg yes ed bradley so hes saying that she consented deborah rosenberg yes ed bradley have you talked with her about this deborah rosenberg oh yeah extensively ed bradley and deborah rosenberg it was not nurturing experience for her and shes had to have lot of therapy about that ed bradley she didnt consent deborah rosenberg she didnt ed bradley they said some pretty terrible things about their father dawn damas they said some true things about their father that are terrible ed bradley what do you have against this man dawn damas theres something about the fact that he is still out there doing all this and people still believe in him this man still gets people sitting in an audience looking up at him believing that what he says is just so wonderful werner erhard clip lecturing to audience i can see for myself that the world can work for everyone dawn damas and this man does relationships on seminars and he beats his wife and beats his children and rapes daughter and then he goes and tells people how to have marvelous relationships ed bradley why are you going against him now in such public forum celeste erhard i kept thinking that he would be father i kept thinking that when he got older hed want children and hed want his daughters i just i i really thought that you know that maybe hed get wiser with age and hed regret what hed done but um he didnt ed bradley this week erhards lawyers sent us affidavits from erhards sister and brother and from few of his close associates disputing some of the stories we heard from his children and denying that erhard ever abused his wife and we also heard from erhard he sent us statement which said simply there is only one appropriate response to these allegations to heal and restore my family and that is what i will do to respond to the accusations at this time would only further publicly exploit my family and there has already been enough of that he has also presumably had enough of his seventymillion dollar year business few weeks ago he sold it to group of his employees
