scobey for reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary on july 2 senator kerry and the ambassador discussed regional developments with president hosni mubarak including zimbabwe sudan iraq iran and israelpalestine mubarak said that egypt was working to find solution in sudan but preferred to do so quietly mubarak warned against precipitous us withdrawal from iraq while he called iranians liars and said they sponsor terrorism he opined that arab state would join the us in formal defense alliance against iran for fear of retaliation mubarak expressed frustration with the israelipalestinian peace process and was particularly disparaging about the lack of palestinian unity end summary au soft on mugabe 2 c in 60minute meeting with president mubarak in sharm elsheikh senator kerry began by asking for mubaraks views on the discussions at the african union summit which had concluded in sharm elsheikh the previous day mubarak said he had been at the summit until late in the evening and was tired he reported that some member states had condemned zimbabwean president robert mugabe while others told him to form national unity government and find role for the opposition parties mubarak said he couldnt prevent mugabe from attending the conference in egypt because zimbabwe is member of the african union he said the british were behind this big fuss and that the pressure from other african leaders was sufficiently soft that mugabe can do what he wants sudan quiet diplomacy is best 3 c in response to senator kerrys query about the situation in sudan mubarak said the issue was not discussed publicly at the au summit he also said this issue could have been worked out if it were not debated so publicly because two tribes always work things out mubarak noted egypts attempts to try and help the sudanese people through the egyptian hospital in sudan and the efforts of egis director omar suleiman to advise on northsouth negotiations iraq dont pull out too soon 4 c turning to iraq senator kerry asked mubarak if he had changed his opinion of prime minister maliki after iraqs successful stabilization efforts in basra and sadr city mubarak said he i am not critical he came to cairo i gave him my phone number but he hasnt called us he noted that egypt offered to host and train iraqi forces but that the offer had not been acted upon by the iraqis he said the us cannot withdraw until you strengthen the armed forces and police until then you have to stay beware the iranians 5 c mubaraks top concern for the stability of iraq and the region is iran he believes that as result of the invasion of iraq iran is spreading everywhere he urged the us to be wary of what iran says they are big fat liars and justify their lies because they believe it is for higher purpose he said he believes this opinion is shared by other leaders in the region nonetheless he opined that arab state will join the us in defense relationship visavis iran out of fear of sabotage and iranian terrorism he said irans sponsorship of terrorism is wellknown but i cannot say it publicly it would create dangerous situation mubarak said that sanctions are the best hope for containing iran but arab states wont dare to endorse them not optimistic on the peace process 6 c on the middle east peace process mubarak said he sees progress between syria and israel and doesnt expect any progress between israel and the pa leadership he said that palestinians are quarrelling and hamas and other factions will reject any agreement made by abu mazen senator kerry cairo 00001637 002 of 002 suggested the parties appeared to be close in some areas in response mubarak reiterated he doesnt believe the many palestinian factions will reach agreement and thus they only serve to undermine abu mazens efforts 7 c this cable was not cleared by codel kerry scobey
