attack and gpms lecture given on 21 october 1963 thank you well whats the date audience twentyfirst male voice october octubre veintiuno huh male voice si ad 13 the reason youre getting this lecture on monday instead of on tuesday is because along about thursday i have to wear the washington legal hats and go up and solve their various difficulties for them and the situation is that ive got to go up wednesday afternoon and so forth so youll get your lectures oddly on odd days this week all of which is bunch of nonsense its spectacle of people defending defending you know you can defend yourself into more holes and it just never occurred to them on this one suit that has been going for about five years to attack anybody oh thatd be very dangerous you know ohhohooooo very dangerous you know oooohoh dont attack anybody its silly look at the situation every time the enemy offers an attack you defend against it and thats all you do any castle to hold out has got to sortie the proper strategy for any battle is to find weak point in the enemy lines and attack it the reason the united states is losing against communism is simply on these same mathematics that they are losing is patent all theyre doing is defending the points attacked oh several years agoon thethis berlin thing before it really came up to hot boil you know the united states has nois not claiming any piece over there anyplace and so is neverto be ablegoing to be able to swap berlin for anything the proper action is to go find something to collect you see as piece thats proper action yet there they stand defending defending defending defending well dont they want to win how about an auditor that sits there and defends and defends and defends and defends and defends against the attack of pc how about it and he never looks for the bypassed charge he never does anything effective to straighten out the ease he just sits there and defends himself well hed last about two minutes about the most dangerous thing you can do look it over its the most unthetan thing you can do certainly you can defend to certain degree and you have to defend to certain degree but use seventyfive percent of your energies to attack and youll always win find weak spot and attack it thats the point thats the point and attack expertly and attack perfectly and dont flub with the attack thats all always put your concentration on the attack and you win every time people look awful silly two miles in your rear without any supplies without any ammunitionwith supplies with defenses and place to go they attacked all right the whole front of the battle shifts they attacked and you didnt defend you went and destroyed their supply dump its very embarrassing to have this sort of thing happen you see now the whole of life is an interchange if youre going to live its an interchange an interchange activity its putting out anchor points and lets look at the gradient scale of how you would go about this supposing youre just there all by yourself and theres limitation to your putting out anchor points right and you can put out anchor points theres limitation to this you can put out as many anchor points as you like you see somebody else shows up and they say you shouldnt put out these anchor points or i want to make some of thisi want to have some of this space too and they put out anchor points against your anchor points so you dont put out anchor points quite so far you seetalking about the factors now all right and lets supposing that every time you put out an anchor point why somebody else forbade you to put out the anchor point and you complied and agreed and didnt put out your anchor point how big do you think you would be after while thats about how big you are now see thats practically the way you got therethe way you got there theres nothing quite as disturbing and theres nothing quite so certain to throw anybody into apathy is just continue to put out your anchor points its the most disturbing activity that you can engage on everybody says you mustnt put out your anchor points and you put out your anchor points then they give you lots of reasons why you shouldnt put out your anchor points and you put out anchor points they bring all sorts of duress to bear on you why you shouldnt put out your anchor points and you put out anchor points whats going to happen to their morale see now sometimes its very difficult to continue to put out anchor points in this particular way sometimes you just get cut to ribbons and its those particular times that you got cut to ribbons you tend to remember as lessons not to attack or lessons not to put out anchor points now the gradient scale on the thing goes put out anchor pointsin other words continue to create your spaceto attacking that which is preventing you from putting out your space now thats also putting out anchor points dont you see and you get down along low human levels and what are you then involved with youre involved with attacking those who are preventing you from putting out anchor points attacking them now you go down scale just little bit further you start defending yourself against attacks this causes you to live good to have good behavior to have various socially acceptable characteristicsall sorts of things these things are basically defenses against attacks direct attacks now you can go down scale even further than that you have the defenses against possible attacks and this causes people to live in castles and you know dig moats that nobody will ever think of ever charging against you see invent weapons that have particular use invent social characteristics that are impossible to attack this causes you in other words to go down scale bit further now theres further down scale than that is imagining you are under attack that you are defending answers itself outanswers itself out in this wise that you are defending yourselfyou understand this is thenow let point back to you the level of the scale just above thispossible attacks see levelyou know possible attacks youre not being attacked youre simply preparing yourself to defend possible attacks see now just below that there is point that because there are all these defenses there therefore must be attacks you see it proves itself well you got moat dug all the way around the place obviously there must be somebody going to ride across that moat some of the screens that thetan puts up are terribly entrancing these screens are very very entrancing because they leave them up forever why did they put them up in the first place well they put them up against lion all right the lion might still be there see you would have to take the screen down to find out you dont dare take the screen down because youd be attacked if the lion were still there this causes very funny action you can get thetan you know pc and get him to find one of these black screens and get him to pick up one little corner of it and peek around it real fast and it readssometimes hell really have to get his nerve up to do it and he will hell see something like mocked up lion or snake or something on the other side of the black screen see one of his answers of confronting is cover it up so he cantwont have to confront it you see black it out there is the finalfinal mechanism of defense permanent defenses lead to belief that one is under attack when you get way down scale youitsmust be that youre under attack because theres the defenses somebody must be ready to launch the rockets at you any moment because heh here are all these radars waiting to detect them and of course the more one defends the less one becomes mobileone is less and less mobile so therefore actually he never gets out to look he never goes out to look to see if there are any attackers and i imagine there are nations on planets someplace in this galaxy at this very moment who have neighbors but who believe implicitly that those neighbors are there with full armies ready to attack them and that live life of complete defense complete immobility never going abroad carrying through all of the various survival activities to them to prevent an attack against nations which are longer there that have long since gone to dust gpm in essence is such mechanism one has defense up against an area of confusion he has stable datum all arranged to take care of an area of confusion that has long since ceased to exist thetan eventually traps himself the gpms then are long history of all of the things which ever attacked him and those things might now be gone what do you think the chances of your opponents of trillions one hundredget that enormous figure trillions one hundred trillions written one hundred times think of the number of zeros that this puts up your enemies of trillions one hundred still being alive and kicking and ready to knock your block off what do you think it is and yet you have all the defenses for that period all rigged and all the stable data already there with those defenses against those confusions and attackers of trillions one hundred and that in actual fact is what thetan is doing he still has up all of the mechanisms of defense and hethese mechanisms of defense are usually stable data identities beingnesses and he still believes implicitly in the existence of the attackersthese confusions and chaotic areas and so forthhe still believes those things are still there ready to bite him he became balanced in his attackdefense characteristics he was defending as hard as he was being attacked and quite accidentally brought about balance you wonder how did anyone ever sit down and plan all this to happen they never did they would postulate hundred goals but one of them worked so well that it lasted for twenty or thirty pairs of items see you got lots of actual goals why didnt all these actual goals crystalize into gpms there would only be one of them at time would crystalize as the single solutionone at time would become the single solution and then it would accumulate onto itself all of the stable data and all of the types of attack which could be made by reason by the way of having the solution one never looked at the fact that the way one got all this trouble was to have solution for it he always looked at it that he had to have the solution to keep out of all this trouble he never really thought that the reverse occurred but actually it was the reverse which did occur now all of these various complicated attacks and defenses and methods of keeping his self going and all that sort of thing these things swept along rigged up each one of them as an emergency action an emergency action is basically timeless action so everything was rigged to go into instantaneous operation and he licked himself by doing this he practically ruined himself because all of these things are built to be instantaneous and therefore to have time associated with them so therefore to float in essence in present time and the characteristic of gpm because its an emergency characteristic is to always be recontacted in present time so this is the genus this is the genus of the pcs actual gpmsthe goals problem mass the problem inevitably is postulatecounterpostulate there is the attacker and he wants to do somethinglord knows what and theres his characteristic his characteristic as viewed from the terminal side is of course one of chaos one of tremendous confusion one of unpredictability and yet it is still central postulate that is guiding that so one puts up against all this confusion of course the counterpostulate which resolves the confusion and when those things hang in exact balance you get pair of items which then accumulate tremendous quantities of mass and if you want to see some fancy mental mass you ought to start trying to swim through gpm cant be done its just fantastic you can only get through real an actual gpm by running it by r4m2 it has to be run and then it winnows away because its taken away and taken to pieces on the exact basis that it was built but backwards you see you take the last feared attack and defense mechanism first which is the end of the gpm the top of the gpm and you run that earlier down to the formation of it and of course the immediacy of the situation runs backwards to the formation of the situation it was lived from goal to top dont you see goal as an ri to top and when you take it apart you take it apart from the top down to the bottom and then it will all fall apart actually you cant pull the goal as an ri out from underneath the gpm because its too heavily overburdened and wont blow apart gpm will never run upwards you very often will be fooled as an auditor youve decided to run this particular gpm youve landed in the middle and you decided to run it up to the top and youre not going to make it you will get all of these items and they will all be very very logical and then all of sudden you will suddenly realize that you have run from the middle to the bottom its very horrifying its very horrifying you have the order then on the line plot in exact reverse because you started in at the bottom and tried to go to the top gpm will always unfold from the top to the bottom and thats the only way the gpm will unfold the goal as an ri will not discharge and you really cant get the charge off of it if you pick it out from the bottom of the gpm and try to discharge it and one of its items discharge that pair against each other and you get nothing oh yeah so you get blowdown on your meter and that sort of thing its interesting that when you go to the top and run all the way to the bottom again then they are fully charged bang you just run into them again theyre all fully charged furthermore it was very hard on your pc to grab those two bottom risvery very hard on your pc to grab those bottom ris and try to run them everything will really go creak with exclamation points now the general situation with regard to gpms then is that they are mechanisms of defense of certain kind of order theyre also of course mechanisms of attack and the scale which i just gave you will be found in the characteristic of the various items person will be trying to do one or another of these levels and it all adds up to just postulatecounterpostulatea pair of ris and gpm see one of the most hideous of the items is the passcleanaway type of item trying to list for that item will be the most lengthy thing that you undertook the item which you were listing forand you dont know what the item will be of course while youre listing for itis who or what would oppose bore bore you see and supposing the item that youre looking for would be fainting or you can see some victorian society or something like that some girl is confronted with this fellow who is bore and she uses as mechanism you see to faint see see and the item is fainting and man you will just list and list and list and list and list and list and list and all of sudden it pops to view its the least conscious item so the pc is least conscious of it the length of the list then is to some degree regulated by this other factor of the consciousness contained in the item being listed for you will find goal to be brillianttaking it over into gpm goalsto be brilliant much more rapidly than you will find goal to be hidden but this is monitored by the fact that the pcs ambition at the top is to oppose everything that is hidden and sometimes when theyre too extreme they reverse and you find the most hidden ones first to be hidden may be found with great rapidity why is this the last pair of course finds the pc like someone opposed to hiding and the oppterm hiding so of course the pc will come up with this goal to be hidden bang see thats because the top ris disclose it by being in reverse you see look over the old goals to scream that sort of pattern youll see what im talking about the goal becomes an enemy by the time the pc is through with it so youll get reversal conversely because of this factor to be easily found as goal to be easily found might be the last one that youll recover on the list because of the reversal factor of the ris these factors of variability however dont necessarily apply in the gpms to the tremendous degree that they appear in items the items of course theres nothing else to disclose it except the item and its opptermthe terminal and its oppterm and they are always disclosed to the degree that the pcs consciousness is reflected in their wording an aggressive person list one item see retiring person list length twenty items get the idea fainting person list length thirty items dead person list length fortynine items you get the idea you almost know what youre looking for after while when you know your business you know how conscious this thing will or will not be because you can establish it by the length of the list thats true of both terminals and oppterms the least consciousness in the oppterm or the more danger in the oppterm will reflect in the length of list the confrontability of the thing is reflected in its dangerousness actually pc doesnt so much sheer off of the dangerousness as the oppterm as its undisclosed nature hidden men for instance would be found much more lengthily than visible people see visible people bang thats right there thats one on the list see but hidden men why that might very well go twentyfive thirty items long on the ri list as youre listing for it get the idea gpms however do not necessarily follow this characteristic because of the pair on the top oppterm reversing the sense of the gpm see so to be hidden becomes sometimes the most easily found gpm but middleground gpm is therefore the most consistently difficult to discover null sort of meaning that neither offers itself nor hides itself and those become the hardest to find goals you might say to be average that will become the toughest goal to find to be average you find goal like to need of course its liable to present itself bang right now or also to refuse itself it all depairs depends on where in the gpm the person is stuck anyway give yougiving you some sort of an insight into gpms in general the attackdefense mechanisms of life are reflected in the gpms these are the conditions of actual livingness that the pc has lived through and it is their variety and assortment that gives you the different personalities of pcs and it is only this variety and assortment unless of course there is native state which causes pc to postulate different variety from another pc which were not in position to examine well and i would prefer at the moment to say it is the type of gpm which is monitoring the conduct of the pc and as far as youre concerned thats perfectly valid because he made those gpms in the first place it was he who imagined the attacking source and the confusion of the oppterm see the pc did that all with his own little paws and it was he who dreamed up the ideal answer to that situation he did that all with his own little thetanesque it was he who did that so the net result of the situation is that gpm is the creation of the thetan it follows out fantastically mathematical lines just as thetans made universe which had so many molecules in hydrogen and so many in lead so did they make in their personalities this pattern called the gpm the goals problem mass these things are huge black islands that float in the bank and they have actual measurementthey have actual size actual measurement actual mass they are not in the least bit imagined they are simply there they have been created in countless activities and attacks each of those pairs have been createdthe hard way the length of time which gpm covers istends to be greater early on the track and lesser closer to present time in other words its taking thetan at this stage of the game less time to make gpm than early on the track trillions twentynine thats trillion written twentynine times to trillions twenty is about the length from goal as an ri to the two top oppterms closest to present time of gpm on the track see for that area of the track now we go back lets go back around the hundreds mark and we may find that the goal as an ri when the goal was postulated would be at trillions one hundred and ten and that the goal did not finish off until trillions ninetyfour years ago see hundred and ten to ninetyfour thats longer isnt it considerably longer to take that ri to goal and now we go back around the two hundredtrillions two hundred were not talking now about two hundred trillions you know were talking about trillions two hundred trillions written two hundred times trillion trillion trillion ehsee trillion trillion trilliongo two hundred of thoseyears ago see and we find that gpm is more likely to occupy an area that would cover forty trillions forty see more likely that type of an area but remember because of the nature of the time track you have shortening characteristic to time which is one of the things that covers this and those time spans earliernow dont get wrong on this you become very involvedare in actual fact longer those time periods are actually longer thats only an arithmetical trick that theyre longer it isnt that time was longer it wasnt necessarily true that people moved slower but you consumed more time for the same amount of activity well ill give you some kind of an idea the aircraft here on this planet at this particular time winged fanjob aircraftlasted about twentyfive years its archaic now i cant even get the kids to look at them now and the total time from their development to their denouement actually the total lapsed periodim not talking now about the time of their commercial application war use and that sort of thingbut the total period the actual total period was really around about fifty years well in other times and places and not too long ago either winged fanjobbed aircraft of the same design was good enough for civilization for billion years thats all the aircraft theyd have for billion years see now we go bit earlier on the track and we find that aircraft not only would suffice for billion years but it was the same kind of aircraft from trillions two hundred to trillions one hundred you get the idea people have exaggerated ideas of the different characteristics of civilizations on the track and science fiction writers particularly ray bradbury and so forth have got to fill everything up with boogies and woogies and boggies and so forth these boys have ball and they try to dream up these oddball civilizations of one kind or another and so forth well in actual fact man is not that imaginative and thetans really arent that imaginative they tend to move up to this average type and very very little off of that type so that civilization humanoid civilization of 450 trillion years ago it might be just bit upscale from the 1920 civilization that has just passed by here on earth but it lasted lot longer you see you have to have agreement on the part of people and it takes lot of people living lot of pattern you see to finally agree that this is the beingness and doingness and havingness that amounts to this civilization they all recognize it as type seven medieval this is type seven medieval ah yes therefore we have varlets you see and we have funny looking church doors and we have bunch of religious loops and we know what this is all about we have gothic architecture oh yeah yeah oh sure so if were going to paint anything or were going to evolve in any way we evolve just exactly along type seven civilization see you build caryou build ear why is it that everybody knows this is futuristictype ear that is space opera age car because that is the car that is used in space opera type civilization i mean its as elementary as that see theyve been building them since time immemorial see these things are asmuch more ancient than the pyramids and the funny part of it is there are pyramids much more ancient than the pyramids the united states government carries this eye and pyramid on the back of its dollar bill its one ofthe back of the seal the great seal of the united states its very interesting that even symbols drift along the lines that total symbol given there complete is an old entrance to theta trap from way back aboutages ago ages agosomething on the order of trillions eight years ago theres the complete obverse seal of the united statescomplete with the eye everything else thetans used to approach it and get all snarled up in it and get incarcerated in the pyramid and so forth rather silly trap the implant was done with cards being held up to slots in the pyramid and i suppose the card lodges in somebodys head as bill dont you see or something like that so they somehow or other associate it is that the proper thing to put on money i wouldnt know what the hell unless money is trap but theyou see youre dealing with basic response pattern on the part of being and he responds to certain stimuli in his environment that he would consider normal for his particular type or characteristic of existence at any given time and he adds up all sorts of things you give certain number of these elements you give elements well lets give the elements of gothic cathedral sitting in the middle of plain you see and some fellows in funny looking flaretop shoes with pointed toes if you were just to go that far some other thetan is going to come along and hes going to stimulusresponse on this whole thing and hes going to say oh i know now what we should do you see and fix up cobble street see that has got bad turn in it that you cant get cart down you see its very careful you see and some other thetan will come along and put certain type of innit must go out over the street dont you see and he knows what to do with there you see and next thing you know everybody knows what belongs here i mean youve gotthe civilization is all built you see anybody coming into it carries it forwardcarries forward on this patternbecause thats the only thing everybody else will agree to automatically in other words you got prepatterned agreement you see well thats civilizations and if thetan is exact on these civilizations so is he exact on his responses in building gpms he considers certain things as dangerous and certain things as defensive and he considers certain attacks as the best and certain other things as the best and certain things dont belong and hes got this all variously sorted out and he eventually builds up gpm thats very patterned you wont find any difference from one gpm to the next on any pc you will find difference whatsoever except the wording of the goal and the exact wording of the ris all else is the same all the mechanics of the whole thing is the same its all built the same way and so forth this fellow has gpm to be cold and its got thirty pairs in it and the top oppterm which is the furthest enemy he has will be some expression of the first postulate of the goal itll be coldness or something like that and somebody who doesnt like cold or warm person will be its terminal you see its reversed now up at the top you get this just gpm after gpm now all the gpms are like that and they all decline from way early backtrack to present time in the same order the items are there to resolve see so the terminal resolves the oppterm but the goals oppose each other and one of the more serious mistakes youre going to make in all this is not making the pc answer the goal oppose question as goal oppose you read some of these lists man theyre wild wild wild thats wonder that the guy is never getting anyplace and overlisting himself and going crazy in the bargain because the toughest job is listing goals list this is most exhausting on the preclear it is the least rewarding its liable to get you into the most errors its roughits rough one its rough one after youve opposed this goal for two hours it suddenly occurs to you to recheck the goal for an actual gpm you find out the goal youre listing was only an implant gpm to begin with why do you learn that now well because by listing youve underyouve taken away the overburden you see youve undermined it so itll now read more properly see and your list is going on and on and on well you dont keep on going on and on and on with this list you better start investigating the goal youre listing from and youll find out that although it read as an actual gpm when you first contacted it and everybody was happy and cheerful with it in the meantime it has become sufficiently cleaned up that it can be recognized better in the mind and we find out that it was just anjust an actual goal it wasntit had gpm connected with it or it was just an implant gpm you shouldnt be monkeying with it anyway and so forth and you just have to abandon that because your incomplete list of course is the one you got it off of so you go back and complete its list and it takes you out to an actual gpm and now this one checks out as actual far better because the bank in that area isoverburden is taken off of it and youll get that more reliably now now you go ahead and oppose that much more thoroughly and you go on up the line and you get proper opposition you say were really swinging everything is fine everything is checking out the pc is comfortable you checking right on up to present time were going to do goal opposes right on up to present time and you get about four later and all of sudden the pc turns on the creaks and you dont know whether hes coming or going and so forth and you find out the last four you find actually belong earlier than the fifth back and theyre all out of sequence and they belong on the early track well why could you find it out now well youve taken enough charge off so that now somebody can read the stuff so you start in again with the one that was five back and you start opposing forward from it and youll eventually make it its horrible activity its really grim its hell on the pc its misery on the auditor it takes far longer than you would possibly imagine and youre starting out with liability that you find its very hard to find an original goal on pc in the first place anyway this is the roughest but the biggest thing that gets in your road as you go along the line the biggest roughest meanest thing that gets in your road all the way along the line consistently and continually is the fact that the pc does not answer the auditing question now this is reason you should nag the pc unduly but it can be pointed out very definitely to the pc if it looks to you like the pc isnt answering the auditing question let give you an example you will look over list which is going endlessly and the goal is to be cold see and youre opposing who or w or youre opposing what goal would oppose to be cold and that is your auditing question see thats your question that youre asking and the pc is saying idont pull him up if he lists one or two wrong see because hes bound to but if its list is getting just absolutely filled up with this kind of thing to be old to be young to have hat that might possibly have something to do with to be cold to be an engineer might have something to do with to be cold dont you see to be tall to be tall to love someone well you say well that might have something to do with to be cold yes yes that probably is all right to be harassed to eat candy well that also might oppose to be cold to be lukewarm of course that of course might oppose to be cold youre allyoure all right see you give him the benefit of the doubt see but when you go back down list and you start looking over list to be cold see all right and the goal is to be warrior to be rich to have fine things to like people to like my mother to have hat you see to jump long distance to be cheerful about life to be optimistic to throw things you start wondering what the hell is going on here see whats going on here well whats going on is the pc is answering this question what might the goal be see the pc is running new whatsit on himself what might the goal be and this is very common for pc to do this and its quite destructive its quite disastrous when he does you want it oppose man to be cold what goal would oppose to be cold to be hot to not be cold you got the idea oppose man we want an oppose well youre up againstif you nag pc too much particularly with r4 technology you wantdont want to nag pc too much but if i was having this trouble with pc id rather point it out to him now lets make sure that youre getting oppose oppose what does it seem to you that would oppose this now and also check once in while until my pc got used to it and got educated along the lines youre not answering whatwhat might the goal be or something like that are you until he suddenly has learned better why i would keep very tight rein on him because that can be the most exhausting thing now if youre going to cut into the goals lineif youre going to cut into the goals line someplace and list on up the line the closer to pt that you can cut in the better off you are now nothing in what ive said has told you to nag pc or upset him or invalidate his answers because youre dealing with dynamite its just you be alert to this condition because when i tell you that when it exists and the pc is consistently doing this to you you havent prayer to find the right goal on that list you just havent got prayer pc is answering one question youre asking another question and its oppose the next goal believe will not be goal that resolves itll be goal that opposes the items resolve with each other but the goals oppose each other to be tall to be short see to stay to leave to be alive to be dead see these are the way these things go theyre flipflop dichotomy all the way up the line you see to be generous to be stingy see they just bang bang and until you learn this well from your own experience you yourself are going to make lot of trouble because you cant tell by inspection whats going on you have this goalyou have this goal to sing beautiful song and you perfectly willingly buy the next goal to it as to be responsible and the pc will say well you see it really figures out this way you see i mean if youreif youre responsible then you havent got any time to sing and so forth and so forth and so forth well let him get away with it dont ever argue with the meter the goal read and that sort of thing but lets just check this out real hard and lets be awful sure that theres gpms skipped because youre liable to find out theres six ten twenty gpms been skipped between these two goals theyre both actual goals except it skipped lot of gpms its remarkable the gradient by which the goals change it starts to be hot and to be cold and goes off gradually you see to be chilly you see you know and to be warm see its more positive and then less positive less positive less positive less positivebut theyre harmonics and it isnt until you get to pt that you get oddball goals up toward pt in the last few trillion years theres some oddball goals start occurring now it doesnt mean that these things dont oppose oh yes they do but they get trickier why theyre into the think band you longer have got this beautiful bangbangbang sort of situation going on to stay to leave dont you see the guy has come down now on dwindling spiral of harmonics until its very hard to get an opposite how do you get an opposite to beto be scintillant you see all right well all right to be scintillant well get an opposite there to be dead that wouldnt it to be dull oh that possibly might be the opposite but lets now oppose to be dull and we get to say bright things now thats more complicated goal you see because its got more think in it now to say bright thingshow do we oppose to say bright things were getting up toward pt now you see to say bright things is opposed in some outlandish fashionit doesnt mean that you wont have short sharp goal there either like to be secretive or something but its usually to be reticent around people or to be reticent or something of this particular character its slowing down in other words now how will we oppose to be reticent tsk well the guy is actually gettinggetting hard put you see to get his opposites we arent in any positive communication line here you see to speak well now early on the track it would just be to speak see but now were getting modifierto speak well and so on and to speak well is opposed by not to stutter badly see how its caving in now how do you oppose not to stutter badly you see well this goes out to have something to say see as the opposition or something to that something wild going on here were getting diminution dont you see theres less latitude early on the trackearly on the track youre liable to get something like to be powerful see followed by to be weak see thats good opposition see but late on the track not that broad span you see and you can just pick them up on the tone scale you can look at the tone scalethe big tone scale that goes all the way south and youll find these pt goals are all down around the lower part of the tone scale and are apt to be more wordy well so much for that your pc in other words starts out big tough strong broad bang bang opposites you see to be black to be white you know bang bang you see and he ends up to not be so gray you see to not be so gray and to be gray occasionally you see and youre getting narrower span if you get the idea very positive he wants to be gray occasionally see you havent got this type of activityyayayruyruya hes going through life the same way you know limpgimp limpgimp limpgimp you get these complications now the risthe ris always match the goal but they dont contain the goals wording in it in an actual gpm thats only an implant gpm you seldom have the goal wording in an ri to be weak would have timid fellow opposing bellicose individual see or something or bellicose people you dont have weak person you see opposing people who hate weakness that was yourthat was your gpm implant influence youre much more likely to get something offbeat well it doesnt rule out it is what it is but you look down an actual gpm and youll seevery seldom you will see the words of the goal youll only see the sense of the goal youll see the sense of it but you wont see any of the words of the goalor seldom do although up at the top oppterm its quite common to have the sense of the goal appearing as the top oppterm its also occasionally you go from the top into dwindle and on an implant ri at theas the top oppterm an implant why youll get up there on goal to beto end something like that you get ended see well on an actual gpm itll be something like end or the end or ending and thats quite common but then its liable to dwindle twice or three times after this you see my own ending see its liable to be topper top oppterm and little more to them in other words they didnt know enough scientology in order to audit these things right and so they didnt get the right pattern the implant gpm gives you actually how close they could guess to the pattern which gave you ajust about what they thought because frankly between you and if theyd put in an actual gpm pattern you wouldve had hell of time an implant pattern as itself doesnt get in your road hardly at all except as the goal because the goals are quite accurate thetans do have goals worded just like that thats deadon so much so that if you wanted to find somebodys goal just take whole list of implant goalstake whole list of helatrobus implant goalsone way or the other read them off to the pc which one of these is your actual goal one of them will finally go tick and you say good check it out get it to rr start goal opposing it on up to pt in other words their rendition of the goals was quite accurate but the rendition of ris they couldnt audit they couldnt audit they really couldnt get enough down in the bank to find out what they really were had they done so we would be in awful trouble because you couldnt tell your ris one or the other for instance i alwaysyou dontif youre running pc properly you almost never get an ri with modernan implant ri in an actual gpm line plotif youre running it properly youd have to be overlisting youd have to have an arc broke chopped up pc youd have to be listing on wrong goal or something would have to be wildly out of sequence youd have to be doing something real goofy as long as you dont do something real goofy you dont get them and then you will see things start toappearing the goal to end you see oooh that is in anthats in pcs actual gpm like hell it is we didnt know it earlier but thats all implant ris actually the goal declines with great speed in an actual gpm before its gone fifth of its distance its more or less around the bend as far as the pc is concerned theyre real short at the bottom quite interesting it takes long time for them to go to pieces at the top but the crossover pointwhen the oppterm and the terminal tend to balance with relationship to the goal see they tend to be more or less of the same valuethat crossover point is much closer to the bottom than it is to the top you sometimes go up the line eight items just four pairs and you get the crossover and then you may go ten more pairs to get to the top of the bank see what i mean ten pairs to the top of the bank and only four pairs to the bottom of the bank from the point where the pc is longer on the what you callon the side of the goal do you lot of good to look over line plots implant line plots and that sort of thing just see how these things are of course its very hard to be analytical and rational while looking at that much dynamite but dont try to run them on himself yourself and dont try to repeat them endlessly yourself and dont make anybody memorize one and youll be all right but as far as goals and ris are concerned you have much more to worry aboutyoure worrying about much more than you really think theres much more that you think there is there to worry about than there is theres lots less to worry about for sure you can dream up more things in this to worry about than anybody could easily count or counter the best way to put it is simply this run with absolute accuracy r4m2 delivers the truth into your hands and through the meter and onto your line plots and run with any variation of any kind whatsoever will deliver you bunch of balderdash when youre used to living with the truth for while and youve had it added up on you few times why you get very used to what the stuff is and you ah well it looks good to you or it looks false to you funny part of it is that r4m2 carried through without any departure whatsoever will deliver the right stuff and that is quite testimony to technique but its that way worked out the varieties that you will get intothe variations you will get into come on accidental departures that youre not aware of until theyve already happened now ill give you an idea of this now heres an accidental departure you get gpm and youre opposing it and by golly you cant get gpm on the list you go fifty past the last ri and the whole thing nulls out uuulph what happened well r4m2 requires that you have an actual gpm as your departure point and by some fluke or another the gpm you got read as an actual gpm and wasntsome reason or other you missed so you had this gpm to sneeze and you are listing who or what would oppose to sneeze and you were taking off trying to get it up to present time dont you see and you list list that goal oppose list and the pc is answering the question everything is going along fine but you list fifty beyond the last rocket reading item you list there actually till theres not any slash or bash to the needle you know its just exactly according to the book and you go back and these are all source lists so you null them one by one you know ive seen more than one of them the goal did not rocket read when put on the list it only rocket read when the whole list was nulled itll drive you around the bend so you might as well shortcircuit any fancy actions you just do the list and you null the list that is all and if the goal is on it itll read its as elementary as that well youve got fifty beyond the last rr and there you are and youve nulled it all out and you havent got goal and youre sitting there chewing your fingernailswhat do i do now well its very elementary the technique required that you take off from an actual gpm and in this case it was to sneeze now to sneeze has been shined up and lot of charge taken off of the area by reason of listing check it out again and youll find out that you were taking off from an implant gpm hehhehhehheh youre opposing an implant gpm now if it still checks outif it still checks out as an actual gpm youin other words you check out your departure point again seethe goal that youre listing from and if that checked out very nicely then you had better look over this list and find out what happened that you didnt find the goal on it now the first action that you undertake is to ask the question and the question you should ask for test is this question what goal would oppose this to sneeze gpm and then you dont hang the goal on the end of the sentence and so get tick or swish from calling the goal but of course you append that additional syllable onto the end of it and you will find that your list probably reads incomplete it now ticks so in that particular case we will be charitable and say you didnt miss an rr as you listed in that fifty but we will extend the list and you extend the list and youll find out there were some more rrs all of sudden and then you go back and null what you added to and you will find the goal staring you in the face this type of crosscheck in other words you always suppose in r4m2 that the pattern has been followed and if the pattern youre followingthat is to say that the exact technique has been followed and if that has not then produced result you then assume that the technique was not followed and you look for where in it wasnt it followed its as elementary as this dont you see i mean if nothing goes wrong if you can get that firmly straightened out something the variations which you see will be all sorts of goofball stuff for instance you get into lot of goofball stuff dont worry about that you will pc is in horrible creak the last foureverything is just going brrrrerrr and the last four goals which you found you check them over theyre actual gpms they properly oppose the goal they came fromthe opposed goal there are skipped or missed gpms pc is in creak well where is it must be an incomplete goals list someplace well r4m2 probablywell it wasnt followed with the fifth goal back well you check out four it didnt occur to you to check the fifth you were taking off from the suppositionyoure taking off from the supposition that youthe fifth goal behind you was accurate and the next four goals you found were perfectly all right but unfortunately they fit on the early trackas i just gave you earlierthey fit on the early track because the goals list that you did on the fifth goal back was an improperly done list grim huh this is the sort of thing that you can shudder about happening to you but it happens the only thing you do to repair r4m2 is just go back and pick up and do r4m2 i mean its as elementary as that you must have overlisted list if you skipped items you dont worry today on item lists of having two rocket reading items i have seen six rocket reading items on the same ri list you went around three corners you went this way and that way and that way and that way you couldnt get the pc shut up and they gave you the next four or five rrs fortunately they all fired and you start nulling the thing everything is firing maddest thing you ever saw in your life go back up and pick up the first firing item and give it to the pc dont torture the pc by listing an item list forever never extend an item list always shorten item lists only extend goals lists goals lists are ordinarily underlisted and item lists are ordinarily overlisted the only item list you can be absolutely sure is not overlisted is oneitem listbe absolutely sure that it is not overlisted anything else is to be regarded with suspicion that doesnt mean it doesnt sometimes take the pc thirtyforty items to get his item on the list doesnt mean that it doesnt but you start going at that rate and you have lot of blowdowns and lot of fire and lot of this and that you must have missed everything under the sun man you just better stop him and then go back up and carefully try to find the first item you can make rocket read on that item list find the first one you can make rocket read my god dont find the last one got the idea because youre going to take him right around the corner you assume in listing itemsheres some new data on thisyou assume on listing items every time that if something rrs it is an ri anything on an item list if it rrs its an ri and you assume that the pc will put the right item highest on the list he wont list around in circle and back up to it he just keeps going and lists himself into another gpm or down at the bottom of this one so make them brief and you dont care one continental cottonpicking moment whether its an rr or raowraow or bluyew or whether or not it has proper curly tail on its q as long as that thing when called will send that needle traveling at least threequarters of that dial away and blow down we dont care what the characteristic of the read is fall longlong fast fall even slow fallif it blows down if it doesnt blow down its not the item but ive also rarely seen pc fail to cognite on the item and it wouldnt blow down pc saying men men that couldnt be the item i detest them you know that couldnt be the item men that couldnt be the item menmen just wouldnt oppose women thats all i mean its the same breed of cat theyre both human thats just not the item and so forth the thing is falling every time but blowdown and so forth and couldnt be oh men ohhoho oh men pssswww blowdown ive seen that happen but thats rather rare and theres the other side of the thing the pc is saying but its cabbages it is cabbages that is the itemcabbages cabbages it doesnt read but it is cabbages cabbages you buy that it wont read and it wont blow down the pc is on big sell and you buy that youre liable to wrap him around telegraph pole and throw the whole bank out of line in an awful hurry but once in blue moon after you have listed few more items cabbages suddenly unburdens and you go back and call it and it reads and blows down and the pc sits there in an exhausted state and he says but i told you it was cabbages you dont read it unless you can get it to go wham and blow down and i mean you dont give it to the pc but do everything you can to give him his item if he thinks thats it because very often hes quite right its just that heyou havent got enough charge off it or its too suppressed or hes asserting it too hard or hes getting too desperate or some other reason i know one list that went three pages which is unheard of in item listing three pages the thing went and at the end of that time the pc just going zzzzulh see had been calling an item that was about the fourth item on the list i couldnt make it read see and after three pages went back and called the fourth item on the list and almost blew the meter apart freak freaklittle freaky exception to the situation they are not the general run of things they can happen thats about the only thing that upsets you about things like this if you cant get goal to read dont ever give the pc goal goals read beautifully when they read but goals will sometimes hang up the same way you only get tick pc is saying well thats my goal and raowraow and so forth and you only get tick and tsk blowdown and only tick extend your list get few more off go back and read it and it now reads pc sits there and says i told you so i told you so i told you so nyahnyahnyah well let the pc say that all he wants to you give the pc goal that wont rocket read and blow down you give the pc an item that wont slash you know goand blow downand the pc is going to be in trouble sometimes you have hard time making themmaking them read and blow down but you can do it now the less mid ruds you use in this line of country the better off you are but you shouldnt eschew them utterly its suppress and invalidate that takes care of the goals and items most ordinarily just those twosuppress and invalidate and you take care of the session with protest and decide those are your best working tools when it comes to straightening up the session and that sort of thing the only other thing i could say about this because of the fantastically brutal nature of an actual gpm the amount of charge that can be bypassed dont ever evereverever ever evereverever dont ever everever ever evereverever force pc to do something he has some resistance to doing never force the pc it even goes this bad pc doesnt think he wants to run any ris this session pc doesnt want to list for the next goal in this session well the pc is either living under some fantastic present time problem or there is something wrong with what you just did about the first thing you decide on is until you establish otherwise its easy to establish you seeits present time problem just few questions the pc says hes so worried about the something or other something or other stock exchange crash or something like that and he cant possibly go on see and he is too worried about this well you can shift over and do something about the present time problem one way or the other but if it doesnt seem to be present time problem of any great magnitude enough to cause this then youd better assume that youve run in something wrong and you try to push pc through that wrongness the pc will go through sad effect first hell go into flaring arc break and then into the sad effect theres some bypassed charge sitting there someplace theres either an incomplete goals list or youve justthe last item you found is dead wrong or the place youre going is not where you ought to be going you ought to be going someplace else youve been busily doing list against an implant goal you havent been doing list against an actual gpm at all theres something wrong here and youre going to cost yourself the most auditing time by persuading the pc to go on when the pc has got his heels set because he can set his heels so lightly that you sometimes dont notice it but you will just curse the day you ever go across this because you areevery piece of work youre doing from that point on will be thrown away and wasted horrible to contemplate pc set his heels pc saysi dont care what reason he giveshe says ive just got my attention on you i just dont seem to be able to list on the list ive just got my attention on you thats all i just dont seem to be able to get my attention on i i i dont know i cant think of anyiive ju canti just got attention on you see well thatd be pretty broad for you to conclude that you were listing against the wrong goal thats lot of signal thats semaphore buzzers going flashing lights and little bells going ping ping ping the one youve got to look for is the pc looking at you rather fixedly and saying haaaaa you say whats the matter well your pens very noisy now you can also slow down and cause noauditing situation by looking for the bypassed charge every time the pc looks at you so somewhere in this line youve got to figure out where is it but you will curse the day you ever go an inch beyond the protest of pc the pc is trying to stop the session one way or the other youd better find out why this is placer4 is place for the heavyhanded juggernaut type auditor because hell come cropper every time every time hell go wrong every time and when you think of the amount of damage that you can do case i donti use that advisedly they can all be repaired but sometimes whos around to repair them you can nail guy going with hispanting and back agony and awful headaches and that sort of thingusually results from being forced in direction he didnt think he could go youre not paralleling his mind in other words he knows something is wrong now if you expect him now to put in the itsa line with him to tell you whats wrong you need your own ead xrayed because he never knows whats wrong you sometimes can guide his attention around read him little bit of list and he suddenly jumps on the listhe jumps down to or something like that and he suddenly cognites see haha thats what it is did you feel any relief did you the auditorwhat you askbut did you the auditor see any blowdown did you see big change of that ta if you did you found it the pc says oh well i know what it is i know what it is now you dropped your chair day before yesterday and thats the bypassed charge and your tone arm sits right there where it sat before and it sits right there and so forth and the needle is still dirty and that sort you havent got the bypassed charge these are the things that youve got to be getting used to so the upshot of the thing is that r4m2 run expertly is absolutely marvelous in its effectsits absolutely wonderful in its effects and you have this to live with that it cannot be run mistakeless it is completely impossible not to commit some errors in running it for the excellent reason that pcs bank gets so overcharged that you cant get proper reads sometimes in other words you say is this an actual gpm and it reads tick is this an implant gpm read is this nogpm read after youve taken the burden off of this thing listed it or done something with it or unfortunately started to work with it and so forth you all of sudden find out to your horror its now reading implant gpm rocket read tsk splow actual gpm smooth rising needle and you say bail out of here brother were in wrong place that goals list was incomplete leave us go elsewhere brethren and drop that like it was hot potato find the right goal that should have been there in the first place what gives you the trouble in this particular time is charge and the charge is very often so great the pc in the first place is having hard time seeing what it is you with the meter can read further than the pc can youre having hard time seeing what it is yet you have to know what it is you have to proceed anyway and then you find out it wasnt something wild like this happens but most of your trouble comes on goals listing there is nothing easier than items listing items listing today is welloiled dream theres hardly anything to it im afraid id educate pc little bit about what line plot looks like so on liable to give you all sorts of balderdash otherwise but imi mean by that they wont get the top of the bank you say see this to scream well youre listing for screamingness and weve got this goal to be cold they say oh coldness that rocket reads thank you very much now ill read you this item coldness yeah it does very well is that your item how does it compare to the remaining items on this list ohoh wrong scriptonly one item on the list it cannot be run totally errorless but the best expert in the world is bound to make some errors so if this is the way that it is run then youd have to be the best best best expert in the world and then youll make the minimal minimal minimal number of errors youre bound to make mistakes on the sequence of goals youre bound to make mistakes now and then on what the top oppterm is you almost never will make mistakes if youre very good on listing for items theyll go terminaloppterm you never even crosscheck them see this iswell its just bang terminals all got pain the oppterms all got senif you checked them youd hardly even bother to check them its just the next one on the list and it read and the next one on the list and it read and the next one on the list and it read and the next one on the list and it read and thats all there is to it item every twelve minutes ta action blowdown boom everything is finei mean its blowing down beautifully you get some more ta action out of it howis this the main item on the list how do these other items compare to it and that sort of thing oh you get all the dope on this you get little more all of sudden your tone arm is longer moving your pc has finished with his itsa youre all set there and he actually now when the tone arm stops moving actually has his attention on the next one if you ask him you got your attention on the next item well i havent well just put your attention there and lets list for it heres your question and get him off of it because to get your tone arm action now you should be able to find one of those every ten minutesan ri every ten minutesfully checked out cognited on itsaed squared away compared with the goal all the courtesy steps everything taken on the thing and youre away listing for the next rr thing thatll give you the most trouble thing youll make the most mistakes on is goals thing youll make the least mistakes on is ris you makethe greatest errors are made in underlisting goals and in overlisting ris and this all is very simple given those provisions and lot of those cautions and so forth ive given you this is flying process and this goes straight to ot the only thing youve got to do is be good enough so that the pc lives to enjoy it thank you very much
