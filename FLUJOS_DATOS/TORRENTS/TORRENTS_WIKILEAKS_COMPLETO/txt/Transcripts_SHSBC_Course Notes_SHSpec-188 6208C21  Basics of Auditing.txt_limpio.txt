6208c21 shspec188 basics of auditing auditors keep asking lrh for rules and more rules then they goof in session and ask for more it is strange that fundamentals usually come at high levels of training here is what an auditor should be able to do he should be able to get another being to be interested in his own case and willing to talk to him rules tricks rudiments and various other types of upsetpreventers are all contributive to getting this to occur the emeter is only contributive insofar as it applies to rudiments it is vital for assessing in rudiments you are trying to do with rules and the meter something that you cannot do yourself this wont work some auditors have only to sit down in the chair to have the pc arc break this is more true now than ever the difficulties the auditor encounters are his own difficulties and the mechanics he uses force the pc into session with an auditor who doesnt want the pc in session or who doesnt understand that the pc should be in session or why the pc should be in session the mechanics of rudiments and rules have made auditing so powerful that the pc is put into state where he is interested in his case and wants to talk to the auditor but the auditor thinks he is supposed to do something else and drives the pc out of session again so the pc arc breaks the auditor looks like an auditor and the rules trick the pc into session then the pc finds that the auditor doesnt want to hear what he is saying the auditor is auditing by some set of rules in fact there is auditor but the technology has created pc this drives the pc around the bend the pc doesnt know what is wrong but he feels that something is wrong we have been blaming meter reading missing reads this is just another technical rule someone who understood the basics of auditing and used them could miss reads and clean cleans and still have pc happily in session but someone who cleans cleans and misses reads must be auditing not by basics but by rules that force pc into session if there is auditor but only rules and meter the rules may be right and the meter wrong there is nothing else holding the pc in session so he gets upset if the auditor is not there and he misses something it is curtains so it is very necessary to know what the basics of auditing are the remedy for the above situation is that people are going to learn to prepcheck and to put ruds in without meters and to do this accurately this will make auditors they can do it because they will learn the basics of auditing why does auditing exist at all there are two articles in certainty magazine 1958 that take apart what psychoanalysis did wrong anyone that went into session in analysis did so accidentally basically the analysand never had an auditor he was also never brought back to pt at the end of session the basics of auditing include the mechanics of blowing something the reason why auditing works axiom 51 one underlying thread is the principle that after session pc should feel better even an awful goals assessment session that missed the goal should end up with the pc feeling better secondly the auditor must get off the pcs withholds the earliest part of auditing is the roughest part since all the missed withholds of life are still sitting there unrelieved it takes far better auditor to handle such case than to handle someone who has come up the line ways scientologists are not really harder to audit than raw meat especially raw meat that hasnt ever reached for anything you would be surprised though at who can go into session and who can be audited once in detroit the cops seized some tapes fourteen cops listened to them and twelve resigned from the force an auditor should be able to handle the pcs problems and to get clean needle so that the pc can be assessed and made to feel better an auditor should audit to get things done in session not just to audit auditing consists of getting something done by series of little accomplishments not by going through the motions you should be able to get pc into session without meter rules or anything some people have gift for this an auditor should be able to let the pc blow something by talking to him you would be surprised how rare this is you should also be able to get done what the pc wants done without q and people have trouble differentiating between tr4 and q and an auditor must be able to make this distinction he must handle the session and do things the pc wants done without q and you have to work at it to get in trouble with this q and is simple 1 not accepting the pcs answer questioning the pcs answer auditing isnt done by rules but by understanding people who q and dont want the pc to talk to them they use remark comment or request for more information to prevent the pc from just saying something and blowing the charge or the auditor doesnt acknowledge this is defensive mechanism 2 doing something every time the pc says something an auditor who always does what the pc says will drive the pc crazy an auditor who audits strictly by rules and not by understanding will never do anything pc says matter how reasonable or sensible it is which also drives the pc crazy there are two things that pcs do 1 they ask auditors to do things such that if the auditor doesnt do them the session will go around the bend 2 they originate auditors who are having hard time with pcs never differentiate between these two situations they dont evaluate importances they try to follow all the rules instead of helping the pc you dont take up the process that the pc wants run or the goal which the pc asserts but which doesnt check out on the other hand you dont ignore it when the pc says this room is so hot that i am melting open the damn window there is substitute for understanding and feeling of humanness obnose why does auditing work it bothers someone to be the only one who knows something he feels better when someone else can see it too he doesnt like to have only his attention on something it bothers him to have to keep it from other people when he puts something out and lets someone else see it and the person says that he has seen it and nothing else happens axiom 10 hasnt fired the catastrophic effect he expected hasnt been produced auditing of withholds blows the pcs certainty of consequences he gets off gross overt that he knew would kill him if anyone else ever found out about it and there is consequence the only thing that happened was ventilation having gotten off the withhold the pc finds himself with his attention freed up from that subject before it was stuck on keeping it withheld so he drops it like hot potato without going into the mechanics of asising we can say this if the horrible consequences that the pc expected on getting off withhold dont materialize his previously fixed attention is freed up auditors have interesting methods of preventing pcs from blowing things they use the meter they do something every time the pc originates if the auditor always does something or asks another question about it the pc isnt allowed to blow anything auditing works because the pc blows things if he isnt allowed to blow things he will blow up the point is to audit the pc not to go through drill auditors should be able to clean up dirty needle they should be able to prepcheck simply using pc indicators to establish cleanness of the question but dont try to assess goals without one if rules get in your way you probably dont understand the rules the reason for this emphasis is that 3ga requires superb auditor if it is to be done rapidly
