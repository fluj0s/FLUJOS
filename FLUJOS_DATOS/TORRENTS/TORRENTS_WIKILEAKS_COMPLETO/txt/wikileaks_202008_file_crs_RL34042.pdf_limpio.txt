science and industry division june 10 2008 abstract the enacted 2008 farm bill pl 110234 the food conservation and energy act of 2008 contains new conservation provision that seeks to facilitate the participation of farmers and landowners in environmental services markets by directing usda to develop technical guidelines for measuring farm and forestrybased environmental services this provision focuses ﬁrst on carbon storage and indirectly references various agriculture and forestry provisions in some legislative initiatives that are being considered as part of the broader climate change debate which have highlighted the perceived need for uniform standards and ways of measuring emissions reduction and increases in carbon storage in the agriculture and forestry sectors these types of provisions could expand the scope of existing landbased conservation programs and facilitate the velopment of privatesector markets for range of environmental goods and services from farmers and landownershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34042 order code rl34042 environmental services markets in the 2008 farm bill updated june 10 2008 renée johnson specialist in agricultural policy resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34042environmental services markets in the 2008 farm bill summary environmental goods and services are the benefits society obtains from the environment and ecosystems both natural and managed such as water filtration flood control provision of habitat car bon storage and many others farmer participation in providing th types of goods and servi ces began in earnest in the 1990s with the development of watershed approaches incorporating nutrient credit trading and wetlands mitigati on banking as well as the more recent development of voluntary carbon credit markets these efforts have triggered furthe r interest in the possibility of developing market nd trading opportunities for farmers and landowners as source of environmental offsets these services would be in addition to the food and fiber services tr aditionally supplied by the agriculture and forestry sectors congress is expressing gr owing interest in developing such market based approaches to complement existing federally supported programs that promote conservation in the farm and forestry sectors as well as to complement existing andor emerging environmental regulations or natural resource requirements that may affect the agriculture and forestry sectors the enacted 2008 farm bill pl 110 234 the food conservation and energy act of 2008 contains ne w conservation provision that seeks to facilitate the participation of farmers and landowners in environm ental services markets by directing usda to develop t echnical guidelines for meas uring farm and forestry based environmental services this pr ovision focuses first on carbon storage and indirectly references various agriculture and forestry pr ovisions in some legislative initiatives that are being considered as part of the broader climate change debate which have highlighted the perceived n eed for uniform standards and ways of measuring emissions reduction and increases in carbon storage in the agriculture and forestry sectors these types of provisi ons could expand the scope of existing land based conservation programs and facilitate the development of privatesector markets for range of environmental goods nd services from farmers and landowners among the possible questions that may emerge as these agriculture and forestry provisions are either implemented as part of us farm conservation policy or considered as part of broader climate change initiative are the following can agricultural interests effectively provide nvironmental services along with traditional food and forestry services how would uni form standards address differences within different production areas type s of resources and ecosystems what is the role of usda as the lead federal agency in establishing technical guidelines for the agriculture and forestry sectors ho w would collaboration work between other participating federal agencies how woul d the agreedupon decisions and standards work within existing regulatory author ities how would the agreedupon decisions and standards work within possible forthcoming regulatory authorities such as in proposed climate change options currently being debated in congress what role should federal agencies play in establis hing environmental services markets httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34042contents w h t r n v i r n m n t l s r v i c s

continuedenvironmental services markets in the 2008 farm bill the enacted 2008 farm bill food conser vation and energy act of 2008 pl 110234 includes new cons ervation provision that s eeks to facilitate the participation of farm ers and landowners in environmen tal services markets covering range of farm and forestry services including improved water and air quality increased carbon storage and habitat prot ection the inclusion of this provision could expand the scope of existing farmland conservation programs and facilitate the development of privatesector market s for agriculture and forestrybased environmental goods and services in part congressional intere st in this area has developed in response to increased attention to the agriculture and forestry sectors contributions to some remaining environmental pollution and re source degradation concerns for example the us environmental protection agency epa reports that agriculture is the leading source of water pollution in us lakes and rive rs and major contributor of pollution in us estuaries epa also reports that agriculture contributes to an estimated 6 of all greenhouse gas emissions in the unite d states at the same time some in congress are suggesting that us farm support programs should do better job promoting environmental be nefits and also complying with domestic support constraints called for by the world trade organization the agriculture and forestry sectors are also being regarded as po ssible source of carbon capture and storage within the broader climate change debate in the 110th congress the development of marketbased appr oaches to farm conservation and land management might complement existing andor emerging environmental regulations or natural resource requirement s affecting the agriculture and forestry sectors as well as complement existing federally supporte d programs that promote conservation in the farm and forestry sectors environm ental goods and services from the agriculture and forestry sectors might also provi for environmenta l improvements and mitigation at relatively lower cost compared to mitigation in other sectors of the economy environmental services market s may also offer dditional financial opportunities to farm ers and landowners what are environmental services markets environmental goods and services are the benefits society obtains from the environment and ecosystems both natural and managed such as water filtration flood control provision of habitat carbon storage and many others table 1 1

continuedmost cases these constitute free servi ces since landowners and managers are not compensated in the marketplace however as many such services have become degraded over time there is gr owing recognition that they s hould be sustained or substituted by market capital similar to investing in water treatment plants and engineered flood control systems one so lution would be to create markets often developed through regulation so that providers of envi ronmental services can be compensated in private markets for the serv ices they provide this could offer potential business opportunity to the farm nd forest sectors which may be able to provide for such services and participate in the market for example by creating restoring preserving functi on and value in natural resources area or by capturing and storing carbon before gases that contri bute to global climate change are released into the atmosphere these services would be in addition to the food and fiber services traditionally supplied by th agriculture and forestry sectors the market for environmental goods and services involving the agricultural and forestry sectors began mostly through va rious pilot programs starting in the 1990s the development of voluntary carbon cred it markets and watershed approaches incorporating nutrient credit trading along with wetlands mitigation banking have involved the farm and forestry sectors th programs provide market for farmers to sell carbon or nutrient farmbased offset s to emittersdischargers that are looking to buy offsets to mitigate their own emissionsdischarges these efforts have triggered interest in other types of tradeable permits and credits including habitat credit trading and other types of c onservation banking usda identifies environmental markets with relevance to the agriculture and forestry sectors to include water quality air quality wetlands endangered species greenhouse gases and developmental rights2 often the impetus for these efforts may be linked to regulatory driver specific to an actual or anticipated environmental regulation or natural resource requirement such as re quirements in the clean water act cwa endangered species act or other state or local regulation see table 1 other incentives may include market drivers that make trading environmental services financially attr active or the desire to cultivate community goodwill farmer participation in voluntary car bon credit trading programs has been growing rapidly and currently invol ves an estimated 4000 farmers across 2530 states covering more than 4 million acres3 the two largest programs providing for farmbased offsets are programs operated by the iowa farm bureau and the north dakota farmers union other similar programs are operated by the illinois conservation and climate initiative the environmental credit corporation based in indiana the upper columbia res ource conservation and development council northwest and terrapass based in california4 these

landowners who pr eserve and enhance the habitat of endangered or atrisk speci among the stated objectives of this agreement is to develop and adopt common definitions standards and measurement protocols8 habitat credits or conservati on banking act like savings account where credits are earned for land preservation of habitat and credits can then be sold to land use industries or others who are required to mitigate the loss of habitat under the and other laws that restrict or prohibit developm ent this is conceptually similar to wetlands and stream mitigation banking which allows for compensation of adverse impacts of development activities compensatory mitigation to wetlands streams wildlife refuges or ot her aquatic resources such allowances whether through wetlands or conservation banking ty pically involve creating restoring enhancing or pr eserving function and value in natural resources area often within the context of meeting federal state or local regulatory requirement the participation of agriculture and forestry in emerging environmental services markets is gaining wide support within the farm community and its supporting organizations and agencies as well as among the regulatory agencies and some environmental groups9 as part of its recommendations for the 2007 farm bill the us department of agriculture usda has proposed to further facilitate the development of environmental services markets in ways that would more effectively involve the farm and forestry sectors both the house and the senatepassed versions of the farm bill hr 2419 in cluded similar provisions as part of the conservation title in their respective bills what are the benefits and barriers the development of marketbased appro aches has been widely touted as possible source of additional farm income whether through the sale of tradeable credits or from other types of payments such as recreational use or hunting fees this could offset or partially offset the costs of pollution abatement incurred by farmers who make environmen tal improvements on their farmlands in some cases adopting alternative production practices could also result in onfarm cost savingshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34042crs5 10 for more information see usda 2007 farm bill conservation and environment theme paper june 2006 at httpwwwusdagovdoc umentsfarmbill07consenvpdf and m ribaudo and c jones environmental credit trading can farming benefit amber waves usdas economic research service feb 2006such as the use of renewable fuel genera ted onfarm marketbased approaches are also often viewed as encompassing broader societal benefits by complementing existing farm conservation pr ograms and evolving regula tory approaches intended to address environmental improvements in the farm and forestry sectors usda reports that there are several existing barriers that may prevent the development of environmental goods and rvices markets invol ving the farm and forestry sectors10 these include but may not be limited to uncertainty quantifying meas uring and valuing credits low demand for or discounted valu of credits from agricultural sources because of uncertainty bout the measurement and value of these credits low participation in the farm and forestry sectors due to uncertaintyover the value of environmental credits compared to the cost of pollution abatement reluctance by farmers and landowners to participate in regulatory based program small quantity of benefits that can be provided by individual farmersor landowners high transaction costs performance risks and liability lack of information about program benefits and how to participate lack of monitoring and enforcement and uncertainty about whether conservation and environmental improvements that we re initially funded th rough other publicly funded programs such as costs hare programs administered by usda will be allowed to be traded what is the recent congressional action the enacted 2008 farm bill contains ne w conservation provision that seeks to facilitate the partic ipation of farmers and landowne rs in environmental services markets by directing usda to develop technical guidelines for measuring farm and forestrybased environmental services this provision focuses first on carbon storage and indirectly references various agri culture and forestry provisions in some legislative initiatives that are being considered as part of the broader climate change debate which have hi ghlighted the perceived need for uniform standards and ways of measuring emissions reduction and incr eases in carbon storage in the agriculture and forestry sectorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34042crs6 11 the law was enacted on may 22 2008 following house and senate vote to override the administrations veto of the bill on may 21 however an enrolling error resulted in one title of the bill title iii trade being om itted from the version that was sent to the white house and the enacted law contains 14 of 15 farm bill titles congress is considering range of options on how to resolve this issue 12 in the house and senatepassed versions of this provision other federal agencies were identified as including the departments of in terior energy commerce and transportation the environmental protection agency and the army corps of engineers 13 identified as including farm ranch and fore stry producers financial institutions involved in environmental services trading and institutions nongovernmental organizations and private sector representatives with relevant expertise or experiencefarm bill legislation in the managers report on the 2008 farm bill pl 110234 the food conservation and energy act of 200811 the conferees state that the largest barrier to participation in emerging environmental services markets is the lack of standards and accounting procedures that make transparent the benefits that are being produced and marketed to address this concern the enacted bill contains new provision in the bills conservation title that seeks to establish technical guidelines that outline sciencebased methods to measure the environmental servi ces benefits from conservation and land management activities in order to facilitate the participation of farmers ranchers and forest landowners in emergi ng environmental services markets sec 2709 environm ental services markets the intended purpose of these technical guid elines is to develop 1 procedure to measure environmental serv ices benefits 2 protoc ol to report environmental services benefits and 3 registry to collect record and maintain data on the benefits measured the provision also re quires that usda provide guidelines for establishing verification pr ocess as part of the protoc ol for reporting environmental services but it allows usda to consider the role of third parties in conducting independent verification in carrying out this directive usda is directed to work in consultation with other federal12 and state government agencies nongovernmental interests13 and other interested persons as determined by usda the inclusion of this provision could expand the scope of existing farmland conservation programs by facilitating the development of privatesector markets for range of environmenta l goods nd services from farmers and landowners although the provision covers range of farm and forestry services including improved water and air quality increased carbon storage and habitat protection among other types of environmental services it explicitly gives priority to first establishing guidelines related to participation in carbon markets both the house and senatepassed fa rm bills hr 2419 proposed versions of this provision in their respective bills although the two versions differed in scope and in overall approach both were similar in their intent to establish framework to develop consistent standard s and processes for quantifyi ng farm and forestrybased environmental services the house passed provision sec 2407 proposed to establish usdaled environmental rvices standards board which wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34042crs7 14 the house provision is similar to that proposed by usda as part of its farm bill recommendations see usda usdas 2007 farm bill proposals jan 31 2007 at httpwwwusdagovdocumen ts07finalfbppdf usda 2007 farm bill conservation and environment theme paper june 2006 at httpwwwusdagovdocumentsfarmbill07 consenvpdf 15 in the context of these legislative proposal s carbon offset is measurable avoidance reduction or sequestrati on of carbon dioxide co2 or other ghg emissions expressed in carbonequivalent terms setaside allowance refers to set percentage of available allowances under the overall emissions cap that is allocated to nonregulated entities in this continuedprovide contracts cooperative agreements nd grants to develop consistent standards and processes for quantifying environmental benefits from the farm and forestry sectors thus establishing framework to develop such sta ndards and processes14 the senatepassed version sec 2406 also directed usda to establish framework to develop consistent standards and processes that would facilitate the marketability of farm and forestrybased environmental services but differed in that it directed usda to give priority to providing assistance to farmers and landowners participating in carbon markets the senate version differe d also in that it called for collaborative process involving governmental and nongovernmental representatives it also required series of progress reports to congress which were subsequently not included in the enacted bill the house senate and conference versi ons of this provision differed in terms of funding for fy2008fy2012 the house bill authorized 50 million to be appropriated for this provision whereas the nate bill authorized such sums as are necessary annually however the enacted bill does not specifica lly address funding instead the managers report states that usda is expected to fulfill the intent of this section with resources available to the partment in st usdas farm bill recommendations requested authorization of 50 million in mandatory funds to cover the types of tasks addr essed in this provision climate change legislation aside from the 2008 farm bill debate ther are other legislative initiatives that might also facilitate the velopment of environmental services markets involving the farm and forestry sectors partic ularly in the area of carbon storage and emissions reduction as part of the ongoing climate change debate during the 110th congress several proposals have been introduced that would either mandate or authorize capandtrade program to reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions capandtrade program provides marketb ased policy tool for reducing emissions by setting cap or maximum emissions limit fo r certain industries sources covered by the cap can choose to reduce their own emissions or can choose to buy emission credits that are generated from re ductions made by other sources in general the current legislativ proposals would not require emission reductions in the agriculture and forestry sectors as covered industry however several of the capandtrade proposals do in corporate the agriculture and forestry sectors either as source of carbon offsets or as recipient of setaside allowances15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34042crs8 15 continued case domestic agriculture and forestry entities 16 some legislative proposals would allow rela tively broad use of agricultural and land use offset types while others would allow for more narrow use of offsets such as emission reductions from animal waste some bills woul d not allow for offsets but would set aside percentage of allowances for various purposes including biol ogical sequestrationthe inclusion of these provisions as part of capandtrade framework could provide additional financial incentives to enc ourage additional land based conservation activities involving the agriculture and fo restry sectors for example these provisions could allow farmers and landowners to participat in this emerging market by allowing them to gene rate and sell carbon offsets and credits associated with carbon capture and storage emissions reductions andor other implemented environmental improve ments on their farm or forested lands16 these allowances and credits could be sold to regulated facilities eg power plants covered by capandtrade program to meet their mission reduction obligations under some capandtrade proposals the agriculture nd forestry sectors also would receive proceeds from the sale of these allowances credits and auctions to further promote and support activities in these sectors that reduce avoid or sequester emissions these bills and issues continue to be debated in congress in most cases these bills contain language highlighting the perceived need for uniform standards and ways of measur ing emissions reduction and increases in carbon storage in the agricultu re and forestry sectors the initiatives generally stipulate that meas urements of emissions reduc tions and carbon uptake should be real verifiable additional permanent nd enforceable this requirement indirectly ties back to the new conservation provision in the 2008 farm bill see previous section that seeks to establish techni cal standards and accounting procedures for environmental services ge nerated in the agriculture and forestry sectors for more information about the farm nd forestry provisions within leading senate capandtrade initia tive see crs report rs22834 agriculture and forestry provisions in climate change legislation s 3036 for other general information on the current ghg policy debate and gislative proposals see crs report rl33846 greenhouse gas reduction cap andtrade bills in the 110th congress by larry parker and brent d yacobucci and crs report rl34067 climate change legislation in the 110th congress by jonathan l ramseur and brent d yacobucci what are some possible considerations among the principal questions regard ing the inclusion of these types of provisions as part of any major legislative initiative is whether the agriculture and forestry sectors can effectiv ely provide environmental g oods and services along with the more traditional food fiber and other services these s ectors already provide the inclusion of these provisions could also ra ise certain procedural or implementation questions as congress debates future farm policy or as it continues to consider the role of the agriculture and forestry s ectors in climate change legislation httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34042crs9 standardssetting processimplementation how will usda implement its new farm bill directive for establishing uniform standards accounting procedures protocols and registries for quantifying farm and forestrybas ed environmental services can usda accomplish its task using available agency resources jurisdictional issues what are the advantages of establishing usda as the lead role what lead role will usda play given the mostly regulatory authority and st atutory obligations of other likely participating federal agencies might putting usda as the lead create conflict of interest as bot h the regulator and promoter of standards are there other jurisdictional issues such that this provision needs to be referred to other authorizing congressional committees how might existing state and local programs implemented by other agencies be affected how will the collaborative effort between usda and the other participating federal agencies be put into practice how will disagreements be addressed and resolved am ong all federal partners consistency with existing regulatory authorities will the agreed upon decisions and standards re sulting from such an effort be binding among all federal agencies what assurances are there that these decisions will not override the authorizing legislation regulating water and air quality and wildlife habitat will regulatory agencies with authorizing legislation have the flexibility to not adopt the standards authorized by the board or other collaborative process if they violate the individual agencies authorizing statutes or contain regulations such as measurement protocols what are the possible implications if these decisions and standards are inconsistent with other existing regulatory guidelines and authorities consistency with possible future authorities and initiatives will such standardsetting framework and the agreedupon standards be consistent with or readily ad apted to other possible future regulatory initiatives such as t hose involving climate change if possible future climate change initiatives do not provide for carbon offsets and credits from the agriculture and forestry sector will the agreedupon standards be enforceab within the existing voluntary carbon market what are the potential implications if these decisions and standards are inc onsistent with other possible forthcoming regulatory guidelines and authorities standards will uniform standards be national regional local or sitespecific in scope how will uniform standards address differences within different produc tion areas types of resources and ecosystems will established protocols and management practices take into account these differences will these standards consist of an assigned value given the wide range in the types of environmental services how will outcomes or benefits be measuredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34042crs10 and expressed as standards will there be penalties for non compliance federal versus marketplace functions what roles should government agencies play in act ually establishing environmental services markets involving agricultu re and forestry what roles will be strictly within the purview of the privatesector and independent credit markets is there fede ral role beyond developing the reporting and credit registries that would require the board to act as intermediary between sellers nd buyers who will be responsible for oversight of third party veri fication and certification and for assigning market value to tradeable credits within an environmental services market will the federal agencies play role in market oversight enforcement risk ma nagement and capital investment what other types of federal assistance may be needed to further facilitate the development of environmental services markets involving agriculture and forestry congressional reportingtimeline how and when will the agencies involved in setting standa rds be expected to report their accomplishments to congress should reporting requirements be included as part of these provisions market barriers how effectively do the current proposals address the types of barriers that have been identified by usda and others that may prevent the developmen t of environmental goods and services markets involving th farm and forestry sectors possible unintended consequences might establishing market based approach shift governmental andor industry priorities away from addressing more serious nvironmental problems by allowing some industrial facilitie s to buy relatively lowercost farmbased carbon credits rather than pay for onsite pollution abatement at the facility might marketbased program shift usda resources away from established farm conservation programs
