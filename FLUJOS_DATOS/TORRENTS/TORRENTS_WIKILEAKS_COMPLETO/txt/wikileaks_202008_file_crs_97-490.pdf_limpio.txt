of 1997 vpa pl 10519 became law on june 18 1997 when the president signed s 543 105th c ongress as passed by the senate this bill was identical to hr 911 105th congress as reported by the house committee on the judiciary on may 19 1997 hrept 105101 the vpa whose effective date is september 16 1997 immunizes individuals who do volunteer work for nonprofit organizations or governmental entities from liability for ordinary negligence in the course of their volunteer work it also limits punitive damages and noneconomic damages against volunteers who are held liable it does not affect the liability of nonprofit organizations or g overnmental entities the purpose of the vpa is to encourage people to do volunteer work for such nonprofit organizations and governmental entities however it allows states affirmatively to declare it inapplicable to suits in their state in which all parties to the action are citizens of the state background and preemption the common law ie courtmade law of all 50 states allows individuals to bring tort suits to recover monetary damages for personal injuries or property damage caused by another persons negligent or willful conduct almost all states however limit the liability of volunteers to some extent in order to encourage people to do volunteer work who are presently deterred from doing so for fear of liability the vpa preempts state tort law to limit their liability it does not limit the liability of nonprof it organizations and governmental entities for the negligence of their volunteers unless state provides charitable immunity then unde r the common law doctrine of respondeat superior such organizations and entities like all employers are generally vicariously liable for the negligence of their employees and volunteers section 3 of the vpa provides that it preempt s inconsistent state laws except to the extent that such laws provide additional protection from liability to volunteers nonprofit organizations or governmental entities this means that state laws that impose caps on noneconomic and punitive damages or other tort reforms that benefit defendants continue to apply in suits resulting from volunteers negligence in addition the vpahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97490crs2 allows states to enact statutes declaring the election of such state that this act shall not apply to such civil action in the state if they do so then the vpa would not apply in any action if all parties to the action are citizens of the state section 4d of the vp provides that it does not preempt five speci fic types of state law 1 state law that requires nonprofit orga nization or governmental entity to adhere to risk management procedures includi ng mandatory training of volunteers 2 state law that makes the organization or entity liable for the acts or omissions of its volunteers to the same extent as an employer is liable for the acts or omissions of its employees 3 state law that makes limitation of lia bility inapplicable if the civil action was brought by an officer of state or local government pur suant to state or local law 4 state law that makes limitation of liability applicable only if the nonprofit organization or governmental entity provides financially secure source of recovery for individuals who suffer harm as result of actions taken by volunteer on behalf of the organization or entity definition of volunteer and nonprofit organization section 6 of the vpa define s volunteer to include person who performs services for nonprofit organization or governmental entity and who receives more than 500 per year plus expenses actually incurred it defines nonprofit organization as 501c3 organization or notforprof it organization organi zed and conducted for public benefit and ope rated primarily for charitable civic educational religious welfare or health purposes the vpa provides that an organization shall not be deemed nonprofit organization for purposes of the vpa if it practices any action that constitutes hate crime referred to in subsection b1 of the first section of the hate crime statistic s act 28 usc 534 note liability limitations section 4a of the vpa provides immun ity to volunteers for nonprofit organizations or governmental entities acting within the sc ope of their responsib ilities provided that if appropriate or required the volunteer was properly licen sed certified or authorized by the appropriate authorities the immunity is for ordinary negligence not for willful or criminal conduct gross negligence reckless misconduct or conscious flagrant indifference to the rights or safe ty of the individual harmed by the volunteer this liability limitation does not apply to nonprofit organi zations or governmental entities they may continue to be held vicariously liable for the ordinary negligence of their volunteers even if volunteers ar immune nonprofit organizations and governmental entities however continue to benefit from an liability limita tions provided by state law section 4f of the vpa provides that the above limitations on volunteers liability shall not apply to misconduc t that constitutes 1 crime of violence or act ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97490crs3 international terrorism for wh ich defendant has been convi cted 2 hate crime 3 sexual offense for which the defendant has been convicted 4 violation of federal or state civil rights law or 5 an act committe d while under the influence of alcohol or any drug joint and several liability section 5 of the vpa eliminates joint nd several liability fo r noneconomic damages with respect to volunteers work for nonprof it organizations and governmental entities we will explain these terms section 6 of the vpa contains lengthy definition of noneconomic losses but the rm refers primarily to pain and suffering and similar damages that are not pecuniary losses such as medical expenses and lost wages joint and several liability is the common law rule modified by some states that if more than one defendant is found liable for an injury each defendant may be required to pay 100 of the damages rather than to pay only an amount proportionate to its share of responsibility for the injury the plai ntiff may choose which defendant to seek damages from although the plaintiff may not recover more than 100 of his damages and defendant who pays more than its pr oportionate share may seek contribution from other defendants the purpose of joint and several liability is to make it more likely that the plaintiff will recover his full damages even if one or more defendants is insolvent supporters of join t and several liability argue that if it comes to choice between an innocent plaintiff recovering less than his full damages or neg ligent defendant having to pay more than its share the latter is th lesser evil opponents of joint and several liability argue that the rule causes plaintiffs in the hope of obtaining full recovery to sue deep pocket defendants that sometimes are at most slightly responsible for the plaintiffs injuries to eliminate joint and seve ral liability only for nonecono mic damages as the vpa does represents compromise between these two positions plaintiffs may collect their total economic damages from any responsible defendant but may collect from each defendant only the latters proportionate share of noneconomic damages economic damages presumably are more important in most cases but noneconomic damages may be more significant for some plaintiffs one reason that president clinton gave for vetoing the products liability bill in 1996 was that eliminating joint and several liability for noneconomic damages in products liability cases unfairly discriminates against the most vulnerable members of our society the elderly the poor children and nonworking women whose injuries often involve mo stly noneconomic losses house document 104207 104th cong 2d sess 2 1996 veto of hr 956 punitive damages section 4e of the vpa limits awards of punitive damages against volunteers in connection with their work for nonprofit organizations and g overnmental entities punitive damages are intended to punish and deter egregious conduct and are not like economic and noneconomic damages intended to compensate the plaintiff under 4e to recover punitive damages the plaintiff must establish by clear and convincing evidence that the harm was proximately caused by an action of such volunteer which constitutes willful or criminal misconduct or conscious fl agrant indifference to the rights or safety of the indi vidual harmed comparing this with 4a reveals thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97490crs4 although the vpa permits volunteer to be he ld liable for compensatory economic and noneconomic damages for gross negligence or reckless misconduct he or she may not be held liable for punitive damages on the ba sis of such conduct unl ess such conduct also constituted something worse namely willful or criminal misconduct or conscious flagrant indifference to the rights or safety of the individual harmed note also that 4e makes the burden of proof that the plaintiff must meet to recover punitive damage s clear and convincing evidence the usual burden of proof in civil cases is the easie rtomeet preponderance of th evidence standard which means essentially that it is more likely than not that the defendant engaged in the conduct with which it is charged many states however have already raised the standard for recovering punitive damages in all cases not only against volunteers to clear and convincing evidence pro and section 2 of the vpa sets forth seven findi ngs in support of the vpa their essence is that the threat of liability deters people from volunteerin g and requires nonprofit organizations and governmental entities to spend money for liability costs and litigation as result nonprofit organizations and gove rnmental entities are unable to provide the level of services that would be desirable an argument against the vpa is that limiting liability denies injured people recovery to which they would otherwise be entitled under state law in particular the savings that the vpa would confer on defe ndants will come at the expe nse of the oftenpoor people they serve who can least afford to pay for their injuries an injured person might also question the equity of being able to recover from paid employee who caused his injury but not from volunteer who did so even wh ere every other circumstance concerning an accident was identical as noted thoug h even when under the vpa volunteer is immune from liability the nonprofit organization or governmental entity for which he volunteered may continue to be held vicar iously liable for th volunteers ordinary negligence as well as for conduct for whic h the volunteer could be held liable an alternative approach which would limit the liability of nonprofit organizations and governmental entities but s till permit accident victims to recover would be for the federal government to pick up the tab there is precedent for this in the national swine flu immunization act of 1976 public law 94 380 which made the united states liable in place of swine flu vaccine manufacturers for injures caused by the vaccine there is also precedent in the federal statutes that deem volunteers with particular federal programs such as vista and the peace corp s to be federal employees for liability purposes as federal employees they become immune from state tort liability and the united states becomes liable under the federa l tort claims act 28 usc 2679 for additional information on these statutes see crs report 97579 as for the vpas punitive damages standard the requirement that to be liable for punitive damages defendant have engaged in willful or criminal misconduct or conscious flagrant indi fference to the rights or safety of the individual harmed raises the question whether unconscious flagrant indifference to sa fety is less objectionable than conscious flagrant indifference this conscious flagrant indifference standard however was used in the vetoed products liability bill and the senate report thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97490crs5 accompanied that bill said that the conscious flagrant indifference standard is fair and is similar to the standards of many states srept 10469 104th congress 1st session 37 1995 another issue that the vpa raises is federalism ie whether it is desirable for congress to regulate an area it traditionally has left to the states the argument for preemption would be the desirability of national uniformity as to volunteer liability the argument against it is that it would be desirable to allow the states to continue to experiment with different options in fact though the vpa allows the states by enacting new laws to elect to apply their own laws to cases in which all parties are citizens of the state effective date nonretroactivity section 7 of the vpa provides that the vpa takes effect 90 days after enactment which is september 16 1997 nd applies to any claim filed on or after that date but only if the accident occurred after not on or after that date thus if this provision is read literally there is an incons istency as to application of the bill to accidents that occur on the bills effective date
