yield insight thats worth the costly capabilities and operations needed to obtain it for over 50 years from world w ar ii through the global w ar on terrorism this investment has been justified but the mission is still rightly judged by the answers it delivers the implied business model is to position the m ission to cover enough priority targets to ensure steady stream f valued products and

ufouo custom ers request sigint by specifying the essential elem ents f information eeis that they want to uncover the national intelligence priorities framework nipf maps each fei into one f three bands b or c f successively decreasing concern according to general topic and assigns i5 priority based on the combination f the topic and specific geopolitical r nonstate entity involved responsive sigint is delivered in several forms but serialized reporting dominates and so one indicator f endtoend m ission performance is the percentage f requested eeis for which at least some responsive reporting is provided ie the eei citation rate ufouo at macrolevel the overall citation rate for band eeis should be greater than that for band b which in turn should exceed that for band c beyond that performance against each band topic is also weighed in accordance with the following firstorder rules performance is poor if band topics rate doesnt even exceed the overall band b rate performance is weak if topics rate is above the overall band b rate but less than the overall band rate performance is fa ir or gootl i f topics rate is at r above the overall band rate with the latter also requiring that the rate for the topics priority 1 eeis be higher than that for the topics eeis generally u citation rates reflect only the existence f responsive sigint and not its impact moreover they dont directly account for requests that are addressed entirely by other than serialized reporting and they can be skewed by careless recordkeeping or differences in granularity between eeis therefore quarterly citation rate assessments arc complemented with two broader more subjective and more m anpow er intensive views f custom er outcom and satisfaction ufouo the first is quarterly manual assessment f performance against each nipf band topic that includes niche interactions that dont involve eeis as well as deliverables beyond serialized reporting performance is graded on the extent to which records show that responsive information was pushed to r pulled by customer and sampling suggests that the records that tie deliverables to requests are accurate and sampling suggests that the information delivered was germane vice just tangential performance is poor if responsiveness is w ell below average relative to that for band tasks as whole weak if responsiveness is somewhat below average fa ir i f responsiveness is average or better and good if responsiveness overall is average or better and is better still against high priorities ufou the second is quarterly survey f roughly 20 intelligence consum ers specified by position based on their ability to speak knowledgably and authoritatively about the sigint contributions to key civil r m ilitary customers those solicited represent the unified combatant commands and the joint staft the departm ents f state treasury commerce energy and homeland security the central intelligence and defense intelligence
