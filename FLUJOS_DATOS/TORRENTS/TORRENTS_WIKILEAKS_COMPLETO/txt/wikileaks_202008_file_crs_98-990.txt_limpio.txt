proceedings thomas b ripy legislative attorney american law division summary the constitution gives the united states senate the responsibility for trying impeachments but does not address the standard of proof that is to be used in such trials this report concludes that an examination of the constitutional language history and the work of legal scholars provides definitive answer to the question of what standard is to be applied in the final analysis the question is one which historically has been answered by individual senators guided by their own consciences at best the constitutional provisions concerning the power of impeachment provide only indirect guidance in analyzing the question of what standard of proof is or should be applicable to senate impeachment trials nevertheless those words are the starting point for discussions about the nature of impeachment proceedings and the standard of proof that is or should be applicable to such proceedings the role of each house of congress is outlined in article i briefly the constitution confers on the house of representatives the sole power of impeachment1 bit more is said of the role of the senate the senate shall have the power to try all impeachments when sitting for that purpose they shall be on oath or affirmation when the president of the united states is tried the chief justice shall preside and person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two thirds of the members present judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor trust or profit under the united states but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment trial judgment and punishment according to law 2 1 us const art i sec 2 clause 5 2 us const art i sec 3 clauses 5 and 6 congressional research service the library of congress crs2 impeachment is also addressed in the executive article of the constitution wherein it is said that the president vice president and all civil officers of the united states shall be removed from office on impeachment for and conviction of treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors3 finally the judicial article provides that the trial of all crimes except impeachment shall be by jury 4 these few words provide the constitutional framework for discussion of the standard of proof in impeachment proceedings but definitive answer as to what standard is to or should be applied the use of certain words such as try convicted and conviction suggests that impeachment might be likened to criminal proceeding where the standard of proof is beyond reasonable doubt this position was enunciated in the minority views contained in the report of the house judiciary committee on the impeachment proceedings against president nixon5 in their view the appropriate standard of proof for the senate was that applicable to criminal cases6 for support they rely in part on the constitutional language cited above the position that proof beyond reasonable doubt is required has been advanced as one might expect by defendants in impeachment proceedings while the house managers who present the case for conviction have urged lower civil standard preponderance of the evidence thus in the senate trial of the impeachment of judge harry claiborne in 1986 his attorneys filed motion to designate beyond reasonable doubt as the applicable standard for the senate in reaching its determination in the brief in support of the motion they argued that the constitutional language made it clear that an impeachment trial was in the nature of criminal proceeding the standard of proof in all criminal trials is beyond reasonable doubt historically impeachments have been conducted in the nature of criminal proceeding and the consequences for the defendant were grave requiring the prosecutors to be held to the highest standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt7 the response of the house managers in opposition to the claiborne motion noted that the reasonable doubt standard was designed to protect criminal defendants who risked forfeitures of life liberty and property quoting brinegar v united states 338 us 160 174 1949 such standard was inappropriate they maintained because the 3 us const art ii sec 6 4 us const art iii sec 2 clause 3 5 hrept 931305 at 377381 6 because of the nature of the impeachment and trial process and the different roles played by the senate and house of representatives the minority felt it necessary to examine the standard appropriate for the senate as predicate to any attempt to assess the appropriate standard for proceeding in the house their analysis led them to conclude that the appropriate standard for the senate was beyond reasonable doubt hrept 931305 at 37980 and for the house clear and convincing evidence id at 381 7 gray reams the congressional impeachment process and the judiciary documents and materials on the removal of federal district judge harry claiborne volume 5 document 41 motions referred to the senate by the senate impeachment trial committee ix judge claibornes motion to designate beyond reasonable doubt as the standard of proof in the impeachment trial and supporting memorandum 1987 hereinafter gray reams crs3 constitution limits the consequences of senate impeachment trial to removal from office and disqualification from holding office in the future explicitly preserving the option for subsequent criminal trial in the courts added support for their position was drawn from the fact that the framers while borrowing some terms associated with criminal law from the english impeachment model expressly rejected the english practice allowing the imposition of traditional criminal punishment including forfeitures of life property and liberty contrary to the defendant they found that historically the senate had rejected the analogy to criminal proceeding citing the ritter impeachment in 1936 as precedent8 during the course of the floor debate on these motions the attorney for judge claiborne quoted statements by senators robert taft jr sam ervin stromthurmond and john stennis indicating that they would apply the beyond reasonable doubt standard if the case against president nixon came before the senate representative kastenmeier responded for the house repeating the arguments contained in the memorandum in response summarized above and stressing 1 that the senate had never adopted such standard of proof 2 that the statements quoted were expressions of individual intent only and not binding on the senate as body 3 that the proceeding was not criminal trial and use of the criminal standard was inappropriate where the public interest in removing corrupt officials was significant factor and 4 that historically the senate had allowed each member to exercise personal judgment in these cases9 during the consideration of the motion by judge claiborne to designate beyond reasonable doubt as the standard of proof the question was posed as to the consequences of voting the motion down senator humphrey asked what the standard would be if the motion was rejected senator metzenbaum asked whether rejection left an inference that the reasonable doubt standard was not applicable and senator heflin questioned whether rejection would prevent an individual senator from applying the reasonable doubt standard the response of the presiding officer was that rejection of the motion left individual members free to apply standard of their choice including but not limited to the reasonable doubt standard judge claibornes motion was rejected by the presiding officer holding that the standard to apply was up to each senator to decide individually senator hatch requested the yeas and nays and the motion was rejected by vote of 17 yeas and 75 nays10 8 gray reams volume 5 document 41 x house managers opposition to motion to designate beyond reasonable doubt as the standard of proof in essence their argument was that since criminal sanctions could not be imposed criminal standard of proof was not required additionally they contended that the criminal standard was inappropriate in an impeachment because impeachment was by its nature proceeding where the public interest the interests of society weighed more heavily than the interests of the individual defendant which were adequately protected by the constitutional requirements of separate action by both houses of congress and twothirds vote of those present for conviction in the senate they urged preponderance standard this contrasts with the view of the house judiciary committee minority in the case of president nixon where the beyond reasonable doubt standard was urged see fn6 and accompanying text 9 132 cong rec s15489 s15490 daily ed october 7 1986 10 132 cong rec s15506 s15507 daily ed october 7 1986 crs4 while the senate refused to impose the reasonable doubt rule as the senate standard individual members undoubtedly applied that standard in their own minds when weighing the sufficiency of the evidence in the claiborne case presumably at least the seventeen who voted in favor of the motion to adopt the standard followed it in their deliberations in explaining his vote on the articles of impeachment in the claiborne case senator hatch makes it clear that he followed that standard relying as they did on the criminal conviction the house articles of impeachment required the senate to ascertain whether beyond reasonable doubt judge claiborne intentionally filed false return11 the issue was revisited during discussions at the organizational meeting of the senate impeachment trial committee for consideration of the articles of impeachment against judge alcee hastings12 senator lieberman asked help in understanding what guidance the common law of american impeachment provided as to the threshold the evidence has to cross for us to make judgment of guilt or innocence against this judge13 in response senator rudman said i dont think you are going to find one joe i think it is going to be whatever you apply to it we looked through that last time and you are not going to find it it is what is in the mind of every senator if you want to use clear and convincing preponderance if you want to use beyond reasonable doubti think it is what everybody decides for themselves14 asked for his comments michael davidson senate legal counsel reviewed the history of the claiborne impeachment and the debate and vote on the standard of evidence in that case noting that the senate had overwhelmingly rejected the motion to establish beyond reasonable doubt as the senate standard leaving that determination to each individual member he suggested that historical records and commentary might provide insight for an individual making these judgments but do not provide any single definitive answer15 some commentators have urged middle ground between the usual civil standard and the criminal standard of proof noting that impeachment is serious business but that the usual criminal sanctions of fines and imprisonment are denied the senate professor rotunda suggests that the appropriate standard of proof should be clear and convincing evidence this is an intermediate standard used in some important civil cases more than preponderance and less than reasonable doubt clear and convincing evidence is 11 132 cong rec s15763 daily ed october 9 1986 senator bingaman also applied the criminal standard id 12 report of

which will produce in the mind of the trier of facts firm belief or conviction as to the allegation sought to be established16 the national commission on judicial discipline and removal decided not to recommend the adoption of standard of proof nevertheless its report provides an illuminating discussion of the issue standards of proof the question remains what is the appropriate standard of proof for senate impeachment proceedings the senate has declined to establish standard leaving it matter for the conscience of each senator the disadvantage of this practice is that the respondent judge the house managers and indeed the senators themselves cannot know in advance what standard the senate will apply the commission considered whether it would be desirable as matter of policy for the senate to prescribe standard to guide participants in their preparation for impeachment trials the senate could choose from among three established standards beyond reasonable doubt clear and convincing and preponderance of evidence some senators favor the beyond reasonable doubt standard because of their concerns about the separation of powers and because impeachment proceedings parallel criminal trials if the senate is impeaching based on prior felony conviction which requires the jury to find commission of an offense beyond reasonable doubt then the senate should use the same standard some argue others claim that the beyond reasonable doubt standard is too deferential to the convicted judge and fails sufficiently to recognize the purpose of impeachment namely to defend the community against abuse of power by judges the purpose of an impeachment proceeding is different from the purpose of criminal trial they argue in criminal proceeding court may take defendants life liberty or property whereas an impeachment proceeding involves respondents office impeachment is political proceeding and in their view the lower standard of preponderance of the evidence is therefore the appropriate one still others have argued that the appropriate standard of proof is clear and convincing evidence that the respondent has committed an impeachable offense it gives force to the purpose of remedying judicial abuse of power while recognizing the competing interests of avoiding unjustified removals and protecting judicial independence in the final analysis the commission recognizes that each senator is both judge and juror as observed by senate legal counsel michael davidson it is the sum of senators separate judgments that amounts to either conviction or acquittal any member is entitled to establish the highest the medium or lower standard to govern his or her analysis of the evidence17 16 rotunda an essay on the constitutional parameters of federal impeachment 76 ky lj 707 71920 1988 17 report of the national commission on judicial discipline removal at 5960 august 1993 crs6 while the report focuses on the impeachment of judges similar competing considerations may come into play when executive branch officials are the subjects of an impeachment proceeding in 1974 with possible presidential impeachment as an impetus professor charles l black jr published his impeachment handbook in it he discusses the conflicting policy considerations of an impeachment in the context of the trial of president in response to rhetorical question as to the right standard for judging guilt in an impeachment proceeding he replies of course we dont know the answer with any sureness we have to work it out for ourselves as with so many constitutional questions we have to ask what is reasonable and the reply here is far from obvious removal by conviction on impeachment is stunning penalty the ruin of life even more important it unseats the person the people have deliberately chosen for the office the adoption of lenient standard of proof could mean that this punishment and this frustration of popular will could occur even though substantial doubt of guilt remained on the other hand the high criminal standard of proof could mean in practice that man could remain president whom every member of the senate believed guilty of corruption just because guilt was not shown beyond reasonable doubt neither result is good law is often like that of course each senator must find his own standard in his own conscience as advised by reflection the essential thing is that part whatever be played by the natural human tendency to think the worst of person of whom one generally disapproves and the verbalization of high standard may serve as constant reminder of this weighing the factors i would be sure that one ought not to be satisfied or anything near satisfied with the mere preponderance of an ordinary civil trial but perhaps must be satisfied with something less than the beyond reasonable doubt standard of the ordinary criminal trial in the full literal meaning of that standard overwhelming preponderance of the evidence comes perhaps as close as can to denoting the desired standard unique rule not yet named by law may find itself in the terrible seriousness of great case senators have plainly authoritative guide in this matter and ought not be censured for the rule they conscientiously choose to act upon after thought and counsel and above all in total awareness of the dangers of partisanship or feelings of distaste18 in sum the senate has traditionally left the choice of the applicable standard of proof to each individual senator while rejecting motion to make the criminal standard the standard in the claiborne impeachment the discussion made clear that it was simply decision to allow each member to make that choice and not repudiation of the standard itself individuals might apply that or any other standard of their choice walk through history and an examination of the discussions of legal commentators may aid individuals in weighing their choices but provides definitive answers indeed such an exercise is perhaps most useful in highlighting basic questions that members will want to ask themselves when searching for the appropriate standard 18 c black impeachment handbook at 1718 1974 for other versions of this document see
