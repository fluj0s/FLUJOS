amendment summary on december 7 2007 the senate environment and public works epw committee ordered reported an amended version of s 2191 the liebermanwarner climate security act of 2008 originally entitled americas climate security act of 2007 on april 10 2008 an amendment to make the bill revenueneutral was submitted to cbo for analysis along with the committee version of s 2191 on may 20 2008 s 2191 was reported by epw at the same time senator boxer introduced s 3036 which is identical to the reported version of s 2191 except that it contains the proposed budget amendment both bills were placed on the senate legislative calendar on thursday may 22 senator reid filed for cloture on the motion to proceed on s 3036 the cloture vote is scheduled for monday june 2 at 530 pm with the preceding hour set for debate in addition to s 3036 senator boxer has proposed an amendment in the nature of substitute with significant changes from the committee version of s 2191 this report provides comparison of five key differences between s 2191s 3036 and the proposed boxer amendment this report supersedes crs congressional distribution memorandum entitled comparison of s 2191 as

reported by the senate committee on environment and public works epw on may 20 2008 the bill would establish mandatory cap andtrade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from most sectors of the economy2 as reported s 2191s emissions cap is estimated by its sponsors to require 71 reduction from 2005 levels by 2050 from covered entities the covered entities are estimated by the sponsors to account for 87 of total us greenhouse gas emissions overall the sponsors estimate that s 2191 would reduce total us greenhouse gas emissions by up to 66 from 2005 levels by 2050 on april 10 2008 proposed deficit reduction amendment was announced aimed at making the bill revenueneutral3 new version of the bill s 3036 identical to s 2191 but also containing the deficit reduction amendment was introduced may 20 and cloture motion was filed on that bill may 22 the senate may begin discussion of s 3036 the week of june 2 on may 21 2008 senator boxer announced proposed substitute amendment to the liebermanwarner bill4 this amendment would make significant changes to the bill for detailed discussion of key terms and concepts used in this report see crs report rl34489 climate change costs and benefits of s 2191 which provides background and much more detailed analysis of the bill crs has identified five key changes that would be made by the boxer amendment these five do not represent all changes in the amendment considering the time constraints these five are discussed in this report other changes may also be of interest in the debate the five key changes discussed below are 1 originally entitled americas climate security act of 2007 2 for more more detailed discussion of s 2191 as reported provisions see crs report rl34489 climate change costs and benefits of s 2191 by larry parker and brent yacobucci for comparison with other proposals see crs report rl33846 greenhouse gas reduction capandtrade bills in the 110th congress by larry parker and brent yacobucci 3 submitted to cbo april 9 2008 cbo s 2191 americas climate security act with an amendment april 10 2008 4 as of may 23 2008 the substitute amendment was available at the epw website httpepwsenategovpublic crs2 the establishment of costcontainment auction that would expand the number of allowances available in early years changes to the limits and applicability of domestic offsets international offsets and international allowances elimination of the climate change credit corporation and the establishment of climate change technology board major changes in the scheme for how allowances are auctioned or distributed at cost to covered entities and noncovered entities and establishment of carbon market oversight mechanisms costcontainment auction the boxer amendment would establish costcontainment auction for this auction the amendment would take share of allowances from 2031 through 2050 and make them available for auction in the early years of the program 2012 through 2027 at the end of 2012 maximum of 450 million allowances would be available for sale in each successive year the number available would be reduced by 1 in total up to 6 billion allowances would be available through these costcontainment auctions for the auctions the amendment would establish costcontainment auction price effectively reserve price for the auction for 2012 the president would determine the initial reserve price of between 22 and 30 per ton in each successive year the reserve price would increase by the rate of inflation plus 5 this provision would essentially allow the borrowing of limited number of future allowances at reduced rate in general both the bill and the boxer amendment allow borrowing but require 10 annual rate of interest on borrowed allowances assuming the allowance price for given year is above the cost containment price participants in the auction will likely bid up the price to something similar to the current allowance price on the other hand if the allowance price on the secondary market is below the costcontainment price there may be limited participation in the costcontainment auction all other things being equal having larger pool of allowances early should lower the price of allowances but it is difficult to predict the magnitude of that price effect use of domestic offsets international offsets and international allowances the boxer amendment would substantially alter the amount and type of offsets that covered sources could use to comply with the emissions cap under the reported version of the bill covered entity could only use domestic offsets andor international allowances the boxer amendment expands the offset opportunities to include international offsets and international forest credits in the reported version of the bill an individual covered entity could meet up to 15 of its allowance requirement through the use of domestic offsets and an additional 15 through the use of international allowances the boxer amendment would eliminate the facilityspecific limitation and would direct epa to restrict the available pool of domestic offsets to 15 international offsets to 5 and international forest credits to 10 of the aggregate quantity of emission allowances distributed under the cap crs3 international allowances could be used if any of the above percentages were not maximized5 although the boxer amendment would increase flexibility by removing the facilityspecific limitation for offset use the amendment would effectively reduce the total number of offsets potentially available in given year the example below illustrates this substantial change in 2012 both s 2191 and the boxer amendment set the number of allowances available to covered entities at 5775 million allowances in the reported version covered facility must submit to epa an allowance offset or international allowance for each ton of actual emissions by allowing facilities to submit offsets andor international allowances to satisfy up to 30 of their allowance submission 15 from domestic offsets and 15 from international allowances the total allowance cap 5775 would essentially represent 70 of actual emissions permitted for instance if there was only one covered facility in the united states and it emitted 8250 million tons of co2e in 2012 the facility could submit 5775 million allowances and 2475 million tons in offsets and international allowances6 however under the boxer amendment the total number of offsets which would include domestic international forestry credits and international allowances would be limited to 30 of the aggregate pool of allowances distributed under the cap therefore the hypothetical facility described above could only use 1733 tons in offsets7 in addition eliminating restrictions on the use of certified offsets the expansion of allowable offset types international offsets and forest credits may lower the costs of the capandtrade program under the reported bill covered entities had only indirect access by purchasing international allowances to these lowercost reduction opportunities the boxer amendment permits direct use of these options however there may be some concern that the increased use of international offsets particularly those in the forestry sector could flood the market with possibly questionable emission reductions8 changes in established entities the reported version of s 2191 would establish climate change credit corporation to auction allowances under the program the corporation would use the proceeds from those auctions to fund various purposes including technology development and adaptation programs as reported s 2191 states that the corporation shall not be considered an agency or establishment of the federal government the boxer amendment would eliminate 5 an international allowance is an allowance purchased from an approved foreign cap and trade system in lieu of using or trading the allowance within its own system foreign firm could choose to sell the allowance to us firm who could use the allowance for compliance with the us program in lieu of an allowance allocated domestically 6 8250 x 03 2475 7 5775 x 03 1733 8 see crs report rl34436 the role of offsets in greenhouse gas emissions capandtrade program potential benefits and concerns by jonathan l ramseur crs4 the corporation instead allowances would be auctioned by epa the funds from those auctions would be disbursed by climate change technology board explicitly established as an agency of the federal government allocation scheme both s 2191 and the boxer amendment use detailed scheme for allocating allowances to covered entities noncovered entities and auctions the total number of allowances for all years is equal in s 2191 and the boxer amendment although the timing of those allocations may be different as the boxer amendment allows for the auction of some allowances early see cost containment auction above further the reported bill and the boxer amendment would distribute those allowances differently in all years relative to the reported version the boxer amendment would allocate larger share of allowances to non covered entities eg states and smaller share for covered entities and for auctions for example in 2012 the reported version of s 2191 would allocate roughly 36 of allowances to covered entities 33 to noncovered entities and 31 for auctions under the boxer amendment assuming all available costcontainment allowances are purchased 32 of allowances would go to covered entities 34 to noncovered entities and 30 would be auctioned table 1 shows allowance allocations in various years for the reported version of s 2191 as amended by the proposed deficit reduction amendment identical to the introduced version of s 3036 and table 2 shows the allocation of auction revenues tables 3 and 4 show allowance allocations in the same years under the boxer amendment for each table direct allocations to covered sectors are labeled cov direct allocations to non covered entities are labeled nc and auctions are labeled auc9 various groups have modeled the economic effects of s 2191 including projections of allowance prices in each year of the program using one of the low cost scenarios epas adagetech scenario estimates of the values of the allowance allocations and auction revenues in s 2191 and the boxer amendment are shown in tables 5 and 610 the same allowance price was used in both tables however it should be noted that some of the changes made by the boxer amendment would likely reduce costs11 to the extent that allowance prices increase or decrease in one version of the bill relative to another the value of allocations and the estimated auction revenues would also increase or decrease carbon market oversight mechanisms the boxer amendment would establish carbon markets working group including the epa administrator the secretary of the treasury and the chairmen of the securities and exchange commission the commodities futures trading commission and the federal energy regulatory commission the group must identify the major issues related to the integrity efficiency orderliness fairness and competitiveness of the carbon market 9 in each of the tables the allocations are presented in the sectionbysection order they appear in the bill or amendment 10 for detailed analysis of the assumptions used in epas model as well as crss assumptions about certain program costs see crs report rl34489 climate change costs and
