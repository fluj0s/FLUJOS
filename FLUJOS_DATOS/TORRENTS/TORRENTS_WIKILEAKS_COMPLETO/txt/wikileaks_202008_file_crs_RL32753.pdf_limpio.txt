logic involved is mu ch more apparent when ideas history is examined idea was originally enacted in 1975 as the education for all handicapped children act pl 94142 th primary motive for its enactment

considerable pressure to pr ovide such services and they lobbied congress to assist them in enacting pl 94142 congress provided gr ants to the states to help pay for education for children with disabilities and also delineated specific requirements the states must follow in order to receive th federal funds these requirements did not contain discipline provision per but rather contained re quirement that if there is dispute between the school and the pare nts of child with disability the child stays put in his or her current educa tional placement until the dispute is resolved using the due process procedur set forth in the statute the concept of stay put was placed in the statute to help eliminat the then common discriminatory practice of expelling children with disabilities fro m school revised stay put provision remains as law in the current version of idea7 issues relating to children with disabilities who exhibited violent or inappropriate beha vior have been raised for number of years in 1988 the question of whether there was an implied exception to the stay put rule was presented to the supreme court in honig v doe 8 honig involved emotionally disturbed children one of whom had choked another student with sufficient for ce to leave abrasions on the childs neck and who had kicked out window while he was being escorted to the principals office the other child in the honig case had been involved in stealing extorting money and making lewd comment s the school had sought expulsion but the supreme court disagreed finding that congress very much meant to strip schools of the unilateral authority they had traditionally employed to exclude disabled students particularly emo tionally disturbed students from school9 however the court observed that this holding did not leave educators hamstrungwhere student poses an immediate threat to the safety of others officials may temporarily suspend him or her for up to 10 school daysand in those cases in which the parents of truly dangerous child adamantly refuse to permit any change in placement the 10day respite gives school officials an opportunity to invoke the aid of the courts under sec tion 1415e2 which empowers courts to grant any appropriate relief10 this statement about the schools right to seek judicial relief has come to be known as honig injunction the supreme courts interpretation of idea in honig did not quell all concerns about discipline and children with disa bilities in 1994 congress amended ideas stay put provision to give schools the unilate ral authority to remove child with

reauthorization to in clude situations where student has inflicted serious bodily injury upon another person while at school the department of education ed had received numerous questions from schools about discipline and in 1995 issu ed memorandum discussing numerous discipline issues including the use of manifestation determinations11 if school sought to suspend or expel child with disability for more than 10 days the school must first make manifestation determina tion determination concerning whether the students misconduct was rela ted to his or her disability if the behavior was not related to the disability the school could suspend or expe l for more than 10 days but must continue to provide ducation services if the be havior was related to the disability the school must give notice of any recommended change in placement and if the parent objected the parent c ould invoke the stay put provision the department found that honig injunctions court orders to change the placement of child with disability were proper when school believed th at maintaining the child in his or her current placement was substantially likely to result in injury to the student or others the concept of manifestation determination was placed in statutory language in 1997 by pl 10517 as was the regulatory interpretation that educational services cannot ceas for children with disabilities even if they have been suspended or expelled both of these pr ovisions are kept in pl 108446 but the manifestation determinati on and the stay put on app eals provisions are amended discipline provisions in the

public agency provides similar services to child wit hout disability who is similarly removed32 manifestation determination as was noted previously the concep t of manifestation determination originated in policy interpretations of id ea by the department of education the theory is that when behavior even inappropriate behavior is caused by disability the response of school must be different than when the beha vior is not related to the disability this requireme nt was codified by pl 10517 in 1997 and amended by the 2004 reauthorization33 the individuals with disabilities edu

maintaining the current placement of the child is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others40 the individuals with disabilities edu cation improvement act of 2004 changed the stay put provision in the appeals section it should be noted that one of the core requirements of the original 1975 law and one which rema ins in the current statute is the requirement that child with disability remains in his or her current educational placement during th pendency of 615 proceedings41 the rationale for this provision was to ensure that children with disabilities were not excluded from receiving an education while parent disputed issues relating to the provision of free appropriate public educa tion however an exception to this general provision was made for children with disabilities who are placed in interim alternative educational settings in the 1997 reauthoriza tion and this exception is amended by the 2004 reauthorization under the 2004 reauthorization when an ppeal has been requested by either parent or the lea under 615k3 whi ch concerns appeals regarding manifestation determination or placement in an interim alternative educational setting the child is to remain in the interim alternative educational setting pending the decision of the hearing officer or until the time period for the disciplinary infraction ends under previous law the child was to
