reauthorization of the fund prior to passage of the taxpayers relief act of 1997 occurred in the aforementioned airport and airway trust fund tax reinstatement act of 1997 temporary extension of the taxes also occurred in august 1996 as part of the small business job protection act of 1996 pl 104 188 prior to these temporary extensions the last regular reauthorization of the fund occurred with passage of federal aviation administration authorization act of 1994 pl 103305 the most recent change in the levels of revenue dedicated to the trust fund occurred as part of obra 902 the aviation

of fy1995 this uncommitted balance dropped dramatically in fy1996 due to the temporary lapse in revenue collections for the fund the uncommitted balance in the fund is sometimes and controversially

community view the surplus in the fund as breach of contract with those paying the taxes they contend that the taxes are collected solely to improve the national aviation system appropriators however take the view that aviation taxes are part of the unified budget system and that federal spending for aviation activities must be done in accordance with the establishment of overall budget priorities the almost 8month lapse in authority to collect taxes for the aviation trust fund during 1996 had significant effect on the balances in this fund by some estimates over 4 billion in revenues were not collected during this period spending from the fund however did not diminish the 2month lapse in 1997 cost the funds an additional 1 billion these stoppages have had an obvious net effect of dramatically reducing the unexpended balance in the fund according to an april 1996 gao report the existing balance in the trust fund would have been depleted by the end of calendar year 1996 if the fund had not been reauthorized in august 19964 similar predictions were made for 1997 prior to the funds reinstatement budget implications the insecurity surrounding trust fund revenues during the last 2years had some serious potential shortter m implications the department of transportation and related agencies appropriations act 1997 pl 1042 05 for example assumes that the taxes will be collected at level sufficient to fund the faa and its programs during the year5 the assumptions in fy1998 appropriations discussions to date also assume continuation of the trust fund with passage of the taxpayer relief act of 1997 these issues have moreorless disappeared the user fee issue there is longstanding debate in the aviation community about the usefulness andor desirability of user fees

aviation administration independent financial assessment final report february 28 1997 some information in this report is considered proprietary by its authors the report is available to congressional requestors from the federal aviation administrationsystem is certainly based on collections from users but this system is viewed by many observers as less than perfect proxy for user fee system the ticket tax for example is collected on the basis of wide range of fares charged by airlines for what is essentially standard product an airline seat the operating requirements of the air traffic control atc system however are based on the movement of aircraft 200seat aircraft and 20seat aircraft operating under atc control require similar level of atc services but obviously pay into the trust fund at very different rates6 the debate about how best to charge users was an important element of discussion in the process that led to passage of the federal aviation reauthorization act of 1996 1996 actpl 104264 during consideration of this legislation the house took the position that user fees should be studied as an faa funding mechanism but that for the short term it would be expedient to reinstate the excise taxes in the preexisting system for 3 years the senate originally called for shorter reinstatement of the tax system 18 months the compromise in the 1996 act is the establishment of 21member national civil aviation review commission review commission the review commission which began meeting in the late spring of 1997 is tasked with proposing new user fee financing system for the faa the 1996 act also called for an independent assessment of the faas financial requirements through the year 2002 the outside assessment was completed earlier this year7 the 1996 act gives the commission 6 months to formulate its recommendations following completion of this outside assessment the commission is expected to make these recommendations in late summer 1997 the user fee proposal of the coalition for fair faa funding it is said that nature abhors vacuum similar effect might be observed in the discussion about renewal of aviation taxes the absence of clear prospect of renewal of excise taxes that occurred in early 1996 encouraged proposals from individuals and groups seeking an alternative to the current system of taxation prior to 1996 most of the debate about user fees centered on whether general aviation aircraf t pay proportionate share for their use of the system the airline industry typically had been seen as an interested but basically nonparticipant party in this debate in late may 1996 seven major airlines and the regional airline association began actively promoting replacement user fee system operating as the coalition for fair faa funding coalition this grouping put forward proposal that would replace the airline ticket tax element of the current system with new user fee systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97657crs6 8 roberts roach associates air

fee per airplane seat 1 for commuter aircraft 450 for each passenger origin ation and 005 per nonstop revenue passenger mile one passenger flying one mile according to documents prepared by the coalition this proposal would raise just slightl less on an annual basis than the current tax structure8 the coalition views its proposal as fairer approach to funding than the ticket tax because it would charge for actual use of the aviation system the coalition ackno wledges that certain group of airlines ie southwest america west reno air and valujet would contribute more to the trust fund under their proposal than they had previously not surprisingly southwest and some other smaller airlines disag ree with the specifics of the coalition proposal they view it as an attempt to raise their costs and hence their fares thereby affording coalition airlines certain competitive advantage the position of these smaller carriers has been bolstered by the findings of the gaos previously mentioned december 1996 report on trust fund issues the report suggests that user fee system for funding the faa could be desirable if properly structured the report however finds that the coalitions proposals raise number of competitive issues because of the way in which additional costs would be imposed on smaller airlines throughout the remainder of 1996 and well into 1997 the coalition was unable to obtain significant support for its proposal from the clinton administration or congressional sources they did however keep the user fee issue in front of congress and the clinton administration the administration is on record as supporting greater role for user fees in funding the faa and included 300 million of unspecified user fees in its fy1998 budget submission for the faa congress looked at the aviation tax issue early in the 1st session of the 105th congress in couple of different forums the aviation subcommittee of the house committee on transportation and infrastructure held hearings on aviation user fees on february 5 and 13 19979 this hearing occurred during the period in which the aviation taxes had lapsed but the hearing also discussed the longterm user fee issue also the house committee on ways and means at the direction of chairman archer formed transportation tax task force to examine all transportation taxes including those for aviation this task force met several times early in the session it did not produce any specific formal recommendations on aviation user fees the task force however is known to have collected substantial information about various possible tax implementation scenarioshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97657crs7 10 this tax is also being called head tax by some this is confusing usage because the already existing airport passenger facility charge is also sometimes referred to as head tax 11 the senate bill provides instructions for airlines as to how the international segment tax is to be computedthe revenue reconciliation process the needs of the budget reconciliation process captured the aviation tax issue as part of their respective plans to accommodate significant tax cuts and at the same time establish glide path to balanced budget in fy2002 both the house committee on ways and means and the senate committee on finance addressed the longterm structure of the aviation tax system in their revenue reconciliation proposals in each instance the committees chose to raise aviation tax levels and hence revenues they also provided taxing authority for 10 years both of these actions could be viewed as at least in part removing the longterm assumption of linkage between aviation taxes and faa funding needs the revenue reconciliation process visavis aviation taxes has focused on the issue of providing additio nal revenues for the budget in the years ahead the approaches chosen by the house and senate to meet this goal were significantly different but the net budgetary effects were similar the revenue projections in the house proposal showed aviation tax revenues of approximately 342 billion over 5 years senate revenue projections were comparable the specifics of the house and senate proposals are shown in table 1 the house proposal made the more dramatic changes to the aviation taxation system of the two the house has in part adopted the proposals of the coalition and established flat tax on airline flight segments to accommodate this change in taxation the house reduced the ticket tax and established new flat rate segment tax10 the net effect of this action is to reduce taxation levels on higher fare long haul domestic flights in some instances and at the same time increase taxes on some lower fare shorthaul flights southwest airlines not surprisingly launched major public relations and advertising campaign against this initiative both proposals aggressively increased taxation on international air travel the high departure and arrivals charge s imposed in the house bill may or may not be comparable in dollar terms to the new tax on the domestic segment of international flights imposed by the senate in conjunction with its lower departure and arrivals taxes airlines do not typically publish separate fares for the domestic portion of an international trip11 as result it is difficult to know with any precision how airlines would charge for this portion of the trip the increased taxation of international travel will raise the cost of this travel whether and how much this will affect international travel remains to be seen international travel is known to be price sensitive but other factors such as exchange rates and physical security in destination countries also affect the decision to travel outside the united states controversial element in the both proposals was the application of the ticket tax 75 house 10 senate to amounts paid for right to award free or reducedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97657crs8 rate air transportation this tax would apply to frequent flyer awards earned as part of credit card use rental car use and other programs tied to the airlines frequent flyer programs these widely used programs have not been subject to taxation in the past the house bill also diverted the existing 43 centgallon tax on aviation gasoline and jet fuel to the airport and airway trust fund this would provide the trust fund with significant increase in revenue the senate bill did not have the same provision but the senate bill did redirect the portion of the 43 centsgallon tax on highway fuels to the highway trust fund and to new intercity rail trust fund effects of the taxpayer relief act of 1997 the aviation tax provisions of the taxpayer relief act of 1997 are compromise between the house and senate proposals structurally congress adopted the house proposal on airline passenger taxation as result many observers are suggesting that the views of the coalition representing the 7 largest us airlines prevailed in the debate this view is only partially true the coalition originally proposed system that was entirely based on user charges the reduction of 25 in the general passenger ticket tax is movement in that general direction but is far cry from its elimination in addition future growth of the segment tax could over time mitigate the effect of the percentage reduction and could lead to higher total dollar levels of taxation on some airline fares for example 240 round trip fare from washington national to denver on major airline involving 4 segments is currently taxed at rate of 24 when the new system is fully implemented and the segment fee has reached the 3 level this same trip will be taxed at rate of 30 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97657crs9 table 1 aviation excise tax provisions in fy1998

is true that some lowfare airlines will experience greater tax burdens and that these will likely translate into highe r fares it would not appear however that the increase in tax levels for this carrier group is so great visavis the potential effects on its competitors that the lowfare airlines might be put at major competitive disadvantage the new tax system raises costs dramatically for two groups of travelers international travelers and frequent flyer program participants whose milage is earned by nonflying activities such as credit card use for the international traveler the effect will be immediate and visible the 18 per round trip increase in arrival and departure taxes is probably not however sufficient in and of itself to cause any large change in travel behavior for frequent flyer program participants the effect of the new tax system is likely to take some time to implement and may be somewhat invisible to program participants this is because the tax is imposed at what might be thought of as the wholesale level this puts the onus of how to change these programs on the program operators who may choose variety of different ways to pass on their additional costs some of which might be quite subtle finally the imposition of new aviation tax regime at this time will likely make it more difficult for those seeking new financial structure for funding federal aviation activities additional revenues in the trust fund do not necessarily equate to additional funding for aviation in fact the balanced budget agreement allows for only modest increases in overall transportation spending in the years ahead as result it is possible that the tax increases in the taxpayer relief act will become new issue in the context of the long standing congressional discussion of the budgetary status of all transportation trust funds
