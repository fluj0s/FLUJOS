economic growth and developm ent versus constraining greenhouse gases that are confounding efforts such as the unite d nations framework convention on climate change unfccc and the kyoto protocol to address global climate change eight nations austria france italy iceland luxembourg norway sweden and switzerland combine high per capita gdp among the top20 nations with the lowest intensity of greenhouse gas emi ssions of all nations between 107 and 70 tons per million gdp taking the wer level of their per capita gdp 23500 and an intensity of 100 this analysis examines the greenhouse gas emissionimplications of world achieving those levels of economic activity and greenhouse gas intensity the relationship of population economic gr owth and emissions is defined by population x per capita gdp x intensity emissions this relationship can be applied globally to individual nations or to groups of nations one can calculate the implications of different popula tion levels different economic development levels different emissions targets etc obviously if population rises emissions w ill rise unless per capita gdp andor intensity decrease enough to offset the rise likewise if per capita gdp rises emissions will rise unless intensity andor population d ecrease enough to offset it with the formula one could test numerous variations this analysis focuses on the one empiricallybased set global per capita gdp of 23500 an intensity of100 and the 2000 world population of 6 billion with those assumptions greenhouse gas emissions would be 141 billi on tons per year about 55 more than the 91 billion tons actually emitted in 2000 whether global greenhouse gas emissions of 141 billion tons per year or more as population increases would pose threat of global warming sufficient to justify impeding that economic development andor stimulating even more aggressive actionto improve greenhouse gas intensity awaits growing scientific understanding and the decisions of world leaders nd the manifestation of events for some the finding that one can constr uct an empirically based approach that achieves standard of living for 6 billion people equal to several european nationswhile not increasing global greenhouse gas missions by more than about 55 will be optimistic for others the emissions level may appear unacceptable implying either constraints on economic growth or even more aggressive improvements in intensity for still others any worry about greenhouse gas emissions is misdirected this report will not be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32762contents

defining goals introduction longterm international efforts to address future global climate change have had to struggle with significant country and re gionspecific differences in possible policy responses related to differing economic technical and politi cal circumstances foremost among these regional differences is the divide between developed and less developed nations in terms of contributions to current and future annual greenhouse gas emissions and the related possible global climate change how to treat in fair way the implications of significantly different material standards of living between developed and developing countries is key conflictarising in international negotiations to slow the growth of or even to reduce futureglobal greenhouse gas emissions the conflict arises because any pressure to reduce emissions comes up against the increases in emissions likely to result from economicdevelopment and rising st andards of living in deve loping economies which contain large share of the worlds population this report explores what future wo rld economic growth and development means for proposals to constrain total nnual global greenhouse gas emissions this analytical exercise uses international data for the three countrys pecific variables that will determine future annua l greenhouse gas emissions population per capita gross domestic product gdp and greenhouse ga s emissions per million dollars of gdp intensity the analysis presents scenarios s howing what levels of greenhouse gas emissions would be if the world popula tion was at benchmark per capita gdp comparable to several european nations that currently have the lowest greenhouse gas emissions per million dollars of gdp among all developed nations the paperanalyzes benchmark based on the inter actions of economic activity population and greenhouse gasemitting activities exemplified by the selected nations but does not deal with the time involved to transition to the higher level of development the empiricallyderived benchmark is an analytical construct designed to illustrate thedynamics involved in designing global gr eenhouse gas emissions goals the report does not present set of pr ojections or predictions background the current international approach to controlling greenhouse gas emissions as contained in the united nations fr amework convention on climate change unfccc and the kyoto protocol is to limit emissions of designated developedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32762crs2 1 following the breakup of the former soviet union various eastern european and former soviet republics economies contracted in th 1990s such that their emissions declined between 1990 and 2000 2 emissions tons divided by economic activity gdp see discussion belownations listed in an annex i relative to baseline of 1990 for the unfccc the target was for annex i nations voluntarily to return emissions to 1990 levels there was penalty for failure for the kyoto protocol which amends the unfccc thetarget is for annex i nations to hold 20082012 emissions to specified percentage of the 1990 baseline sanctions for fa ilure have not yet been defined this approach has twofold logic 1 the annex i nations having achieved development and having contributed th most to cumulative greenhouse gas emissions are generally considered rich enough to make inves tments in controlling greenhouse gases and 2 the annex ii na tions undergoing development are exempted from greenhouse gas emission limits so as not to constrain theiropportunities to expand activitie s that may be essential to their economic growth the success of this approach is problematic except for the former soviet bloccountries the unfccc voluntary targets generally were not achieved 1 likewise many signatories to the kyoto protocol are anticipated not to meet their targets andfurther the worlds largest emitter of greenhouse gases the united states has refused to join finally this approach even if valid as first step could have littlelongterm effect on cumulative emissions since it lacks longterm limits for anynation and leaving developing nations free to develop without greenhouse gas limits likely means that their emissions will at some time in the future exceed any diminution of emissions from developed nations to illustrate if one were to assume that in 2000 all nations equaled the united states in per capita economic activity th the global gdp would have been about 204 trillion at the us greenhouse gas intensity 2 of 195 then global emissions would have been nearly 40 billion tons of carbon equivalents per year compared to actual emissions of about 91 billion tons in 2000 so are the twin objectives of holdi ng down greenhouse gas emissions and of fostering economic growth compatible can one visualize world in which allpeoples achieve comfortable standard of living without greenhouse gas emissions causing unacceptable global warming two alternative views of the situation avoid the conflict analyzed in this report first the apparent conflict in objectives can be mooted if one concludes that greenhouse gases do not cause global warming for those who hold this pos ition growth can proceed without concern for emissions second th apparent conflict might also be mooted if one concludes that economic activity can be delinked from fossil fuel energy use within an acceptabl time period for those who believe that many opportunities exist to save energy at little or cost with appropriate technical fixes the conflict can be avoided at least fo r some time and economic development can proceed without increas ing emissions rates and other societal benefits can also be achieved such as reduced air pollution httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32762crs3 3 the analysis in this report is based on the climate analysis indicators tool cait created by the world resources institute the database uses variety of data sources to provide information on greenhouse gas emissions

number of the worlds very poorest nations have very low emissions and intensitiesanalytical approach identifying benchmark countries given concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and the risk of global warmin g on the one hand and the desire for and impetus of economic growth on the other the challenge of finding way to merge the objectives persists the approach of this report is to identify nations that havebest combined economic growth and low greenhouse gas emissions their accomplishment becomes benchmark for examining implications for greenhouse gas emissions if all nations equaled their achievements in balancing economicactivity and greenhouse gas emissions this study compares hypothetical wo rld of economic activity and greenhouse gas emissions based on the be nchmarks to the actual situation in 2000 the report does not explore whether all nations could in fact achieve the benchmarks nor deal with technological or other ch anges that might be relevant table 1 presents data

relationship of the goals for this analysis the relationships of population economic activity and emissi ons are expressed by the following formula population percapitagdp intensity emissions equation 1 gdp data are presented on per capita basis to provide comparability across nations or categories of nations the implication for the two goals of economic growth nd of constrained emissions is clear if econo mies grow and population is stable or rises emissions will rise unless intensity decreases enough to offset the rise thus intensity becomes focus of analysis factors affecting in tensity

combined greenhouse gas intensity of less than 110 tons per million dollars gdp w ith per capita gdps of 23490 or better while six of the eight are relatively sm all in terms of both geography and total gdp the other two italy and france are among the top 15 nations in terms of both size of total economy and amount of gr eenhouse gases emitted this shows that substantial economies can rank low in greenhouse gas intensity and that such efficiency is not rest ricted to only small countriesec onomies from the perspective of global economic developm ent benchmark of per capita gdp of 23500 at the low end of the eight falling between france and sweden could be taken as areasonable starting point for analysis with 23500 as the parity gdp benchmark the worlds nations can be categorized into

this analysis the first called the global parity scenar io assumes the benchmar k parity gdp of 23500 the benchmark greenhouse gas intensity of 100 and the 2000 world population of 6 billion the second called the parity with grandfathering scen ario makes the same assumptions as the global parity scenari but maintains grandf athers higherthan parity gdps and the associated emissi ons for those nations whose 2000 per capita gdps exceeded the benchmark of 23500 the results are presented below global parity scenario combining the values of intensity equaling 100 and 23500 parity gdp w ill result in higher emissions with the higher gdps of developing nations emissions will be higher thus if in 2000 the 6 billion inhabitants of the planet each shared per capita gdp of 23500 decline for 19 developed nations listed in table 5 substantial increase for much of the rest of the world then the global economy woul d have been about 141 trillion and at an intensity of 100 annual gree

would find scenario that decreased their gdp levels ve ry appealing an alternative scenario to strict parity is one that gra ndfathers any gdp above parity grandfathering changes equation 1 by an additive factor it is not multiplier population percapitagdp intensitywp population percapitagdp percapitagdp intensitynn pnp emissions equation 2 in which w is world n is nations p is parity and np

ng to per capita gdps of 23500 and greenhouse gas intensity of 100 for all nations then emissions would be pproximately 145 billion tons this is nearly 60 higher than actual 2000 emissions the last column of table 5 shows grandfathered gdps of the 145 billion tons about 370 million tons would result from the grandfathered nations extra economic activity thus in this scenario maintaininggdps higher than 23500 adds less than 3 to emissions compared to the scenario with all nations having the parity gdp nd an intensity of 100 note that grandfathering aboveparity gdps mean s that the world per capita gdp 24167 is higher than the parity level this scenario could be called minimum per capitagdp standard of living of 23500 of that grandfathered 370 million tons the united states would emit about 295 million tons or 80 however because th scenario assumes an intensity of 100 rather than the actual us intensity of 195 the total emissions under the scenario are still 942 million tons less than the ited states 2000 actual emissions of 1892 million tons however even assuming gdps above 23500 are maintained the emissions could be kept at base vel say the 141 billion tons at parity by constructing scenario in which those nations with higherthanparity gdps had greenhouse gas intensities below 100 in this variation all nations with per capita gdps of 23500 would be at an intensity of 100 while t hose with higher gdps would have lower intensities such that the calculations of equation 1 produced global greenhouse gas emissions at 141 billion tons this scenari offsetting the emissions attributable to the amount of gdp grandfathered would par ticularly affect the united states which accounts for 80 of the grandfathered gdphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32762crs12 as table 6 shows switzerland and sweden already are offsetting their higher thanparity gdps france with per capita gdp just 20 less than parity and an intensity of 99 effectively defines the parity gdp austria

report has tr eated the variables of equation 1 as an illustrative tool not prediction of future gr owth or distribution the analysis has compared scenarios to the 2000 situation in reality economic development is and will be continuing process with nations exhibiting differing growth rates dependingon starting points resource endowments in stitutional structures and so on any attempt to translate the results and insights of this exercise into an enforceableagreement would extend beyond the issue of appropriate emission targets in whatever form to issues of implementation strategy and compliance timetablesthose considerations are bey ond the scope of this paper however the implications of differing growth rates could be analyzed by incorporating growth rates into equation 1 this would allow evaluation of policies that affect the rates of growth for the variableshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32762crs14 15 this is grandfathering only the amount of gdp above parity in 2000 for the population at that time in fact aboveparity gdp nations gdps will presumably continue to grow over time and thus the amount that could be grandfathered will grow this analysis ignores that growth in order to avoid having to projec t growth as result if future aboveparity growth is grandfathered the analysis understates emissions growth however it should be remembered that grandfathering is an dd on to emissions not multiplier and in the scenario of parity gdps with global intensity at 100 grandfathering aboveparity gdps in 2000 increased emissions less than 3incorporating growth equation 1

emissions are rising if the sum is negative emissions are declining obviously if any one of the three variables on the left increases more than the sum of the other two decreases emissions rise since population is rising globally and national and intern ational efforts are fostering the development of belowparity gdp nations intensity is the variable of focus for constraining emissions outcomes and sensitivity to alternative values one could test numerous assumptions this analysis has focused on one set parity gdp of 23500 with and without grandfathering an intensity of 100 and the 2000 world population table 7 summarizes the results and for illustrative purposes includes further variations as described below equation 1 shows that even at globa l intensity of 100 which would in 2000 be considered best performance sta ndard greenhouse gas emissions will be rising in the future as economic activity increases at population of 6 billion achieving parity gdp of 23500 and an intensity of 100 global gree nhouse gas emissions would be 141 billion tons 55 with the same assumpti ons plus grandfathering15 aboveparity 2000 gdps emissions would be 145 billion tons

prospects the 2002 revision highlights esapw 180 26 february 2003 at httpwwwunorg esapopulationunpophtmone can also explore the implications of other values for the variables table 7 includes some illustrative variations for example if one thought that population were going to increase to level of 9 billion then at population of 9 billion the parity per capita gdp of 23500plus grandfathering 16 and an intensity of 100 emissions would be 215 billion tons 136 or if one thought that parity vel of 23500 were t oo high one could calculate the implications of lower leve l say an average per capita gdp of 15000 slightly more than double the 2000 world average per capita gdp at the 2000 population of 6 billion an intensity of 100 an average per capita gdp of 15000 and ignorin g grandfathering emissions would be 9 billion tons slightly lower than the 2000 level but at population of 9 billion an intensity of 100 and an averageper capita gdp of 15000 and ignorin g grandfathering emissions would be 135 billion tons or if one thought that global average intensity of 100 were too aggressive an improvement one could substitute higher value say 150 at the population of 6 billion an intensity of 150 an average per capita gdp of 23500 and ignoring grandfathering emissions would rise to 212 billion tons and at population of 9 billion an intensity of 150 an average percapita gdp of 23500 and ignoring grandfathering emissions would be 317 billion tons finally one could set value for tota l emissions and solve equation 1 for another of the variables for example suppose one ca pped emissions at 150 of current emissions for total of 137 billion tons then at the population of 6 billion and parity per capita gdp of23500 ignoring grandfathering and holding emissions at 137 billion tons 50 above 2000 emi ssions intensity would be 96 and at population of 9 billion and parity per capita gdp of 23500 ignoring grandfathering and holding emissions at 137billion tons 50 above 2000 emi ssions intensity would be 65 level below the developed wo rlds 2000 intensity leader switzerland at 70 these scenarios are only illustrative readers may wish to assign their own values to the

resolv emissions implications of the transitional situation17 while the complexity of an imple mentation strategy is beyond the scope of the paper the analysis does suggest one method for understanding the challenges involved in moving to world of econo mic growth for belowparity gdp nations within the context of constr ained greenhouse gas emissions those few countries that have achieved parity gdps with the lowest intensity may be considered benchmark for defi ning excess emissions this can be combined with the current interest in economic mechanisms for achieving efficientconstraints on the growth of greenhouse gases as shown by the last column of table 6 this metric provides calculation of shortfall or excess of current emissions compared to the emissions that result from the 23500 parity income times the 100 intensity goal the implications of this scenario for selected nations are shown in the far right hand column of table 6 plus means that the scenario results in higher emissions than actual emissions in 2000 minus means that the scenario results in lower emissions than actual 2000 emissi ons the growth implication is that plus nation could increase its emissions by the plus amount as its gdp grows and still be within the scenario the implica tion of minus nation is the opposite that under the scenario emissions would be less by the minus amount this gives rise to various possibilities one would be to tax excess emissions and the monies raised could be used for example to further economic development or to finance efforts at reducing intensity another possibility would be to createallowances out of the shortfalls which c ould be sold to countries with excessive emissions transferring monies to those shortfall nations while providing offsets to excess emitters also global trading scheme or global excess emissions tax deals with leakage in which greenhouse gasintens ive economic activitie s may be shifted from controlled to uncontrolled nations policy implications importan ce of greenhouse gas intensity the metrics of total emissions per capita emissions and intensity interrelate per capitagdp times intensity divided by one million equals per capita emissions population times per capita emissions equals total emissions but in considering tradeoffsbetween economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions intensity is more useful metric than per capita emissions mu ltiplying population times per capita emissions to get total emissions would say nothi ng about per capita or national gdp intensity on the other hand directly rela tes economic activity to total emissions emissions divided by gdp equals intensity using per capita gdp permits bothcomparisons among nations and incorpor ation of population into the calculation the bush administration has focused its greenhouse gas policies on intensity rather than emissions per so far this policy relies on voluntary actions ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32762crs18 18 papers outlining the administrations clim ate change initiative are available on the white house website httpwwwwhitehousegovne wsreleases200202climatechangehtml note the administrations intensity figu res include land use and are not directly comparable to the intensities used in this paperfocuses on the decline in intensity and suggests that this path will lead to an intensity decline of 17 over decade ending in 201218 total emissions are nonetheless projected to rise ultimate intensity goal is set nor is the rate of intensity decline tied to rates of growth in popula tion or economic activity finally if climate change concerns were ever to lead nati ons to t an upper bound cap on greenhouse gas emissions this analysis brings out the implications for economic growth and intensity of that cap when emissions are capped the rate of growth of emissions is 0 so equation 3a becomes kp kg ki 0 with cap then if any of the three lefthand variables is positive at least one of the others must be negative currently wo rld population is growing although few individual countries have nega tive population growth rates growth in gdp is goal both globally and for individual nations on year by year basis various nations gdps and even world gdp may contract but globally and for individual nations over time gdp has been growing when population and economic activity are growing then cap on emissions globally or for an individual nation implies decline in intensity at rate equal to the sum of the rates of growth of population and of per capita gdp concluding discussion this analysis assumes minimum sta ndard of living of 23500 per capita gdp in 2000 purchasing power parity based on benchmark countries the analysis identifies the differing actual starting point s of individual nations in terms of gdp population and greenhouse gas intensity but not other factors such as their resource endowments where the capital for developm ent would come from etc which mean that economic development occurs unevenly and dynamically over time in looking at the interaction of the countervailing forces of ec onomic growth and constrained greenhouse gas emissions th other factors will be important moreover differing rates of economic growth among nations and the continuing economic growth among aboveparity gdp nations makes any degree of achieving parity gdps and constraining missions more complicated and raises the issue of maintaining aboveparity gdps without grandfathe ring parity implies some transfer of wealth from richer to poorer nations through emissions trading or other mechanisms while accepting grandfathering implies higher emissions oreven further improvements in intensity world of minimum

ecting global economic activity and emissions of gr eenhouse gases some of these forces and choices will have the effect of increasing emissions others will have the opposite effect population growth currently about 12 per year19 means that economic activity must grow just to keep per capita gdp constant if world population were to leve l off at say 9 billion 50 increase over 2000 then at annua l per capita greenhouse emissions of 2 to 23 tons total emissions would be 18 to 207 billion tons ordouble those of 2000 economic growth must exceed population growth if per capita gdps are to grow but growth per may not meet thedistributional requirements to address poverty ie economic betterment of those at the bottom of the economic ladder greenhouse gas carbon intensity improved in many countries and globally between 1950 and 2000 see table 8 while those improvements were overall smaller than the rate of economicgrowth the examples of few nations such as france and swedensuggest that highintensity nations could improve public policy initiatives at global and national levels are addressing all three forces on population for example programs regarding health children and family planning all impactpopulation individual nations so have programs affecting populati on some exp licitly to encourage childbearing others the opposite on economic developmen t the united nations has underway set of programs to impr ove the standards of living of the worlds poorest 20 including goal to halve the number of persons living on less than one dollar pe r day by 2015 and many nations have or contribute to foreign aid programs to foster economic growth on greenhouse gas emissions initiatives include actionsunder the unfccc and kyoto protocol together with nationalprograms to improve energy efficiency to encourage energyconservation to develop carbon si nks and otherwise to reduce emissions of greenhouse gas emissions with international polic ies and programs to lleviate poverty and foster development together with increasing population this analysis indicates that the cruxof any goal of constraining greenhouse gas emissions is the leve l of intensity this in turn implies substantial decoupling of energy use and economic activity although not to an impossible level the analyzed level of 100 has been achieved by nations that rank in the top20 for both per capita

over the same decade world population grew 137 and per capita gdp grew 30 so emissions rose21 goal of all nations equa ling or bettering an intens ity of 100 would represent very substantial challenge for most na tions some studies have suggested that improving intensity could be achieved at low cost even in some cases at profit22 but the assumption that many regrets opportunities23 exist to reduce carbon emissions has not been borne out so far in practice as evidenced by the failure of most countries to meet the unfccc goal and likely problems in meeting the kyotoprotocol limits from policy perspective if constraining greenhouse gases were determined to be an appropriate action for all nations the question w ould be the relationships of and the relative efforts to be devoted to international and domestic policies andprograms that affect population economic growth and devel opment and intensity at present the first two are clearly manding proportionately more attention and resources than intensity is the purpose of this analysis has been to give some tangible sense of possible outcome from pursuing competing goals economic growth and development versus constraining greenhouse gases that are confounding efforts such as the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc and thekyoto protocol to address global climate change for some the finding that one canconstruct an empirically base d approach that achieves standard of living for the existing population equal to that of severa l european nations while not increasing global greenhouse gas emissions by more th an 60 will be optimis tic however this calculation ignores population growth and ssumes level of in tensity that may appear daunting to many for others the emissions may appear
