sunset date of october 1 2007 for the office of the sigir with transition operations authorized to continue through december 31 2007 the conferees support the comprehensive audit efforts of the sigir

conferees direct the si gir jointly with the inspectors general of the departments of state and defens and the inspector general of the us agency for international development u said to develop and submit such transition plan to congress by april 1 2007 the plan should ensure maintenance and accountability of all accumulated records and minimal if any disruption in the ability to oversee reconstruction funding or other us assistance to iraq the plan should include process and time line for transfer of open audits and investigations to the ppropriate departments of defense state or

did the termination provis ion get put in thats very good question we are both conferees were conferees and speaking for myself what i thought was the last version of the bill did not include that provision but i think its important that however it got in there and it certainly did not originate on the senate side that its important that we correct the problem go forward and extend the life of the office lieberman yes id just dd also as conferee that we didnt see this in the last version that we saw we checked after this became public and i dont believe that the leaders of the committee on the senate side or their staff knew it was in there senator collins had introduced an am endment to the military construction appropriations bill then under consideration on the nate floor this
