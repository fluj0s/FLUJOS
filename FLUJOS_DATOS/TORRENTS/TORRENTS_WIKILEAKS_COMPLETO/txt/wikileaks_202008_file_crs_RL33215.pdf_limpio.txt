december 30 2005 abstract congress and the president have often collided over access to information within the executive branch although executive oﬃcials recognize that they have duty to keep congress informed and to share agency documents domestic as well as national security on some occasions the executive branch will invoke diﬀerent types of privileges to block congressional access congressional committees can issue subpoenas and either house may hold executive oﬃcials in contempt for refusing to release documents or to testify however those measures are extreme and are taken only after customary eﬀorts to ﬁnd compromise have collapsed in the midst of some of these confrontations presidents have issued orders to executive agencies to limit information to congress particularly to prevent agency employees from going directly to congress congress has responded with statutes to keep the lanes of information open in cases involving the reporting of sensitive information related to national security congress has balanced the competing interests of keeping lawmakers informed while safeguarding secrets for example the intelligence community whistleblower protection act of 1998 encourages employees of the intelligence community to contact congress but only through the intelligence committees introduction agency whistleblowers operate within system of mixed messages on the one hand the code of ethics adopted by congress in 1958 directs all government employees to expose corruption wherever discovered over the years agency employees have received credit for revealing problems of defense cost overruns unsafe nuclear power plant conditions questionable drugs approved for marketing contract illegalities and improprieties and regulatory corruption on the other hand exposing corruption can result in their being ﬁred transferred reprimanded denied promotion or harassed in 1978 senate panel found that the fear of reprisal renders intraagency communications sham and compromises not only the employee management and the code of ethics but also the constitutional function of congressional oversight

december 30 2005 louis fisher senior specialist in separation of powers government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33215national security whistleblowers summary to discharge its constitutional duties congress depends on information obtained from the executive branch domestic and national security information is provided through agency reports and dir ect communications from department heads but lawmakers also receive information directly from employees within the agencies they take the initiative in notifying congress its committees and members of congress about alleged agency illegalities corruption and waste within the agency this type of information come s from group known as whistleblowers through such techniques as gag or ders and nondisclosure agreements presidents have attempted to block agency employees from coming directly to congress in response congress has enacted legislation in an effort to assure the uninterrupted flow of domes tic and national security information to lawmakers and their staffs members of congress have made it clear they do not want to depend solely on information provided by agency h eads overall the issue has been how to protect employees who are willing to ert congress about agency wrongdoing the first procedures enacted to protect agency whistleblowers appeared in the civil service reform of 1978 it also c ontained language that excluded protections to whistleblowers who work in federa l agencies involved in intelligence and counterintelligence in 1989 congress passe d the whistleblower protection act in an effort to strengthen statutory protecti ons for federal employees who assist in the elimination of fraud waste buse illegality and corruption that statute continued the exemption for national security informa tion it did not authorize the disclosure of any information by an agency or any pe rson that is 1 specifically prohibited from disclosure by any other provision of law or 2 specifically required by executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs several statutes apply expr essly to national security information congress has passed series of laws known collectively as the military whistleblowers protection act under which members of the military may give information to members of congress it also passed the intelligence community whistleblower protection act of 1998 to encourage the reporting to cong ress of wrongdoing within the intelligence agencies in crafting this legislation c ongress has sought to balance its need for information with national security requirements giving intelligence community whistleblowers access to congress only through the intelligence committees for legal analysis see crs

establishing new executive agencies to protect those ri ghts has not produced the prot ections that some expected as explained in this report the offi ce of special counsel the merit systems protection board and the federal circuit the agencies created by congress to safeguard the rights of whistle blowers have not in many cases provided the anticipated protections to federal employees national security whistleblowers were exempted from the civil service refo rm act of 1978 and the whistleblower protection act of 1989 some protections ar available in statutes passed in recent years including the intelligence commun ity whistleblower pr otection act of 1998 individual members and congressional committees have attempted to provide long term protections to whistleblowers enab ling them to provide the kinds of agency information that congress wants without costs and injuries to their government careers the purpose of this report is to explor the statutory and political protections available to national security whistleblowers first an examination of the civil service reform act and the whistleblower protection act will explain why national security whistleblowers were excluded from the protections provided in those statutes second to the extent that those statutes are consider ed models to protect national security whistleblowers the experi ence of the office of special counsel the merit systems protection boar d and the federal circuit is relevant in evaluating protections for national s ecurity whistleblowers whistleblower activity is often viewed as struggle between the executive and legislative branches presidents may d ecide to centralize control of agency information by requiring the agency head to approve the release of any information members of congress regularl express need to obtain information from employees within the agency without seeking the pproval of the agency head this conflict between the branches is seen in the i ssuance of executive orders by presidents theodore roosevelt and william howard taft in 1902 and 1909 and the resulting legislation the lloydla follette act of 1912 adopted by congress to maintain access to agency information the cons titutiona lity of the lloydlafollette act continues to be challenged t oday by the justice department gag orders and lloydlafollette both presidents theodore roosevelt and william howard taft threatened to fire agency employees who attempted to contact congress employees were ordered to communicate only through the head of thei r agency congress responded by passing legislation intended to nullify that policy and allow employees to contact lawmakers committees and legislative staff the gag orders president theodore roosevelt issued an order in 1902 to prohibit employees of executive departments from seeking to influe nce legislation individually or through associations except through the heads of the departments failure to abide by this presidential order could resu lt in dismissal from federal service the order readhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33215crs3 4 48 cong rec 4513 1912 5 ibid 6 ibid at 4657 statement of rep reilly 7 ibid 8 ibid

the language it is hereby ordered that bureau office or division chief or subordinate in any department of the government and fficer of the army or navy or marine corps stationed in washington shall

presidential orders congressiona l debate emphasized the concerns of lawmakers that the orders left unchecked would put congressional committees in the position of hearing only one side of case the views of cabinet officials lawmakers wanted to hear from the rank andfile members of department who could disclose what departments did not want communicated some members of congress argued that they would not place the welfare of citizens in the hands and at the mercy of the whims of any single individual whether he is cabinet officer or anyone else6 they insisted on access to agency employees and their complaints and observations about the c onduct of their supervisors7 legislative language was drafted to ensure that agency employees could exercise their constitutional rights to free

were required to speak only through the heads of the partments there is possible way of obtaining information excepting through the cabinet officers and if these officials desire to withhold informati on and suppress the truth or to conceal their official acts it is within their power to do so10 if agency employee was allowed to speak directly to congress and could communi cate only through the department and eventually the cabinet officer then this is an aristocratic government dominated completely by the official family of the president11 another legislator remarked the vast army of government employ ees have signed agreement upon entering the service of the government to give up the boasted liberty of the american citizens12 those themes also emerged during senate debate one senator said it will not do for congress to permit the executive branch of this government to deny to it the sources of information which ought to be free and open to it and such an order as this it seems to belongs in some other country than the united states13 the language used to counter the presidential or ders was added as section 6 to the postal service appropriations act of 191214 section

house of congress or to any committee or member thereof shall not be denied or interfered with section 6 was later carried forward nd supplemented by the civil service reform act of 1978 and is codified as permanent law15 the conference report on the 1978 statute explained why congress pends on agency employees to disclose information directly to the legislative branch the civil service reform act placed limitations on the kinds of information an employee may publicly disclose without suffering reprisal but the conference report stated that there was intent to limit the information an employee may provide to congress or to authorize reprisal against an employee for providing information to congress nothing in the statute was to be construed as limiting in any way the rights of

of 1978 congress passed legislation in 1978 to abolish the civil service commission and create such new institutions as the ffice of personnel management opm the merits systems protection board mspb and the office of sp ecial counsel osc the statute was the first to establish pro cedural protections for whistleblowers but also recognized an exception for the nationa l security area because of conflicting values in the legislation however whis tleblowers never received the anticipated protections and congress took note of th at decade later when it passed the whistleblower protection act of

to act as effective checks on excesses in the executive branch we have to hear about such matters23 during floor debate senato r jim sasser stated that patriotic employees who bring examples of official wrongdoing to the publics attention have in the past enjoyed meaningful protection against repr isals by their supervisors he referred to too many examples of federal employees finding themselves fired transferred or deprived of meaningful work simply because they were brave enough to place the public interest ahead of their own persona l career interest he saw reason why an

or prohibited by statute from disclosure29 it was the committees understanding that s ection 102d3 of the national security act of 1947 which authorizes protecti on of national intelligence sources

wrongdoing she stated that an fbi employee is guaranteed protection if he or she follows the procedures set out if the employee decided to make public disc losures of the wrongdoing this statute does not serve as authorization for the bureau to take reprisals the general policy of protecting whistleblowers runs to all government instrumentalities33 such intelligence agencies as the cia and the dia

however representative schroeder argued that the civil service reform act applies the merit system principles to all units of the federal government and that while specific forcement provisions are not mandated for agencies like cia and gao the legislation makes it clear that whistleblowers should be protected in these agencies35 in the event the special counsel received from an agency employee foreign intelligence or counterintelligence informa tion the disclosure of which is specifically prohibited by law or by executive order the statute directed the special counsel to transmit that information to the house permanent select committee on intelligence and the senate select committee on intelligence36 the special counsel was directed to make available to the pub lic list of

order requiring that information be kept secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs37 communications with congress the senate committee on governmental affairs added to the bill provision to ensure that nothing in the section on prohibited personnel prac tices will authorize the withholding of any information from congress or will sa nction any personnel action against an employee who discloses an information to member of congress or its staff either in public session or through private communications moreover nothing in the bill was to be construed as

supervisors or colleagues the situation may often be serious the committee believed that most employees would much prefer an effective channel inside the agency to pursue complaints rather than

between promise and practice with regard to whistleblower protections resulted from the complex and in some ways conflicting values placed in the statute although it expressly stated its intention to protect whistleblowers dominant purpose behind the statute was to make it easier to hold federal employees accountable for their performan ce in announcing the admin istrations civil service reform proposals president carter not ed widespread criticism of federal government performance the public suspects that there are too many government workers that they are underworked overp aid and insulated from the consequences of incompetence63 although he immediately dismi ssed such sweeping criticisms as unfair much of the impetus behind civil service reform was driven by the belief that managers needed greater discretion in demoting and removing underperforming employees in this same address president carter referred to the sad fact that it is easier to promote and to transfer incompetent employees than it is to get rid of them64 making it easier to punish in reporting the bill the senate committee on governmental affairs referred to conditions in federal agencies that ma them too often the refuge of the incompetent employee65 an employee has right to be incompetent66 one of the central tasks of the bill was simple to express but difficult to achieve allow civil servants to be able to be hired nd fired more easily but for the right reasons67 senator abraham ribicoff chairman of the committee that reported the bill listed two purposes of the gislation without indicating any tension between them the bill provided new protection for whistleblowers who disclose illegal or improper government conduc t while at the same time it streamlined the processes for dismissing and disciplining federal employees68 he explained that the bill lowered the standard of evid ence needed to uphold the dismissal of an employee who has been fired for poor perform ance instead of supervisor proving by preponderance of evidence that an employees performance had not been up to par the conferees adopted the substantial evidence test to give supervisors greater deference in assessing the work of an employee69 ironically if supervisor found whistleblowers charges to reflect on poor management within the agencyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33215crs14 70 public

early statements by president ronald reagan urged whistleblowers to come forward federal employees or private citizens who wish to report incidents of illegal or wasteful activities are not only encouraged to do so but will be guaranteed confidentiality and protected against reprisals the vital element in fighting fraud and waste is the willingness of employees to come forward when they see this sort of activity employees must be assured that when they blow the whistle they will be protected and thei r information properly investigated he wanted to make it clear that this administration is providing that assurance to every potential whistleblower in the federal government70 as presiding officer of house hear ings on june 26 1985 representative pat schroeder heard contrary tes timony

congress to that end and the end that the osc is charged with effecting73 federal employees who bring charges of agency wrongdoing are not the clients of this office the system is74 although some witnesses from the schroede r subcommittee argued that the osc was principally established to protect whistleblowers oc onnor testified that protection of whistle blowers even th word whistle blower

recent improvements in the operations of osc including an effective outreach program developed and maintained to apprise whistleblowers of the responsibilities of and protection afforded by this office77 he pledged to continue to use the statutory powers of this office to protect bona fide whistleblowers from prohibited retaliation for their protected disclosures by enforcin g the law that is by prosecuting anyone who takes reprisal against them because of their protected disclosures and by invoking appropriate agen cy corrective actions78 oconnor described how he would handle an employee who had been sanctioned by an agency even though th employee had been involved in protected whistleblower activities if an agency sanction was proper because of an employees incompetence or misconduct even though the motivation of the deciding or proposing official was contaminated by minimus vindictiveness or desire for retaliation and reprisal for protected conduct the sanction agai nst the employee will probably stand the reprisal oriented official however may be prosecuted by my office and may be disciplined by the board if the improper motivation of the conduct is not minimus this it seems to is proper and worthy result it is not in the public interest to empl oy retain or cosset drones incompetents disruptors of the workplace malefactors or those whose conduct is in other unlawful ways inappropriate to the execu tion of the mission of the organization even though the person is also an individual who has engaged in specifically protected conduct like whistleblowing th public interest is after all the execution of the public business it is not maintenance program for the incompetent nor is it in the public in terest to foster internal dissidence vituperation backbiting and disaffection79 representative schroeder referred to some 11000 fede ral employees who had contacted the office of sp ecial counsel for relief oconnor acknowledged that these individuals had complaint and thought they had case but added there are many people who feel that they have comp laints and some of them are carrying bags and walking up and down constitution avenue right now i

chose not to report it moreover the percentage of employees who did not report government wrongdoing because of fear of reprisal rose from an estimated 20 in 1980 to 37 in 198392 in reviewing the boards report the committee agreed that statutory protections alone cannot guarantee the elimin ation of reprisal among civil servants agency heads and supervisors must foster an environment where employees are encouraged to come forward with ggestions and report problems and are appropriately rewarde d rather than punished for doing so the statistics included in the boards report show that

vulnerable to reprisal even if an employee was successful in proving connection between whistleblowing activity and reprisal the agency had an opportunity to show that it would have taken the

doyle 429 us 274 1977 and later had been applied by the mspb and the courts in reprisal cases the committee found that the mt healthy test allowed an agency to search an employees work record for conduct that can be cited as the reason for taking an adverse action it has proved to be diffi cult for employees to refute the agencys contention that it would have ta ken the personnel action anyway94 to overcome this problem th committee proposed that the mt healthy test be modified only for whistleblow er reprisal cases once an employee had made prima facie case of reprisal by showing that whistleblowing was factor in personnel action the agency would be required to s how by clear and convincing evidence that the whistleblowing was not material fact or in the personnel action clear and convincing evidence is less than the cr iminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt but higher than preponderance of the evidence which was the current standard for this type of employee case95 the whistleblowing protection act of 1988 passed the senate and the house section 2b of the senate bill stated the primary role of the osc was to protect employees especially whistleblowers from

that heads of departments and agencies can manage their personnel effectiv ely it was his concern that the bill would have changed the law so that empl oyees who are not genuine whistleblowers could

essentially rigs the boards process against agency personnel managers in favor of employees the interests of both employees and managers should be fully protected104 the pocket veto memorandum also

stronger factor than statutory provisions to establish workplace environment of respect for the merit system120 mspb and federal circuit the house committee also found that the st atistical record i

lost credibility with the practicing bar for civil service cases121 in november 1993 gao released report indicating that 81 percent of federal employees who sought whistleblower reprisal protection

after analyzing th relevant statutes and thei r legislative history found basis for concluding that congress inte nded the mspb to review the merits of security clearance determinations145 oral argument before the court on december 2 1987 explored the statutory intent of congress at time did the justice department suggest that classified info rmation could be withheld from congress the courts ruling in favor of the navy did not limit in any way the right of congress to classified information the court decided the narro w question of whether the mspb had statutory authority to review the substan ce of decision to deny security clearance146 although the court referred to inde pendent constitutional powers of the president including those as commander in chief and as head of the executive branch147 and noted the presidents responsib ility with regard to foreign policy148 its decision was based on statutor construction in stating that courts traditionally have been reluctant to intrude upon the authority of the executive in military and national security affairs the court added this important qualification unless congress specifically has provided otherwise 149 the justice departments brief had also stated absent an unambiguous grant of jurisdiction by c ongress courts have traditionally been reluctant to intrude upon the authority of the executive branch in military and national security affairs150 nothing in the legislative history of the civil service reform act of 1978 convinced the court that mspb could review on the merits an agencys securityclearance determination151 the presidents national security power s surfaced at times during oral argument before the supreme court when the justice department and egans attorney william j

called national security152 in disposing of the issue on statutory grounds the court also cited the presidents role as commander in chief nd said that the presidents authority to protect classified information flows primarily from this constitutional investment of power in the president and exists quite apart from any explicit congressional grant153 the constitutional issue would have been joined had the court faced statutory language that the administration objected to as an interference with executive power that issue was not present in egan the district c ourts decision having relied on egan judge gasch also looked to language in the supreme courts curtisswright decision154 from the latter case judge gasch concluded that the sensitive and complicated role cast for the president as this nations emissary in foreign relations requires th at congressional intrusion upon the presidents oversight of national security information be more severely limited than might be required in matters of purely domestic concern155 the central issue in curtisswright was the scope of c ongressional power the court was asked how broadl congress could delegate its powers to the president in the field of foreign affairs the previous year the court had struck down the national industrial recovery act becau it had delegated an exce ssive amount of legislative power to the president in the field of domestic policy156 the question before the court in curtisswright was whether congress could us more general standards in foreign affairs than it could in domestic affairs and the court said it could several courts have remarked on justice sutherlands views in curtisswright regarding the scope of presidential power in foreign relations in the steel seizure case of 1952 justice robert jackson noted that much of the sutherland opinion is dictum comments extraneous to the issue before the court157 in 1981 federal appellate c ourt cautioned against placing undue reliance on certain dicta in

spoke repeatedly about the presidents cons titutional role to control classified information the attorney fo r afsa challenging the reagan nondisclosure policy objected that the decision by judge gasch by declaring that the executive branch has such sweeping power has impeded the kind of accommodation that should take place in this kind of controve rsy and hoped that the court wipes that decision off the books160 on april 18 1989 the court issued pe r curiam order that vacated judge gaschs order and re manded the case for further consideration161 in doing so the court cautioned judge gasch to avoi d expounding on constitutional matters having thus skirted the statutory question whether the executive branchs implementation of nondisc losure forms 189 and 4193 violated 630 the court proceeded to address appellees the govern ments argument that the lawsuit should be dismissed because 630 was an unconstitu tional interference with the presidents authority to protect the national security162 the court counseled judge gasch that the district court should not pronounce upon the relative constitutional authority of congress and the executive branch unless it finds it imperative to do so particularly where as here case impli cates the fundamental relati onship between the branches courts should be extremely careful not to issue unnecessary constitutional rulings163 on remand

question whether cia employees should repor t their concerns only to the inspector general was the ig to be the sole pr ocess by which an employee may report serious or flagrant problem to congress second should the head of an intelligence agency have holdback power that is should the agency head be authorized to block whistleblowers complaint in th exceptional case and in order to protect vital law enforcement foreign affairs on national security interest191 when the house bill was reported it was decided that the ig mechanism for whistleblowers should not be the sole pr ocess for them to report wrongdoing to congress the house bill would provide an additional procedure to the existing ig route192 the house intelligence committee recognized that some agency employees might choose not to report problem either through the process outlined in the bill or through another process authorized by their management but instead approach the committee directly193 the committee also decided to eliminate the holdback provision agency heads would not have the authority to block disclosures by agency employees to congress statutory ac knowledgment of holdback authority was dropped because it was considered unw arranted and coul d undermine important congressional prerogatives194 authority over classified information like the senate the house intelligence committee rejected the administrations assertion that as commander in chief the president has ultimate and unimpeded constitutional authority over na tional security or classifi ed information rather national security is constitutional re sponsibility shared by the executive and legislative branches that proceeds accord ing to the principles and practices of comity195 consistent with that position the committee rejected the theory that the president as chief executive has constitutional right to authorize all contact between executive branch employees and congress the issue of whether an agency employee must ask the boss before approaching the intelligence committees with unclassified information about wrongdoing seems well below any constitutional threshold196 the handling of classified information was

intelligence community employee may make report to congress the conference report stated that the managers agree that an intelligence community employee should not be subject to reprisals or threats of reprisals for making report to appropria members or staff of the intelligence committees about wrongdoing within the intelligence community197 the statute covered communications from the agency to cap itol hill through the intelligence committees the statutory language lists six findings 1 national security is shared responsibility requiring joint efforts nd mutual respect by congress and the president 2 the principles of comity betw een the branches of government apply to the handling of national security informati on 3 congress as coequal branch of government is empowered by the constitution to serve as check on the executive branch in that capacity it has need to know of allegations of wrongdoing within the executive branch including allegations of wrongdoing in the intelligence community 4 basis in law exists for re quiring prior authorization of disclosures to the intelligence committees of congress by employees of the executive branch of classified information about wrongdoing within the intelligence community 5 the risk of reprisal perceived by employees and contractors of the intelligence community for reporting serious or fl agrant problems to congress may have impaired the flow of information needed by the intelligence committees to carry out oversight responsibilities and 6 to courage such reportin g an additional procedure should be established

are considered protected disclosures231 the bill is designed to clarify that disclosures of classified information to appropriate committees of congress are protected to codify the antigag provision that congress has placed in annual appropriations bills to protect agency employees who come forward with disclosures of illegality to authorize the c to file amicus briefs in whistleblower cases and to allow whistleblower cases to be heard by all federal appellate courts for period of five years232 the committee report also discusses provision in the bill that relates to whistleblower actions after 911 when ag ency employees in several high profile cases have come forward to disclose g overnment waste fraud and abuse that posed risk to national security but then faced retaliatory action by having their security clearance removed the federal circuit had held that the mspb lacks jurisdiction over an employees claim that his secur ity clearance was revoked in retaliation for whistleblowing
