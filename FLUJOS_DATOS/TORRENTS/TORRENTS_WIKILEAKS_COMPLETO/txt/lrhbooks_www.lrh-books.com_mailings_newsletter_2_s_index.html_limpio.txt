bridge yes i handle the everyday life of going to work earning money to have nice car and paying bills i was budgeting my time to get enough sleep to get enough play to be on course and to learn more to enhance my life i was always trying to find extra money to pay for that precious auditing which i needed to make things better for then i started listening to lrh lectures the months went by and
