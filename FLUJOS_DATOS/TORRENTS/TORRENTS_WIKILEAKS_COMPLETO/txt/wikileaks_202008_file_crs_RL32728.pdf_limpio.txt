forming transmission organizations comprehensive electricity legislation may involve several components the ﬁrst is puhca reform some electric utilities want puhca changed so they can more easily diversify their assets state regulators have expressed concerns that increased diversiﬁcation could lead to abuses including crosssubsidization consumer groups have expressed concern that repeal of puhca could exacerbate market power abuses in monopolistic industry where true competition does not yet exist the second issue is purpas requirement that utilities purchase power from qfs many investorowned utilities support repeal of these mandatory purchase provisions they argue that their state regulators misguided implementation of purpa has forced them to pay contractually high prices for power that they do not need opponents of this legislation argue that it would decrease competition and impede development of renewable energy the third main issue is reliability without mandatory

for the 109th congress summary the public utility holding company act of 1935 puhca and the federal power act fpa were enacted to eliminate unfair practices and other abuses by electricity and gas holding companies by requiring federal cont rol and regulation of interstate public utility holding companies prior to puhca electricity holding companies were characterized as having excessive consumer rates high debtto equity ratios and unr eliable service puhca remain ed virtually unchanged for 50 years until enactment of the public utility regulatory policie s act of 1978 purpa was in part intended to augment electric utility generation with more efficiently produced electricity and to pr ovide equitable rates to elect ric consumers qualifying facilities qfs ar exempt from regulation under puhca and the fpa electricity regulation was changed agai n in 1992 with passage of the energy policy act epact the intent of title 7 of epact is to increase competition in the electric generating sector by creating new entities called exempt wholesale generators ewgs that can generate and sell electricity at w holesale without being regulated as utilities under puhca this title also provides ewgs with way to assure transmission of their wholesale power to their purchasers the effect of this act on the electric supply system has been more farreaching than purpa on april 24 1996 the federal energy regulatory commission ferc issued orders 888 and 889 ferc issued these rules to remedy undue discrimination in transmission services in interstate co mmerce and provide an

issues for the 109th congress background historically electricity service has been defined as natural monopoly meaning that the industry has 1 an inherent tende ncy toward declining longterm costs 2 high threshold investment and 3 tec hnological conditions that limit the number of potential entrants in addition many regula tors have considered unified control of generation transmission and distribution as the most efficient means of providing service as result most people about 75 are currently served by vertically integrated investorowned utility as the electric utility industry has evol ved however there has been growing belief that the historic cl assification of electric utilitie s as natural monopolies has been overtaken by events and that market forces can and should replace some of the traditional economic regulatory structure for example the existence of utilities that do not own all of their generating fac ilities primarily coope ratives and publicly owned utilities has provided evidence that ve rtical integration has not been necessary for providing efficient elect ric service moreover r ecent changes in electric utility regulation and improved tec hnologies have allowed dditional generating capacity to be provided by independent firms rather than utilities the public utility holding company act puhca1 and the federal power act fpa of 1935 title i and title ii of the public utility act2 established regime of regulating electric utilities that gave specific and separate powers to the states and the federal government regulatory bargai n was made between the government and utilities in exchange for an exclusive franchise service territory utilities must provide electricity to all users at reasonable regulated rates state regulatory commissions address intrastate utility activities including wholesale and retail ratemaking state authority currently tends to be as broad and as varied as the states are diverse at the least state public utility commission will have authority over retail rates and often over investment and debt at th other end of the spectrum the state regulatory body will oversee many facets of utility operation despite this diversity the essential mission of the state regulator in states that have not restructured is the establishment of retail electric prices this is accomplished through an adversarial hearing process the central issues in such cases are the total amount of money the utility will be permitte d to collect and howhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32728crs2 3 pl 95617 16 usc 2601 4 pl 95620the burden of the

of the abusive practices of the 1920s eg crosssubsidiza tion selfdealing pyramiding etc the securities and exchange commission sec regulates utilities corporate structure and business ventures under puhca the electric utility industry has been in the process of transformation during the past 25 years there has been major change in direction concerning generation first improved technologies ve reduced the cost of generating electricity as well as the size of generating facilities prior preference for largescale often nuclear or coalfired powerplants has been s upplanted by preference for smallscale production facilities that can be brought online more quickly and cheaply with fewer regulatory impediments second this has lowered the entry barrier to electricity generation and permitte d nonutility entities to build pr ofitable facilities recent changes in electric utility regulation nd improved technolog ies have allowed additional generating capacity to be provi ded by independent firms rather than utilities the oil embargoes of the 1970s created concerns about the security of the nations electricity supply and led to enac tment of the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978 purpa3 for the first time utilities were required to purchase power from outside sources the purchase price was set at the utilities avoided cost the cost they would have incurred to generate the additional power themselves as determined by utility regulators purpa was established in part to augment electric utility generation with more effici ently produced electricity and to provide equitable rates to electric consumers in addition to purpa the fuel use act of 1978 fua4 helped qualifying facilities qfs become established under fua utilities were not permitted to use natural gas to fuel new generating facilities qfs which by definition are not utilities were able to take advantage of newly abundant natural gas as well as new generating technology such as combinedcyc plants that use hot exhaust gases from combustion turbines to make steam to generate additional power these technologies lowered the financial threshold for entrance into the electricity generation

the total electricity supply this influx of qf power challenged the costbased rates that previously guided wholesale transactions before imp lementation of pu rpa ferc approved wholesale interstate electricity transactions based on the sellers costs to generate and transmit the power but as nonutility ge nerators typically do not have enough market power to influence the rates th ey charge ferc began approving certain wholesale transactions whose rates were result of competitive bidding process these rates are called marketbased rates this first incremental change of traditional electricity regulation started movement toward marketori ented approach to electricity supply following the enactment of purpa two basic issues stimulated calls for further reform whether to encourage nonutility generation and whether to permit utilities to diversify into nonregulated activities the energy policy act of 1992 epact5 removed several re gulatory barriers to entry into electricity generation to increase competition of electricity supply specifically epact provides for the creation of entities called exempt wholesale generators ewgs that can generate and sell electricity at w holesale without being regulated as utilities under puhca unde r epact ewgs are also provided with way to assure transmission of their wholesale power to wholesale purchaser however epact does not permit ferc to mandate that utilities transmit ewg power to retail consumers commonly called retail wheeling or retail competition an activity that remains under the jurisdiction of state public utility commissions purpa began to shift more regulatory responsib ilities to the federal government and epact continued that shif t away from the states by creating new options for utilities and regulators to meet electricity demand epact allowed for robust wholesale market in electricity the transmission system is now used extensively for bulkpower transfers be tween utilities even though the physical system was designed to handle primarily intrautility transfers utilities now depend on combination of selfgeneration mercha nt generators and other utilities to meet their retail electricity demand shortly after enactment of epact stat began considering whether to allow retail choice it was argued that retail prices would decline with additional competition most state plans have not t initial expectations few alternative suppliers have remained in the market consumers are reluctant to switch suppliers and default service rates set by the states are generally equal to or less than wholesale market prices plus retail margin needed to cover retail service costs6 currently 24 states and the district of columbia have either enacted legislation or issued regulatory orders to implement retail

electric utility provisions are included in comprehensive energy legislation hr 6 that was signed into law by president bush on august 8 2005 in part this law repeals the public utility holding company act puhca the electric utility industry has long been pr oponent of such repeal while consumer groups have been opposed as compromise provision was included that strengthens fercs merger

an electric reliability organizationero is created and the ero will promulgate mandatory enforceable reliability standards for the ectric industry that includes cybersecurity protection also included in the law is sense of congress that ferc should carefully consider the states objections to the locational installed capacity licap mechanism for new england transmission in addition to creating new type of wholesale electricity generator exempt wholesale generators ewgs the energy policy act epact provides ewgs with system to assure transmission of their wholesale power to its purchaser however epact did not solve all of the issues relating to transmission access as result of epact on april 24 1996 ferc issued orders 888 and 8897 in issuing its final rules ferc concluded that these orde rs will remedy undue discrimination in transmission services in interstate co mmerce and provide an orderly and fair transition to competitive bulk power markets under order 888 the open access rule transmission line owners are required to offer both pointtopoint and networ k transmission services under comparable terms and conditions that they provide fo r themselves the rule provides single tariff providing minimum conditions for bot h network and pointtopoint services and the nonprice terms and conditions for providing these services and ancillary services this rule also allows for full recovery of socalled stranded costs with those costs being paid by wholesale custom ers wishing to leave their current supply arrangements the rule encourages but does not require cr eation of independent system operators isos to coordinate interc ompany transmission of electricity order 889 the open access sametime information system oasis rule establishes standards of conduc t to ensure level playing field the rule requires utilities to separate their wholesale power marketing and transmission operation functions but does not require corporate unbundling or dives titure of asse ts

eighth circuit ruled in case between ferc and northern states power company the court held that the commission overstepped its authority when it ordered northern states power company to treat wholesale customers the same as it treats native load customers in making electricity curtailment decisions this decision raised federalstate jurisdictional questions particularly states right to guarantee system reliability on october 3 2001 the us supreme c ourt heard arguments in case new york et v federal energy regulatory commission that challenged fercs authority under order 888 to regulate tr ansmission for retail sales if utility unbundles transmission from other retail charges in states that have opened their generation market to competition unbundling occurs when customers are charged separately for generation tr ansmission and distribution nine states led by new york filed suit and argued that the federal power act gives ferc jurisdiction over wholesale sales and interstate transmission and leaves all retail issues up to the state utility commissions enron argued that ferc clearly has jurisdiction over all transmission and ferc is obligated to prevent transmission owners from discriminating against those wishing to use the transmission lines on march 4 2002 the us supreme court ruled in fa vor of ferc and held that ferc has jurisdiction over transmission incl uding unbundled retail transactions16 at issue for congress is whether to allow certain utilities to give preferential treatment to native load customers customers within their service territories reliability electric reliability organization the blackout of august 2003 in the north east midwest and adjoining parts of canada has highlighted the need for infra structure and

as result of the recommendations of the joint uscanada task force investigating the august 2003 blackout nerc is conducting reliability readiness audits of reliability coordinators all audits are ex pected to be completed by 2006 ferc held technical conference on septem ber 29 2004 to discuss the status of the reliability readiness reviews more than twothirds of the audited control areas and reliability coordinators need to make staff training improvements nd add support to their control centers in case of an emergency17 at the conference nerc ferc and industry officials agreed that absent mandatory reliab ility standards there is little assurance that operators of the system will comply with more rigorous guidelines both nerc and ferc agree that implementation of an electric reliability organization ero will improve the reliability of the electric system the energy policy act of 2005 as signed by the president on august 8 2005 includes the creation of an ero the law requires ferc to promulgate rules to create ferc certified electric reliability organization the ero will develop and enforce reliability standards for the bulkpower system all ero standards will be approved by ferc under the law the ero can impose penalties on user owner or operator of the bulkpower system that violates any fercapproved liability standard in addition ferc can order comp liance with the reliability standard and can impose penalty if ferc finds that us er owner or operator of the bulkpower system has engaged in violation of the reliability standard however this law would not give an ero or ferc authoriza tion to order constr uction of additional generation or transmission capacity generally the ero is nonc ontroversial advocates of giving ferc authority over the ero contend that central juri sdiction would provide more accountability ferc would be ultimately responsible fo r reliability issues if the penalties employed by the ero are not successful then ferc will have the authority to enforce penalties for entities that did not comply with reliability standards establishing this new relationship be tween ferc and the ero could have the potential to improve coordination between market functions and reliability functions those opposed to giving ferc jurisdic tion over bulk power system reliability contend that ferc has experience in this area they argue that by giving ferc this authority it will have to rely on nerc for much of its expertise placing ferc in this position may add to the uncertainty associated with the changes in institutional structure as ferc takes on this new role infrastructure improvements conflict exists between the apparent goal of increasing competition in the generation sector and assuri ng adequate transmission capacity and management of the system to move the power additions to generating capacity are occurring at more rapid pace than transmission additions the traditional vertically

is measure of the resistive and reactive attributes of component in an alternatingcurrent circuitutility longer dominates the industry structure18 in addition demand for electric power continues to increase unresolved regulatory issues that have emerged after 1992 have resulted in consider able uncertainty in the financial community as result of all of these factors investment in the transmission system has not kept pace with demand for transmission capacity siting one reason transmission lines have not been built in recent years is the difficulty in siting lines even though the transmission of electricity is considered interstate commerce the sitin g of transmission lines is the responsibility of the states in addition several fede ral agencies play various roles in the siting process primarily with regard to environmental impacts siting and building transmission lines have been very difficult because of c itizen opposition as well as inconsistent siting requirements among states while contr oversial since the blackout of 2003 ferc commissioners are now supporting fe deral siting backstop authority19 in addition the electric industry is in favor of giving ferc siting authority20 states are generally opposed to this proposal the energy po licy act of 2005 include s federal backstop authority for siting transmission lines pricing some transmissionowning utilities argue that the current pricing mechanism for transmission discourages investment ferc regulates all transmission including unbundled retail trans actions under the federal power act fpa ferc is required to set jus t and reasonable rates for wholesale transactions21 ferc has traditionally determined rates by using an embedded cost method that includes recovery of capital costs operatin g expenses improvements accumulated depreciation and rate of return trad itionally transmission owners have been compensated for use of their lines based on contract path for the movement of electricity generally the shortest path between the generator and its customer however electricity rarely follows contract path and instead follows the path based on least impedance22 transmission lines often carry electricity that has been contracted to move on different path as more bulk power transfers are occurring on the transmission system tran smission owners not belonging to rtos are not always being compensated for use of their lines because contract path rarelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32728crs10 23 see national economic research associates transmission prici ng arrangements and their

for transmission single rate based on customer location as ferc is encouragin g formation of large regional transmission organizations ferc may move toward uniform access charge sometimes called postage stamp rates with postage st amp rate users pay one charge for moving electricity anywhere within the regional transmission organization postage stamp rates eliminate socalled rate pancaking or series of accumulated transmission charges as the electricity passes through adjacent transmission systems and increases the pool of available generation on the other hand by moving to postage stamp rates customers in lowcost transmission areas may see rate increase and highcost tr ansmission providers in the same area may not recover embedded costs because cost s are determined on regional basis regulatory uncertainty transmission owners and investors have expressed concern that the regulatory uncertainty for electric utilities is inhibiting new investment in and construction of transmission facilities for example repeal of puhca has been debated since 1996 without resolution without clarification on whether puhca will be repeal ed utilities state that they are reluctant to invest in infrastructure repeal could significantly expand the ability of utilities to diversify their investment options in addition ferc has been moving towa rd requiring partic ipation in regional transmission organizations to create more seamless transmission system fully operational regional transmi ssion organization would opera the entire transmission system in region and be able to repl ace multiple control centers with single control center26 this type of control can increase efficiencies in the operation of the transmission system rto participants are required to adhere to certain

atslegviews109lvhr1640elecshtmluncertainty over the form of an rto its operational characteristics and the transmission rates for specific region have apparently made utilities wary of investing in transmission ferc has gran ted rto status to several entities and conditionally approved ot hers if rtos are able to operate successfu lly and develop track record some regulatory uncertainty will diminish market transparency some have argued that the wholesal power markets cannot be competitive without additional market transparency for both generation and transmission some proposals would require ferc to issue rules to establish an electronic information system to provide the public ferc state commissions buyers and sellers of wholesale electric energy and users of transmission services with information on the availability and price of wholesale electric energy and transmission services regulatory reform puhca the energy policy act of 2005 repeal s puhca and gives ferc additional merger review authority one argument for additional puhca reform has been made by electric utilities that want to further diversify their assets under puhca holding company could acquire securities or utility assets only if the securities and exchange commission sec found that such purchase would improve the economic efficiency and service of an integrated public utility system it has been argued that reform to allow diversificati on would improve the risk profile of electric utilities in much the same way as in other businesses the risk of any one investment is diluted by the risk associated with all investments utilities have also argued that diversification would lead to better us of underutilized resources due to the seasonal nature of electric demand utility holding companies that have been exempt from sec regulation argue that puhca discouraged diversification because the sec could repeal exempt status if ex emption would be detrimental to the public interest for number of years there has been significant bipartisan congressional support for repealing much of puhca and giving ferc and state commissions access to books and records since the 1980s the secur ities and exchange commission has testified befo re congress that many pr ovisions of puhca are longer relevant and other provisions ar redundant with state and other federal regulations27 however as result of enrons co llapse some in c ongress have taken somewhat different view toward sign ificantly amending or repealing puhca28 even though enron had claimed exem ption from puhca on february 6 2003 securities and exchange commission chief administrative law judge brenda p murray denied enrons puhca exempti on applications of february 28 2002httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32728crs12 29 initial

subsidizing an unregulated affiliate crosssubsidization was major argument against the creation of ewgs and reemerged as an argument against puhca repeal in the case of electric and gas companies nonutility vent ures that are undertaken as result of diversification may benefit from the regulated utilities allowed rate of return moneymaking nonutility enterprises would c ontribute to the overa ll financial health of holding company however unsu ccessful ventures could harm the entire holding company including utility subsidiaries in this situation utilities would not be penalized for failure in terms of reduced access to new capital because they could increase retail rates several consumer and envi ronmental public interest groups as well as state legislators expressed cerns about puhca repeal puhca repeal such groups argue could only exacerbate market power abuses in what they see as monopolistic industry where true competition does not yet exist purpa prospective repeal of 210 of purp the mandatory purchase requirement provisions is included in the energy policy act of 2005 proponents of purpa repeal primarily investorowned utilities ious located in the northeast and in california argued that their state regulators misguided implementation of purpa in the early 1980s has forced them to pay contractually high prices for power they do not need they argued that give n the current environm ent for costconscious competition purpa is outdated the pu rpa reform group which promotes iou interests strongly supported repeal by contending that the purpas mandatory purchase obligation was anticompetitive and anticonsumer opponents of purpa reform industrial power customers some segments of the natural gas industry the renewable ergy industry and environmental groups have many reasons to support purpa as it was enacted mainly their argument was that purpa introduced competition in the ectric generating sector and at the same time helped promote wider use of cleaner alternative fuels to generate electricity since the electric generating sector is not yet fully competitive they argued repeal of purpa would decrease competition and impede the development of the renewable energy industry add itionally opponents of purpa repeal argued that it would result in less competition and gr eater utility monopoly control over the electric industry state regulators ex pressed concern that mandatory purchase requirement repeal would prevent them fro m deciding matters currently under their jurisdiction the national association of regulatory utility commissioners hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32728crs13 opposed legislation that would allow ferc to protect utilities from costs associated with purpa contracts
