koenig reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary the sudden resignation of economics minister michael glos csu on february 7 caught chancellor angela merkel cdu and her party off guard at time when addressing germanys economic downturn is paramount to minimize damage the csu quickly replaced glos with its secretary general karltheodor zu guttenberg decision which continues to draw criticism from other parties as well as from within the cdu due to thirtysevenyearolds minimal background in economic policy the shuffle reveals strains between the cdu and csu and presents an opportunity for merkels political foes to portray her as lacking control as the country tries to deal with its worst economic crisis since world war ii end summary initial confusion over resignation 2 c citing his age and intention to leave the cabinet after the september 2009 elections the sixtyfouryearold glos submitted his resignation as minister for economics and technology on february 7 chairman of the christian social union csu the bavarian sister party of chancellor merkels christian democratic union cdu and bavarian minister president horst seehofer named karltheodor zu guttenberg 37 as his successor zu guttenberg had been csu secretary general for only three months following major party reshuffle glos explained his departure would allow the csu to campaign with new minister in place and help restore trust in the csu following its poor showing in the bavarian regional elections in september 2008 the timing of his departure during the financial and economic crises however was awkward in addition glos submitted his resignation to seehofer instead of merkel which the media has portrayed as snub to the chancellor note bavarian political reactions to be reported in congen munich septel enter the young turk 3 sbu under pressure to resolve an apparent power vacuum at key ministry seehofer who as csu party chairman had the right to fill the slot had to find replacement for glos quickly at february 9 press conference announcing the choice of zu guttenberg seehofer said that he chose the rising csu star partly in order to have minister representing the northern region of bavaria he lauded zu guttenbergs international contacts and his presumed ability to promote german exports seehofer denied reports that before accepting the new post zu guttenberg had demanded the highlevel position of csu bundestag spokesman and cducsu caucus chief in case the cducsu lost the september elections for his part zu guttenberg welcomed the opportunity to take on the economics portfolio he described germanys social market economy as the guiding principle of his economic thinking and underscored the importance of free trade zu guttenberg also said he would work to lower taxes for small and mediumsized companies gloss rough ride 4 c glos had always been an awkward fit for the economics ministry job which he took on in november 2005 glos did bring intimate knowledge of federal politics to the job but was not an economist and had never shown strong interest in the economics ministrys portfolio chancellor merkel instinctively turned to her finance minister peer steinbrueck spd to coordinate the response to the financial crisis sidelining glos gloss inability to overcome cdu and spd objectives and get additional tax cuts into the stimulus plan may have cost the csu the recent bavarian elections to the dismay of seehofer and others in the csu 5 c devastating profile of glos few months ago in der spiegel whose main points ministry contacts did not contadict portrayed him as weak out of touch with the bureaucracy bored with his job and looking forward to nice sinecure for himself after retirement in farewell berlin 00000168 0022 of 002 meeting with former ambassador timken in late november 2008 glos appeared under great strain and confessed to tremendous frustration over his inability to influence merkel on tax cuts as part of the stimulus package love lost 6 c spd party stalwarts are giddy over perceived turmoil in the csu and the perception that merkel is not in control of developments chancellorcandidate frankwalter steinmeier spd said the cducsu lacked orientation in their management of the economic crisis and called for party order and discipline cdu staffer expressed irritation over seehofers handling of the shuffle but she shed tears over gloss departure on zu guttenberg fdp economics expert rainer bruederle commented to us that as far as economics is concerned it seems to be enough these days for the csu to find someone who can read and write 7 c the business community has mixed views an ibm lobbyist told econoff that she regarded glos as the only counterweight to steinbrueck on economic policymaking in the germany government contact from the german industry association bdi conceded that glos was not the strongest minister in the cabinet adding that bdi had often wished for someone in the position who was more outspoken on zu guttenberg he conceded the new minister was wellversed in foreign policy and transatlantic issues though young and inexperienced comment 8 c gloss resignation caught the cducsu party hierarchy offguard at time when everyone in berlin and munich was concentrating on the munich security conference this highprofile resignation opens the door to criticism of merkels handling of the economic and financial crises as well as seehofers leadership style zu guttenbergs first challenge will be to help resolve the debate between the cducsu and spd over the stimulus package his appointment has been heavily criticized within the cdu with some calling him mere place holder until the september elections raising questions about merkels ability to steer her party effectively through long super8 election year if not addressed the spd and the opposition fdp could emerge strengthened by the affair which has come at very inopportune time for chancellor merkels cdu and its sister party the csu
