american law division april 9 2007 abstract federal statutes of limitation are as old as federal crimes when the founders assembled in the first congress they passed not only the ﬁrst federal criminal laws but made prosecution under those laws subject to speciﬁc statutes of limitation similar provisions continue to this day federal capital oﬀenses may be prosecuted at any time but unless some more speciﬁc arrangement has been made general ﬁve year statute of limitations covers all other federal crimes some of the exceptions to the general rule like those of the usa patriot act identify longer periods for particular crimes others suspend or extend the applicable period under certain circumstances such as the ﬂight of the accused or during time of warhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31253g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

within which legal proceeding must begin the purpose of statute of limitations in criminal case is to ensure the prompt prosecution of criminal charges and thereby spare the accused of the burden of having to defend against stale charges after memories may have faded or evidence is lost there is statute of limitations for federal crimes punishable by death nor for certain federal crimes of terrorism nor since passage of the adam walsh child protection and safety act pl 109248 hr 4472 2006 for certain federal sex offenses prosecution for most other federal crimes must begin within five years of the commitment of the offense there are exceptions some types of crimes are subject to longer period of limitation some circumstances suspend or extend the otherwise applicable period of limitation arson art theft certain crimes against financial institutions and various immigration offenses all carry statutes of limitation longer than the five year standard regardless of the applicable statute of limitations the period may be extended or the running of the period suspended or tolled under number of circumstances such as when the accused is fugitive or when the case involves charges of child abuse bankruptcy wartime fraud against the government or dna evidence ordinarily the statute of limitations begins to run as soon as the crime has been completed although the federal crime of conspiracy is complete when one of the plotters commits an affirmative act in its name the period for conspiracies begins with the last affirmative act committed in furtherance of the scheme other socalled continuing offenses include various possession crimes and some that impose continuing obligations to register or report limitationrelated constitutional challenges arise most often under the constitutions ex post facto and due process clauses the federal courts have long held that statute of limitations may be enlarged retroactively as long as the previously applicable period of limitation has not expired the supreme court recently confirmed that view the ex post facto proscription precludes legislative revival of an expired period of limitation due process condemns preindictment delays even when permitted by the statute of limitations if the prosecution wrongfully caused the delay and the accuseds defense suffered actual substantial harm as consequence this

alterations in the statutes of limitation that govern number of federal crimes this is an overview of federal law relating to the statutes of limitation in criminal cases including those changes produced by the act the phrase statute of limitations refers to the time period within which formal criminal charges must be brought after crime has been committed 1 the purpose of statute of limitations is to limit exposure to criminal prosecution to certain fixed period of time following the occurrence of those acts the legislature has decided to punish by criminal sanctions such limitation is designed to protect individuals from having to defend themselves against charges when the basic facts may have become obscured by the passage of time and to minimize the danger of official punishment because of acts in the fardistant past such time limit may also have the salutary effect of encouraging law enforcement officials promptly to investigate suspected criminal activity 2 therefore in most instances prosecutions are barred if the defendant points out that there was indictment or other formal charge within the time period dictated by the statute of limitations3 statutes of limitation are creatures of statute the common law recognized period of limitation an indictment could be brought at any time limitations are recognized today only to the extent that statute or due process dictate their recognition4 congress and most state legislatures have enacted statutes of limitation but declare that prosecution for some crimes may be brought at any time 5 federal statutes of limitation are as old as federal crimes when the founders assembled in the first congress they passed not only the first federal criminal laws but made prosecution under those laws subject to specific statutes of limitation6 similar provisions continue to this day 1 black s law dictionary 927 6th ed 1990 2 toussie v united states 397 us 112 11415 1970 3 the statute of

1796 the death penalty authorized by federal capital offense statutes could not be constitutionally imposed the question arose whether the term offenses punishable by death in the statute of limitations referred to offenses made capital by statute or only to offenses for which the death penalty might constitutionally be imposed the courts concluded that congress intended the term to refer to offenses which it made capital by statute united states v emery 186 f3d 921 924 8 th cir 1999 united states v edwards 159 f3d 1117 1128 8th cir 1998 united states v manning 56 f3d 1188 1196 9th cir

age of 18 to be filed within the longer of 10 years or the life of the victim30 the recent enactment of 18 usc 3299 discussed earlier which eliminates the statute of limitations in cases of child abduction and sex offenses against children obviously limits the sweep of section 3283 prior to the enactment of section 3299 and the passage of the 2006 violence against women act 31 the application of the dna sections turned on the presence or absence of crime under chapter 109a of title 1832 in the case of crime under chapter 109a section 3282b stated that the statute of limitations could be tolled by the filing of an indictment identifying the accused by his dna profile if the accused were otherwise unknown 33 in the case of felonies other than those of chapter 109a the governing section section 3297 seemed open to either of two interpretations in case in which dna testing implicates an identified person in the commission of felony except for felony offense under chapter 109a statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution of the offense shall preclude such prosecution until period of time following the implication of the person by dna testing has elapsed that is equal to the otherwise applicable limitation period 18 usc 3297 language struck by the violence against women act amendment noted it might mean that the otherwise applicable statute of limitations is tolled until dna testing can be completed on the other hand it may mean that the applicable statute of limitations is tolled in the presence of suspectimplicating dna evidence until the individual implicated is sufficiently identified for indictment other than merely by his dna profile section 3297s enactment in conjunction with legislation designed to eliminate dna testing backlogs seems to

the grand jury or the subject of the foreign evidence sought may contest the governments application when it is filed or whether the application may be filed ex parte with an opportunity for the accused to contest suspension following indictment45 in either event the government clearly bears the burd of establishing to the court its right to suspension by preponderance of the evidence46 yet

must relate to specific grand jury investigation or may be filed in anticipation of such an investigation47 on the related issue of when an application may be filed one court has ruled that the government may seek the suspension either to allow it to obtain foreign evidence or to compensate it for time expended to acquire the evidence prior to the application48 yet another has held that the extension cannot be had when the evidence sought by the government is in its possession at the time of the application 49 finally the question of when final action occurs and the statute of limitations again begins to run has proven perplexing some courts suggest that final action occurs with dispositive response ie when the united states is satisfied its request has been answered50 yet at least one other believes that final action occurs when the foreign government believes it has provided final response51 provision exempting fugitives accompanied passage of the first federal statute of limitations52 the language has changed little since statute of limitations shall extend to any person fleeing from justice 18 usc 3290 but its meaning remains topic of debate53 most circuits taking their lead from streep v united states 160 us 128 1895 have held that the government must establish that the accused acted with an intent to avoid prosecution54 yet two have held that mere absence from the jurisdiction is sufficient55 even in the more demanding circuits however flight is thought to include the accuseds concealing himself within the jurisdiction56 or remaining outside the jurisdiction when he becomes aware of the possibility of prosecution57 or fleeing 47 compare united states v oneill 952 fsupp 831 833 ddc 1996the government can only request that statutes

several overt acts to the ultimate commission of the underlying substantive offenses which are the objectives of their plots thus the statute of limitations for such conspiracies runs not from the first overt act committed in furtherance of the conspiracy but from the last65 the statute of limitations under conspiracy statutes which have overt act requirement runs from the accomplishment of the objectives of the conspiracy or from its abandonment66 concealment of the criminal plot after its comp letion is considered natural component of all conspiracies consequently overt acts of concealment

limitation perhaps most often claim support from the ex post facto or due process clauses the constitution prohibits both congress and the states from enacting ex post facto laws80 more precisely it prohibits 1st every law that makes an action done before the passing of the law and which was innocent when done criminal and punishes such action 2d every law that aggravates crime or makes it greater than it was when committed 3d every law that changes the punishment and inflicts greater punishment than the law annexed to the crime when committed 4 th every law that alters the legal rules of evidence and receives less or different testimony than the law required at the time of the commission of the offense in order to convict the offender 81 the lower federal appellate courts had long felt that statute that extends period of limitation before its expiration does not offend the ex post facto clauses but that the clauses ban laws that attempt to revive and extend an expired statute of limitations82 until the united states supreme court confirmed that view in stogner v california 539 us 607 2003 however there were well regarded contrary opinions the california supreme court for example at one point concluded that the ex post facto clauses in fact pose impediment to the revival of an expired statute of limitations 83 the justice department cited the california case frazer in its summary of proposed antiterrorism legislation84 suggesting that its retroactive section was intended both to extend the statutes of limitation to cases where the period of limitation had not run and to revive the prospect of prosecution where the period had expired the usa pa triot acts retroactivity clause used the same language found in the justice departments original proposal 85 arguably

contemporary united states supreme court interpretations of the ex post facto clause frazer involved statutory amendment which allowed prosecution of certain child sex offense cases within one year after the offense had been reported to authorities even if the otherwise applicable statute of limitations had run the frazer court pointed out that the supreme court had apparently pruned its calder statement so as to define ex post facto laws as any statute which punishes as crime an act previously committed which was innocent when done which makes more burdensome the punishment for crime after its commission or which deprives one charged with crime of any defenses available according to law at the time when the act was committed 21 cal4 th at 755 982 at 191 88 calrptr2d at 324 quoting beazell v ohio 269 us 167 169 1925 moreover as the california court understood it the supreme court had not only indicated that evidentiary changes were beyond the realm of the clauses protection but that the defenses protected by the clauses were limited to those based on the elements or punishment of the crime when it was committed 21 cal4 th at 75557 982 at19192 88 calrptr2d at 32426 citing collins v youngblood 497 us 37 43 n3 50 1990 the supreme court subsequently warned that collins should not be read as repudiation of calder s four prohibited classes but instead that collins held that it was mistake to stray beyond calders four categories carmell v texas 529 us 513 539 2000emphasis in the original the court seemed to further signal its reluctance to reach beyond the limits of calder when it declined to extend the ex post facto proscription to cover retroactive application of judicial rather than legislative change in the law rogers v tennessee 532 us 451 462 200186 these developments did not necessarily undermine the california decision in frazer however since its revival of statute of limitations that had run did not appear to fit easily within any of the calder categories but the frazer analysis was in error nonetheless the us supreme court characterized the california legislative revival of an expired period of limitation not only manifestly unjust and oppressive but among those laws that run afoul of calder s second standard every law that aggravates crime or makes it greater than it was when committed stogner v california 539 us 607 61112 2003 as properly understood and alternatively characterized in calder this second category embraces statutes that like the california statute inflicted punishments where the party was not by law liable to any punishment at the time 539 us at 612 quoting calder 3 dall 3 us at 389 retroactivity aside the due process clauses may be implicated if crime is not subject to any statute of limitations or if the period of limita tion has not run although statutes of limitation generally govern the extent of permissible prei ndictment delay extraordinary circumstances may trigger due process implications the

amendment would require dismissal of an indictment if it were shown at trial that the preindictment delay caused substantial prejudice to defendants rights to fair trial and that the delay was an intentional device to gain tactical advantage over the accused87 the court declined to dismiss the indictment there however because the defendants failed to show they had suffered any actual prejudice from the delay or to show that the government intentionally delayed to gain some tactical advantage over them or to harass them 88 the court later made clear that due process contemplates more than claimants showing of adverse impact caused by preindictment delay thus marion makes clear that proof of prejudice is generally necessary but not sufficient element of due process claim and that the due process inquiry must consider the reasons for the delay as well as the prejudice to the accused89 perhaps because so few defendants have been able to show sufficient prejudice to necessitate further close inquiry90 the lower federal appellate courts seem at odds over exactly what else due process demands before it will require dismissal most have held that the defendant bears the burden of establishing both prejudice and government deficiency91 others that once the defendant establishes prejudice the burden shifts to the government to negate the second prong92 and still others that once the defendant shows prejudice the court must balance the harm against the justifications for delay93 87 united states v marion 404 us 307 324 1971 see also united states v gouveia 467 us 180 192 1984but applicable statutes of limitations protect against the prosecutions bringing stale criminal charges against any defendant and beyond that protection the fifth amendmen t requires the dismissal of an indictment even if it is brought within the statute of limitations if the defendant can prove that the governments delay in bringing the indictment was deliberate device to gain an advantage over him and that it caused him actual prejudice in presenting his defense 88 united states v marion 404 us at 325 89 united states v lovasco 431 us 783 790 1977 see also arizona v youngblood 488 us
