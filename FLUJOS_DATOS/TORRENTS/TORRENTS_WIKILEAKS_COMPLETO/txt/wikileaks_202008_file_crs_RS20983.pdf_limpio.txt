nicaragua april 2001 foreign aid constituted as much as 45 of nicaraguas gdp in 2000 in 2001 extreme drops in export coffee prices and drought have reportedly brought increased unemployment and starvation to parts of nicaragua according to the world bank nicaraguas economy had been performing well with sustained improvements in stabilization and economic growth prior to hurricane mitch the hurricane which struck in 1998 cut nicaraguas gross domestic product in half and killed more than 3000 people key roads and productive agricultural lands were also damaged by the hurricane the international community responded with largescale assistance for reconstruction efforts us reconstruction assistance focused on agricultural recovery natural disaster mitigation public health promotion and disease prevention restoration of schools public works and micro enterprise financing1 one of the principal sectors spurring economic growth has been export production top exports include the traditional exports of coffee meat and sugar fastest growing exports include nontraditional products such as apparel bananas gold seafood and new crops such as sesame melons and onions according to the world bank accelerating growth of the rural economy is key to reducing poverty in nicaragua because the majority of nicaraguas poor reside in rural areas the bank also says nicaragua has the basic conditions to achieve such growth good natural resources and low population density nicaragua has population of about 49 million people political conditions according to its constitution nicaragua is democracy with four equal branches of government the executive legislative judicial and electoral branches the current constitution went into effect in january 1987 and has undergone major reforms aimed at strengthening democratic institutions and distributing power more equitably among the four branches drafted during sandinista rule the 1987 constitution established presidential form of government although in reality actual power lay with the ninemember directorate of the fsln party in conjunction with the president and the national assembly generally operated as rubberstamp for directorate initiativeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20983crs3 2 filadelfo aleman sandinistas hold lead in polls ahead of presidential elections associated press july 23 2001president arnoldo aleman was elected on october 20 1996 to 5year term aleman leader of the conservative liberal constitutionalist party and mayor of managua from 19901995 defeated leftist daniel ortega head of the sandinista national liberation front fsln and president from 19851991 and 21 other candidates by wide margin although ortega lost both the 1996 and the previous presidential elections he garnered seat in the national assembly both times as the secondplace candidate with certain percentage of votes the presidential election campaign had been highly polarized with aleman and ortega each vilifying the other although aleman won the presidential race the sandinistas retained substantial political power through their various organizations nationwide and emerged from the elections with the second largest bloc in the legislature the aleman administration lacking an outright majority in the legislature included the sandinistas informally in the political process including negotiating agreements on the controversial property claims issue and on electoral law reform many critics have charged that the two former antagonists have worked out mutually beneficial sets of reforms throughout alemans term early electoral law reforms had the effect of working toward twoparty system one which favors larger parties such as theirs over smaller ones constitutional reforms passed in january 2000 also benefitted both aleman and ortega president aleman who is prohibited by the constitution from running for second term was awarded lifelong seat in the national assembly when his term expires some observers note that the immunity from prosecution accompanying the legislative seat may be of considerable significance to aleman considering the suspicions surrounding his sizeable accumulation of wealth while in office other changes provided that candidates could win the presidency with plurality of only 40 of the vote without having to have runoff election first place candidates can win in the first round with only 35 of the vote if they are ahead of the next candidate by at least 5 percentage points critics see these changes as trying to give an advantage to ortega who is running again for president in the november 2001 elections he lost the presidential race in 1990 with 384 and in 1996 with 395 of the vote2 november 2001 elections elections for the presidency and national assembly will be held on november 4 2001 these will be the third democratic elections since the sandinista government passed the presidential baton to violeta chamorro in 1990 the faces in this election are familiar ones to nicaraguans frontrunner daniel ortega was leader of the fsln when it overthrew dictator anastasio somoza in 1979 he was elected president in 1985 in elections which much of the international communit deemed fair but which were boycotted by much of the opposition and deemed unfair by the reagan administration ortegas administration was marked by bloody civil war with the contras authoritarian tendencies and charges of corruption some critics worry that victory for the former revolutionary socialist ortega would trigger capital flight and scare off investors but fsln

own finances enrique bolanos of the ruling liberal constitutional party is second in current polls businessman in his seventies bolanos was imprisoned by the sandinistas in the 1980s he was vicepresident under current president aleman but resigned last year in accordance with the law in order to run for president as perceptions of corruption in the aleman administration rise and the

toward nicaragua has been hotly debated during the 1970s the debate was primarily over how much assistance the united states should provide to the somoza government which was criticized for dictatorial tendencies and human rights abuses in the 1980s the controversy centered on whether the united states should provide aid to the contras battling the sandinista government which overthrew the somoza dictatorship in 1979 in the early 1990s the debate focused on the extent to which the united states should support president violeta chamorros national reconciliation policy which sought cooperative relations with the defeated sandinistas since the mid1990s congress has restricted us assistance to nicaragua pressuring the government there to make greater progress in such areas as

its civil war human rights abuses were widespread since the end of the civil war in 1990 however respect for human rights has improved and human rights observers longer accuse nicaraguan governments of systematic human rights violations according to the state departments report on human rights practices for 2000 cited above the nicaraguan government generally respected many of its citizens human rights although serious problems remained for example there were reports of political killings by government officials but police did report six cases of extrajudicial killings by members of the police force and there were allegations of torture and other mistreatment of detainees by police the government punished some members of security forces who committed human rights abuses but according to the report degree of impunity persisted the country was engaged in structural reform program of the judicial system but the system remained weak and susceptible to corruption and political influence other persistent problems include violence against women and children child labor trafficking in persons for forced labor and in women and children for forced prostitution and discrimination against indigenous people also according to the report the rule of law and basic infrastructure do not extend to all rural areas despite the governments disarmament campaigns since the formal end to
