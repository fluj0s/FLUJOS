freezone bible association tech post tape transcript shsbc lectures level vii shsbc415 statement of purpose our purpose is to promote religious freedom and the scientology religion by spreading the scientology tech across the internet the cof abusively suppresses the practice and use of scientology tech by freezone scientologists it misuses the copyright laws as part of its suppression of religious freedom they think that all freezoners are squirrels who should be stamped out as heritics by their standards all christians moslems mormons and even nonhassidic jews would be considered to be squirrels of the jewish religion the writings of lrh form our old testament just as the writings of judiasm form the old testament of christianity we might not be good and obedient scientologists according to the definitions of the cof whom we are in protest against but even though the christians are not good and obedient jews the rules of religious freedom allow them to have their old testament regardless of any jewish opinion we ask for the same rights namely to practice our religion as we see fit and to have access to our holy scriptures without fear of the cof copyright terrorists we ask for others to help in our fight even if you do not believe in scientology or the scientology tech we hope that you do believe in religious freedom and will choose to aid us for that reason thank you the fz bible association confidential shsbc tape lecture level vii sh spec52 renumbered 415 23 feb 65 level vii confidential thank you thanks lot i thank you appreciated appreciated nobody did that in spain although when we left when we left you would have thought we the whole foundation of the area wed been living in had been pulled out from under the people turning out to see us and say goodbye and tears in their eyes and all very wild and i see ive been gone quite while whats the date audience the 23rd the 23rd of february the 23rd of february thats right mary sue looks younger and and you didnt really know but shes the shortesteared burro in the world audience we didnt hear that its the shortesteared burro in the world time youve carried the huge bags of photographic equipment over hill and dale john lawrence offered to go down and and carry my photographic equipment for and so forth over the hill and dale and i said oh john i said this is this is mainly matter of putting my foot on rail and sleeping it all away dont you see and im not going to be very ambitious and so forth well as soon as i got down there i got ambitious and there was nobody around but mary sue and she gainly started packing all sorts of baggage over her shoulder and i kept noticing that the kept noticing that the burros you know that the spaniards use down there and so on they were really recalcitrant so she started getting recalcitrant she you know she wouldnt climb over pile of rocks or something like that so i started calling her burro and then i noticed oddly enough that she was the shortesteared burro in the whole world she did very fine the only thing that she did wrong she did something wrong while she was gone and that is to say she petted cactus now the the spaniards do something weird they pull the spines they use the cactus for decoration they pull all the spines out with pair of tweezers pretty wild you know whod ever think of doing that and so she saw one of these cactus and she was going around looking at lot of them and she didnt realize they hadnt gotten the little spines apparently so ever since every few days why wed pull another cactus splinter out of her hand little tiny things but otherwise we had good time and everything is fine and it was cold in spain cool in palmas and there is winter vacation area over on the european side north of i think liberia or something like that and you have to go quite while but quite ways but anyway theyre getting faster and faster aircraft and im very very close to not needing any aircraft anyway symptoms of this are turning up well we had good time and mainly i got good long distance look at everything i did quite bit of research and i cracked level vii i havent run level vii i havent finished level vi by an awful long ways but all of sudden one fine day toward the end of vacation actually it was on the boat coming home and i was sitting there and i took look and all of sudden realized that although i hadnt run vi i found out there was something over there and what was that and suddenly realized i was looking at level vii and you talk about being right my god how right can you get level vii of course is the 8 dynamics and were right back at the beginning its the 8 dynamics and you run them out and thats level vii and it isnt experiential track and its not very hard to do in fact its so easy to do that im having hard time not doing it i know ive got to finish level vi and when i discovered it and so forth plus my stomach too too much dont you see i mean its like little boy and hes been wishing for lollipop you know and somebody gives you an icecream factory and youre stomach goes youre stomach turns cold as ice you see and somatics chasing all over the body and and so forth while i was looking at this stuff you know its just just but thats you know to try to climb that escalator vertical and its right there and oddly enough there isnt anything more to find out about it i got it all taped i got its patterns and actions and everything else it only took about 45 minutes when id finally seen it to see the whole thing and its not very complicated and you probably could run out level vii i dont know in two or three sessions but you see to make myself more more more clear theres the ancient question of are we one or are we individuals well i told you someday wed have to solve that so thats solved and whats this stuff pounding on podium well you see there isnt anything much beyond this because then i found out that you dont really have to destroy the mest universe to get out of it its an individual proposition it appears to be collective proposition but its not its an individual proposition and you can go ahead of it in time back of it in time you can go out of it it can still be there you dont have to destroy it you dont have to destroy it for everybody that was one of the things i was little bit worried about oddly enough if i ran out the mest universe would it still be here for anybody else seemed to to be bit of an overt and you can run out the mest universe and its still there for other people you dont have to be in it and you dont have to not be in it you know but thats level vii and so the vacation wound up in in very highpeak win in spite of it being cold and so forth but one one about the only thing that really happened that was of very great interest is i found that psychologists were wrong again and although that isnt news its interesting to find point ive been told by them that animals dont commit suicide and ive even thought myself that animals didnt commit suicide and thats not true i ran across an animal that committed suicide and he was bear big alaskan brown bear that they had in zoo down in palmas and the way this zoo got started is of some interest columbus shoved off from spain to discover the new world and his first stop was the canary islands which had already been conquered by spain about century or so before or less than that and he stopped off and spent bit of time and then of course after he discovered america why he called in at the canary islands again and before he got back to spain at one of his his way stop was the canary islands so actually he got to the canary islands before he got back to spain well the canary islands are very aufey savvy to go french on you the kids are studying it so i have to the canary islands are very knowing on the subject and very up to snuff on the subject of the discovery of the new world and they probably know more about it than they do in spain and the natives down there still sell models of columbuss various ships you know all these things die out slowly they still carve and sell these little wooden models its the nina and pinta and santa maria anyway theres museum down there theres columbus house and so forth columbus slept here actually thats what they tell you and lot of his relics and when he came back from the new world well of course he gave them some cheerios and so forth and apparently started them zoo and the zoo has been going on ever since but not the same animals and one of these animals in the zoo theres pair of them and actually one additional one in some other cage but pair of of kodiak bears of smaller edition and the spaniards didnt know that bears hibernate although the kodiak doesnt do too much hibernation he nevertheless is hibernating animal bear is and they wouldnt let this old bear go to sleep but kept turning him out to do his stuff for the visitors typical spanish treatment of animals you know theyre very rough on animals and they kept turning this bear out and theyre ripping him out of the cement cave that he would get curled up in and hed finally gotten very sick and the temperature down there was running daytime and so forth about 60 65 and so forth and its very cold to the spaniards so he considered the bear was getting sick because it was cold weather well naturally this bear probably before he saw the zoo and his breed and so forth would consider 40 like london considers sweltering 77 in london today i mean that is headline serious headline but hed consider 40 degrees sweltering 40 degrees you see and they kept turning him out and he got sick and he started to protest on the basis of getting very sick and he was very sick bear one of the sickest bears ive ever seen hed go into shivers and ice cold and his legs wouldnt hold him up and hed get frozen in one spot dont you see and then all of sudden why hed get red hot and start panting and so forth and he had fever and chills the like of which i never saw and he was weak as cat the other bear in the cave was of course stark staring stircrazy and shed attack him all the time and life was just to grim and he was about the least climbing bear that anybody ever that breed doesnt climb anyhow and that iron cage came up to the top and met in the middle very high and very difficult to do anything with monkey would have had hard time climbing it and that bear few days later climbed up to the top of the cage all godknowshowmany pounds of him in this horrible state of not being able to walk he climbs up to the top of the cage gets to the total top crown of the cage and drops on the cement that was the end of the bear the most forthright case of suicide i think i ever saw in my life so apparently animals do commit suicide because he sure did only one of the few interesting stories we ran across of course one runs across lots of interesting stories but this we we saw the bear and we knew the bear and it happened while we were right there fantastic situation well i see ive been gone an awful long time because this student list goes pretty long and some of you have been here for quite while and so it will seem strange to you to be introduced at this particular moment nevertheless i am going to introduce you one by one stand up and take bow ron pook cal rigney val rigney constance flemming joe gains peter rost wally pallas and barbara poole to whom i owe considerable favor she she acted as another burro thank you barbara dorothy knight laura printer roger throw david hollywell and nan beardsley and arthur francis and last but not least retread leon bosworth well i see in in calling that role most of you most of you newcomers are in very good shape and everything is cheerful and some of the others have some overts so i will be watching that now on on the basis of i dont want to have missed withhold so i call to your attention the fact that i have already announced it so i havent missed it alright well im very glad to see you here and im glad to see the rest of you and im glad to see that youre getting along the line i noticed theres been few separations but you should be having ball i noticed you had an alteris in one of the processes you were doing some listing you shouldnt have been doing on level vi yeah there was some listing going on that shouldnt have been done and it was slowing down your tone arm action but thats all straight and then youve got youve got wideopen road on that particular level because right now im im just putting up the putting up the rack of gpms but let give you little comment here just as we as we go in passing here r6ew and so forth is not about to fade from view let call to your attention that when you bring student in onto r6 he is for the first time on solo audit its going to take him some time to get used to that to run meter and about that time he learns why meter works and he learns all sorts of things about auditing which is quite remarkable its very educational action for him to undertake in addition to that he does several other things in that he finds out why he has been operating the way he has been operating and so forth and he gets himself pretty well settled down now at that point if he cannot get tone arm action with r6ew he has business at the level in his auditing hes back there hes unable to talk to the auditor dont you see and hes got too many worries about his ptps and hes got this and hes got hidden standards and hes got the book of case remedies and he has business at the level so at that moment if its too grim and too gruesome he can be taken off and jumped through the book of case remedies and put in some kind of condition and run from the bottom up till hes back up there casewise you see you can run any process on him there is process that is barred out just because hes been on r6ew does not spoil any lower level process you see you can run any of them now therefore it gives us its very important that we have this it gives us this breathing spell because the truth of it is if you ran him into actual gpms they would run just enough to get him into the channel of the gpms and start him down the line and it would go just enough to get him completely smeared in and after that you couldnt run anything on him that had words endwords in it in other words itd be near thing he could be fished out of this but it would have to be very delicately done in other words hes gone in over his head and as pc hes wandering around in lost state somewhere in the reactive bank dont you see and now to pull him out of this with some junior process becomes very difficult thing that is what is wrong with r6 and that is r6 the biggest problem and that is why r6 is only being taught at st hill you see because when this sort of thing happens its quite catastrophic well that was happening here for while and i always run very heavy pilot right where i can straighten it out right up close before i let any dynamite package like this go out very far and its thats why its only being taught at st hill it is solved now however it is an intricate level and it can get so much good that we just know very well somebody if it was released to broadly who who should be being trained at level dont you see why somebody would be ambitiously for quick buck or something like that trying to audit or train him at level vi we already have an example of somebody whos running group someplace or other and he he had them all on level vi you know of what he thought was level vi and we had another thing of guy bringing somebody on and audit him for short time and and then perfectly green pc turning him loose with an emeter to run level vi on himself well of course the guy just had one long parade of catastrophes i dont know that anybody died as result of it but it could easily have happened so anyway the this was an important this was an important step to find some way to put somebody into level vi and get him accustomed to solo audit and find out whether or not he could take it without actually getting him into the middle of the reactive bank so that he couldnt be rescued and that process is r6ew so youre going to see that around for long time and that is your bridge process its quite an amusing process in that you have cognitions like mad but you finally get up to point when you run through r6ews in sixes and when you start getting the track plotted out i got i got the bulk of the track all all in sequence what what will happen is ill tell you now the course of action you you get to point finally where you where you dont have to audit it to find out what it it is see i mean you get loose enough on the thing i was very interested not an hour ago i felt cold you know and i was just hurrying around trying to get some things done and i just felt cold and i was wondering why i felt cold and i i just took look and there were about sixteen endwords lying on it and i said well what do you know thats an awful lot of end words i didnt bother to go over them dont you see i just whhhhwhhhwhh look at that mess you know not even auditing you know ifeelcold wonderwhatswrong ohwell lookatthatmessofendwords youknow whhwhhh so on its those sixteen endwords and i didnt think anything more about it it went on for another minute or so and i said wow ive been trying to solve the problem of one of these endwords another endword entirely on which all the remaining sixteen were serving as locks in other words gpms operating as locks on gpms which is pretty interesting anyway from that one could extrapolate rather easily that when poor condition lets say you didnt run out the bank see when when you found yourself in poor condition if you went on with an elementary process like r6ew carried it up to r6ews carried it up to r6ewp you would very shortly find yourself in position where it would be by inspection of the same nature as boy i got problem youre suddenly you know you have problem you just know youve got problem youre car wont start so you know you have problem well you dont consider that auditing where your bank becomes sufficiently confrontable and youre up to point of where it is more worry than this and its little bit weird to to look back at at year ago when i could collide crosswise with couple of gpms that were get them wrong or something like this and practically get the top of my head torn off or come down with high fever or something of this sort you know of absolute catastrophe you see now that compares with with hmm stomach feels cold oh i hmhmhmhm thats about sixteen about sixteen endwords have gotten piled up there what do you know and go on doing what im doing oh well theyre all serving as locks on any there well what do you know and go on with what im doing but not feeling cold thats bit of different look isnt it because originally it was basis of we better not fool with that because thats too close lock on gpm see so your confront on these things comes right on up and the extrapolated that is the the predicted course of action or the predicted change of condition and so forth does take place these things become more and more confrontable youre more and more able to handle and you get up to point of where theyre not worrying you theyre not worrying you to the degree that you look through and see the other side of the fence you know and so these these one the condition is attainable of that and the end product of ot is attainable that becomes quite obvious on practical basis and the other thing is weirdly enough is attainable with the processes youve got in r6ew r6ews and r6ewp regardless of running them running the whole gpm see thats the other predicted condition in other words you can get to point where you get to point where the bank is so thin its just blowing i mean inspection blows it not inspection of it is is it the right word and does it fit in the right place but you just notice it and it blows dont you understand i mean the thing has got that much its that weakened in command value the command value has become so weak as far as youre concerned that it cant concern you and its aberrative value of course is proportionately weak and in addition to that why its ability to do anything to you physically is proportionately weakened i mean youre becoming youre becoming cause over thing which before you were the total effect of you see that happening while youre running r6ew r6ews and so on very improbable that you will ever really have to run or future auditors in training and so forth will have to run r6ews or r6ewp because what well do is well find out if the guys all right at the r6ew you see can he make it go and can he solo audit and is he ok and then well just start opening up sections of the cabinet and show him the plot from the top down all very accurately done because the probability by the way of his colliding with the accurate plot is so negligible as to be neglectable thats weird thing to say isnt it but its true see ive had people giving what they thought the plot was here for about year and theyre pretty wrong you probably could attain all this however by running if you ran it long enough this is long route r6ew r6ews r6ewp you probably could attain the final blowing of the bank but thats long route you see now youre looking at couple of years of auditing or something like that if youre going at it not very intensive auditing couple of years of the kind of auditing you you get when youre not at st hill you see you know now and then sort of thing session week maybe if youre lucky or something like that well itd still take you couple of years to to do this all the way whereas youre looking at in terms of running time and so forth youre looking at about three months of auditing to total clean ot thats what youre looking at right now is about three months of of hammer and tongs auditing to go on up the line to to total ot when you get up to total ot you find yourself still in this universe well youre cause over matter energy space and time thats absolutely true perfect definition youre cause over it in this universe and your causation is not anything absolute dont you see its because youve still got youve still got 8 dynamics and if you noticed that there are seven dynamics flanking the 6th dynamic see so level vii in actual fact is is is an odd way to number it because you say it really really it should be level viii if there are eight dynamics in connection with it its very possibly true but in actual fact youll find out that youre only really handling seven of them you prove ive got the other one squared away but the rest of its just the mest universe youve got bank dont you see youve got reactive bank and what happens when you havent got reactive bank well weve never assumed otherwise that that person would be in the physical universe with reactive bank thats perfectly accurate see what happens then his next bank of course is the physical universe that is the next bank the universe of trolley cars and buses and brick walls and everest whats that well thats bank you could describe it as such and it is as such i notice nobody gets out of it i notice they leave and kick the bucket and theyre right back in the bank again every once in while science fiction boys will worry about other universes and moving around in various universes particularly after theyve read dianetics and scientology textbooks and but factually even wells and so forth was running into he he never considered he would get outside the physical universe its only occasionally that some science fiction writer will mention going into another universe and they speak then that is sort of this universe but there is this universe with time warp in it you know or space warp or its this universe with well theyre off the string to the degree that its not you dont go from this universe to another universe see you have to you dont move into another universe because youve moved out of this universe you see and its very hard situation to grasp you see you feel your brains creak when youre trying trying to grasp the thing originally which is what was happening to in trying to cognite on this thing what was this all about well when you well you dont have to have bank you see you put it in this category you dont have to have bank you dont have to every time you you have some thought that you shouldnt have or something of the sort that clobbers in the back of the neck with somatic or or something like this you dont have to have bank youd perfectly comfortable without one and you can think much better than the bank can i assure you particularly when you finally find out to your horror what is in the bank and what the basic motivation of man is too incredible for words its all backwards to anything anybody would think you see the thetan is basically good so he made bad bank because everybody else was bad and then if we all had this bad bank then we wouldnt do all these bad things hey well this bad bank proposition well person would be much better off if he didnt have the bank and thats quite obvious even on shortterm look fellow runs part of his bank out and he can now start functioning better you know he he doesnt have asthma anymore and he can think and he doesnt get the jitters and start screaming just because girl with nylon stockings walks through the room you know something like that so hes getting along much better hes much more effective and that sort of thing bank alright that little section of the bank is gone so hes more effective you see by extrapolation if the whole banks gone hed be terrifically effective and true he is he never dreamed how effective he really is see well now thats thats perfectly observable you see because thats finite observation well if you apply the same thoughts to the mest universe youve got it answered clearly its you know the hard thing is that what would you do if you didnt have mest universe you know well psychiatrists and psychologists today think the same thing about bank what would you do if you werent neurotic see what would i do if i werent crazy well so you can get into that same state of mind about reactive bank that everybody is in about the physical universe see what would i do without it what do you do without one what the hell have you got one for what what you got to have road for you know and you say well what are you what are you talking about what do you got to have road for you can walk on it you can drive on it and you its very useful road and its very nice road and its very nice thing to have road yeah its very nice thing to have road and i dont really know why you have to have road if all you have to do is have road you get the point that seems to be much more interestingly direct it seems to youd get into lots more interesting games in very peculiar ways if all you had to do to have road was have road road you know see traffic cop running on your road road you talk about random life would become very very very interesting guy would have to be in complete apathy to want things as dull as having universe all laid out predictable all the time every time you look at your watch five five minutes from the last time you looked at your watch its five minutes later crazy business you know well its like fellah in cage its like i guess animals get in zoos at five oclock the keeper is going to come and feed us and thats we have to have that so nice and certain all we have to do is sit here in this cage and at five oclock the keeper will feed us and if we werent sitting in this cage we wouldnt get fed at five oclock you see the logic well thats actually the logic that thetan uses to account for the mest universe and so forth and hes just securityhappy hes got to have security hes in complete apathy about being able to do anything himself so he hes got to have all this total security and the least randomity drives him out of his mind dont you see well to give you an idea what would happen if the sun started moving backwards without any phenom without any geological cataclysm see but if just all of sudden you woke up one morning the sun was over in the west and it was traveling to the east or it got to noon and went into spiral for while do you realize what would happen out here in the streets can you envision the streets of london while that was going on boy would the catholic church make money you can predict that too but now thats well everybodyd go frantic well why would they go so frantic well because its destroyed their their certainty and their predictability well why do they got to have this much predictability why shouldnt the sun move to ten oclock and stay there till august oh bill bill you forgot to move the sun hey thats your hat it isnt we changed hats last tuesday we did not yes we did you forgot to fill up the ocean well whos responsible for mocking up the ocean here this week oh they dont need any ocean we had to have desert scene the only place we could find for it was the middle of the pacific ocean what pacific ocean physical universe pacific ocean oh you want to look at the physical universe pacific ocean well alright go take look at the physical universe pacific ocean i cant ive run it out im not crazy like that anymore then you say well what happened to it if everybody else has got it mocked up why what happened to it the truth of the matter is it never was there it never is there and it never will be there just everybodys got it there so the end product of things look something along in that view dont you see you can you can have it you can have it you can have it and you can go on seeing it and that sort of thing and you can undoubtedly vary it or alter it to considerable marked degree but when you think of varying and altering dont just think of the physical universe if youre going to vary and alter mest why have you got to pick on the mest of the physical universe to vary it and alter it vary and alter your own mest joe and bill have got piece of mest so they vary it and alter it i dont see why they have to vary and alter gibraltar they could vary and alter gibraltar you see at the same time and itd get varied and altered for other people but it would get varied for people to the degree that they were aberrated by it to the degree they were overwhelmed by the bank you wonder why 8c works well oddly enough 8c of course is cousin not to level vi but is cousin to level vii and you wonder why people suddenly have leaped out hospital beds on having read dianetics evolution of science or something of that sort you were cheating out some little piece that they had in disarray at level vii not at level vi and then the reason you got gains on your subjective processes and so forth is because you were doing things to level vi so you remember for years and years and years weve had subjective and objective well subjective of course level vii is also subjective to the degree that it is your bank dont you see but youll get over that because you that you have to do weird little trick with logic to get that thing squared out in other words the situation is simply that subjective processes or think or figure processes or processes like any of practically any of your your repetitive processes arc straightwire see they were influencing level vi and they were taking locks off level vi you following they were straightening out the mental purely mental masses and so therefore they were keying out bits of the reactive mind and thats what subjective process was and then an objective process is level vii process that familiarized and accustomed person to his the mest universe bank see his his other bank and thats why you would very often find somebody that you could run and run and run and run and run and they wouldnt have single commlag on level on 8c you know they could just run and you say now look at that wall walk over to that wall go on and touch that wall the guy does it and does it and does it when you finish up hes better i know its it was seldom this happened but it did happen every once in while youd get one pc out of about ten or fifteen in hgcs that you run them on 8c and they and we explained it on the basis you couldnt develop commlag so the process was to high for them how absolutely correct we were trying to run them on level vii process see that that was their the harmonic the lower harmonic of level vii we were making them touch walls dont you see and they were actually putting the universe back you know there are people around who had walls right up against their faces and all kinds of weird because of course nobody really knows how the mest universe looks to anybody else you see and they had people who had different universes theyve got them in theyve got them in insane asylums all the time and its not necessarily something subjectively wrong with them at all thats objectively wrong with them it isnt because their mind is giving them wrong world dont you see their mind isnt giving them anything their mind as we would think of it or know it and that sort of thing would be level vi theres nothing wrong with their mind there is something wrong with their environment theyve just merely got an aberrated vii see it didnt have to be aberrated at vi at all see this guys got it fixed up so that all walls are 45 degree angles and he could even have it aberrated objectively to the point where he was dealing with some when knighthoods were in flower timewarp so dragons keep walking in through the front door the dragons might walk in through the front door they might even bite him maybe he or maybe not you see we describe it as delusion but that that says theres something wrong with his mind you see in here see an introverted error its an extroverted error see it isnt in here thats wrong with him its there thats wrong with him you see although hes influencing that of course and so forth but dragons keep walking in that door man ohoooh and you try to tell one of these fellows theres bugs on you the truth of the matter is there is bugs on the patient in the psychiatrists view of level vii but in the patients view of level vii there are bugs on the patient so something has gone wrong with vii so if you can make the guy merely pay attention to what he is calling and mocking up the physical universe locational processing 8c where is the indicated object such things as that you find some remarkable things happen you can also do this odd thing you think youre running problems and youre not you say well lets lets spot all the places where this fellow is having any trouble in his life and lets just have him sort of indicate where they are youre youre not handling his level vi difficulty with problems what youre handling is youre handling his level vii difficulty with locations see its not its not the gpms that have got him going you follow its its see he hasnt got he hasnt got the bideawee biscuit factory four or five miles over that way where it belongs hes in the bideawee biscuit factory while you are trying to audit him and probably your voice sounds peculiar to him too because trying to audit across distance of four or five miles its difficult you know children you say get the child into the classroom well what if some of those children are actually still outside playing and not not anybody thinks theyre outside playing you see theyre the the road which they have the viewpoint of they dont have to be out there playing you got the idea they are where they are but they are outside playing because thats where they are although they are sitting in front of you and youre talking to them you get the idea well theyve got in essence and aberration on the viith because of great desire to be outside they actually put outside where they are but not really put it there but really put it there dont you see but they dont put where they are there because they dont want to be there dont you see theyre not putting up 7th dynamic what the hell you going to do with them they they you you get read on the meter that they were outside playing but thats thats what theyve got out there but they really dont dare mock it up very boldly you see youre liable to see it too all kinds of you see how it gets pretty weird when you start trying to pick your way through it in relative to relation to so child we have said we had to get the child into the classroom before we could teach him so therefore locational processes or something like that were very good now it was level vi which ruined creative processing because creative processing really although it touched vi slightly and would have alleviated vi slightly creative processing in actual fact affected level vii its the exercise by which he was actually putting up the physical universe and that was old creative processing now when you could get that working on somebody it worked like bomb but what was wrong with it and why it got boobytrapped the step 6 effect we used to call it what happened was his bank would start getting more solid well he actually because the bank gpms is full of the word create strung from one end to the other dont you see his his reactive mind would get in the road of his making the physical universe you see and you couldnt run the process because he was addressing it at level vi and it wouldnt work unless it were addressed at level vii dont you see so level vi boobytraps level vii and keeps it from operating so therefore creative processing ive had ive had auditors come why did you ever go off there i had wonderful results with it you know oh this and that and the other thing and so forth well all he had to see was one guy go green when his bank started to get totally solid to say well if that happened one pc out of hundred that would be too many times so therefore its very dangerous process the devil with it dont you see and at the time it was released i hadnt run into that hundredth guy dont you see although i had enough cases to make it look perfectly all right ran all right on and ran all right on anybody i audited and then all of sudden started colliding with the person it didnt run all right on he was about one out of hundred or something like that you see so we found this stray so right away why we threw it away and didnt use it any more and so forth but it will make clear well one of the reasons itll make clear is because it moves so it sort of keys out vi and puts person more solidly in vii and he finds himself in somewhat apparently clear state in the physical universe yes the apparency because what youve done is really straighten out the physical universe for him and it wasnt straightening out his mind at all you were straightening out his view of the physical universe is what was being straightened out it was not then mental exercise it was full straight forward thetan exercise which corrected the outofcontrolness of his making the physical universe see this was so badly out of control and so aberrated and so far adrift so messed up that he could longer mock himself up good physical universe the walls came in on him you know and so you give his some practice in mocking things up and where it worked it was impinging on the fact that he was moving the physical universe getting rid of that automaticity to the degree that it would stabilize into his basic automaticity of making it see and you get rid of just his the aberrated nature the aberrated the degree that he was aberrated on the subject of being aberrated you you follow that in other words hes already aberrated so that he was obsessively making physical universe and then this had inverted that word we use occasionally which means that that aberration had become in its turn aberrated you follow so he longer he longer can do clean job of this then when you gave him little practice in mocking things up or lot of practice in mocking things up you take the aberration off the basic aberration the basic aberration therefore stayed the way it was and he felt fine see youve taken hes still crazy but now he was happy to be crazy well thats good comparison the guy was unhappy about being crazy and with little exercise of creativeness why he got happy about being crazy but everything was better yeah thats right it was better i think there was even movie on it one time called harvey harvey stage play guy saw rabbit all the time he had very cheerful rabbit around with him all the time and the doctor said he would get unhappy and mean if you took his rabbit away from him and they took his they took his rabbit away from him and he became very unhappy happycrazy and unhappycrazy anyhow gap in tape might be anyhow they took the pcs home universe away from him and he became unhappycrazy well when i got that then was able to go back and do some 0 to iv with great accuracy and knock out lot of things and so forth well now having come to grips here with vii and seen that its there you dont even have to have release point see guy can see it figure out whats there ive got to get ive got to finish vi before i can tackle vii and thats very hard to do by the way and i sit down solo auditing feeling why wait to go on vii why dont i get rid of all those icepicks i dont know well we got all of sudden i get horrible somatics dont you say and waaaah and vooo talk about trying to audit yourself over youre head you know its very intriguing so i have to suppress it that isnt so good either so i run the suppression off and get on with vi he laughs the net gain here has been to get another look and realize that there were all the time these two approaches to the bank the subjective and the objective the subjective process the objective process there were there were two things you could do with the bank just like there are two things significance and mass those are the two things you address now you can address those things in two ways which is kind of weird significance and mass but you can handle them subjectively and you can handle them objectively so you get the significance and mass subjective and the significance and the mass objective you say that is door well that is the significance and mass objective you ask some little kid whats in the room and they will tell you theres door and theres ceiling and theres floor and so forth well thats the mass and the significance thats an objective process well what its actually treating is the penchant the thetan has to put in the physical universe out there see hes working on actually i keep saying physical universe because mine keyed in and so forth theres all eight dynamics out there not just the 6th and hes well when he sees flowers dont you see why hes into the 5th and and hes but thats out there and its got significance and mass you see its got name form and an apparent purpose relationship to the physical universe lets its or two other flowers or two gardeners or something like that so thats the significance and then there is the mass of the flower and of course to have mass youve got to have some space around it to separate the mass but thats there that is it it isnt because something is wrong in here that makes that it dont you see any wrongness is right over there where its it see the guy but there is bank in here that gives you another set of values of the wildest and craziest sorts and directions and so forth but that has to do with behavior of specific significance and mass that has to do with the behavior and attitude persons behavior and attitude is what is regulated on the type of subjective process and his observation and well theres ability and behavior and attitude as part of ability too but his perceivability as perception in the by and large and whether or not hes got solid walls and whether or not he can walk out of houses you see this those things depend on that other zone of aberration see which is the objective zone of aberration and if this guy cant walk out of houses it isnt because something is in his mind saying i cant walk out of houses you follow that it it isnt something in the bank that says i cant walk out of houses or trouble is out there house see its nowhere else than where it is in other words is what im trying to say to you he trouble with this fellah he says i could never leave the house well then dont audit him on subjective process oddly enough youll run into gpms thatll account for it theres whole series of six that account for getting stuck in houses after youve run after youve run these however why you find out that you still arent as happy about going out and dashing around outside of houses as youd like to be and thats because although theres theres behavior an attitude relationship to houses theres also houses and actually hes lost the ability to mock up the outside of house over there see he longer makes the outside of house over there he makes the inside of the house around here so he cant leave house do you follow so if youre very clever auditor you could add all this up in this way well do we audit this pc subjectively or objectively is he crazy objectively is he crazy subjectively fellow had poltergeists you would never dream you know objects and he goes skidding around and objects fly around the room where he is wed never dream now what we know now you see and audit him on subjective process you audit him on an objective process well what is an objective process well there are tons of them there were tons of them crossroads by the way is because its so thoroughly into level vi and the reactive bank is have so havingness ran level vi and level vii simultaneously it ran out there and in there too and therefore its very workable on most people and little bit steep for some and some people it doesnt work on at all and then you have to have all the special brands of havingness to try to get around this well theyre just not capable of theyre not capable of auditing two levels simultaneously theyre just not clever its too much for them so just dont run it thats easy run pure objective or pure subjective to straighten them out when you get your can squeeze going wrong cant get can squeeze well you could probably correct the can squeeze subjectively or objectively compared to whether the pc was aberrated on the subject of the physical universe because of attitude and behavior or aberrated on the subject of the of the universe around him because he was had an aberrated physical universe around him you get the idea is his attitude toward the universe wrong or has he got wrong universe now i think ive said it little more comprehensive you understand in talking to you about these things i havent actually had chance to express them at all i havent written them up these are your sole notes on all of this oh well thats not true theres about eight pages of reports on the subject but it it doesnt cover what im telling you it just recovers the exact precise crisp findings in other words you it gives you an insight if you know this then this gives you this kind of an insight pcs can squeeze is down well it gives you the choice then of whether you get his can squeeze up by running off the locks of the session which has been an introverted type session see and that would get his can squeeze up providing his can squeeze was down because of subjective reason level vi reason bank reason gpm reason see suppress prepchecking is totally subjective of course you could prepcheck an exterior object but it would have to be the object that is with you right this minute youd have to give the guy be typewriter or typewriter and say now suppress that typewriter you wouldnt be able to say recall time you have suppressed that typewriter dont you see youd have to say suppress the typewriter now unsuppress it suppress it unsuppress it all of sudden the typewriter would do something did you move the roller of the typewriter again you couldnt say get the idea of supressing the typewriter dont you see you just have to exercise this is very direct you have to exercise the pc in relationship to the object and youve got youve got an objective process i dont care how you do it you do this with emeters all the time did you ever have something funny happen while you were doing reach and withdraw from an emeter well of course youre not very aberrated on the subject of an emeter but you get something around that would be really aberrative dont you see i know get fire burn fire get fire burning little wood fire or something like that and sit pc down in front of it and exercise him on the subject of this fire you say reach the fire withdraw from the what mmmm just gonna run this little process reach the fire withdraw from the mumble the hell with you now come on now well how could we phrase this so that its runnable well youve given lose now and i wouldnt be able to run it at all alright well well start in on this thing on gradiment gradient alright then you get smart dont you see if you really know hes putting the physical universe there for himself and that that is another bank now you can get very smart and you say alright heat up the fire good cool off the fire good heat up the fire good hell say how am i supposed to do that well just do it well i can get the idea of just just you know go nrrrrrrrrrrrrr heat and nrrrrrrrrrrrrr cold and nrrrrrrrrrrr rr thats the way youre supposed to do that alright if you say so now this is this hasnt been done dont you see ive just given you straight off the cuff these are theoretical abstractions as that might occur you see and so he does this for while and he so he goes ooooossnmmmmmmmmmmm and you know his fire is starting to flicker and all of sudden he notices the fire too and you say alright well lets it cause it did get bit flat why this by the way would probably register on the emeter too because you know its the physical universe but it would probably be the emeter registering back at the pc dont you see not the emeter registering to the bank or thered be something crazy going on i dont know exactly what would go on i know the emeter will register on the physical universe the pcs reaction to the physical universe causes registry on the emeter as well as the bank reaction apparently now youre next youre next action you see of is to tell this fellow alright now reach toward the fire well its gotten brighter after little while you say whats your this is theoretical what are you telling to do that for what do you mean why are you saying toward why dont arent you saying reach the fire withdraw from the fire whats the matter you changing the process on you squirrel or something and you say alright reach the fire withdraw from the fire its totally theoretical you dont say put your had into the fire and take your hand away from the fire but you very possibly if this was exercised it would be very possible if the fellow was up at up at hed gone through vi and was in vii this would be pipe but im talking about fellow thats still got the human characteristics and hed be reaching into the fire and withdrawing from the fire and reaching into the fire and withdrawing if you got curious say how can you do that well hed say i never reach into hot fire man i reach into cold one laughter now just exactly what would happen if you put thermometer in that fire i wouldnt be prepared to tell you i dont know if itd only be cold for him dont you see or if itd be cold for everybody thats the point these are little points of interesting speculation which in due course one will get adequate subjective reality on this subjective reality is right over the hill its very close too but i myself have seen lamps move and have seen things happen in various types of process that i never really competently understood before i now know what its all about i mean i was doing at the time these things happened an objective process and of course spatial relationships of things change when you do it ive often i every now and then would be auditing pc and hed find the distance to the wall has shifted this is almost standard of are they getting good reaction out of an objective process by getting good reaction out of it i mean are they getting any improvement out of it they going anyplace with this effective process well very often they will make some remark like this but its something mild and you wouldnt you really wouldnt be too alert because it sounds very mild when they say it well the distance to the wall the distance to the walls good and the room has gotten larger and so forth and youve heard pcs say that and youve said to yourself well alright it just seems to him hes got an idea of this whole thing and it never occurred to you the room had gotten larger you know the room was not as far as he was concerned two feet by three feet the room is now eight feet by ten feet now you could aberrate it in the other way around and get the room to get too large and something might happen there but this when youre going up through the levels they are not the processes in them this was another datum i needed in order to make final adjustment of any processes in there although i consider them pretty final now at lower levels but probably each one should have little bit and piece of an objective and subjective you see we used to do this all the time where everything was either we had an objective and we had subjective process for various things we used to look out and look in now this find three spots in your body three spots in the room is oddly enough an objective process one hundred percent because of course the mind the reactive bank is not in the body just because youre looking into the body is reason why youre inspecting the reactive bank the reactive bank is thing its got sort of mushy looking electronic masses and its got pictures and locks and other things associated with this it is thing well the physical universe and the remaining dynamics of course are themselves thing and thats what we mean when we say our universe and the other fellows universe and everybodys universe there were three universes if you can remember rightly well that apparently is very true there are apparently three universes but we were speaking of the reactive bank as meaning one of those universes where as matter of fact thats little bit of curve in the line it turns out that there was his universe you know his brick walls and were not sure right now whether or not theyre his brick walls and everybodys brick walls or only his brick walls or exactly whats the status of these brick walls because were right up bunch right up against the ability to disintegrate matter all these various phenomena that yogi has been know as good yogi if he could you know something or other if he could levitate you know youve heard all these tricks and nonsense pieces and that sort of thing kid game stuff this this is this is this is the level youre looking at you see now exactly the extent and dimension and capability and if you do it if it does it for everybody and if we if we blow up the rock of gibraltar is it also blown up for spain or is it only blown up for england lot of interesting questions get asked there and we cant of course at this instant give final absolute exclamatory point answer what is the condition of this stuff and so forth all the remaining dynamics ask question like what is plant is plant part of another thetan is it somebody who is keeping his eye on something or other which keeps it growing you know these are these are all these very little interesting bricabrac type of questions that knock around in anybodys head youre looking over this situation and well i what do i mean by i you see and various questions well theyre your your 7th dynamic aspect and the bank as we see it is really not part of that theyre quite distinct theres an error in very small error i like to call these things to your attention theres an error in the early materials on level vi that says you make this has been consistently stated and its now found to be incorrect the bank is responsible for the physical universe that is felonious statement the bank is responsible for the physical universe the thetan is responsible for the physical universe the thetan is responsible for the physical universe and not via the reactive bank because he has walked up gpm that has time in it is not then the reason why he had time do you follow that well it doesnt occur at level vi i had two levels together there that occurs at level vii and is direct action and the aberration itself is time and not gpm about time you follow that thats very subtle difference nevertheless the other is little bit too broad generality and that that have to be corrected to that degree but the aberration is time the aberration is not having gpm that gives you time see see and then because youve got gpm that gives you mud that makes mud aberrative when you fall into it see the aberration is mud now there is state of mind and set of agreements at level vii which is not the gpm bank and that state of mind keeps one fixed into the belief and keeps one that there is physical universe and keeps one fixed also into the belief that everybody has one bank and one universe in common that is the fixed belief it looks like first cousin to gpm but its not gpm but it looks like first cousin to it and that is what is at level vii its its the the kinks in the thetan that bring about his belief in the oneness of everything and that kind of thing so anyhow its all very fascinating and you should distinguish between an objective then and subjective process and at any lower level you could actually get clever enough to choose which one to run on the pc on the basis of what youve observed in the pc this pcs car is wreck well we used to say if you straightened out various things his car would be less of wreck well theres more direct way you could do that his approach to the world called car see is 7th dynamic thing and therefore if you did an objective process it would straighten out faster you dont have to worry about the think you dont even have to worry about his you see the physical universe is not an experiential line and level vii doesnt include the experiential line you acknowledge the scape stray engrams and experience and and that sort of thing theyre not there the experience you see one of the things youre stepping out of when you go from level vi to level vii is you step totally out of the aberration because of past experience thats gone there isnt any the aberration doesnt stay there because youve had the past experience the past might be there but the aberration wont be there you understand so the basis of the whole idea i know this is strange to you youd have thered longer be basicbasic to anything dont you see or anything like that because there wouldnt be basic experience you have to trace forward like the first time you made any mest that would not be the thing actually the fact that you had made mest at some prior moment and so forth would have bearing your having mest now do you follow well the whole build up and the compounded nature of aberration vanishes at level vi youre longer dealing with that at level vii experience now will mean nothing so you were in train wreck yesterday so what it doesnt influence your condition today because you were in train wreck yesterday do you follow that youre not aberrated because your mother was mean to you anymore dont you see the whole aspect of that as matter of fact at that point it appears to be that i would predict that it would be rather hard to grasp how you could figure it out so that you could now be aberrated because then had had something happen to you see you can get that as the primary aberration that person is facing all the time because of level vi i am the way i am because we they dropped an atom bomb on my foot one day see of course that sounds perfectly logical to human but it would sound very illogical at level vi youre in bad shape because something happened why brother how you connect them things up like that you crazy or something you say you feel tired because you didnt have any sleep last night figure this out you feel tired because you didnt have any sleep last night last night oh i get it when do you feel tired oh you feel tired now oh i dont understand that i can understand how you could feel tired last night you know its last night and youre feeling tired ok thats good game youre youre as we talk youre last night feeling tired yeah that makes sense ok i got that so its sense to i dont know why youre doing it flexercising or something of course its up to you you say that that isnt what youre doing you feel tired now because you were up late last night hmmmm how the hell are you doing that lets see well you must be living in broadened time is that what it is quite game here broadened time boy youre going to get confused if you do that i wouldnt do that if i were you and actually from rather sane viewpoint that is more or less how it would look from level vii when you try to make sense of what is humanoid obviousness it doesnt make sense anymore and you might maybe you may run across some materials from lord knows how long ago you might have been there at the time but during the period when i used to tell you you couldnt be right and be human impossible to be right and be human and thats absolutely true it becomes incredible from viewpoint of that upper level you couldnt be if you were right to that degree you would be at the upper level and you wouldnt be human but to the amount of error that human obviousness looks like from these points of view its its just braincracker absolute braincracker i can i can bend my own wits around and see how it would look you see itd look silly i really had ball when i was going down the line adding this up bangity bangity bangity bangity bang and i was looking right straight at it you know and i was trying to keep my hair from standing on end and few things like that and just doing competent job of observer dont you see which you have to you cant go off and get lot of case run while youre doing this what ruins lot of people in research is they get case advances they dont maintain an objective viewpoint they maintain an aberrated or subjective viewpoint which they dont need and it was it was quite interesting i could see which way that was going and boy you know i had to drag myself away from that session with the crook on the neck or i would have gone right back and started running this stuff out and id probably cut my head off and had the ship sunk in the middle of the high seas and lord knows what all would have happened but i had to lay it aside quietly and come home like good boy the now ill have at it im going to be very good boy im going to go ahead and finish the plot of of the gpm because ive been taught by experience it isnt very likely to be turned out very accurately in long period of time so i better go ahead and finish that total plot up and then run them all like good boy and and its lot of its done right now ive got stack of cards about that high and then go on back on up to level vii in an orderly progress in other words i will do exactly what i am advising everybody to do in general laughter so its matter of record here that ron has for once taken his own advice in other words do as i do as well as i say so anyhow thats about the extent of it it shows that theres were approaching were approaching just to be unemotional about it and so forth the point of all of the conundrums and all of this sort of thing and they become very objectively shaken out you dont have to be informed of them particularly they just shake out you you get uncrazy on the subject of them and thats very good thing but it doesnt mean that youre not interested in participating and so forth you can get more excited and you know more more pleasure out of existence because it isnt kicking you in the head and yet i dont know ive probably got 910ths of the bank in place and all of the physical universe sitting there staring at and when i walk out of that door im going to have to take hold of the knob so thank you very much end of lecture
