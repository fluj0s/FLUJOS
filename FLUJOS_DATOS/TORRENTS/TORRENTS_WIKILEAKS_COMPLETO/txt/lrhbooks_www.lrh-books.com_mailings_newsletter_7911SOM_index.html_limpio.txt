marriage or relationship an article by l ron hubbard from the state of man congress lectures because when youre getting married youre doing something you dont know anything about did you ever think of that hm did you ever think about it thats the one trip one lifetime sort of thing dont you see and when you try it couple of times why usually you know less about it the second time than you did the first time now it doesnt say that operating manuals havent been written for marriages i know there are several extant all written by bachelors or people who have not beenlike most of the careofchildrenforthemother books are always written by bachelors now marriage is an interesting boat to steer its not third dynamic activity and yet it is kind of it generally ceases to be second dynamic activity but has to remain so the genus of marriage is one of these things that is big pose on the early track and that is thetan association thetans early on the track very often got the idea that they would mock each other up you know asthey would be brothers or they would be family or something of the sort and they would all appear to be related cousins sisters uncles aunts mothers fathers mothersfathers actually comes later on the track earlier it was just thetan brotherhoods and this pretense at association was something that seldom worked out very well because everybody knew they were just pretending and they knew there was real familial relationship this falsity or the ideas of this falsity actually continue forward into the modern family its very easy to break down family because there is relationship in family except pretended relationship think of it for moment and you realize youre supporting thing which cant exist thetan was never the daughter of another thetan thetan was ever the father of another thetan matter what the good book says thats the truth of the matter now any time you have relationship which isnt inherent or based on immediate and direct fact you have to work at it now im not saying that marriage is false relationship it isnt in this society and time family is the closest knit selfperpetuating selfprotecting unit and is necessary economically and otherwise to the society the way its rigged at this present time and who destroys marriage destroys the civilization thats fairly sure culture will go by the boards if its basic building block the family is removed as valid building block but this is reason we should get mawkedup and silly about what the relationship is the relationship basically is postulated relationship there is truth in the relationship it is postulated relationship and when people stop postulating it it ceases to exist and thats what happens to most marriages people stop mocking up the family unit and the moment they stop mocking it up it isnt you see what happens to marriages it isnt the other way around it isnt that all men are evil so therefore contracts such as marriage dissolve usually in infidelity and go all to pieces that is not true the reverse is true that when you have purely postulated relationship which has real existence in fact you have to continue to create it and family which doesnt continue to create itself as family will cease to exist as family thats about all you need to know about it when i was little kid most people in this society at this time had considerable
