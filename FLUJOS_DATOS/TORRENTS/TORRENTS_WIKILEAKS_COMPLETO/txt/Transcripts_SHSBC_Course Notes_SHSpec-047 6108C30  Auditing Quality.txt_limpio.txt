6108c30 shspec47 auditing quality if you pass up any reading rudiment and try to go on with the session when the pc has his attention on something else even if it is notised you will set up trouble in session youll get arc breaks stemming from the ptp it may not be ptp stemming from the environment sessions can be ptps also asking for ptps can restimulate one that had been dormant until looked for so rudiments can be dangerous ground if the pcs ptp is the session he has already postulated that he cant have session otherwise hed just relax about it and not have the ptp hes got such scarcity of auditing that he has to get the most session he can in that unit of time he presses at it gives himself more commands substitutes process he can do for one he cant in all this the pc is just trying to make session out of it this creates ptp for the pc new pcs especially have scarcity of any treatment because theyve had so much ineffective treatment they feel treatment is being offered anywhere so they get cant have on treatment this gets carried over into auditing it produces scarcity the pc will demand auditing and wont have it when he gets it this all stems from the ptp of scarcity of treatment handle it with any ptp process once you get the pc to see that he has it using innuendo to get him to cognite that auditing is scarce use something like what auditing sessions have you been unable to confront or when has there been auditing or what unknown in an auditing session would you want to escape from this would cure the phenomenon the pc who has continual ptps has obviously not told you anything about his ptp because those things that are known are not aberrative so if he says i know whats wrong with its my mother you can write it off those things that are halfknown can still make trouble from the unknown half so the second the pc says i know all about it that does not necessarily mean hes recovered from it if he found out about it in auditing it may not be fully known never believe pc except on goals and terminals to the pc auditing is handling of his fixed attention on the track so you neednt quail at getting in rudiment if thats where the pcs attention is fixed you do have to find the root of it the thing hes really stuck on auditing is what the pc considers frees up his attention so ask enough questions to find out what hes doing and where his attention is if the auditor sits there running the process and doesnt know whats happening with the pc he has big notknow on the session the pc can also notknow what the auditor is doing he can feel hes got withhold because the auditor never asks whats going on you can ask pertinent questions in any number get very certain on what hes doing how what hes looking at etc etc it keeps the pcs attention on his case to keep asking about it it also keeps his comm in and it gives you chance to guide him into doing the command the way you want him to pc who goes anaten has suffered drop in havingness his primary havingness is havingness of an auditor so if hes gone anaten hes lost the auditor you could ask when is the first time you lost the auditor if you dont give him back an auditor hell continue to go anaten the pc with the most anaten has the least auditor the things that cause him to lose the auditor could be what the auditor does eg an error or just the pc hitting some incidents and losing the auditor the pc starts going anaten and the pc is alone thats all find out where he is hes doing retreat anaten and boiloff on the part of the pc indicate that from the point of view of the pc the auditor isnt there if you find out where the pcs attention is you free it which is the goal of auditing if you are interested in the pcs case it helps hip to be interested in it you can just sit back and give the command and never find out what the pc is doing and it will work but compared to what happens if you really do cooks tour of the bank getting the pc to tell you whats going on all the time its an inferior type of auditing if you dont do it that way the pc will hit the thing and bounce hit and bounce leaving bit stuck here and there the pc will eventually come out fine it just takes longer the reason lrh hasnt insisted on auditors doing it this way is that they can be so knuckleheaded about it they dc some escape mechanism by asking dumb question as long as an auditor experiences impulses matter how obscure to rescue the pc from the dangers of the bank by pulling him away from it its not safe to have him asking questions thats the bug in back of it the bank is as it is because of the confusion and randomity in it if you dont keep the pc confronting the randomity he wont clear up thats all thats the source of the 51 ratio in length of time needed to produce an auditing result between others and lrh ron has allergy to action but has musthave on it either you dont audit the quiet points of the track although scarcity of action is what is wrong with the pc we have to ask how did this scarcity of action occur it occurred because of the unpalatability of action stillness is preferred because it keeps you from getting hurt you may find the pc complaining of the boredom of life if you suggest lets go join the marines the pc will say well action has become discreditable society at this time has the opinion that action is bad idea at least as represented in literature why should this be if pc is so starved for action you would think that the scarcity of action just stemmed from his situation in life but how did he get himself in that situation the faster you get him over the idea of the discreditable nature of action the sooner youll get him unstuck from the quiet areas of his track the blood and guts are there moment before and after its fascinating to find out what pcs think pictures should be too they may have weird ideas about what they should have all backed up with the discreditability of action you can direct the pcs attention by asking him questions as long as your questions do not yank his attention off the subject on which it is operating hell get into trouble at all finding out what hes doing what hes looking at etc is beneficial and whenever it seems hes just escaped find out about what is unknown about what he just left cog this would also be the mechanism of blows on misunderstoods person cannot confront the unknown or if theres anything else in that keep putting his attention back on the thing he bounced out of dont do this forcefully but use pointed questions eventually the whole thing is sorted out and hes not stuck on it by all the effort to escape and the mystery and the unconfronted action furthermore he knows hes getting auditing because he gets his attention freed from the spot where it was stuck he winds up with action not being discreditable and being able to have it
