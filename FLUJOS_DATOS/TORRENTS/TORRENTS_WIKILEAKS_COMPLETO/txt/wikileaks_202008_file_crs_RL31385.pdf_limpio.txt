sustainable development wssd held august 26 september 4 2002 was charged by the ited nations genera l assembly with assessing progress and charting future course regarding implementation of agenda 21 the action plan for sustainable devel opment agreed upon 10 years before at the united nations conference on environm ent and development unced four preparatory meetings prepcoms to fo rmulate and negotiate possible outcomes of the wssd were held and final discussions were c onducted at the summit itself several of the most difficult issues incl uding additional fina ncial resources for developing countries good governance nd capacity building reached somewhat of stalemate between devel oping and developed countries in the preparatory period as result although agreement was r eached among the worlds nationsmost of which sent delegations to the prepcomson so 73 of the text for draft plan of implementation for sustaina ble development before th wssd the press and many observers described the status of ne gotiations at the conclusion of the 4th prepcom in bali indonesia as f ailed or collapsed in addition to the draft implementation plan political declaration and series of type 2 outcomes were agreed upon during the wssd the latter will outline partnerships for sustainable devel opment for ontheground action undertaken cooperatively by variety of stakeholders such as governments businesses public interest groups and others the overarching issue for the wssd is now whether greater success will result from the draft implementation plan than appeared to follow from the completion of agenda 21 in 1992 the process in 2002 produced sense of deja vu in many observers who saw re play of many of the issues and concerns that were present in the 1992 unced pr ocess there was sense among many participants that the wssd negotiations had goal of being more integrative of the three pillars of sustainabl development the economic social and environmental elements background the predecessor to the wssd the conference on environment and development known popularly as the ri earth summit was held june 314 1992 in rio janeiro brazil that date was c hosen to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the 1972 stockholm conference on the huma n environment which was the first global environmental confer ence held by the united nations the 1992 conference was product of growing in ternational concern over th global environment it provided an opportunity for national leader s to reach consensus on how to promotehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31385crs2 sustainable developmentintegratin g the linkages between environmental economic social and development priorities the broader focus reflected realization that environmental goals would be optimally achieved in the context of appropriate social nd economic development unced was the largest summit of national leaders ever held attracting well over 100 heads of state or government in addition more than 20000 people from nongovernmental organizations ngos nd various professi onal groups attended the constellation of events surrounding th conference including the very large global forum organized by ngos with da ily parallel events during the course of the unced the conference produced wide agreement on the goal of environmentally sustainable velopment but there were few specifics or definitions attached to the term in the statements and objectives in unced documents defining sustainable development in operati onal terms has remained one of the major challenges of unced followup activities the rio earth summit produced thr ee documents intended to provide recommendations and guidance for sustainabl development they were not legally binding although they were negotiated wordforword nd adopted by consensus resolution the rio declaration on environment nd development relatively short statement of 27 guiding principles that represent consensus on the basis for sustainable development

the treaty on global forest management originally sought but later opposed by the united states agenda 21 the extensive action plan that provides guidance on actions needed to bring about

review progress on specific issues iden tified in agenda 21 one product of the deliberations of the csd has been the establishment of an ongoing forum on forests that continues to negotiate

activities on specific issues to the csd for the wssd nations have submitted special reports that more broadly summarize their sustainable development activities1 treaties signed at unced climate change and biodiversity in addition two legally binding treaties were opened for si gnature at unced dealing with two of the major issues that were driving much of the concern over the global environment the convention on biologi cal diversity and the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc these treaties were negotiated in processes that were separate from but parallel to unced preparations and they are currently being implemented by countries through continuous meetings of the conference of the parties cops while the completion of these treaties was viewed by many as keystone for the success of unced they wereand they remainon parallel tracks that are not directly part of the earth summituncedwssd processes the issues addressed by these treaties are widely regarded as critical components in susta inable development and are likely to be addressed as part of the wssd agenda but the treaties themselves and their requirements were not on the agenda per although the precise wording of how nations were to be encouraged to ratify the kyoto protocol proved highly controversial ending with ag reement on this language s tates that have ratified the kyoto protocol strongly urge states th at have not already done so to ratify the united states has signed and ratified the climate change framework convention and is thus party to it the ited states has signed but not ratified the convention on biological diversity and as consequence is not party the major environmental treaty in the spotlight ce 1997 has been the kyoto protocol to the unfccc which provides for legally binding reductions by developed countries of greenhouse gas emissions related to gl obal warming concerns see crs report rl30692 global climate change th kyoto protocol president clinton signed the protocol in 1998 but did not submit it to the senate for advice and consent president bush has rejected the protocol but the other 37 nations with obligations under the protocol have declared it their goal to ratify the treaty with enough ratifications to bring it into force even without us participation earth summit 5 review of issues at the fiveyear point after unced in midjune 1997 the united nations general assembly held special session on environment and development in new york to review progress on followup to the 1992 earth summit over 50 heads of state

difficult especially on longstanding points of northsouth contention such as new and additional fina ncing for developing countries to fund the costs of implementing the recommendati ons in agenda 21 the complexity and difficulty of reaching consensus on concrete steps to achieve sustainable development was very evident at this earth summit followup session wssd key issues in december 2000 the united nations ge neral assembly passed resolution ares55199 tenyear review of progress achieved in the implementation of the outcome of the united nations conferen ce on environment and development in which it issued its decision to organize the wssd and welcomed the opportunity to hold the conference in south africa in 2002 the decision which has lengthy set of findings and statements welcoming the wo rk of various organizations also states that the summit including its prepar atory process should ensure balance between economic development soci development and environmental protection as these are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development3 the decision further stat the review should focus on the identification of accomplishments and areas where

the pro cess begun at the 1992 earth summit to open the process to participation by nongovernmental partie s and stakeholders at other sessions governments and u n agencies made presentations and identified issues that needed attention in sustainable development context these proposals were wideranging from narrow nd specific concerns such as leadfree fuels initiative to broad issues such as

structure of negotiations and of the final plan of implementation prepcom 3 word used often to descri be the situation during prepcom 3 held marchapril 2002 in new york city nd at its conclusion was disarray as it became obvious that there were serious obstacles to obtaining agreement on negotiated text hope for succe ss in johannesburg began to focus on division of goals into type 1 outcomes which would be th more conventional ne gotiated declarations and action plans and type 2 outcomes whic h would be the launching of variety of partnerships between governme nts and private sector parties between private sector entities between ngos and business and other possible partnerships type 1 outcomes while it had been expected that prepcom 3 negotiations would formulate agreedupon text in decision doc uments that would go forward to the ministeriallevel meeting in bali at prepcom 4 instead there was virtually negotiated text at the end of the meeting the chairmans paper was discussed and then very extensive compilation text was put together on the basis of commentary in the first week during the second week discussions were held on the very lengthy compilation text but the result was additional commentary for the most part agreement on specific language was not atta ined it was widely noted that budgetary restrictions contributed to the problems in reaching any agreement these restricted full negotiations to standard daytime hours per mitting just 6 hours of discussion per day and limiting nighttime negotiations the negotiations at prepcom 3 took place in three working groups which divided the issues of the chairmans pa per among them however working group 3 had responsibility for just one issue for which text had been developed in the chairmans paper governance this working group only met once for about two hours in the second week of the prepcom and simply responded to paper circulatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31385crs7 7this document and others related to the wssd can be viewed at httpwwwjohannesburgsummitorg to find recent documents click on whats newthat week by the chairman on governance text was not agreed to but reactions were presented one frequently voiced concern during the 3rd prepcom was that issues that had been agreed upon in earlier forums such as agenda 21 the forum on forests and the commission on sustainable development were being renegotiated with many old ideas once again being deliberated often ending in new stalemates type 2 outcomes attention at prepcom 3 began to focus with increasing interest on hopes that the formulation and launching of partnerships that would carry out on theground sustainable development project s and activities would create form of progress that would enliven the johannesbur g conference and be key to its success first step in formulating expectations for what would constitute appropriate such partnerships was taken by guid ance paper prepared at prepcom 37 two concerns were raised by some ngos that governme nts will abdicate their responsibilities and that many of the partnerships will be in reality greenwash that repackages old on going activities as type 2 partnerships the guidance paper notes that type 2partnershipsinitiatives are comple mentary to the globally agreed type 1 outcomes they are not intended to substitute commitments by government in the type 1 documents rather they should contribute to translating those political commitments into ac tion type 2 partnerships initiatives are of voluntary selforganizing nature unlike type 1 outcomes they are not subject to negotiations within the preparatory committee for the summit links to other conferences and institutions during 2002 number of regional and issuesfocused meetings were held that were of importance to the wssd process and agenda policymakers ga ve particular attention to the march conference on financing for development held in m onterrey mexico the announcement at that meeting of additional financ ial assistance from the united states and other countries for development was hailed as an outcome that would bode well for the success of wssd once again as at unced and the earth summit 5 conferences the issues surrounding developing countries attempts to secure commitments for financing their development were focus of discussion pr ior to and during the wssd the scope of this discussion has broadened in the year s since 1992 to encompass not only official development assistance oda but also trade foreign dir ect investment fdi and funding from the multilateral development banks mdbs and other international financial institutions ifis such as the global environment facility gef and the international monetary fund imf the united states had identified wide ra nge of wssd priorities prior to the 3rd prepcom with continuing focus on improving governance which it indicated contribute to economic growth higher living standards and social equality the six factors it identified are capacity building which includes favorable enabling climate for investment institution building which includes strengthening governmental institutions and

intensive two weeks of negotiations at which they attempted to agree on specific language in chairmans compilation text for implementation of sustainable development that reflected commentary dur ing prepcom 3 in addition discussion continued on possible guidelines or criteri for type 2 outcomespartnerships for sustainable development activities that could be launched at the wssd and subsequently press reports on the bali meeting reflected predominant sense that the meeting had been failure and that the talks had stalled however the situation was more complex than that delegates worked har d often long into the nighttime hours to wrestle with the usual problems in reaching agreement on the text of the type 1 document that is to express the actions needed to improve implementation of the rio decisions they succeeded in reaching agr eement on some 73 of the text in the chairmans compilation however the remaining 27 of the text dealt with such polarizing issues as financing from developed countries to assi st developing count ries good governance capacity building whether there should be specified targets and timetables for achievement of the specific sustainable development goals and other issues such as the precautionary principle whether action should be taken on difficult issues even in the absence of definitive scientific evidence in particular there was dissatisfaction among the g77 the general term used for the loose collaborative group of the developing countries with the trade and financing issues so developed country delegations reported that there was wish to reopen the discussions on trade that were concluded in the most recent world trade organization wto ministerial meeting in doha qatar nd the discussions on financ concluded in monterrey mexico in march of this year better access to developed count ry markets and more financial assistance with fe wer conditions were the goals that developing countries reportedly would like to establish many of these issues were resolved at the rio earth summit with highly nuanced language but the operational followthrough has remained problematic the result is that these issues have resurfaced durin g the wssd preparations with resulting gridlock primarily between developed and developi ng country delegations summary of the wssd outcomes some 100 heads of state including mo st of those from europe attended the wssd president bush declined to attend the us delegation was headed by secretary of state colin powell during the highest level segments of the conference the decisions of the participating nations largely reaffirmed the approaches and decisions reflected in agenda 21 of the 1992 earth summit as well as those articulated in recent decisions in other arenas such as the doha nisterial trade meeting in 2001 and the monterrey conference on financ ing for development in march 2002 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31385crs9 8httpwwwjohannesburgsummitorg these outcomes are found under whats new on this website 9statement of paula j dobriansky undersecreta ry of state for global affairs at the world continuedas was the case with the 1992 agenda 21 of the rio earth summit neither the wssd plan of implementation nor the political declaration are legally binding or mandatory they are collection of decisions that essentially outline desirable actions that participants agree to encourage and promote thus the goals and timetables announced at the summit are described as commitments but in fact are not legally obligatory the key outcomes of the summit as described by the official website of the wssd8 included reaffirming sustainable development as central element of the international agenda and new impetus to global action to fight poverty and protect the environment the linkage between povert the environment and good management of natural resources was highlighted in the wssd plan of implementation and governments agreed to and reaffirmed wide range of concrete commitments and targets for action to achieve more effective implementation of sustainable development objectives energy water and sanitation concerns were highlighted as well specifically the plan of implementation outlines the goal of halving by 2015 the proportion of the worlds people whose in comes are below 1 day and who suffer from hunger reaffirming the millennium velopment goals agreed by the general assembly another of these goals is to halve by the year 2015 the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation on energy renewable energy was focus with encouragement to nations to diversity energy supply and increase the global share of rene wable energy to improve access to reliable affordable and environmentally sound energy services and resources to encourage energy efficiency through domestic pr ograms supported by the international community and to remove market distortions together with providing better functioning and more tran sparent energy markets other important areas in which initiatives and commitments were identified were chemical management and safety manageme nt of the natural resource base including large number of goals for water oceans and fisheries the atmosphere biodiversity and forests health including reduction of mortality rates for infants and children and reducing hiv prevalence and other diseases sustainable devel opment for africa and for small island developing states means of implementation includi ng reaffirming the doha agreement for trade and an emphasis on education and the institutional framework for sustainable development in addition the concept of type 2 outco mes in the form of partnerships between governments business and civil society was major focus of attention at the summit over 220 partnerships representing some 235 million in resources were identified in advance of the summit with an add itional 60 partnerships announced during the summit by number of

runup to the wssd and in johanne sburg the united states was the subject of criticism in the press and among some participants for objecting to targets and timetables in several issue areas for emphasizing good governance which seemed to some to be an infringement on sovereignty and for failing to make general commitments on financing and trad in addition to those involved in the doha trade meeting and the monterrey financing for velopment meeting on the other hand the united states fielded large delegation of experts in number of the environmental and economic issues under discussion nd this delegation worked with other participantsboth governmental and non governmentalto successfully fashion initiatives and reach agreement on th more controversial issues in the end despite fears that the joha nnesburg meeting would be failure agreement was reached and success was declared it is unclear to what extent the followthrough for this meeting will differ or be more effective than that following the rio earth summit of 1992 the extremely broad range of issues in itself poses major challenges to meaningful outcomes that go beyond rhetoric however as was repeatedly pointed out the concept of stainable development has become widely accepted and though still poorly defined clearly now includes extensive consideration of how the many elements of economic ac tivity interact and how they could avoid some of the social and envir onmental problems of the pasthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31385crs11 conclusions as followup to the world summit on sustainable development begins the wssd plan of implementation represents th outcome of another major effort in the ongoing process of trying to find ways in which economic activ ity and development in all countries industrialized as well as less developed nations can be made more environmentally and socially sustainable the underlying concept of sustainability holds that economic growth and progress need to take into account the social environmental financial and other fact ors that may produce sideeffects that can undermine the longterm viability of that growth and progress if the economic development process can successfully integrate the many and sometimes conflicting goals of society without undermin ing often unintentionally one or more of them then that would re sult in sustainable development the experience of the past ten years has shown th at attaining such result is fraught with complexities that so far have proven extremely difficult to resolve these are the challenges that once again the nations of the world will face in obtaining concrete results from the decisions at the wssd
