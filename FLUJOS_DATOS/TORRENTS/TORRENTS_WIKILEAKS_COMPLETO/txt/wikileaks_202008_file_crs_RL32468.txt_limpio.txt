frequently asked questions and provide essential facts and figures about the defense budget it includes figures from the presidents fiscal year fy 2005 budget request and provides brief analyses of recent and historical trends in the defense budget each frequently asked question about the defense budget falls within one of the following four sections in this report 1 trends in defense spending over time from world war ii through ombs fy2009 budget projections questions 1 2 3 and 4 2 the impact of defense on the economy questions 5 6 and 7 3 costs of wars and supplemental appropriations questions 8 and 9 4 trends in force structure questions 10 11 and 12 the fifth section of the report consists of additional data tables with historical budget authority and outlay figures and glossary of frequently used budget terms most of the figures used in this report are taken from annual budget documents prepared by the office of management and budget omb1 it is important to note that omb figures for budget authority and outlays through fy2004 include both regular and supplemental appropriations as result budget authority and outlay totals for fy2003 and fy2004 which included significant supplemental appropriations are sometimes larger than totals for fy2005 which represent the presidents fy2005 request and do not include any fy2005 supplemental appropriations in addition please note that the budget authority and estimated outlay figures for the presidents fy2005 request include the 25 billion budget amendment for iraq and afghanistan submitted by the president to congress on may 12 2004 outlay estimates provided by the congressional budget office cbo for the 25 billion amendment are added to omb outlay projections for fy2006 fy2009 included in this report please note as well that all figures provided for fy2006 through fy2009 in this report are either omb cbo or department of defense projections and represent neither congressional appropriations nor the presidents request 1 most figures are from the office of management and budget budget of the united states government fiscal year 2005 historical tables february 2004 crs2 key budget terminology the federal budget has its own unique vocabulary basic understanding of which is essential to understand the significance of defense budget figures and trends the following budget terms which will be used often in this report are frequently used yet sometimes misunderstood budget authority obligations and outlays when congress appropriates money it provides agencies with budget authority budget authority gives an agency the legal authority to obligate money for the provision of goods or services appropriations are the most common but not the only type of budget authority2 obligations then occur for example when agencies enter into contracts submit purchase orders and employ personnel when those obligations are liquidated or in simpler terms when the check is written and the performance of an obligation is paid for outlays occur the term defense spending technically refers to outlays although budget authority and outlays are frequently confused in budget discussions the 050 vs the 051 budget function the federal budget is divided into several functions including the national defense budget function or 050 function the 050 function consists of three subfunctions department of defense 051 atomic energy defense activities 053 and defenserelated activities in other agencies 054 thus national defense spending consists of more than just the department of defenses annual expenditures although the majority of the 050 function consists of the department of defense 051 function the 050 function also consists of billions of dollars 1675 billion in fy2004 appropriated to the department of energy for atomic energy defense activities this report contains figures for both the 050 and 051 functions depending on which is most useful to the reader current and constant dollars the cost of goods or services in current dollars is the value of such goods or services in terms of prices current at the time of purchase for example fy1985 national defense outlays in current dollars represent the amount spent on national defense in fy1985 according to what the dollar was worth in fy1985 current dollars may also be referred to as thenyear dollars the cost of goods or services in constant dollars is the value adjusted to eliminate the effects of changes in prices usually due to inflation constant dollars expressed in terms of particular reference year normally the current budget year 2 other types include borrowing authority and contract authority for further explanation of these terms see allen schick the federal budget politics policy process washington dc brookings institution press 2000 crs3 are determined by dividing current dollars by deflator based on the prices in the reference year constant dollars are used to measure the growth rates of programs over time independently of the effects of inflation for this reason figures in this report measuring trends in the defense budget use constantdollar figures discretionary and mandatory spending within the federal budget budget authority is classified as either discretionary or mandatory generally budget authority is discretionary if provided by congress in appropriations acts and mandatory if provided in permanent authorizing law examples include social security medicare and federal employee retirement however portion of mandatory budget authority including medicaid and certain veterans programs is funded in annual appropriations acts discretionary budget authority must be renewed annually while most mandatory budget authority is available automatically each year without legislative action by congress outlays are also classified as discretionary or mandatory according to the classification of the budget authority from which they flow part i trends in defense spending over time the following section questions 1 2 3 and 4 provides figures and an analysis of trends in defense spending over time question 1 what are the recent historic and projected trends in

outlays for the 25 billion budget amendment for iraq and afghanistan are included in fy2005fy2009 outlay figures crs4 figure 1 shows the pattern of budget authority and outlays since world war ii since 1947 there have been four periods of significant increases in budget authority and outlays the korean war the vietnam war the reagan era military buildup and the post911 defense spending increases each period to date has been followed by period of significant decreases in budget authority and outlays following the end of the cold war and the disappearance of the soviet threat some observers believed that this cyclical pattern in budget authority and outlays would end with long or even permanent decline in defense spending3 however the events of september 11 2001 and the subsequent wars in afghanistan iraq and the ongoing global war on terrorism ended the decline in budget authority and outlays that had continued through most of the 1990s figure 2 shows recent trends in budget authority and outlays from fy1997 through projected totals for fy2009 table 1 below shows budget authority and outlays in current and constant fy2005 dollars for both the national defense

military personnel operations and maintenance om and research development test and evaluation rdte tables 2 3 and 4 list recent budget authority in current year and constant year dollars and outlay

overall increases and decreases in national defense budget authority since fy2002 budget authority for each appropriations title has increased sharply in part as result of the wars in iraq and afghanistan and enhanced security for defense installations supplemental appropriations in fy2003 and fy2004 were crs8 major cause of the sharp increases in military personnel and om budget authority

almost 75 of total discretionary outlays in fy1962 to just under 50 of total discretionary outlays in fy2003 this steady decline was interrupted significantly by the reagan buildup of the 1980s during which time defense discretionary outlays rose from 501 of total discretionary outlays in fy1981 to 62 in fy1987 since fy1995 defense discretionary outlays have remained between 47 and 50 of total discretionary outlays although this percentage has increased from 471 in fy2001 to 497 in fy2004 under current projections defense will rise to 514 of total discretionary outlays by fy2009 crs14 part ii the impact of defense on the economy the following section questions 5 6 and 7 looks at the impact of defense on the economy measured in terms of defense outlays and federal outlays as percentage of gross domestic product gdp and compares us defense outlays to those of foreign countries question 5 what are the historical trends in us defense outlays as percentage of gross domestic product gdp figure 6 gdp and defenses share of gdp fy1962fy2005 constant fy2005 dollars in trillions percent of gdp source gdp deflators and figures from the office of management and budget historical tables budget of the united states government fiscal year 2005 february 2004 httpwww whitehousegovombbudgetfy2005pdfhistpdf pp 128 184 advocates of higher defense spending frequently cite defenses declining percentage of gdp to argue that the nation can afford more for defense these observers note that even with recent increases defense spending is still at relatively low levels historically as percentage of gdp as shown in figure 6 whereas defense spending reached 95 of gdp in fy1968 and 62 of gdp in fy1986 at the height of the reagan buildup it equaled only 39 of gdp in fy20045 others counterargument however is that defense spending as percentage of gdp is as much dependent on the level of gdp growth as it is dependent on the level of defense spending growth since 1962 gdp has grown 306 in real terms while 5 see table 12 in the appendix for the data that correspond to figures 6 and 7 crs15 defense outlays have risen 30 during the same period6 therefore some say the story of defenses decline as percentage of gdp is as much story of the rapid growth of the us economy as it is story of declining defense spending question 6 what are the historical trends in different categories of federal spending as percentage of gdp it should be noted that the trend in defense outlays is part of broader longterm trend in the federal budget in which both defense and nondefense discretionary outlays have declined as shares of gdp while mandatory outlays have increased as figure 7 below shows total federal spending has been remarkably stable at about 20 of gdp over the past
