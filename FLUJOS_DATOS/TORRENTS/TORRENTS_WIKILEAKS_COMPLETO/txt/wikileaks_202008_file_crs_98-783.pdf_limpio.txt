between the united states mexico and canada went into effect in january 1994 there is continuing debate over whether it has resulted in job gains or job losses before nafta estimates were that the trade agreement could result in maximum of one million job shifts among sectors over naftas entire 1015year implementation period1 in its first five and onehalf years nafta has primarily served to accelerate trade plant relocation and sectoral job gain and job loss trends that were already ongoing before nafta federal agency documented specific job losses from imports or plant relocations to mexico or canada only anecdotal estimates were available these statistical gaps make naftas effects difficult to isolate because it is virtually impossible to discern job effects from nafta this report is really about job effects since nafta moreover jobeffect estimates included in this report were developed by different agencies using divergent methods are arguably incomplete and may not capture all of the sectoral job gains or job losses but they attempt to present arguments and data so far during little more than naftas first five and onehalf years from january 1 1994 september 28 1999 nearly 260000 primary jobs were certified by the department of labor dol in 2346 plants as potentially threatened by increased imports from or plant relocations to mexico or canada two industries apparel and electronics accounted for about 40 of the nafta certifications according to recent reports by the department of labor perhaps 20 30 of those workers certified may actually have collected benefits others certified may never actually have lost their jobs or may have found new jobs before beginning to collect benefits additional job losses may have occurred outside of these figures these potential job losses are balanced by an estimated nearly 710000 net job gains in the economy from increased exports to mexico and canada since nafta took effect this represents nearly 5 of the 15 million jobs created in the us economy over the same period of time it may also account for about 98 of the 697000 jobs gained in manufacturing over the same period of time since slightly more than half of all jobs supporting exports to mexico and canada are in the manufacturing sector httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98783contents overall job effects under nafta 1 estimates of job gains since nafta 3

trends after 5½ years five and onehalf years after the north american free trade agreement nafta between the united states mexico and canada went into effect january 1 1994 there is continuing debate over whether the trade agreement has resulted in net job gains or job losses before nafta estimates were that it could result in maximum of one million job shifts among sectors over naftas entire 1015 year implementation period economists believe that overall and in the long run trade in general and nafta in particular results in neither net job gains nor net job losses only in reallocations from less efficient to more efficient industries jobeffect estimates included in this report were developed by different methods are arguably incomplete and may not capture all of the sectoral job gains or job losses nevertheless the purpose of this report is to present sort out and explain the arguments and data so far overall job effects under nafta when discussing job effects under nafta most economists emphasize that both production shifts caused by lowering of trade barriers and resulting job dislocations are an intermediate step to greater productivity greater real income and higher standard of living the effects of nafta will take many years to become fully manifest under nafta trade barriers are being reduced gradually over 1015 years and resulting dynamic gains from trade and accompanying job effects will continue for all three countries particularly as the mexican economy evolves in this report estimates of job gains cover naftas first five years estimates of potential job losses cover bit more than naftas first five and onehalf years in its first five and onehalf years nafta has primarily served to accelerate trade plant relocation and sectoral job gain and job loss trends that were already ongoing before nafta was approved however federal agency systematically docume nted specific job losses from imports or plant relocations to mexico or canada only anecdotal estimates were available between 1986 and 1993 for example an estimated 25000 jobs in electronics 20000 jobs in transportation and 17000 jobs in apparel production moved to mexico2 meanwhile expanding exports to mexico supported increasing numbers of us jobs an estimatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98783crs2 3us department of commerce economics and statistics administration us jobs supported by

estimates are available hard data still are difficult to come by in addition because it is virtually impossible to discern job effects from nafta this report is really about job effects since nafta one more point about overall job effects under nafta economists argue that since total us employment as well as us manufacturing employment increased by about 15 million jobs in the 19941998 period any job losses under nafta have in the aggregate been more than made up for by job gains in other industries job effects since nafta depend on trade effects table 1 shows changes in trade with mexico and canada during naftas first five years trade data at the industry level are included in the appendix table 6 since nafta went into effect exports to and imports from canada have each increased by roughly 55 this suggests little net job effects from trade with canada imports from mexico however have increased about one and onehalf times as much as exports to mexico this suggests some sectoral job losses from production shifts to mexico however since about twothirds of the increase in imports from mexico is covered by an increase in exports to that country net job effects over naftas first five and one half years are estimated to be relatively small table 1 us commodities exports imports and trade balance with mexico and canada 1993 1998 in millions 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 mexico

represent negative balanceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98783crs3 estimates of job gains since nafta how great have the sectoral job gains been during naftas first five years the department of commerce doc under contract with the university of maryland used an inputoutput model incorporating outputperworker ratios for each subindustry to estimate jobs added to the economy when output for any given sector increases this model has been used to calculate the average number of jobs supported by each billion dollars worth of exports to mexico and canada for each year since nafta went into effect the resulting figures can be used to produce two separate estimates on job gains in the us economy from increased trade with mexico and canada since nafta the two estimates are gross job gains and net job gains which are mitigated by product ivity increases both sets of figures are presented in table 2 columns 6 and 7 on the following page table 2 in addition to showing estimates of job gains from new trade with mexico and canada since nafta went into effect also includes other data from which these job gains were derived in table 2 columns 2 and 3 list the value of total exports to mexico and canada combined and new exports for each year since nafta went into effect column 4 includes figures from the doc model the number of jobs supporting each billion dollars worth of exports to nafta partners for the various years this is number which declines each year because of productivity changes column 5 lists total jobs supported by merchandise exports to nafta partners for the respective years columns 6 as mentioned above reflects gross jobs that is the value of new exports in billions column 3 times the number of jobs supporting each billion dollars worth of exports column 4 column 7 reflects net jobs which represents added jobs from increased exports for given year minus jobs lost over the year from increases in productivity for any year this is calculated as the column 5 figure minus the column 5 figure for the previous year estimates of the total net number for jobs created from new exports to mexico and canada since nafta went into effect 709988 represent about 5 of the 15 million jobs created in the us economy over the same time the overall job gain figures are not sorted by specific industries because the department of commerce does not publish annual figures showing by industry the number of jobs supported by each billion dollars worth of exports however table 3 shows the major industries of increased exports to mexico and canada since nafta went into effect table 3 shows that most of the export gain and therefore most of the presumed job gains since nafta went into effect would be expected in three manufacturing industries transportation equipment eg auto and some parts manufacturing electronics and nonelectric machinery including computers however productivity gains in these industries may eliminate any actual net job gains in these industrieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98783crs4 table 2 estimates of gross and net jobs created each year from increased exports to mexico and canada since nafta 1 yearvalue of merchandise exports to nafta

source doc office of trade and economic analysis indicates industries that are also prominent in table 4 which lists major industries of nafta taa certification in anticipation of possible job losshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98783crs5 4an example helps illustrate if there is trade balance then exports equal imports subsequent trade deficit means either that net imports have increased or net exports have decreased if net imports have increased then extra imported goods consumed in the united states are being made abroad in jobs held by workers in other countries some would argue that these specific jobs held by foreigners are actually us jobs foregone gone to other countries before they were able to become us jobs and thus have identifiable us victims however not all these imported goods represent jobs that could be held in the united states for two reasons first because countries tend to import goods that are relatively costly to produce domestically and to export goods which they can produce most efficiently imported goods in all likelihood could not be produced as cheaply at home therefore if the imports were not available us consumers would presumably buy lower additional quantity of domestically produced goods which would employ smaller number of additional workers in the united states than are employed abroad in manufacturing the actual level of extra goods produced for import into the united states second if the united states is at full employment when there is trade deficit as is currently the case then there would be limited supply of available workers to shift into domestic production of these goods however some unknown number of workers would likely be willing and able to shift into jobs producing these import substitutes if wages were greater than in their current employment and if their education and training qualified them for the jobs their shifting would leave other less desirable jobs unfilled difficulty of making estimates of job losses since nafta some analysts have tried to count sectoral job losses under nafta by applying the doc average table 2 column 4 numbers of jobs supporting each 1 billion of exports to imports or to net imports ie trade deficits for the respective years however this methodology is not correct trade deficits cannot be used to measure net job losses because there are net job losses as long as output and employment continue to rise new imports are just added to domestic output and not substituted for it trade deficits therefore do not reflect aggregate jobs lost but rather at most some job gains foregone which have identifiable victims in sectors affected by trade4 nor can trade deficits be used to measure specific job losses in various industries this is because at even the most detailed industry levels job losses in one operation may be balanced by job gains from increased exports or domestic demand in another thus many specific job losses are hidden in subindustries this is not to say the job losses do not exist they are very real and perhaps more accurately counted directly and tallied up by industry however attempting to do this unveils other problems although the department of labor regularly publishes the number of job certifications potential job losses from trade with mexico and canada since nafta it does not publish the actual number of job losses in various industries which may vary as proportion of certifications from industry to industryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98783crs6 5us department of commerce economics and statistics administration us jobs supported by goods and services exports 198392 p 13 suggests that approximately two additional jobs support each manufacturing job by producing intermediate inputs capital goods and transportation and other services to the goods to markethow great have certified job losses been under nafta the department of labor dol certifies potential job losses from trade with mexico and canada under the naftatransitional adjustment assistance taa program the certification identifies those eligible for training or income replacement benefits because imports are expected to contribute importantly to the potential for job loss or the plant is relocating to mexico or canada hence nafta certifications cover an unknown number of actual job losses which are subset of total job losses from nafta the nafta certifications include only those job losses for which the worker or an employer applied for certification and direct linkage to trade with or shift in production to mexico of canada can be verified however naftataa certification figures may overestimate job losses among certified workers not all workers certified actually lose their jobs rather certification numbers represent the total number of workers at the plant which has applied for certification data from the department of labor suggest that as few as 2030 of the certified workers actually collect naftataa benefits therefore the others certified may either actually not have lost their jobs may have found another job in lieu of needing benefits or for other reasons may not have collected benefits the dol has certified roughly 259618 job losers from 2179 plants under the naftataa program in little more than five and onehalf years january 1 1994 september 28 1999 these potential job losers are distributed by industry in table 4 and by state in table 5 common question relates to the identity of naftarelated job losers outside the naftataa subset other workers whose job losses may be related to nafta include the following major groups 1 primary job losers who for some reason either did not apply for naftataa benefits or b applied and were rejected because they did not meet the criteria for certification eg imports from mexico or canada contributed somewhat rather than importantly to their job loss 2 secondary job losers who typically equal about twice the number of primary job losers in supplier or distributor industries who did not apply or were not approved for nafta taa benefits5 and 3 other job losers whose job loss is less directly related to nafta and who did not apply or were not eligible for nafta benefitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98783crs7 6case refers to group of workers applying for nafta certification it may represent plant or production operation 7declining industries are typically those at the end of their product life cycle concept authored by economist raymond vernon he hypothesized that as each product moves through its natural life cycle from fledgling product requirin g constant research development and refining to mature product with standardized technology it likely experiences changes in the geographical location of its production after production technologies are perfected the product can be manufactured wherever production and distribution costs are lowest this frees scarce labor resources for work on other newly emerging

identifies major industries of increased exports and high up on table 4 which lists industries of potential job loss from new trade with mexico and canada in descending order suggests that certain portions of the same industries are declining and relocating to mexico or canada while other parts are increasing their exports industries included in both tables 3 and 4 are listed in bold typeface and marked with an asterisk longerterm output and employment projections have been included in table 4 columns 4 and 5 because some observers argue that if nafta were repealed both output and jobs could be preserved in the united states since merchandise exports to mexico and canada combined represent only about 27 of us gdp repeal of nafta would likely have very little effect on these longerterm trends in most industries8 these trends show clearly that even though output is expected to increase in most industries employment is not expected to increase appreciably

manufacturing jobs in the us economy has more than made up for nafta job losses between january 1994 and june 1999 manufacturing employment grew by 478000 jobs or about 26 to what extent will naftarelated job gains occur in the manufacturing sector in the coming decade as mentioned briefly earlier in this report productivity gains in manufacturing are expected to greatly mitigate job opportunities in this sector little future job growth is expected in any of the four industries that currently account for 63 of manufacturing exports to mexico and canada table 4 column 8

landscape although manufacturings real inflation adjusted output as percent of real gdp has remained relatively stable manufacturings employment level and employment share has been shrinking between 1972 and 1998 manufacturing lost 2 of its jobs while its share of total us jobs declined from 26 to 15 productivity growth and downsizing have helped some manufacturing industries become more competitive in the international marketplace between 1992 and 1997 manufacturing employment has actually grown by 3 in the future however as manufacturing employment continues to shrink from additional productivity gains most employm ent gains elsewhere in the economy that balance out small naftarelated job losses will tend to occur in non manufacturing sectorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98783crs12 in conclusion the estimates reported here provide mediumterm perspective on possible traderelated effects since nafta an analysis of the complete employment effects from nafta must include many more years of data and more comprehensive analysis an accurate assessment of employment effects under nafta would have to separate out from raw data such nonnafta influences as business cycles productivity growth prenaftatrends and postnafta fluctuations in currencieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98783crs13 table 6 appendix data on trade with mexico and canada
