state s attorney appointed to investigate allegations of police brutality committed against certain detainees during the early 1980s concluded that in three instances indi ctable aggravated battery perjury and obstruction of justice had occurred but that the 3year illinois statute of limitations barred prosecution media accounts howev er have suggested the possibility of federal prosecution

the 5year federal statute of limitations is not likely to prove any more forgiving that the illinois law federal law however does recognize longer period of limitation for certain conspiracies and racketeering offenses yet it is unclear whether either of the exceptions is available federal authorities have appare ntly examined the question on several occasions in the past and declined to

connection with the investigation of the murder of two police officers report at 45 the arresting officers allegedly brutalized wilson beating him burning him subjecting him to electric shocks and threatening him with gun until he confessed report at 467 the commanding officer of the ar ea 2 violent crime unit was purportedly present during much of the time and was said to have administered some of the mistreatment id at 1000 in the evening wilson was taken to hospital after officers at the lockup refused to take cust ody of him because of his condition3 after the escorting officers remarked that he would refuse treatment if he knew what was good for him he was examined at about 1115 pm by dr geo ffrey korn dr korn later testified that he made note of some 15 separate injuries th at were apparent on the defendants head chest and right leg two cuts on the defendants forehead and one on the back of his head required stitches the defendants right eye had been blackened and there was bleeding on the surface of that eye dr korn also observed bruises on the defendants chest and veral linear abrasions or burns on the defendants chest shoulder and chin area finally dr korn saw on the defendants right thigh an abrasion from seconddegree burn it was six inches long and 1 Â½ to 2 inches wide4 wilson was subsequently convicted for the murder of the two officers and sentenced to death but the illinois s upreme court overturne d the conviction on appeal because the state had failed to monstrate that wilsons confession was not coerced5 he was retried convicted second time and sentenced to life imprisonment his conviction and sentence were affirmed6 and his federal habeas corpus petition denied7 wilson sued the three officers the supe rintendent of police and the city under 42 usc 1983 based on allegations of hi s mistreatment and u ltimately settled with the city8 after being awarded damages and attorneys fees at trial against the commanding officer9 the office of professional st andards investigation of the allegations of brutality led to the commanding officers suspension in november 1991 and following police board hearing his dismissal in 1992 report at 153httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33592crs3 10 the suit was filed in 1986 and depositions taken in december 1987 report at 267 11 the office had earlier initiated an investigation november 7 1984 to 1985 which it closed based in part upon lack of cooperation on the part of adkins report at 266the commanding officer denied mistrea ting wilson at the suppression hearing november 9 1982 in depos itions relating to the civil litigation 1988 1989 and at the hearing before the police board which nevertheless found the three had tortured wilson fired the commander and suspended the other two officers in 1992 report at 2829 44 49 he seems likely to have denied them to investigators during various office of professional standards investigations th last of which apparently occurred in november 1991 report at 153 and during interviews with the special states attorneys office sometime between 2001 and 2006 report at 15 phillip adkins adkins was arrested on june 7 1984 in connection with an armed

hospitalized in th intensive caretrauma ward on june 8 and june 9 and discharged on june 10 report at 271 adkins successfully sued the officers and the city in federal court and the city settled for 25000 report at 26710 thereafter the chicago office of professi onal standards conducte d an investigation may 4 1993 to december 16 1993 that concl uded that officers had in fact beaten adkins report at 26611 alfonzo pinex pinex was arrested on june 28 1985 in connection with murder charge report at 276 his statement while in custody was suppressed for failure to honor his miranda rule rights report at 27677 the court declin ed to address the question of whether the statement was the product of beating report at 277 charges against pinex were dismissed and he sued lleging that two officers in detective area 2 had beaten him to secure his c onfession while he was in custody id the city settled for 5000 on november 1 1991 id related matters the report addresses several other instances where detainees complained that they were beaten by officers of detective area 2 in each instance the report concludes that there is lack of creditabl evidence sufficient to convict the officers in question report at 178 182 202 24041 264 the report also considers the possibility of charges against those purported to have covered up the misconduc t of others at detective area 2 it observes that we have found evidence that would support charge beyond reasonable doubt of obstruction of justice or coverup by any police personnel there is insufficient evidence of wrongdoing by any member of the

when he testified about the sequence of events leading up to the courtreported confession of andrew wilson then the claim of andrew wilson that he had been abused before he gave that confession would be seriously undercut if on the other hand he was not lling the truth his false testimony would stand as strong corroboration of andrew wilson he has testified on the motion to suppress and before the jury that convicted wilson and sentenced him to death he was named in the federal civil rights action brought by andrew wilson his depositi on was taken and he testified in both civil trials he also testified as witness on behalf of the police commander in the police board hearing in 1992 in our judgment he did not tell the truth when he denied that he had been told by andrew wilson that he had been tortured by detectives report at 534 the report does not indicate that its authors would seek to indict and convict the prosecutor but for impediment of the statute of limitations nor does it speak to the weight of any evidence that might support charges of perjury or obstruction of justice against the prosecutor finally the report comments that the evidence supports the conclusion that the superintendent of police was guilty of dereliction of duty and did not act in good faith in the investigation of the claim of andrew wilson report at 17 it makes comment on the existence or we

sufficient to support civil rights convi ction for violation of 18 usc 242 federal perjury charges cannot be predi cated upon false statements made during illinois judicial and administrative proceed ings but the same false statements may have been made under oath in connection with the federa l civil rights suits brought by wilson and adkins statements that nied wilson and adkins were beaten while in police custody if perjurious in illinois proceedings were likely perjurious in federal proceedings moreover evidence of such false statements made to internal police and other state

jurisdiction of federal department or agency25 or 18 usc 1512 obstructing disclosure of federal crime to federal authorities by decep tion of potential witness26 until recently it might have been possible to argue that the use of violence or the threat of violence by w enforcement authorities to coerce prisoners to relinquish their constitutional rights constituted prohi bited extortion under the hobbs act and as rico predicate the supreme courts decision in scheidler v now seems to preclude such construction scheidler held that hobbs act extortion does not include the use of violence or the threat of violence to restrict anothers freedom ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33592crs8 27 scheidler v now 537 us 393 400409 2002extortion as understood by section 1951s drafters involves the acquisition or deprivation of property and contrasts with coercion which is essentially extortion wit hout this property element the extortion claimed in scheidler was the use of violence or the th reat of violence directed against abortion clinics in order to force others to give up property rights namely womans right to seek medical services from clinic the right of doctors nurses and other clinic staff to perform their jobs and the right to clinics to provide medical services free from wrongful threats 537 us at 400401 28 537 us at 410 where as here the model penal code and majority of the states recognize the crime of extortion as requiring party to obtain or to seek to obtain property as the hobbs act requires the state extorti on offense for purposes of rico must have similar requirement 29 eg diaz v gates 420 f3d 897 9th cir 2005 guerrero v gates 110 fsupp2d 1287 cdcal 2000 30 diaz v gates 354 f3d 1169 1170 9th cir 2004allegations of kidnaping and witness tampering

violate the rico provisi ons however is separate offense 18 usc 1962daction27 moreover scheidler holds that the same defin ition of extortion applies the generic reference to state extortion laws in the rico predicate list28 the ninth circuit appears to have recognized the general possibility of rico prosecution in cases involving charges of police misconduct29 the cases there however involved allegations of wider range of predicate offenses principally involved an issue critical in civil rico cases but not relevant for purposes of criminal rico prosecution and have yet to resolve the question of whether the requisite elements of rico have been sa tisfied the cases which grew out of the socalled ramparts scandal alleged that various officers had committed kidnaping extortion witness tampering drug dealing and attempted murder30 they focused primarily on the type of injuries for which civil rico plaintiff has standing to recover damages31 as for the possibility of rico prosecution based on crimes implicated here civil rights violations of 18 usc 242 are not rico predicate offenses 18 usc 19611 neither are violations of 18 us c 1001 false statements of 18 usc 1621 perjury nor of 18 usc 371 conspiracy 18 usc 1961132 violations of 18 usc 1512 however are rico predicate offenses 18 usc 19611b in order to establish rico violation in th is context the government would have to prove that the commander andor various officers of area 2 conducted the activities of an enterprising affecting interstate commerce either the area 2 violent crime section or the informal association of the officers dedicated to the use of brutality to punish and obtain coerced confessions from so of those in their custody through the patterned commission of violations of 18

occurring prior to that date the three cases the report found prosecutable but for the statute of limitations at best involve conduct straddling november 10 1986 the denials of mistreatment to state

section 1512 was added as rico predicate november 10 1986 provides beginning line prior violati on of section 1512 may be used as rico predicate offense there may also be question as to the end line it is not at all clear that section 1512b3 covers situa tions where deceit is used to prevent disclosure of information to federal authorities concerning federal crimes for which the statute of limitations has expired thus it may be that violations of section 1512b3 occurred with respect to denials made more than five years after the alleged civil rights violations on fe bruary 14 1982 wilson june 7 1984 adkins or june 28 1985 pinex on the other hand here we have alleged civil rights violations followed by series of denials themselves purportedly constituting violations of federal perjury and false statement statut court might conclude that the end line should be marked at five year s after the penultimate instance of perjury or false statement cealed within more recent denial upon which section 1512 charge may be based in the context of the wilson case for example section 1512 may permit the prosecution of any denial occurring within five years of false statements made concerning the 1982 civil rights violation during testimony at the 1992 police board hearing then there is the question of patte rn rico prosecution requires the government to establish not only qualified predicate offens but to prove that they were committed as part of pattern the supreme court has explained that person cannot be subjected to rico sanctions simply for committing two widely separate and isolated criminal offenses instead the term pattern itself requires the showing of relationship between the predicates and of the threat of continuing activity it is this factor of continuity plus relationship which combines to produce pattern36 predicate acts are related if they have the same or similar purposes results participants victims or methods of commission or ot

series of predicate offenses that is continuing or bears the threat of continuation open ended the government can satisfy the continuity prong either by 1 demonstrating closeended series of conduct that existed for such an extended period time that threat of future harm is implicit or 2 an openended series of conduct that while shor tlived shows clear signs of thr eatening to continue into the future38 the report highlights three cases each arising at least year apart from the others and involving three different sets of officers nevertheless each is an instance where officers of area 2 under the same commanding officer are alleged to have brutalized detainees in police custody regularly denied wrongdoing and offered explanations that the report does not find creditable of course the civil rights violations are not the alleged rico predicates the rico predicates are instead the alleged violations of section 1512 in th form of denials and fabrications to investigators and in state proceedings and federal depositions more numerous than the underlying civil rights violations they benefit and suffer from the same relationship analysis they are relativel isolated instances involving different officers but arising out of the same environment reflecting common means and purpose even if court should find the cases fficiently related for rico purposes the question of continuity may still prove troubling the ac tionable obstructions appear to run from the depositions taken in adkins civil case in 1987 to the depositions in wilsons civil litigation in 1988 and 1989 and include statements in pinexs civil litigation in 1991 testimony in the wilson police board hearing in 1992 and possibly statements to investigators in th office of professiona l standards adkins investigation that ended in december 16 1993 the duration of the activity would seem sufficient but the comparatively few instances relatively isolated in time and circumstance may bring into question whethe r the events can accurate be seen as the evidence of the continuous existe nce of single enterprise statute of limitations as noted earlier federal crimes are generally subject to 5year statute of limitations 18 usc 3282 the civil rights violations of which the report speaks occurred in 1982 1984 and 1985 the report indicates that with the exception of its own interviews for which it

professional standards investigation ended report at 266 the report argues that the illinois statute of limitations pr ecludes state prosecution report at 16httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33592crs11 39 the report notes that some of those who claimed to have been the victims of police abuse articulated comparable theory 1 all the police officers at areas 2 and 3 who have been accused by any of the claimants had enga ged in single conspiracy even before the arrest of the claimants to ex tract confessions from the claima nts by force if necessary and at the same time 2 conspire to obstruct justice and to commit perjury by testifying falsely at the trials of the claimants and 3 at any possible future proceedings such as those involving postconviction petitions or federal habeas corpus hearings 4 conspiracy to obstruct justice and to commit perjury may be barred by the statute of limitations but subsequent overt act will resuscitate it 5 th original conspiracy to commit armed violence in each case is part of continuing conspiracy that still exists 6 it is conceded that the evidence to support finding of general conspiracy is all circumstantial report at 21 40 united states

tion of the facts in lower court opinion united states v grunewald 233 f2d 556 2d cir 1956 43 the government urges that even if the main object fo the conspiracy was to obtain decisions from the bureau of internal revenue not to institute criminal tax prosecutions the indictments alleged and the proofs showe d that the conspiracy also included as subsidiary element an agreement to conceal the c onspiracy to fix these tax cases to the end that the conspirators would escape detection and punishment for the crime says thewhile citing the earlier conclusions of fe deral authorities media accounts at the time the report was released quoted one of its authors as suggesting that rico and the longer federal statute of limitation might hold the prospect of future federal prosecution this would seem to build upon theory that the officers alleged to have committed the three civil rights violations in the 1980s were part of conspiracy or rico enterprise that encompassed not only the beating of detainees but an agreement to perpetually conceal the activity39 as general rule the statute of limitations begins to run with the commission of the most recent overt act for conspiracies in violation of statute which requires the government to prove both criminal agreement and some overt act in furtherance of scheme40 in the case of statutes like rico whose conspiracy proscription carries overt act requirement the scheme is said to continue until all its objectives have been realized or it is abandoned41 in grunewald v united states 353 us 391 1957 the question arose in whether in the case of an overt act conspiracy the statute of limitations may be extended when the conspirators or one of their number acts to conceal the past workings of the scheme the defendants in grunewald had conspired to fix tax prosecutions and had doctore d government records to conceal their misconduct 353 us at 395 when grand jury was conve ned after the statute of limitations on the tax fix had run the conspirators deni ed wrongdoing and urged other witnesses not to cooperate 353 us at 39642 the prosecution argued that the conspiracy included concealment component that meant the plot continued in place even after its principal objective the tax fix had been accomplished43 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33592crs12 government from the very nature of the conspiracy there had to be and was from the outset conscious deliberate agreement to conceal each and every aspect of the conspiracy it is then agreed that since the alleged conspiracy to conceal clearly continued long after the main criminal pur pose of the conspiracy was accomplished and since overt acts in furtherance of the agreemen t to conceal were performed well within the indictment period the prosecu tion was timely 353 us at 398 44 it is not clear why much the same could not have been said about the grunewald defendants except that in masters concealment was component of the scheme among the elements of the conspiracy with which t he chief was charged was that he had agreed with the other two defendants to conceal their actions and to participate in such concealment indefinitely 924 f2d at 1368the court was unpersuaded we find in all this noting more than what was involved in our earlier cases that is 1 criminal conspiracy which is carried out in secrecy 2 continuation of the secrecy after the accomplishment of the crime and 3 desperate attempts to cover up after the crime begins to come to light and so we cannot agree that this case does not fa ll within the ban of those prior opinions 353 us at 403 but then the court went on the explain that by means does this mean that acts of concealment can never have significance in furthering criminal conspiracy but vital distinction must be made between acts of concealment done in furtherance of the main criminal objectives of the conspiracy and acts of concealment done after these cen tral objectives have been attained for the purpose only of covering up after the crime 353 us at 405 emphasis in the original subsequent lower court decisions refl ect the view that an overt act of concealment will toll the statute of limitations or evidence its continued existence if the indictment charges that concealment was of the main object of the conspiracy the report cites two reported fe deral appellate court cases as examples united states v masters 924 f2d 1362 7th cir 1991 and united states v maloney 71 f3d 645 7th cir 1995 masters involved an attorney chief of police who until he lost his job took kickbacks for referring clients to the atto rney and sheriffs department lieutenant who accep ted bribes from the attorney to protect bookies from police interference 924 f2d at 1365 the three also participated in plot to murder the attorneys wayward wife 924 f2d at 1365366 the three were convicted under federal rico charges predicated on the corruption offenses 924 f2d at 1365 the chief of police was charged and convicted only with conspiracy because the statute of limitations on the substantive corruption charges had run between the time he lost his job and the time the indictment was returned id the appellate court rejected the chiefs statute of limitations challenge with the observation that the conspirators in this case signally including the chief intended from the first to exert strenuous fforts to prevent discovery fo the crime and of their involvement in it the fact that two of the three conspirators were policemen supports the inference that concealment was part of the original conspiracy and not spontaneous reaction to fear of arrest and prosecution it was also fair inference that the defendants agreed to keep trying to conceal the conspiracy for as long as they could us ing their official pos itions where possible 924 f2d at 136844 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33592crs13 45 thus the principal difference between grunewald and maloney is that the grunewald indictment consisted of separate conspiracy and concealment charges the maloney indictment merged them together in rico charge 46 united states v qayyum 451 f3d 1214 1219220 10th cir 2006emphasis in the originalgiven the grand jurys express desc ription of the conspiracys purpose and object the alleged false statements to government ag ents formed part of the charged conspiracy because they did not follow the accomplishment of its central criminal objectives but rather were acts in furtherance of those aims united states v rabinowitz 56 f3d 932 934 8th cir 1995when concealment is necessary to accomplish crime successfully acts of concealment are properly considered to be within the conspiracymaloney involved judge who accepted bribes to fix four criminal cases and then sought to make sure that the middle man through whom the bribes were funneled continued to sta nd tall in the face of criminal investigations into allegations of corruption united states v maloney 71 f3d 645 65052 7th cir 1995 the statute of limitations had run on each of the bribery cases by the time indictments were returned but the judge was charged with and convicted of rico conspiracy based upon the obstruction of justice predicates 71 f3d at 649 the judge objected that the statute of limitations barred prosecution for conspiracy to conceal the commission of timebarred offe nses but the appella court responded that unlike grunewald however the conspiracys main criminal objective was never finally attained in this case in the instance case the main criminal objective to fix cases wh enever feasible was neith er accomplished nor abandoned as long as judge maloney remained on the bench concealment therefore was an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracys main objectiv maloneys statements helped to preserve his position on the bench the essential ingredient in the conspiracys ability to fix cases thus grunewald does not exclude the obstruction of justice acts from the rico conspiracy for statute of limitations purposes 71 f3d at 6596045 cases from other circuits reflect the same view grunewald does not bar extension of the statute of limitations to include acts of concealment where concealment falls within the scope of the conspiracy grunewald only applies where the conspiracys objectives have been attained and concealment follows46 if federal prosecutors could establish ither conspiracy in which concealment was an initial object of the plot or rico violation or conspiracy the specter of statute of limitations bar would disappear otherwise the statute of limitations would appear to preclude federal prosecution on the basis of any conduct identified in the report other than its own interviews the last of the events in question took place later than december 16 1993 report at 266 the special states attorneys investigation described in the report began in 2001 and ended july 19 2006 the commanding officers and each of the individual officers whom the report describes as indictable were interviewed report at 16 274 290 15 the interview statements were apparently consistent with the officers earlier statements for the report would certainly have noted any incriminating statements if the interview statements were false and material they would constitute violations of 18 usc 1001 and 1512bhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33592crs14 3 but if the statute of limitations bars the prosecution of the offenses to which the statements relate they are not ma terial consequently violation the report suggests that dispelling statute of limitation difficulties however may be challenging for on several occasions federal au thorities have concluded that the passage of time bars federal prosecution on october 3 1990 the task for ce to confront police violence wrote to the united states attorney pointing out that it had previously submitted information regarding incidents of torture committed by the detectives at detective area 2 the response form the united states attorneys office was that the incidents had occurred more than five years before on march 15 1991 assistant public defender joseph m grump wrote to the attorney general also referring to the case of andrew wilson mr gump identified over 25 cases involving persons who claimed to have been abused it was determined that prosecution would be declined because of the statute of limitations the matter was reopened by the department of justice and on may 18 1993 prosecution was again declined be cause of the statute of limitations shortly after we were appointed we were informed that persons seeking prosecution of police officers met with the attorney general we have received report that the investigation by the civil rights section of the justice department was closed as of december 2001 because of the statute of limitations report at 301 30
