form of house measure as passed by the house and substitute for the entire text agreed to by the senate or vice versa often the substitute from the second chamber formally an amendment in the nature of substitute reflects the text of companion measure agreed to by that chamber other possibilities exist but all involve an amendment or amendments by one house to measure agreed to by the other house rule xxii clause 9 authorizes house conferees to negotiate only on matters in disagreement between the houses that is points on which the house and senate versions of the measure differ this rule permits conferees to reach an agreement that constitutes germane modification of the matter in disagreement conferees may for example propose conference substitute new amendment in the nature of substitute as an alternative to both versions committed to conference the conference proposal on each matter in disagreement must fall within the scope of the differences between th house and senate versions in general this requirement means that conferees may not change or eliminate text agreed to by both houses nor may they introduce any specific additional matter not included in either version also they may not delete matter in such way as to broaden the scope of the measure beyond both proposals if the two versions contain different provisions on the same subject conferees must in general retain provision on that subject they may accept either the house or senate version or may propose version intermediate between the two the conference proposal may not be stronger than the stronger version or weaker than the w eaker version if only one house has provision on subject then the position of the other house is implicitly that current law on the point should be maintained the conferees may include the provision omit it or propose version intermediate between it and current law g24g146g152g149g138g157g146g152g151g156g561g152g143g561g3g158g157g145g152g155g146g157g162g561 in recent practice conferees often include in their report provisions that either are entirely new or otherwise violate the scope requirement conference report containing provisions outside the scope is subject to point of order in the house if the speaker sustains the point of order the entire conference report is out of order and cannot be considered because conference report is package agreement it must be considered and disposed of as unit it may not be amended or broken up in this situation conferees often ask the committee on rules to report special rule for considering the conference report that waives the scope point of order alternatively if little opposition is expected the conference report may be called up on motion to suspend the rules which has the effect of waiving any points of or der the house may also waive points of order t httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20219g10g152g158g156g142g561g5g152g151g143g142g155g142g142g156g497g561g20g142

also available to remedy other violations of conferees authority

bills conferees authority is subject to important additional restrictions rule xxii clause 5 restricts the authority of house conferees to accept senate amendments to appropriation bills that change existing permanent law called legislative amendments or make unauthorized appropriations or senate appropriations amendments to bills that are not appropriation bills rule xxii clause 6 forbids house conferees from accepting senate revenue amendment to house nonrevenue bill in the past if conferees reached agreements that violated these restrictions they often reported their proposals as amendments in technical disagreement they would formally report that they could not reach agreement conference report in disagreement they would then propose that the house resolve the disagreement by agreeing to the senate version as amended by new house amendment because these motions to recede and concur with an amendment are not subject to the restrictions applicable to conference reports the text of the new amendment could embody the agreement that conferees had actually reached this approach becomes inconvenient however when the position of one house is embodied in single secondchamber substitute for the entire text which has become routine even on appropriations bills g16g152g151g144g142g155g150g138g151g142g561g21g142g151g138g157g142g561g18g155g152g159g146g156g146g152g151g156g561 finally house rule xxii clause 10 restricts the ability of house conferees to agree to include in conference report provisions that originate in senate language and are not germane to the measure as passed by the house the rule subjects each provision of this kind to separate point of order in the house if the speaker sustains the point of order however the conference report does not automatically become ineligible for consideration instead motion is in order to strike the nongermane matter from the conference report if one or more motions to strike are agreed to the conference report is considered as rejected the rule then however permits the house automatically to consider motion to recede and concur with an amendment consisting of the unrejected portion of the conference report for each nongermane senate provision in conference report this mechanism permits the house to choose either to accept or reject it without kill ing the legislation as whole similar procedures apply when senate nongermane matter appears in an amendment reported from conference in real or technical disagreement
