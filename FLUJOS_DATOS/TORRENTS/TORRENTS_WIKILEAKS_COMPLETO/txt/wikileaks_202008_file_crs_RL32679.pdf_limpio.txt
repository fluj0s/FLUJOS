hea was last reauthorized by the higher education amendments of 1998 pl 105244 title iv of the act authorizes the major federal student aid programs including the fede ral student loan programs which provide more direct aid to support students post secondary edu cational pursuits than any other source in fy2003 the federal st udent loan programs provided 458 billion in new loans to students and their parents this report discusses issues concerning the student loan programs that are likely to be considered during reauthorization the report is organized in the followi ng manner first it provides background information on the student loan programs and their loans then it provides an overview of many of the issues likely to receive attention in the reauthorization1 introduction to the federal student loan programs the federal government operates two major student loan programs the federal family education loan ffel program authorized by part b of title iv of the hea and the william d ford direct loan dl program authorized by part d of title iv of the hea2 these programs provide loans to undergraduate and graduate students and the pa rents of undergraduate student s to help them meet the costs of postsecondary education under the ffel program loan capital is provided by private lenders and the federal government guarantees lenders ag ainst loss through borrower default death permanent disability or in limited instances bankruptcy under the dl program operated through the us partment of education d the federal government provides the loans to students and their families using federal capital ie f undshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32679crs2 3 for detailed information on the array of ffel and dl program loans see crs report rl30655 federal student loans terms and conditions for borrowers by adam stoll for thorough discussion of how the loan programs operate see crs report rl30656 the administration of federa l student loan programs background and provisions by adam stoll 4 for comprehensive description of consolidation loans terms and conditions see crs report rl31575 consolidation loan provisions in the federal family education l oan and direct loan programs by adam stollfrom the us treasury the two programs rely on different sources of capital and different administrative structures but esse ntially disburse the same set of loans3 the dl program established in 1993 was intended to streamline the student loan delivery system and achieve cost savings while the dl program was originally introduced to gradually expand and replace the longstanding ffel program the 1998 hea amendments removed the provisions of the law that referred to phase in of the dl program currently bot h programs are authorized and the two programs compete for student loan busin ess in fy2003 these programs provided 458 billion in new loans to students and their parents in that year the ffel program provided 8429000 new loans averag ing approximately 4009 each and the dl program provided 2937000 new loans averaging approximately 4075 each the ffel and dl programs provide the fo llowing types of loans to students and their parents stafford loans subsidized and unsubsidized low interest variable rate loans available to undergraduate and graduate students the interest rates on subsidized and unsubsidized stafford loans adjust annually based on statutorily established marketindexed rate setting formula and may not exceed 825 to qualify for subsidized stafford loan student must establish financial need the federal government pays the interest on the borrowers behalf on the subsidized stafford loans while the borrowe r is in school on at least halftime basis and during grace periods and deferment periods plus loans variable rate loans available to parents of dependent undergraduate students the interest rates on these loans adjust annually based on statutorily established marketindexed ratesetting formula and may not exceed 9 consolidation loans loans that provide borrowers refinancing options consolidation loan may be comprised of one underlying loan or multiple underlying loans consolidation provid borrowers with multiple loans the opportunity to simplify the repayment of loans by combining multiple loans into one consolidation loans also enable borrowers to lower monthly payments by extending the repayment period additionally consolidation loans afford borrowers the opportunity to pursue more favorable long term interest rate through locking in fixed interest rate on their student loans based on the weighted average of the interest rates in effect on the loans being consolidated rounded up to the nearest onee ighth of 1 capped at 8254httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32679crs3 5 in instances where the terms and conditions differ across programs it will be noted otherwise the reader should assume terms and conditions being discussed apply in both programs 6 variable rates for stafford and plus loans adjust annually for stafford and plus loans continuedunderlying tensions prior to discussing individual reauthor ization issues it may be helpful to note that there are certain underlying tensions i nherent in the current design of the loan programs that affect many of the reauthor ization issues considered in this report one pertains to program cost it is generally the case that enhancements to borrower benefits increase federal subsidy costs fo r instance in the ffel program where the government insures and subsidizes loans ma by private lende rs federal subsidy costs increase when less revenue is derived from borrower fees and when interest subsidy payments to lenders are increased lenders receive subsidy payment that ensures they receive the difference between the statutorily set borrower rate and fair market rate in the dl program wher the government acts as lender federal subsidy costs are increased when borrower fees or repayment re venues paid to the government are reduced another tension stems from dissimilarities in ffel and dl program loan terms and conditions the two progra ms disburse the same set of loans but loan terms and conditions are not perfectly parallel across the two progra ms each program has its supporters some favor prom oting more parallel terms and conditions others do not if parallel terms and conditions are achieved by reducing benefit currently available in only one of the two programs5 reauthorization issues loan terms and conditions interest rates on stafford and plus loans the stafford and plus loans currently being disbursed are variab rate loans as of july 2006 under current law new stafford and plus loans will carry fixed interest rates the desirability of this planned switch has been the subject of considerable debate student loan interest rate s were focal issue in the 1998 reauthorization the statutory rate setting formulas which are used to establish rates for loans disbursed from july 1 1998 through june 30 2006 were initially enacted in june 1998 and extended in the hea amendments of 1998 the formula for calculating interest rate s on stafford loans is based on the 91 day treasury bill rate plus 17 while the borrower is in school and plus 23 when the borrower is in repayment stafford rates are capped at 825 the formula in effect for calculating interest rates on plus loans is based on the 91day treasury bill rate plus 31 and the pl us rates are capped at 96httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32679crs4 6 continued the tbill rates used in establishing the nnual borrower rate are the bond equivalent rates from the last auction prior to june 1 rates take effect from july 1 through the following june 30 7 the statute states that the borrower rate would adjust annually but does not specify the index upon which the variable rate will be established the selection of the security to serve as the index would be left to the secretarythe current rate setting formulas were dopted as result of deliberations that centered on how to replace so called comparable maturity rates that were set to take effect july 1 1998 the comparable ma turity ratesetting formula was initially enacted in the student loan reform act slra of 1993 the legislation that created the dl program the formula afforded the secretary of education great deal of latitude in establishing borrower rates7 the decision to move toward compar able maturity rate was made in 1993 within the context of the assumption that the dl program would be phased in over series of years and ultimately replace th guaranteed loan system in years following the enactment of the slra c ongressional support emerged for sustaining both loan programs and within this contex t considerable atte ntion was devoted to replacing the comparable maturity rate struct ure before it took effect this led to the adoption of the rate setting formulas currently in effect however due to cost considerations under preva iling budget scoring rules the hea amendments of 1998 were only able to install the current formula until june 30 2003 after which the comparable maturity rates were once again set to take effect the interest rate issue was revisited in 2002 with the passage of pl 107139 this measure extended the existing variable rate setting formulas through june 30 2006 additionally it installed fixed intere st rates of 68 for stafford loans and 79 for plus loans disbursed thereafter in the upcoming reauthorization of the hea it is likely that borrower interest rates will once again receive consideration some feel that the 68 fixed rate set to take effect for new loans ma on or after july 1 2006 is good rate in comparison to historical borrower rates in the prog ram and that fixed rate provides the borrower with set of predictable monthl payments which many borrowers desire others feel that borrower is better serv ed under variable rate formula where the borrower is able to take advantage of low market rates when available such as the 337 repayment rate being charged this year but still receive protection against high rates thanks to the 825 interest cap it is likely that student loan interest rates will be hotly debated part of the debate is likely to focus on enhancing or preserving borrower benefits there will also likely be concerns about the federal s ubsidy cost this is because in the ffel program lenders are provide d federal interest subsidy payment discussed later when the statutorily set borrower rate fails to provide lenders market rate of return in the dl program where the federal g overnment acts as lende r federal subsidy costs increase when repayment revenues are reduced across both programs more generous borrower benefits ge nerally increase federal costshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32679crs5 borrower fees several proposals have been forwarded recently that call for reductions in borrower fees currently st afford borrowers in the dl program pay 3 origination fee that goes to the federal government to help offset program costs statutory provisions call for dl borrowers to pay 4 origination fee but ed reduced the fee for stafford dl borrowers effective august 15 1999 dl plus borrowers pay 4 origination fee in the ffel program the origination fee for plus and stafford borrowers is 3 which goes to the federal government lenders may opt to pay the fee or portion of the fee on the borrowers behalf in order to secure loan business additionally ffel borrowers ma be required to pay 1 insurance premium this fee goes to guaranty agencies to help offs et loan insurance costs guarantors may wave the fee and if the fee is assessed nders may opt to pay the fee or portion of the fee on the borrowers behalf it is likely that reduction in borrower origination fees particularly for student borrowers will be considered in reaut horization helping students by reducing charges is goal upon which many can ag ree but finding offsetting revenues from other sources is often challenge in fy2003 borrower origination fees generated approximately 13 billion in revenue acr oss the two programs additionally attention may be devoted to examining the comparability of borrower fees charged across and within the two loan programs loan limits to limit the federal governments subsidy costs and to limit the amount of debt incurred by borrowers annua l and aggregate stafford borrowing caps have been established considerable interest has surfaced in the adequacy of the existing loan limits the current caps for undergraduate students which were enacted in the higher education amendm ents of 1992 pl 102325 are as follows table 1 annual and aggregate stafford loan limits dependent undergraduate students independent undergraduate students annual limits annual limits 1st year 2625 1st year 6625 2nd year 3500 2nd year 7500 3rd year and beyond 5500 3rd year and beyond 10500 aggregate limit 23000 aggregate limit 46000 source hea section 428 20 usc 1078httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32679crs6 8 for federal student aid student is consider ed independent of his or her parents if the student is at least 24 years ol d by december 31 of the award year is an orphan or ward of the state or was until age18 is veteran of th armed forces is graduate or professional student is married has dependents other than spouse or is deemed independent by financial aid officer for other unusual circumstances 9 parents are actually provided quite flexible borrowing limits through plus loans plus borrowers may borrow any amount up to the pendent students cost of attendance minus certain other types of aid ie grants scholar ships federal work study and perkins loans 10 plus borrowers are not eligible for income contingent repayment the main difference between income sensitive and income contingent repayment plans are the 10year repayment term and prohibition on negative amortization in income sensitive repayment negative amortization refers to situation where the borrowers required monthly payment does not cover the interest due on the loanas table 1 shows dependency status is key determinant of students personal borrowing limits8 it is assumed that depende nt students and the parents of dependent students will cofinance the pos tsecondary educati on of the dependent students dependent students are therefore afforded lower personal borrowing limits than independent students at the same time parents of dependent students are afforded the opportunity to take out federal plus loans to support dependent students9 some have questioned however whet her dependent stude nts in particular are being provided adequate bo rrowing opportunities if they ve to self finance their studies in general those in favor of expanding loan limits suggest loan limits have not kept pace with tuition increases and thus c onstrain students ability to finance their education adversely affec ting student access choice and persistence those opposed suggest it is undesirable for stude nts to incur more debt and question whether the expansion of borrowing oppor tunities will have any positive effect on access choice or persistence particularly for lower income students also at issue are federal subsidy costs because as borrowing opportunities are expanded so are federal subsidy costs repayment plans issues concerning repayment plans that surface with some regularity relate to differences between options made available to borrowers in the dl program and those made available to borrowers in the ffel program brief summary of the repayment options available in each program is offered below all ffel borrowers are allowed to c hoose among standard graduated and income sensitive repayment plans for new borrowers on or after october 7 1998 who accumulate after such date outst anding loans totaling more than 30000 fourth repayment option is availa ble an extended repayment plan like ffel borrowers all dl borrowers are allowed to choose among standard and graduated repayment plans in addition all dl borrowers are allowed to choose extended repayment there are restrictions similar to those in ffel income contingent repayment as opposed to income sensitive repayment is available to all dl unsubsidized and subsidized stafford borrowers10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32679crs7 one of the things likely to garner some attention is the difference in the repayment terms available in each program in ffel all repayment plans offer 10 year repayment term with the excep tion of extended repayment under which repayment must occur within time period not to exceed 25 years in dl standard repayment offers 10year term under the income contingent repayment plan repayment must occur over period not to exceed 25 years repayment periods for dl extended and graduated repayment plans vary with the size of the loan it is likely that some attention may be devoted to adopting more comparable repayment options across the two programs additionally some interest exists in adding new interest only repayment option under such an option borrower would have low interestonly payments in their initial years after graduation but would also delay the point at which th ey begin paying down loan principal loan consolidation consolidation loan interest rates in recent years several congressional hearings have focused on the fixed rate be nefit on consolidation loans in general the debate pertaining to the fixe d rate benefit centers on its cost consolidation loans were originally introduced in the hea amendments of 1986 pl 99498 they were initially intended to simplify repayment for borrowers simplify loan repayment servicin g for lenders and offer relief in the form of extended repayment to those borrowers seeking lower monthly payments as the consolidation loan interest rate fo rmula has been modified by congress consolidation loans have evol ved into refinance benefit as well ie benefit that enables borrower to pursue better interest rate the current consolidation loan interest rate formula affords borrowers the opportunity to secure fixed rate equal to the weighted average of the rates in effect on underlying variable rate loans being consolidated rounded up to the nearest one eighth of 1 in the recent low interest rate environment consolidation volume has grown dramatically as borrowers have soug ht to lock in as permanent the favorable rates currently in effect on their variable rate loans this has enabled large number of borrowers to secure valuable refi nance benefit currently borrower who consolidates while in the grace period can s ecure 288 interest rate over the last two years in which very low rates have been available an estimated 63 billion in loan volume has been consolidated when borrowers exercise their option to lock in low rates permanently the federal government is potentially exposed to high subsidy costs in the ffel program this is so because the government has guaranteed the lenders market rate of return and must ma ke up the difference between the rate the borrower is paying and the rate the lender is guaranteed in the dl program subsidy costs increase when repayment revenue is reduced those in favor of the existing fixed rate setting formula assert that in the current low interest rate environment the fixe d rate amounts to valuable benefit to borrowers at time of escalating student loan debt it provides important repayment relief and sends signal to students and potential students that repayment will be manageable further proponents of the existing rate setting formula suggest that eliminating the opportunity to lock in fixed ra would be tantamount to takinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32679crs8 11 if ffel lender secures an insurance agreem ent to make consolidation loans the lender may offer consolidation loans upon request to all borrowers for whom the lender is the sole loan holder also if ffel lenders opt to make consolidation loans the lenders may not discriminate against borrowers seeking consolidation loan based upon the number and type of eligible student loans the borrower eks to consolidate b the type of institution continuedaway benefit that was available when bo rrowers received their stafford loans and that they are counting on utilizing once they enter repayment the removal of this benefit in low interest nvironment would amount to dropping large share of the interest subsidy currently available to borrowers those opposed to sustaining the existin g rate setting formula suggest it offers an overly generous borrower benefit that is costly to the point of placing future aid in jeopardy they also question whether it is necessary to offer refinance benefit when the rate is already subsidized on sta fford loans further they question whether benefit received in the years after posts econdary schooling contributes in any way to students postsecondary acce ss persistence or choice they note the repayment period subsidy is provided without regard to need over lengthy period potentially extending up to 30 years beyond schooling and disproportionately benefits students who attended fouryear private institutions andor graduate programs reconsolidation in many ways the debate on reconsolidation is an extension of the debate on the fixed rate benefit borrowers who have locked in fixed rates through consolidation in high interest periods sometimes miss out on more advantageous variable rates that they would have had on underlying loans this introduces facet of the fixed rate be nefit some find troubling some borrowers fare worse under the high fixed rates they ck in this raises concern particularly with regard to those using consolida tion for repayment relief ie extended repayment because these borrowers may have to consolidate in years in which the fixed rate is disadvantageous one way to address this situation is through offering borrowers multiple refinance opportunities ie offering borrowe rs with relatively high fixed rates the prospect of securing better rate any added interest benefit for borrower however would likely expand federal subsidy co sts another way to address this is to eliminate consolidation loans fixed rate benefit this would prevent borrowers from locking in disadvantageous rates in the future but would not offer assistance to those having already done so borrowers ability to c hoose among consolidators complex set of provisions has been enacted to regulate competition for consolidation loan refinance business among loan holders w ithin the ffel program and across the dl and ffel programs and to protect borrowers ensuring they are afforded equitable refinancing options in effect some of these provisions constrain borrowers ability to choose among consolidators ffel borrowers whose loans are held by one holder must first attempt to consolidate their loans with that holder11 if consolidation loan is unavailable fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32679crs9 11 continued the borrower attended c the interest rate to be charged to the borrower which varies in accordance with when the loans being consolid ated were initially disbursed additionally ffel lenders may not discriminate with regard to the types of repayment schedules they make available to borrowers 12 for all ffel consolidation loans made on or after july 1 1994 lenders have been required to offer borrowers income sensitive re payment plans established by the lender in accordance with regulations promulgated by the secretary 13 for ffel borrowers who also have outstanding dl program loans this certification is not required such borrowers are free to pur sue consolidation in the dl programthat lender or the lender does not provide the borrower with an income sensitive repayment plan acceptable to the borrower then the borrower may pursue other ffel consolidation loans other ffel borrowers with loans from more than one ffel lender may seek consolidation loan through any ffel lender if ffel borrowers certify that they are unable to secure consolidation loan through ffel lenders or that they are unable to secu re ffel consolidation loan with income sensitive repayment terms deemed to be acceptable by the borrower12 the borrower may pursue dl consolidation loan13 dl borrowers may pursue consolidation loans within the dl program dl borrowers are also able to consolid ate their loans through ffel lenders it is likely that proposals calling for the elimination of provisi ons that constrain borrowers choice among consolidator s will receive consideration during reauthorization those in favor of such ch anges suggest it is important to afford all borrowers not just some the opportunity to shop among consolidators some ffel lenders object to making change in this area asserting they offer some up front discounts on stafford and plus loans base d on the assumption they will be able to hold the loan over its life and their anticipated level of income from the loan will be jeopardized if the borrower can consolidate elsewhere comparable consolidation loan benefits across the ffel and dl programs interest is often expressed in promoting greater comparability among ffel and dl consolidation bene fits there are several ways in which consolidation loan benefits differ across the ffel and dl programs one of the primary ways discussed above pertains to constraint s placed on borrowers ability to choose among consolidators some of the othe r principal differences are as follows in school consolidation borrowers seeking ffel consolidation loan are eligible to pursue consolidation when th borrowers have entered the repayment or grace period on each loan they are seeking to consolidate in contrast borrowers seeking dl consolidation loan may consolidate any eligible loans that have been fully disbursed even if the borrowers ve not yet entered repayment or grace period ie the borrower may still be in th eir inschool period when consolidating in practical terms this affords dl consolidation borrowers broader time period in which they can lock in as permanent an inschool rate which is lower than the repayment rate tbill 17 as opposed to tbill 23 this affords borrowershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32679crs10 greater opportunity to lock in as permanent fa vorable variable rates in effect in years when the borrowers are still in school repayment term borrowers with less than 7500 in outstanding loans seeking to consolidate in ffel may receive maximum repayment term of 10 years 12 year repayment term is available to borro wers with that level of debt in dl joint consolidation married persons each of whom has eligible loans are eligible for joint consolidation loan only one of the borrowers must meet the full set of individual eligibility requirements for new consolidation loan however each agrees to become jointly and severally liable for repayment of the note regardless of any changes in marital status it is likely that proposals to eliminate joint consolidations will receive c onsideration in the reauthorization while joint consolidation can simplify re payment for married couple concerns have been raised in recent years about di sadvantages that may be associated with joint consolidation for some borrowers for instance borrowers with joint consolidation loan must both meet the re quirements for deferment or forbearance in order to receive those benefits had the loans not been joined each borrower could qualify for these benef its based upon their own stat us additionally concerns have been raised about complications that may ensue for unsuccessful marriages given that both parties agree to be liable for the total repayment of the joint consolidation loan also in instances involving spouse who becomes permanently disabled disability discharge is provide d for that spouse covering the proportion of the loan attributable to their underlyi ng debt but each spouse remains liable for repayment of the remaining loan amount ffel financing and structure guaranty agencies guaranty agencies administer the federal governments loan guarantee the role guarantors play within the ffel program has evolved good deal since the programs inception initially the federal government intended to encourage the growth of state loan insurance programs over time the federal government assumed the role of providing the insurance and now guaranty agencies service the federal guarantee and perform various program administrative tasks in the 1998 reauthorization of the hea consid erable attention was devoted to more clearly defining the role guaranty agencies play within the ffel program and insuring clear linkages exist between financing streams and tasks performed changes adopted during the 1998 reauthor ization focused on strengthening the relationship between revenues and activities and improving efficiency the 1998 amendments adopted risk sharin g approach under this approach uses of reserves are restricted and guaran tors are afforded flexibility in the use of their operating funds there is clearer distinction between re serves and operating funds and clearer direction about where va rious revenue streams are to be deposited and ultimately about how these sources of revenue are to be used under this arrangement reserves are held in guaran tors federal fund which is the property of the federal government and other funds are held in guaranty agencys operating fund which is the property of the guarantorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32679crs11 14 the lender rate in sap calculations which serves as proxy for fair market compensation to lenders is based on the average of daily quotes of the threemonth commercial paper rates plus 234 for stafford loans in repayment the lender rate is intended to be sensitive to lender borrowing nd servicing costs and the need for profit marginit is likely that some attention will be devoted to the solvency of federal funds ie locally held federal re serve funds and the size of operating funds which can be used to support agency operations and so for discretionary student financial aid expenditures an overarching issue here pertains to the adequacy of revenues flowing into each fund some concerns ve been raised about shrinking reserves and robust operating funds some propos als have already called for mandating insurance premiums to strengthen rese rves some observers have suggested guarantor fees for loan collections and defaulted loan rehabilitation work may be too high thus inflating operating funds excess interest provisions as has been noted the federal government provides lenders with loan subsidy know n as special allo wance payment sap the sap amount is determined on quarterly basis by statutory formula which is tied to financial index and ensures lenders receive at minimum specified level of interest income on loans the sap is designed to compensate lenders for the difference between the belowmarket statutorily set interest rate charged to borrowers and market set interest rate that is intended as fair market compensation on the loan asset14 in some instances lenders receive inte rest income from borrowers exceeding the amount called for by the sap calculation the amount of income lenders receive above the government sap rate is often ca lled floor income the sap affords lenders necessary prot ection in high interest environments during which the statutorily establishe d borrower rate may provide lenders insufficient belowmarket rate returns however in low interest environments the statutorily established borrower rate s the potential of providing lenders with abovemarket rate returns i returns above the market indexed sap rate some argue that since the sap is designed to approximate fair market compensation it is unnecessary to compensate lenders at levels that exceed the sap rate it is often noted that in an earlier period excess interest provisions were adopted that essentially installed the sap rate as the sole lender reimbursement rate for loans several recent proposals have called for reducing federal subsidy costs by establishing the sap rate as the sole nder reimbursement rate and having lenders floor income refunded to the federal government 95 floor loans some ffel program loans which are made or purchased with tax exempt funds provide lenders gu aranteed interest rate of at least 95 hereafter these loans are referred to as 95 floor loans this guarantee is provided in the sap formula applied to these loans which requires the federal government to supplement borrower interest payments so as to insure minimum 95 rate for lenders there seems to be broad congressional support for curbinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32679crs12 15 investors in taxexempt bonds do not pay ta xes on the interest they earn and are thus willing to accept lower interest rate on their investment 16 it should be noted that this decision was made within the context of high interest rate environment in 1979 saps averaged 65 meaning 135 return 65 sap plus 7 interest rate constituted fair market comp ensation in the prevailing interest rate environmentthis rate guarantee for future loans the legislative developments that led to the enactment of the guarantee are briefly described below as part of an effort to ensure the ffel program would be fully capitalized in the programs early years provisions that served to encourage the issuance of tax exempt student loan bonds were include d in the tax reform act of 1976 such bonds are exempt from federal taxation and are used by states to finance below market interest rate loans for students15 in essence through the issuance of bonds with low taxexempt interest rates state au thorities are able to raise low cost funds and then relend the funds at higher rates soon after these provisions were pa ssed student bond volume began to grow rapidly and concerns about the profitab ility of tax exempt student loans surf aced the 1980 hea amendments took steps to curb the profitability of taxexempt loans by reducing by half the sap rate on loans originating from the proceeds of tax exempt bonds however to ensure that st udent loan authorities were always able to cover their operating costs the amendments also established minimum saps for loans disbursed on or after october 1 1980 which ensure minimum return of 95 on these loans16 the discourse on the profitability of taxexempt student loans continued through the 1980s on into the early 1990s the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 contained provision elimin ating the floor on taxexempt loans supported through taxexempt financing for issuances on or after october 1 1993 these loans were afforded the same sap ra tes as were available for taxable loans however different provisions were retained with regard to loans made or purchased with taxexempt funds obtained by holders from obligations originally issued on or after october 1 1980 and prior to octobe r 1 1993 these loans retained the 95 floor reimbursement structure the statutory provisions adopted in pl 10366 and ensuing regulatory guidance from ed have served to establish funds derived from debt originally issued in the aforementioned period that can be us ed by holders to finance 95 floor loans on an ongoing basis in recent years lenders have been using variety of refinancing techniques and also invested earnings from existing 95 floor loans to make or purchase new ones while 95 floor loans comprise relativ ely small percentage of all outstanding loans in recent years they have accounted for very large proportion of federal sap subsidies there appears to be genera l consensus that fe deral policy objective is served now by continually guarant eeing lenders minimum return of 95 however there is some bate about how best to phase out the guarantee forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32679crs13 nonprofit lenders the taxpayerteacher protection act of 2004 pl 108409 signed october 30 2004 curbs growth in 95 loans for one year by eliminating the 95 guarantee on new loans stemming from any new refinancing of obligations originally issued on or after october 1 1980 and prior to october 1 1993 however it does not curtail the 95 guarantee on new loans stemming from recyclingof proceeds from outstanding 95 loans thes proceeds can be used to finance new 95 loans phase out of the 95 guarantee would produce savings in mandatory spending these savings could be used to offset new expenditures
