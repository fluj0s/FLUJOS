specialists in energy and environmental policy resources science and industry division global climate change three policy perspectives summary the 1992 framework convention on climate change requires that signatories including the united states establish policies for constraining future emission levels of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide co2 the george h w bush clinton and george w bush administrations each drafted action plans in response to requirements of the convention these plans have raised significant controversy and debate this debate intensified following the 1997 kyoto agreement which had it been ratified by the united states would have committed the united states to reduce greenhouse gases by 7 over fiveyear period 20082012 from specified baseline years controversy is inherent in part because of uncertainties about the likelihood and magnitude of possible future climate change the consequences for human well being and the costs and benefits of minimizing or adapting to possible climate change controversy also is driven by differences in how competing policy communities view the assumptions underlying approaches to this complex issue this paper examines three starting points from which us response to the convention is being framed these starting points or policy lenses lead to divergent perceptions of the issue with respect to uncertainty urgency costs and government roles they also imply differing but overlapping processes and actions for possible implementation thus shaping recommendations of policy advocates concerning the federal governments role in reducing greenhouse gases technological lens views environmental problems as the result of inappropriate or misused technologies the solutions to the problems lie in improving or correcting technology the implied governmental role would be to provide leadership and incentives for technological development an economic lens views environmental problems as the result of inappropriate or misleading market signals prices the solutions to the problems lie in ensuring that the prices of goods and services reflect their total costs including environmental damages the implied governmental role would be to improve the functions of the market to include environmental costs so the private sector can respond efficiently an ecological lens views environmental problems as the result of indifference to or disregard for the planets ecosystem on which all life depends the solutions to the problems lie in developing an understanding of and respect for that ecosystem and providing people with mechanisms to express that understanding in their daily choices the implied governmental role would be to support ecologically based education and values as well as to promote green products and processes for example through procurement policies efficiency standards and regulations some initiatives are underway all the perspectives are relevant in evaluating them and possible further policies the purpose here is not to suggest that one lens is better than another but rather to articulate the implications of the differing perspectives in order to clarify terms of debate among diverse policy communities contents introduction 1 three lenses for viewing solutions 3 technological lens 4 background 4 application to global climate change 6 economic lens 10

table 4 review of lenses across different policymaking criteria 33 global climate change three policy perspectives introduction climate change policy actions are underway at state federal regional and international levels1 as party to the united nations framework convention on climate change the united states committed to the objective of achieving stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system and to preparing national action plans to address emissions of greenhouse gases2 the domestic debate intensified with the negotiations relating to the kyoto protocol agreed to in december 19973 specifically under the terms of the kyoto protocol the united states would have committed to reducing its average annual net carbonequivalent emissions of six gases carbon dioxide co2 nitrous oxide methane perfluorocarbons hydrofluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride by 7 below 1990 levels 1995 for the fluorinated gases over the fiveyear period 2008 2012 if it had been ratified by the senate the kyoto agreement would have moved the debate beyond the mix of study regrets4 and voluntary actions policies of the george h w bush clinton and george w bush administrations the clinton administration however never submitted the kyoto protocol to the senate5 and subsequently president george w bush rejected it outright in lieu 1 see crs report rl34513 climate change current issues and policy tools by jane leggett 2 the senate consented to ratification of the framework convention on climate change on october 7 1992 with twothirds majority division vote president h w bush signed the instrument of ratification of the convention on october 13 1992 3 on the agreement see crs report rl33826 climate change the kyoto protocol bali action plan and international actions by susan r fletcher and larry parker 4 adopting regrets policy can be summarized as assessing policy options across the range of federal activities for their potential impact on global climate change and where alternative policies to achieve goal otherwise appear similar adopt the one most consistent with protecting against the risk of global climate change c boyden gray and david b rivkin jr regrets environmental policy foreign policy summer 1991 pp 47 65 5 in july 1997 prior to kyoto the senate agreed by unanimous vote 950 to sres 98 stating that the clinton administration should not accept an agreement that would seriously harm the economy or that did not require developing countries to meet appropriate reduction continued crs2 of the approach of the kyoto protocol featuring binding commitments to reduce emissions by developed and transitional nations president george w bush proposed twopronged approach one to focus on further research and development to better characterize global climate change and its causes the other to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases emitted per unit of economic activity through voluntary actions6 in addition on july 27 2005 the bush administration announced formation of six nation asiapacific partnership on clean development and climate app7 with the goal of meeting national pollution reduction energy security and climate change concerns consistent with the principles of the framework convention on climate change unfccc through voluntary nonlegally binding framework for international cooperation8 additionally in may 2007 the president announced that the united states would convene meeting of the worlds major economies that are responsible for most greenhouse gas emissions held in september 2007 the final statements of the major economies meeting on energy security and climate change emphasized the need to integrate such meetings into the overall unfccc negotiations the us summary of the meeting focused on the aspirational nature of reduction goals reflecting the administrations rejection of mandatory reduction targets9 second meeting was held in january 2008 meanwhile the congress engaged in oversight and consideration of legislative initiatives bill addressing climate change s 2191 reached the senate floor in 2008 but after series of parliamentary maneuvers the senate failed to invoke cloture with the new administration taking office in january 2009 changes in congressional membership and new chairman of key house committee energy and commerce new legislative initiatives are expected for the 111th congress because of the uncertainties associated with global climate change the extent to which global climate change is occurring what the effects might be and their magnitude the economic and social consequences that would follow from actions to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases the relationships between emissions and economic activity the costs of actions or of taking action the time frame of 5 continued requirements the clinton administration signed the agreement saying that costs would not be excessive particularly because it included emissions trading and joint implementation provisions and said it would be encouraging developing nations to participate but the clinton administration never submitted the agreement to the senate 6 see httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases200202climatechangehtml 7 the other members are china india japan australia and south korea 8 charter for the

individuals perception of what if anything to do is strongly influenced by personal and community values perceptions of human progress and adaptability experience education and training and outlook in how to cope with risks and uncertainty10 these differing perspectives of persons affect their observations and interpretations of the issue influencing their decisions on whether policy interventions are necessary and if so what kinds of intervention at the same time personal perspectives can change new knowledge education andor moral suasion may impact on policymaking and individual and corporate behavior and may also be necessary to create conditions for successfully implementing initiatives relating to climate change three lenses for viewing solutions the many personal proclivities and professional constructs that help shape an individuals perspectives on environmental issues in general and global climate change in particular can be grouped into three perspectives that affect proposed policies these perspectives which can intertwine and overlap are that environmental problems are the result of inappropriate or misused technologies and that the solutions to the problems lie in improving or correcting technology that environmental problems are the result of market failures and that the solutions to the problems lie in ensuring that market decisions take into account all costs including environmental damages and that environmental problems result from combination of ignorance of indifference to and even disregard for the ecosystem on which human life ultimately depends as well as for the other living creatures that share the planet and that the solutions to environmental problems lie in developing an understanding of and respect for that ecosystem and in providing mechanisms for people to express the priority they place on the environment in their daily choices 10 implications of differing perceptions are discussed in for example steven kelman what price incentives economists and the environment boston auburn publishing co 1981 lester b lave and hadi dowlatabadi climate change the effects of personal beliefs and scientific uncertainty

in the global warming debate ends report 233 june 1993 2123 crs4 each of these perspectives can be considered lens through which individuals and policy communities view the issue lens that provides particular focus on the nature of the problem and for the kinds of actions to solve it11 for shorthand they might be termed the technological lens the economic lens and the ecological lens respectively each perspective and its associated policy approaches generally are sufficiently distinct that dominating tendency in policy options can be discerned as policy frameworks these lenses incorporate terminology and methods associated with diverse academic disciplines and professions including not only engineering economics and ecological sciences but also various social sciences jurisprudence theology and others as policy frameworks they should not be confused with any one academic discipline or profession12 rather they are perspectives on policymaking on how to focus on policy issue while the lenses can be analyzed as distinct perspectives most of the time for most people they represent predilections rather than conscious alternatives13 the lenses differ primarily in what aspects of the issue come into focus resulting in some being magnified others obscured or even distorted the appropriateness of this focusing is dependent on the characteristics of the specific issue and the orientation of the policymaker thus policymaker viewing global climate change through one lens say the technological lens is not necessarily disregarding economic or ecological factors although these factors tend to lie outside and may be less discernible than the more clear focus on technological options ultimately given the diversity of policymakers and the potential overlapping of viewpoints any global climate policy considered will likely involve mix of initiatives representing all of the perspectives14 such mix may reflect mutual accommodation as much as conscious agreement that combination of approaches better ensures progress toward mitigation goals the purpose here is not to suggest that one lens is superior to another but rather to articulate the differing perspectives in order to facilitate communication among different parties and interests technological lens background viewed through the technological lens an environmental problem is an opportunity for ingenuity for technical fix this technologically 11 further action on global climate change or setting policy of federal government role are options as well 12 hence the economic lens should not be confused with the academic discipline of economics nor the ecological lens with ecological science the frameworks are broader than any single discipline incorporating range of policyrelevant perspectives depending on the personal experiences and knowledge of the policymaker 13 see marco janssen and bert vries the battle of perspectives multiagent model with adaptive responses to climate change ecological economics 26 1998 4365 14 see for example thomas l friedman hot flat and crowded new york farrar straus and giroux 2008 crs5 driven philosophy focuses on research development and demonstration of technologies that ameliorate or eliminate the problem many uncertainties can be ignored if technology is available to render them irrelevant presumption underlying the pollution prevention concept for example from this perspective policy entails the development and commercialization of new technologies governments role can include basic research technical support financial subsidies economic mechanisms or the imposition of requirements or standards that stimulate technological development and that create markets for such technologies the relationship between environmental protection and technological development was recognized early in the environmental debates and policymaking of the 1960s and 1970s particularly in the area of mobile source pollution control standards anticipated technological development to achieve emissions reductions commonly called technologyforcing although some in industry argued that this was not an efficient means of encouraging technology particularly when the deadlines for compliance were short the process undoubtedly stimulated development regulatory mandates can directly stimulate the commercialization of technology by creating market opportunities these mandates can be performancebased meet an emissions level or technologybased specify the performance of the technology used for example california and 14 other states have enacted legislation or regulations mandating that greenhouse gas emissions from new passenger vehicles be reduced by 22 in model year my 2012 and 30 in my2016 the degree to which these sorts of mandates have forced technologies has depended on the perceived seriousness of problems resulting in accelerated time frames for development and in very high levels of required performance the ease of developing the needed technology and the impact of anticipated costs on consumers15 along with the use of regulatory approach to forcing technology the federal government has also taken an active role in assisting private industry in developing pollution control technology some environmentally important industries did not have strong research and development sectors in the late 1960s and 1970s or did not have ones that could easily be redirected toward pollution control this led to governmentally directed research and developmental efforts toward pollution control technology for example the epa spent approximately 2 billion supporting development of feasible flue gas desulfurization fgd device for electric utility use to control sulfur oxides at that time late 1960s the utility industry had central research effort the electric power research institute epri was not started until 1972 and individual utilities devoted their engineering efforts to improving mechanical efficiency of generation not the chemical engineering necessary for desulfurization many utilities also were opposed to adding chemical process on their plants preferring other control techniques such as tall stacks and low sulfur coal the success of the governments efforts is indicated by the fact that the fgd device is now the performance and reliability standard by which new emerging 15 for more information see crs report rl34099 california waiver request to control greenhouse gases under the clean air act by james mccarthy and robert meltz crs6 control devices are measured16 the federal government has also promoted the development of hybrid electric and fuel cell vehicles in the united states through joint governmentindustry research and development aimed at the introduction of high efficiency cars and trucks as well as tax incentives for the purchase of new advanced technology vehicles17 the technological lens reflects traditional american cando faith in technology and in the countrys ability to find technologyfix to meet the needs of most problems such an approach attempts to increase the effectiveness of technology so that social problems can be solved at little or additional cost consumers desires and needs are taken as given the technological response is an effort to achieve an acceptable level of environmental protection without unduly restricting the choices available to those consumers for example consumers want to drive viewed through the technological lens policymakers see their role as making that activity less environmentally harmful at minimal cost to consumers not as restricting that desire or even necessarily as offering alternatives to driving such as mass transit efforts to diminish consumer use of the automobile would be seen as last resort the technological lens provides view of the economy in which technology permits consumers to continue their preferred behaviors while concomitantly achieving environmental goals it is not necessary for consumers to change their behavior significantly to adjust to the new reality of an environmental problem application to global climate change viewed through the technological lens global climate change is seen as problem requiring reorientation of the energy sector from carbonbased fossil fuels to more environmentally friendly energy system based on renewables and conservation as stated by worldwatch institute the end of the fossil fuel age is now in sight as the world lurches from one energy crisis to another fossil fuel dependence threatens at every turn to derail the global economy or disrupt its environmental support systems if we are to ensure healthy and prosperous world for future generations only few decades remain to redirect the energy economy18 this view was reflected in speech of president clinton on april 21 1993 the challenge of global climate change must be clarion call not for more bureaucracy or regulation or unnecessary costs but instead for american ingenuity and creativity to produce the best and most energyefficient technology the focus on technology was evident in the clinton administrations 1993 climate change action plan 16 for further discussion see crs report rl34621 capturing co2 from coalfired power plants challenges for comprehensive strategy by larry parker peter folger and deborah d stine 17 see crs report rl33654 alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles issues in congress by brent yacobucci 18 christopher flavin and nicholas lenssen beyond the petroleum age designing solar economy washington dc worldwatch institute december 1990 p 5 crs7 these longterm policies must address technologies of energy supply and use and condition markets for the longterm transition away from activities fuels and technologies that generate large emissions of greenhouse gases the policies contained in the action plan are directed primarily at creating effective markets for investments in existing or nearly commercially available technology that reduce greenhouse gas emissions the core of long term strategy must ensure that constant stream of improved technology is available and that market conditions are favorable to their adoption the action plan is likely to stimulate modest acceleration in technological development such gains will lay the foundation for the development of technologies that could contribute to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in both the united states and abroad research and development into the technologies that could contribute to greenhouse gas emission reductions will be critical part of the long term effort19 these views were reiterated in president clintons 1998 6 billion climate change technology initiative as stated by then national economic council chair gene sperling we think that this climate change initiative package is very good example of what we spoke about when we said that there were winwin opportunities for positive incentives that would clearly show how we can address the issue of climate change and strengthen our economy at the same time20 this winwin perspective on climate change policy also represented the core of the george w bush administrations approach the president stated that his alternative could grow our economy and at the same time through technologies improve our environment21 in supporting his new national climate change technology initiative he stated americas the leader in technology and innovation we all believe technology offers great promise to significantly reduce emissions especially carbon capture storage and sequestration technologies so were creating the national climate change technology initiative to strengthen research at universities and national labs to enhance partnerships in applied research to develop improved technology for measuring and monitoring 19 william j clinton and albert gore jr the climate change action plan october 1993 p 29 20 as reported in daily environment report administration announces 63 billion plan of spending tax credits to curb emissions february 2 1998 p aa1 21 response to questions by president george w bush at the national security agencys operations center fort meade md june 4 2002 reported in bush defends voluntary policy to slow emissions rather than mandating cuts daily environment report june 5 2002 p a13 crs8 gross and net greenhouse gas emissions and to fund demonstration projects for cuttingedge technologies such as bioreactors and fuel cells22 this technology focus also is the central element of the asiapacific partnership to facilitate the development diffusion deployment and transfer of existing emerging and longer term costeffective cleaner more efficient technologies and practices among the partners through concrete and substantial cooperation so as to achieve practical results23 looking through the technological lens policymakers may see technological development as costeffective thus improving the economy not penalizing it this winwin perspective appeared clearly in the george w bush administrations 2002 climate action report president george w bush said last year 2001 that technology offers great promise to significantly and costeffectively reduce emissions in the long term our national circumstances our prosperity and our diversity may shape our response to climate change but our commitment to invest in innovative technologies and research will ensure the success of our response24 according to proponents the cost of technological approach to the climate change issue appears to net out to zero or even to save money depending on how the benefits from increased efficiency are estimated the technological lens tends to focus costbenefit analysis on bottomup methodology that evaluates the relative costs of projected compliance techniques as summarized by national academy of sciences technological costing develops estimates on the basis of variety of assumptions about the technical aspects together with estimates often more than guesses of the costs of implementing the required technology25 assumptions are technological in terms of technological performance economic in terms of costeffectiveness and behavioral in terms of penetration rates in the year 2000 does five national laboratories oak ridge lawrence berkeley argonne national renewable energy and pacific northwest estimated the benefits of technological approach for reducing carbon emissions26 the five laboratories analyzed scenarios for technologies to reduce carbon emissions in cost effective manner see table 1 in discussing their results the national laboratories concluded 22 statement of president george w bush on global change

source interlaboratory working group scenarios for clean energy future november 2000 such conclusion raises the question if technological fixes such as enhanced energy efficiency could actually save money why arent people voluntarily doing it now one possible answer is that the projections are wrong the technological fixes are mirages and the market has correctly ignored them an alternative answer the one focused on by the technology lens is that widespread commercialization of these technologies is blocked by technological economic or institutional barriers for example barrier might be that the initial cost of an energy efficient appliance is higher than lower efficiency alternative even though the lifetime cost is less this can be barrier to purchaser who is not aware of the comparative life time costs andor who cannot afford the upfront cost despite the longterm savings an activist viewing the problem through the technology lens would look to methods for overcoming that barrier such as providing information on lifetime costs andor financial help technology proponents tend to look favorably on governmental assistance in overcoming such barriers this assistance can include public sector research development and demonstration efforts incentives to private enterprise through direct funding beneficial tax treatment for research expenditures and costsharing programs to help overcome technical barriers and to improve the conditions for commercialization governmental subsidies to technology regulatory interventions that create markets for new technologies and regulations to address institutional and market barriers such as energy efficiency labeling requirements some of these incentives eg hybrid and fuel cell vehicles tax credits were enacted as part of the energy policy act of 2005 and increased energyrelated research and development funding was authorized by the energy independence and security act of 2007 key issue in lowcarbon technological development has been volatile energy prices while high energy prices create investment opportunities in new technologies eg solar and wind generation of electricity alternative fuels for autos low prices 27 ibid p 128 crs10 diminish the attractiveness of those investment options as discussed in the next section carbon tax or capandtrade program could create more positive long term investment climate for energy alternatives by establishing predictable floor for prices of highcarbon energy sources the technology lens focuses attention on two basic issues what drives technological development and what barriers impede it from this perspective government can help stimulate the former and help remove the latter for those who envision technological fixes that can achieve environmental goals with minimal economic costs governmental intervention may be necessary antidote to market failures and unnecessary barriers but even for those who would rely primarily on markets and minimize the role of government the technological perspective is considered optimistic dynamic and oriented toward the future economic lens background viewing environmental issues through an economic lens focuses attention on markets price signals and market imperfections in this view the recognition of environmental problems should lead to adjustments in market signals changing producers inputs and handling of wastes as well as the composition and level of consumer demand so as to maximize net social welfare cleaning the environment entails costs which can be weighed against benefits the governments role in this scenario is to ensure the correct market signals to ensure correct signals the government can make consumers and producers aware of information on economic costs and benefits adjust prices through taxes or fees and affect supply through tradeable permits for products as with leaded gasoline in the early 1980s or for productionrelated emissions as with sulfur dioxide emissions or through other marketoriented devices viewed through the economic lens the marketplace with the correct signals can operate to find the optimal solution economic considerations have been an explicit or implicit part of environmental policymaking since environmental quality became federal issue in the 1960s the use of economic mechanisms to implement environmental goals was debated in the 1960s and early 1970s but usually rejected on various grounds28 excluding economic considerations from environmental protection proved difficult however as laws began to be implemented economic costs became increasingly consequential although generally masked under practical or feasibility concerns 28 see for example steven kelman what price incentives economists and the environment boston auburn publishing co 1981 crs11 as achievement of some environmental standards within specified deadlines proved impossible automobile standards were delayed ozone compliance was postponed and other issues were litigated economic concepts began to reemerge in the debate over the environment with the need to extend deadlines and to provide more flexibility to polluters to achieve mandated standards29 the preferred economic approach to environmental problems traditionally is the pollution tax economists observe that pollution imposes costs on society that are not incorporated in the price of the goods or services responsible for the pollution these are called external costs an ideal pollution tax internalizes these external costs by making the beneficiary of the polluting activity pay for the socially borne costs polluter pays as long as polluters find it costeffective to reduce their emissions to avoid paying the tax they would add pollution controls until further controls would have higher incremental costs than the tax likewise innovators would be encouraged to develop new technology that reduce emissions at cost less than the pollution tax when the tax is set at the level at which the marginal costs of more control would equal the marginal benefits society gains by future reductions societys net welfare is maximized despite the theoretical benefits of the pollution tax methodology environmental taxes have received limited practical use in the united states for technical as well as political reasons30 there are existing us models of an emissions tax although five european countries finland the netherlands sweden denmark and norway have carbonbased taxes the closest us example is tax on chemicals that deplete stratospheric ozone 31 with the economists favor for pollution taxes not gaining policymakers adherence attention shifted to other economic mechanisms to increase polluters flexibility in achieving environmental standards based upon regulation unlike tax that focuses on the price demand for pollutant these mechanisms focus on the quantity supply of the pollutant permitted the tradeable allowance system for sulfur dioxide control in the acid rain program title iv of the clean air act amendments of 1990 represented significant step in the evolution of economic mechanisms commonly called cap 29 for background see crs report 94213 marketbased environmental management issues in implementation by john l moore et 30 steven kelman what price incentives economists and the environment boston auburn publishing co 1981 31 to facilitate the phaseout of ozonedepleting chemicals required under the montreal protocol and subsequent amendments the united states imposed tax on the production or importation of certain chemicals including chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs in 1990 this tax was designed to supplement the allowance trading program that the epa had designed to implement the international agreements also inventories of certain cfcs held on january 1 of each year are subjected to floor stocks tax crs12 andtrade system the acid rain control programs success has led to calls for use of similar system with other pollutants including carbon dioxide32 capandtrade program like title ivs is based on two premises first set amount of pollutant such as so2 emitted by human activities can be assimilated by the ecological system without undue harm thus the goal of the program is to put ceiling or cap on the total emissions of the pollutant rather than limit ambient concentrations second market in pollution rights between polluters is the most costeffective means of achieving given reduction this market in pollution rights or allowances each of which in the acid rain program is equal to one ton of so2 is designed so that owners of allowances can trade those allowances with other emitters who need them or retain bank them for future use or sale thus the allowance has value and hence becomes in effect the price of emitting sulfur while marketbased mechanisms such as cap and trade are sometimes regarded as the private markets alternative to regulatory commandandcontrol program the interactions are more complex the socalled market for pollution rights would not exist if not for governmental role in altering what the market would do in the absence of governmental action if governmental regulations did not restrict so2 emissions there would be need for so2 allowances government creates the market and defines the boundaries of acceptable market responses under the so2 trading program facilities may buy allowances to meet necessary reductions instead of installing equipment to control pollution33 the choice depends on cost by allowing polluters to choose their lowest cost abatement actions implementing environmental goals through market mechanisms represents general elevation of economic efficiency as the sine qua non of decisionmaking pragmatically achieving this efficiency presumes substantially complete knowledge by producers and consumers of costs abatement alternatives and product substitutions as well as substantial flexibility in achieving compliance the market approach simultaneously maintains the general principle of polluter pays as the underlying ethical rationale for the distribution of costs among parties through the market the polluter who pays includes not only the producer but also labor stockholders and the consumer who demands the product and who pays somewhat more for the embedded costs to control pollution those viewing environmental policy through the economic lens generally presume that governmental interference whether through subsidies or regulation should be minimal in reality the distribution of impacts through the market often leads to calls for political interventions that compromise efficiency and the polluter pays principle the political process tends to weigh relevant differences between various groups affected by an environmental mandate and special treatment may be deemed necessary to promote justice or fairness for example the sulfur dioxide 32 see crs report rl33799 climate change design approaches for greenhouse gas reduction program by larry parker 33 however emissions may not cause ambient levels to exceed the national ambient air quality standard for so2 regardless of how many allowances the owners of emitting facilities hold crs13 allowance system contains numerous special allocations of allowances to various groups that argued for special consideration due to past current or future situations these special allocations represent subsidies to these groups that strict polluter pays principle would not allow thus the polluterpays principle is not distributional principle that policymakers will necessarily treat independently of other concerns and criteria the economic lens reflects traditional american belief in individual choice and private markets given the correct price signals producers and consumers will adjust their behavior accordingly this adjustment will be done in the most cost efficient manner and with minimum of governmental involvement consumers desires are seen as responsive to price the issue then is for the price to reflect the costs of relevant externalities with the right price supply and demand will find the level that maximizes social welfare34 policymakers using the economic lens see consumers and producers adjusting their behaviors to the new reality of an environmental problem by responding to the price signals that take into account particular environmental goal but this approach creates clear winners and losers in terms of who will profit and who will pay the tab as result policymakers adjust governmental intervention to achieve change at pace and impact that are socially and politically acceptable application to global climate change the economic lens focuses policymakers on marketbased approaches to address global climate change these include marketable permit allowance programs and various taxes fees and rebates as well as research and development education and marketrelated information current proposals for controlling carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions center on either marketable permits programs loosely based on the current sulfur dioxide program or on carbon tax35 meanwhile the members of the european union in addressing their obligations under the kyoto protocol have established co2 trading program that covers about half their total co2 emissions36 in addition finland the netherlands sweden denmark and norway have imposed carbon taxes debate in the united states about implementing carbon reductions has focused on tradeable permits as manifested by numerous bills introduced in the us congress eg s 2191 in the 110th congress though occasionally voice for carbon taxes is heard37 the inclusion of domestic and international emissions 34 as american enterprise institute scholar kenneth p green says the right thing to do is to tax the environmental harms that energy demonstrably creates and let the market sort it out the best policy on subsidies is to simply ditch them aei short publications posted january 29 2007 at httpwwwaeiorgpublicationspubid25532pub_detailasp 35 see crs report rl33799 climate change design approaches for greenhouse gas reduction

post february continued crs14 trading systems and international joint implementation programs to implement any emission reduction requirements were key element of the clinton administrations negotiating position at kyoto while rejecting the kyoto protocol the george w bush administrations climate change initiative acknowledged the potential use for trading programs to address climate change the initiative directed the secretary of energy to recommend ways to ensure that entities that register reductions under current voluntary initiatives were not penalized under future climate policy and to give transferable credits to companies that achieve real reductions in addition the administration stated if in 2012 we find that we are not on track toward meeting our goal and sound science justifies further policy action the united states will respond with additional measures that may include broad marketbased program38 numerous bills have been introduced in congress to mandate substantial reductions in co2 emissions implemented through nationwide tradeable permit program and twice the senate has voted on proposals in the 108th congress s 139 which would have imposed mandatory capandtrade greenhouse gas reduction program failed in 2003 on 4355 vote in 2005 similar initiative was considered as an amendment during the senate debate on the energy policy act of 2005 and defeated on 3860 vote these proposals would have capped us greenhouse gas emissions with the cap being implemented through tradeable permit program to encourage efficient reductions although these initiatives failed 13 senators introduced samdt 866 during the debate on the energy policy act of 2005 it stated that it is the sense of the senate that the congress should enact comprehensive and effective national program of mandatory marketbased limits and incentives on greenhouse gases that slow stop and reverse the growth of such emissions the resolution passed by voice vote after motion to table it failed on 4354 vote subsequently in the 110th congress the environment and public works committee approved s 2191 to establish capandtrade system for greenhouse gas emissions as amended on december 5 2007 by vote of 118 the bill was reported srept 110337 may 20 2008 and senate debate on modified version of the bill s 3036 began june 2 motion to invoke cloture failed however june 6 on vote of 4836 the generally acclaimed success of the sulfur dioxide program notwithstanding it may not translate easily to marketable permit program for carbon dioxide fundamental differences exist for example the acid rain program involves over 2000 new and existing electric generating facilities that contribute twothirds of the countrys sulfur dioxide and onethird of its nitrogen oxide emissions the two primary precursors of acid rain this concentration of sources makes the logistics of allowance trading administratively manageable and enforceable however carbon dioxide emission sources are not so concentrated although over 95 of the co2 generated from human activities comes from fossil fuel combustion only about 40 37 continued 6 2007 p a17 38 white house global climate change policy

use for about 12 and direct industrial use for about 15 small dispersed sources in transportation residentialcommercial and the industrial sectors are far more important in controlling co2 emissions than they are in controlling so2 emissions this would create significant problems in administering and enforcing tradeable permit program that attempts to be comprehensive or equitable39 these concerns multiply as the global nature of the climate change issue is considered along with other potential greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide40 in the view of most economists carbon tax would be the most efficient approach to controlling co2 emissions41 the approach is generally conceived as levy on natural gas petroleum and coal according to their carbon content in the approximate ratio of 06 to 08 to 10 respectively with the millions of emitters involved in controlling co2 the advantages of tax are selfevident imposed on an input basis administrative burdens such as stack monitoring to determine compliance would be reduced also carbon tax would have the broad effect across the economy that some feel is necessary to achieve longterm reductions in emissions in other ways tax system merely changes the forum rather than the substance of the policy debate because paying an emissions tax becomes an alternative to controlling emissions the debate over the amount of reductions necessarily becomes debate over the level of tax imposed those wanting large reductions quickly would want high tax imposed over short period of time those more concerned with the potential economic burden of carbon tax would want low tax imposed at later time with possible exceptions for various events taxing emissions basically would remain an implementation strategy policy determinations such as tax levels would require politicalregulatory decisions also tax would raise revenues the disposition of these revenues would significantly affect the economic and distributional impacts of the tax the difficulties in crafting carbon tax or multinational trading program should not be underestimated with the 1997 kyoto protocol now in force many countries that ratified the protocol have developed appropriate implementation strategies to begin reducing their emissions of greenhouse gases in particular the european union eu decided to establish an emission trading scheme as cornerstone of its efforts to meet its obligation under the kyoto protocol in deciding on this scheme the european commission ec adopted an initial learningby 39 on distributional effects of carbon trading see congressional budget office who gains and who pays under carbonallowance trading the distributional effects of alternative policy designs june 2000 40 for discussion of the emerging

of the program had series of problems including overallocation of allowances thin trading volumes and other issues that resulted in very volatile market from high of about 30 euro per allowance in 2005 the allowance price dropped to less than 1 euro by mid2007 the 20082012 kyoto compliance phase of the european trading system has been adjusted to address some of the problems identified in the first phase resulting in more stable and mature market system42 more improvements are planned for the next phase beginning in 2013 the choice between tradeable permit approach and tax approach depends in part on ones sensitivity to the uncertainty in the benefits of reductions in greenhouse gases versus the uncertainty in the costs of the program those confident of the benefits to be received from reducing greenhouse gases tend to focus on the quantity of pollutants emitted and to argue for specific mandated emission level for example the kyoto agreement mandates specific allowable emission level based on historical baseline 19901995 depending on the gas for specific compliance period 20082012 while ceiling is placed on emissions ceiling is placed on control costs implementing such reduction program through marketbased scheme such as tradeable permit program would probably assure that the costs would be dealt with efficiently through the marketplace however those costs are not capped this is the approach used under the current so2 control program after decade results indicate that control costs under the so2 program are considerably less than they would have been under an alternative command and control scheme however there is lid on the costs which may rise in the future as growth in electricity generation pushes against the cap on emissions alternatively tax in effect places ceiling on control costs although the actual reductions achieved are subject to some uncertainty for example if carbon tax of 100 ton were levied polluter would pay more than 100 ton to reduce carbon emissions thus under worstcase conditions the program costs would be 100 ton however the actual reductions that such tax might achieve would have to be estimated based on economic simulations or actual monitoring reductions would not be guaranteed as any polluter could choose to pay the tax rather than to reduce emissions reductions could also vary over time as new technology or other events raise or lower the cost of reducing emissions carbon tax or tradeable permit program would affect economic behavior in at least three ways 1 effectively reduce real income through higher prices and therefore reduce overall consumption of goods particularly in the shortterm 2 encourage manufacturers and consumers to substitute less carbonintensive or carbon free energy sources for current carbonintensive ie fossil fuel energy sources and 3 encourage research and development of innovative less carbon intensive or more energy efficient technologies and their penetration into the marketplace the ability and efficiency of the economy in making these adjustments over specified period of time would largely determine the impact of market 42 for more information see crs report rl34150 climate change and the eu emissions trading scheme ets kyoto and beyond by larry parker crs17 induced rise in the costs of energy generated from fossil fuels either through carbon tax or marketable permit program depending on the reduction achieved and the model employed annual gross domestic product gdp losses resulting from carbon control are estimated to range from less than 1 to more than 4 with most falling into range of 1 to 3 if carbon tax were chosen that tax would generate revenues revenues sufficiently large to affect aggregate consumer demand it is the contractionary pressure of these tax revenues that the congressional budget office cbo cites as the major reason for projected loss of 2 in us gdp from 100 per ton carbon tax phased in over 10 years43 the disposition of those tax revenues would greatly affect the impact of the carbon tax on the economy thus the impact of carbon tax on the economy would depend on combination of policies beyond just the level of the tax the tax level necessary to achieve given reduction is also subject to wide range of estimates the stanford energy modeling forum compared 13 models under series of control scenarios with common assumptions where possible including one that would have stabilized carbon emissions at 1990 levels by the year 200044 about half of the models studied estimated the carbon tax necessary to meet the stabilization target in the year 2000 to be about 30 per ton or less while the other half estimated the necessary carbon tax to be about 100 or more further studies by the stanford energy modeling forum on the cost to comply with the kyoto protocol and on the global compliance cost of various stabilization scenarios resulted in similarly wide range of estimated tax levels45 because the problem of greenhouse gas emissions is seen in terms of internalizing currently external cost the economic lens implies that the marketplace is the most efficient means of controlling undesirable pollutants the private sector can solve the problem if given sufficient incentive with minimal governmental interference the governments role primarily consists of providing marketbased signal to private industry about the external cost eg emission taxes tradeable permits etc in reality the governments role is more involved for taxes this includes determining the tax level any phasingin period escalation and recycling of revenues received for permits this includes the total numbers of permits allowed initial allocation formulas any phasing in period penalties transaction procedures and tax liability while an economic approach would supplement the policy process in implementing greenhouse gas reduction program it would not be substitute for basic policy decisions and oversight 43

overall perspective of the economic lens private initiative economic costeffectiveness concern about impact of environmental policy on economic policy cost aversion and reliance on market forces ecological approach background the development of environmental protection as national policy concern has reflected three factors 1 the development of an environmental consciousness among the electorate 2 change in the climate of decisionmaking among individuals businesses and government at all levels 3 the availability of opportunities to make concrete decisions based on environmental grounds either in addition to or in opposition to other criteria including economic ones the underlying basis of an environmental consciousness is an understanding of the interconnectedness of the planets biological processes and recognition that changes caused by humans may have ecological effects beyond those intended or foreseen from this perspective it is in humanitys selfinterest as well as in the interests of nonhuman life to protect the basic biological processes that are the foundation of all life humans can protect those processes by being conscious of humanitys environmental impact and by avoiding or mitigating that impact to the greatest extent necessary accepting that some impact is unavoidable and that ecological science has crucial role in discovering the effects of human activities seminal characterization of the ecological perspective is sand county almanac by aldo leopold46 he suggested that humankind has developed two ethical dimensions the first dealing with the relation between individuals and the second with the relation between the individual and society but said leopold there is as yet ethic dealing with mans relation to land and to the animals and plants which grow upon it the extension of ethics to this third element in human environment is if i read the evidence correctly an evolutionary possibility and an ecological necessity47 describing the need for an ecological conscience leopold concluded that the environmental problem is one of attitudes and implements the development of land ethic requires an internal change in our intellectual emphasis loyalties affections and convictions48 46 aldo leopold sand county almanac with essays on conservation from round river new york ballantine books 1970 pp 237264 47 ibid p 239 48 ibid pp 263 246 some viewing global climate change through the ecological lens see in the longterm risks an indictment of the lifestyle and economic structure of western society viewpoint profoundly disturbing to others who do not look through the same lens as noted by leopold an environmental ethic imposes new obligations calls for sacrifice and changes existing values crs19 the challenge of the ecological approach was given global scope by the brundtland report of the world commission on environment and development articulating the goal of sustainable development its forward described the challenge this way if we do not succeed in putting our message of urgency through to todays parents and decision makers we risk undermining our childrens fundamental right to healthy lifeenhancing environment unless we are able to translate our words into language that can reach the minds and hearts of people young and old we shall not be able to undertake the extensive social changes needed to correct the course of development we call for common endeavor and for new norms of behavior at all levels and in the interests of all the changes in attitudes in social values and in aspirations that the report urges will depend on vast campaigns of education debate and public participation49 the idea of sustainable development suggests future generations should enjoy the same opportunities for meaningful and fulfilling lives as the current generation sustainable society has been defined as one that satisfies its needs without jeopardizing the prospects of future generations50 the concept thus serves as an umbrella to encourage development of renewable resources and conservation of non renewable resources51 the emergence of the ecological perspective or the land ethic or sustainable development is manifest in new values and practices of individuals businesses and government within the federal government the national environmental policy act of 1969 represented watershed in establishing the principle that major federal decisions should publically disclose and take into account environmental impacts originally resisted by many agencies the idea of assessing the environmental consequences of decisions through environmental impact statements has now become routine also over the past two decades the federal government has taken steps to foster public awareness of environmental values through support for environmental education in addition the federal government has used procurement policies to support environmental goals for example by requiring purchases of paper of specified recycling content and authorizing payment of premium for it and has revised statutes to make federal facilities subject to these requirements 49 our common future new york oxford university press 1987

confrontational relationship between federal environmental policymakers and industry consequence often attributable to the commandandcontrol regulatory approach to environmental policy industry itself has increasingly recognized that community environmental values are part of the social milieu in which industrial production occurs 1994 article in the chemical industry publication chemical week reviewed the industrys perceptions of pollution control it noted that in the early 1970s most corporations viewed environmental management as threat and that pollution control expenditures were nonrecoverable investments52 the article observed that in 1970 economist milton friedman described the actions of any company making pollution control expenditures beyond that required by law in order to contribute to the social objective of improving the environment as pure and unadulterated socialism in contrast the article said that major corporations currently are espousing the benefits of proactive environmental management stewardship and environmental leadership the chemical industry which was suffering from poor public perceptions particularly after the bhopal incident was at the forefront of this shift as indicated by remarks of robert luft senior vice president of du pont chemicals our continued existence requires that we excel in safety and environmental performance we must shift our mindset from meeting regulations to meeting public expectations53 this new attitude or climate of decisionmaking is providing many businesses and individuals with new alternatives and opportunities to choose environmentally preferred options either in concert with more traditionally based economic criteria or in opposition to such selfinterestbased criteria for example the chemical industry today sponsors an international responsible care campaign54 and prodded by environmental groups and epa the american chemistry council acc has committed the industry to testing of highuse chemicals55 an independent but related acc initiative is the green chemistry institute nonprofit organization with the mission of promoting pollution prevention using economically sustainable clean production technologies56 in addition epa and the american chemical society jointly sponsor annual green chemistry challenge awards to recognize pollution prevention through innovative chemistry the first green chemistry award was presented in 1996 52 34 years of environmental strategy chemical week august 24 1994 27 53 robert vd luft protecting the environment its good business remarks at the

httpwwwuslriorg and httpwwwepagovchemrtk 56 see httpchemistryorggreenchemistryinstitute crs21 individuals as consumers and citizens are also exercising options to express an environmental consciousness that extends beyond immediate economic selfinterest consumers responses to such environmental problems as solid waste disposal indicate that individual behavior and community programs can and will reflect environmental values for example recycling programs have increased in recent years despite questionable economics and the significant consumer inconveniences involved such trend suggests the power of aesthetics and the perceived intrinsic value of the environment as force which influences peoples preferences and priorities likewise driven by public demand several states offer electricity consumers the opportunity to purchase green power ie electricity produced from renewable energy and other lowpolluting sources rather than power produced from conventional more polluting sources57 the ecological lens magnifies elements that are psychological philosophical and theological58 policy decision to address pollution problem generally involves sophisticated and sometimes lengthy educational process of which economics and technological availability are only components in this view environmental education smokey the bear and environmental interest groups from the audubon society to greenpeace to population connection represent efforts to inculcate the sense of moral obligation toward the environment to acculturate people to the importance of the environment as essential to longterm human health and welfare such efforts can promote climate of opinion in which environmentally responsible decisions are socially endorsed and environmentally irresponsible decisions are stigmatized as not socially acceptable pollution protection gets on the national agenda not on the basis of affordability or whether control technology exists but because an environmental problem is recognized as threat to human health or welfare the ecological approach views the problem of environmental policy implementation to be the moral education of individuals and institutions to the dimensions of the ecological crisis changing the climate in which decisions are made and providing opportunities for individuals and institutions to make decisions based on ecological concerns rather than having those choices limited to alternatives dictated solely by economic criteria application to global climate change one could argue that global climate change is the quintessential issue for an ecological lens as it so clearly involves farreaching dimensions including the standing of future generations non human life and distributional justice around the globe the ecological lens provides decision criterion in the face of uncertainty or of competing preferences aldo leopold observed that the land ethic may be regarded as mode of guidance for meeting ecological situations so new or intricate or involving such deferred reactions that the path of social expediency is not discernible to the average individual59 situation is better described as so new and intricate or as having such deferred reactions than global climate change 57 for more information on green electricity markets see the doe website at httpwwweereenergygovgreenpowermarketsindexshtml 58 leopold noted that ezekiel and isaiah decried the despoliation of the land 59 leopold p 239 crs22 an ecological perspective on global climate change focuses attention on an enlightened public to implement stewardship through changed value system numerous international and domestic entities are supporting activities to foster governmental corporate and public awareness of the global climate change issue and to encourage remedial actions other entities provide neutral information and analysis on the issue and still others actively lobby against the viewpoint that action is justified at this time these organizations support activities that translate into concrete actions through variety of mechanisms including voluntary programs for businesses and alternative green options that allow for individual consumers to make ecologically responsible decisions even when they cost more than do traditional choices the current umbrella for activities to foster action is the framework convention on climate change under which range of activities from research and development to education are sponsored manifesting the ecological perspective the framework convention defines the signatories objective to be the protection of ecosystems from dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in sustainable manner60 economic and human concerns are seen as interdependent with ecological processes the potential policy agenda could include virtually all human endeavors and relationships from industrial policy to northsouth equity from population policy to energy policy from domestic concerns to the restructuring of international institutions from the ecological perspective achieving such broad policy agenda would require an active federal governmental role that involves educating the citizenry about the need to act on the risk of global climate change providing the public with role model in terms of governments own decisions and priorities and developing opportunities for individuals to make ecologically responsible decisions even if those decisions are not economic in traditional sense the federal role has included four kinds of activities that reflect environmental stewardship first making decisions that take into account potential consequences for global climate change and taking actions that support and promote environmentally friendly products or processes for example through procurement policies or through product labeling second internationally exploring the possibilities of achieving consensus on further greenhouse gas emissions reductions and on interrelated economic and human issues third supporting education of the public on environmental concerns generally and about global climate change specifically and fostering the inculcation of environmental values in educational programs 60 united nations framework convention on climate change article 2 the united states is party to the framework convention on climate change crs23 fourth fostering mechanisms that permit the public to express their environmental values in everyday decisionmaking similar activities are being promoted through various corporate and nonprofit initiatives as well for example 1998 corporate initiative under the auspices of the pew center on global climate change61 was created to engage business in developing efficient effective solutions to the climate problem accepting the views of most scientists that enough is known about the science and environmental impacts of climate change for us to take actions to address its consequences the center believes businesses can and should take concrete steps now in the us and abroad to assess their opportunities for emission reductions establish and meet their emission reduction objectives and invest in new more efficient products practices and technologies besides this commitment to stewardship major companies and other organizations are working together through the center to educate the public on the risks challenges and solutions to climate change undertaking studies and policy analyses that will add new facts and perspectives to the climate change debate in key areas such as economic and environmental impacts and equity issues and engaging in an international effort designed to increase the global understanding of market mechanisms and to work with developing countries to assess emission reduction opportunities the ecological perspective emerges from individual actions both in terms of support for educational endeavors as in support for environmental interest groups as well as through market choices based on ecological impacts rather than on pure economic costs indeed these actions can go against prevailing economic or technological trends for example people may choose to pay more for product or service because it is perceived as being more green or climate friendly than alternatives based on traditional economic or technological considerations in sense customer preferences can outrun the marketplace by creating demand for product that producers did not anticipate in such cases economic and technological mechanisms follow the ecological imperative rather than defining limits to it as noted earlier some states now offer consumers green electricity alternative to conventionally produced electricity in response to consumer demand many actions to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases can serve multiple social ends such as energy conservation and pollution prevention that are thought to improve the economic efficiency with which human needs are met governments and corporations have taken lead in fostering energy conservation and efficiency in use particularly in developed countries in the us epa and doe sponsor range of energy efficiency programs under the rubric energy star to promote 61 the efforts are spearheaded by the centers business environmental leadership council with 44 member companies including alcoa american electric power bank of america boeing company bp duke

transportation industry utility and buildings sectors63 there is also an alliance to save energy nonprofit coalition of prominent business government environmental and consumer leaders who promote the efficient and clean use of energy worldwide arguing benefits for the environment the economy and national security64 while technological in thrust these epa and doe activities involve educating and informing prospective consumers to persuade them not only of potential cost savings but also of social benefits to be gained thus technology and markets can be the tool for meeting the moral imperative associated with by the ecological perspective65 internationally the george w bush administrations asiapacific partnership on clean development and climate has parallels it involves encouraging the partners including the developing china india and south korea to adopt more sustainable environmental policies especially in using energy sources and technologies that constrain greenhouse gas emissions similarly government and corporate initiatives for pollution prevention through for example source reduction and product stewardship foster systemic changes that have the potential to reduce global climate change risks epa estimates that its wastewise program voluntary partnership between epa and businesses to prevent waste recycle and buy and manufacture products with recycled materials reduced greenhouse gas emissions by more than 221 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 200766 thus from the ecological perspective with public more aware of the problem of global climate change and with the availability of relevant technological andor economic alternatives the implementation of the broader agenda through appropriate measures becomes possible making available options that permit people to exercise their moral obligation the three lenses and policy approaches each of the three lenses implies fundamentally different ways of assessing policy actions to address global climate change crucial variations emerge in perspectives on cost analysis scientific uncertainty and the role of government 62 see httpwwwenergystargov 63 see crs report rl33599 energy efficiency policy budget electricity conservation and fuel conservation issues by fred sissine 64 for more information see httpwwwaseorg 65 however some deep ecologists reject technological fixes and the use of market mechanisms on the grounds that they merely further nonsustainable system that needs to be replaced 66 personal communication jennifer brady epa waste wise program november 25 2008 crs25 cost analysis as viewed through the lenses the technological lens focuses attention on the outcome of the innovation actions are justified if they resolve the pollution problem and costs and benefits should be weighed in terms of the outcome not in terms of the transitional costs in contrast those viewing the issue through the economic lens tend to focus on costs and benefits as the critical metric for evaluating policies actions are justified when the benefits outweigh the costs but not otherwise the ecological perspective basically suggests that policy choices can be based on recognition of rights rather than costs and benefits the principles of protecting life and of preserving the ecosystem for future generations govern choices these differing viewpoints have implications for the timing and focus of invested resources looking through the technological lens policymaker would focus on investing resources directly in technical options some investment in understanding the problem may be necessary to delineate technical options but new technologies may make extensive research in understanding the problem moot as when process change eliminates use of chemical of concern looking through the economic lens policymaker would typically first invest resources in understanding the problem and the costs and benefits of alternatives that assessment would reveal whether society would be better off adopting policies and committing resources to action eg to reduce carbon dioxide emissions looking through the ecological lens policymaker who perceives risk to health andor ecological systems would tend to promote immediate action investments in understanding the problem and the costs and benefits would be undertaken only to the extent appropriate to ensure costeffectiveness of those actions because the ecological lens portrays benefits largely in noneconomic terms sustainability equity efforts to quantify and monetize those benefits may be viewed as inappropriate even immoral instead people are provided with alternatives to act on the problem allowing them to choose responsible option even if it costs more than traditionally defined economic option technological lens those using the technological lens see it as far sighted economically justifiable approach to global climate change technology is seen as the impetus for improved efficiency in the economy concomitant with improved environmental protection although the development of technology may be encouraged for variety of reasons its commercialization is ultimately based on costeffectiveness in terms of the substance of the environmental issue the user of the technological lens is typically agnostic or indifferent the current economic system is viewed as inefficient since it does not consider decisions on lifecycle basis when considered on this broader perspective reductions in carbon emissions may be possible at net costs to the economy even at net savings under the technological lens the parameters of cost analysis change concepts like lifecycle costs are pivotal in making the costeffectiveness case for new technology existing barriers institutional or financial to the rapid and widespread commercialization of new technologies are seen as artificial constraints to be overcome by government and individuals ultimately the development of new technologies can create new industries and new jobs changing the economic crs26 baseline the focus of analysis is on costeffectiveness of solutions not so much on the benefits of the policy economic lens the view through the economic lens fits the global climate change issue within the boundary of market economics the motivations of people in reducing pollution is unimportant the critical assumption is that people will act in their own selfinterest as dictated by price signals the global climate change issue becomes another consideration in setting prices an externality that needs to be internalized if that price increment does not result in significant reductions it is because none is economically justified under the economic lens the potential impacts of controlling greenhouse gases on the economy versus expected benefits is central variable in determining the degree and time frame of reductions economic efficiency is the primary criterion for assessing emission reduction programs any existing inefficiencies in the economic system are assumed to reflect market reality and to be difficult to eliminate and eliminating them may be undesirable uncertainty about the potential benefits is understood to be factor in determining the stringency of any reduction program and potential reason for stretching out compliance for this lens costbenefit analysis is very important in assessing potential control programs to the extent that new technologies are projected to be costeffective and to overcome any existing market barriers or distortions they are included in the costbenefit analysis as viable alternatives to existing control options ecological lens those looking through the ecological lens are suspicious of attempts to measure the economic effects of global climate change options most efforts to measure economic effect involve comparing carbon control scenario with baseline projection the baseline generally is defined as the path the economy would take assuming changes attributable to adoption of climate change policies however the baseline also tends to connote path with distortion it is the path from which distortions are measured this conveys some normative legitimacy on the baseline if global climate change arguments are correct then the current path is not sustainable in the long run and the baseline means little concern reflected in proposals to incorporate green accounting into major economic indicators such as the gross domestic product gdp67 arguably if an ecological perspective returned the actual path to longterm sustainability that scenario would represent the more reasonable baseline discussions of economic growth and distortions are relative to ones perspective on the longterm potential for economic growth in world with increasing carbon dioxide concentrations commonly those looking through the ecological lens tend to dismiss economic cost analysis and particularly costbenefit analysis as being of limited usefulness in the overall debate on global climate change while acknowledging that they can have utility in developing and choosing specific options from the ecological perspective people should respond to the global climate change crisis because of its threat to important values such as the fate of future generations not because action can be 67 carol s caron integrated economic and environmental satellite accounts survey of current business april 1994 3349 crs27 justified on the basis of some narrowly defined costbenefit analysis traditionally such analysis tends to place value only on those benefits that can be easily quantified while dismissing or ignoring many values that would be seen as governing through the ecological lens viewed through the ecological lens lives and such values as intergenerational equity should not be quantified as commodity68 what people need are alternatives to many of the choices that the marketplace provides based on traditionally defined economic considerations69 at the same time burgeoning area of study is ecological economics and in particular analyses to determine the economic benefits of ecosystems services which include climate regulation70 such studies may serve to defend environmental values that are rarely accounted for in traditional economic analyses they also provide another example of the intertwining of the viewpoints the role of science as viewed through the lenses although some would prefer that science dictate the timing and magnitude of environmental policymaking scientific knowledge actually represents continuum of knowledge and uncertainty policy initiatives go forward when sufficient majority of the society concludes that what is known about the problem outweighs the uncertainties or that the risks of delay despite uncertainty are not acceptable in some cases increases in knowledge about an environmental problem lead to more uncertainty not less in other cases increased knowledge about problem leads to widening the issue not narrowing it in the case of global climate change at least three parameters help determine how one is willing to balance the knowledgeuncertainty aspect of science these three parameters involve ones perception of the potential risk of the problem the potential effectiveness of any reduction program and the potential cost of the solution if one perceives the potential risk of the problem to be slight the potential effectiveness of any response to be questionable andor the potential cost to be high one will tend to require high threshold with respect to scientific certainty before one is willing to act conversely if one perceives the potential risk to be high the potential effectiveness of any response to be reasonable and the potential cost to be low one will likely be willing to act at substantially lower threshold with respect to scientific certainty 68 the ecological view was shown in the negative response to an economic analysis prepared for the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change the social costs of climate change greenhouse damage and benefits of control valued projected deaths of persons in oecd nations at 15 million each while deaths of persons from china india and africa were valued at 150000 each from an ecological or human rights standpoint the discrepancy surfaced ethical concerns see john adams

robert constanza et the value of the worlds ecosystem services and natural capital ecological economics 25 1998 315 originally published in nature 387 may 15 1997 253260 the issue contains number of comments on the article as well crs28 each of the three lenses contributes to differing views on these parameters and on different courses of action for example being optimistic that energy efficiency can be gained at low cost the technology lens can accept somewhat lower threshold with respect to scientific certainty because the risk of high cost is discounted likewise the ecological lens concern about unintended consequences and the protection of future generations lends itself to accepting lower threshold with respect to scientific certainty because of the precautionary need to protect the biosphere regardless of cost in contrast the economic lens leads one toward cost aversion response because the uncertainty may mean fewer benefits less effective response and potentially high cost those viewing the issue through this lens likely seek more certainty before any significant investment is made in any solution in study of the effects of personal beliefs and scientific uncertainty on climate change policy71 two researchers lave and dowlatabadi concluded that uncertainty and the degree of optimism of the decisionmaker were both important but less so than whether the policymakers decision criterion hinged on minimizing expected costs or on being as precautionary as possible the former criterion focused on costs essentially reflects the economic lens the latter focused on the precautionary principle essentially derives from the ecological lens in mix of scenarios lave and dowlatabadi found that those focused on minimizing expected costs would most often support moderate abatement given existing uncertainties while those focused on being precautionary would more often support stringent abatement despite costs this interplay of uncertainty information and costs is summarized in table 2 the perspective on uncertainty can have tangible policy implications as evidenced by the ongoing debate between those who believe action to address global climate change is justified and those who do not federal policy as viewed through the lenses faced with fundamental problem such as the potential for global climate change policymaker who is looking through the technological lens and focusing on technical fixes tends to take an activist view of the governments role to support innovation and commercialization in the same situation policymaker who is looking through the economic lens and focusing on the costs and benefits of action tends to view the governments role as limited to ensuring that any misfunctioning of the market is corrected and policymaker who is looking through the ecological lens and focusing on the need for action to solve the problem tends to see the government actively playing crucial roles to inform public understanding to seek public commitment and to make available options for solving the problem these differing propensities on the role of government among the three perspectives are summarized in table 3 as described in this report these differences have consequences for ones expectations for government action depending on the lens one views global climate change through at the same time 71 lester b lave and hadi dowlatabadi climate change the effects of personal beliefs and scientific uncertainty environmental science and technology vol 27 10 1993 pp 1968 1972 crs29 these differing expectations can have consequences for how one views the lenses themselves that is persons with predisposition for limited government are likely to find the economic lens more appropriate way to approach the issue than the other two lenses whereas persons with predisposition for activist government may be more comfortable with the technology andor ecological lenses crs30 table 2 influence of the lenses on policy parameters seriousness of risk in developing approach costs problem mitigation program by itself the lens is believes any reduction viewed from the bottom agnostic on the program should be up tends to see problem the focus of designed to maximize significant energy the lens is on opportunities for new inefficiencies in the developing new technology risk lies in current economic system technology that can be not developing technology that currently or technological justified from multiple by the appropriate time projected available criteria including focus on research technologies can economic

understands issue in believes that economic viewed from the top terms of quantifiable costs should be examined down tends to see costbenefit analysis against economic benefits gradual improvement in

economic costs and benefits are imposing costs in excess of gdp loss resulting measured of benefits any chosen from global climate unquantifiable reduction goal should be change control programs uncertainty tends to be implemented through typical loss estimates ignored economic measures such range from 1 to 2 of as tradeable permits or gdp emission taxes understands issues in rather than economic views costs from an terms of its potential costs and benefits or ethical perspective in threat to basic values technological opportunity terms of the ecological including ecological effective protection of the values that global viability and the well planets ecosystems climate change threatens being of future should be the primary believes that values such generations such criterion in determining as intergenerational values reflect the specifics of any equity should not be ecological ecological and ethical reduction program focus considered commodities considerations of program should be on to be bought and sold adherents see attempts altering values and costs are defined to convert them into broadening consumer broadly to include commodities to be choices aesthetic and bought and sold as environmental values trivializing the issue that economic analysis cannot readily quantify and monetize crs31 table 3 summary of lenses approach view of the problem guiding principles role of government problem seen as technology can solve create market through opportunity for new many of the problems technological more efficient involved if so directed mandates technology country seen as on the edge of governmental economic assistance an energy transition sponsorship of and through research and technological intervention in development technological sponsored by the development can government accelerate the commercialization of appropriate technology problem seen in terms the marketplace is the provide market of internalizing most efficient means of based signal to private currently external cost controlling undesirable industry about the pollutants external cost eg emission taxes private sector can tradeable permits economic solve problem given etc appropriate incentives with minimal governmental interference prices are the best signal problem seen in terms if people have all the encourage climate of individual and relevant information in which institutional behavior about choices and have environmentally influenced by societal the choice they will responsible decisions values and education make the responsible are more socially choice prices cannot acceptable and less signal all essential responsible decisions values are stigmatized ecological through public people do not currently education and fully understand the policies implications of their behavior the ensure availability of economic system and green options for current technologies consumers also restrict the available choices crs32 conclusion balancing the three lenses to develop policy the technological economic and ecological lenses represent ways of viewing responses to environmental problems none is inherently more right or correct than another rather they overlap and to varying degrees complement and conflict with each other most people hold to each of the lenses in varying degrees and combinations for example person who is quite concerned about the potential of global climate change from an ecological perspective but concerned also about the economic costs and the effectiveness of reduction program might see regrets policy as most prudent under the circumstances in contrast an ecological perspective combined with strong technological perspective would see reason for not pushing forward with strong reduction program without delay third possibility could be risk aversion perspective deriving from costbenefit concerns combined with technological perspective combination that could lead one to strong research and development program combined with phasedin and selective technological incentives based on potential costeffectiveness the combination of possibilities are many depending on the depth of commitment to any one perspective or to any particular aspect seriousness effectiveness costs of the problem table 3 summarizes the three lenses identified in this report as indicated they reflect differing assumptions about the nature of the problem the means to solution and the governmental role in crafting that solution the lenses are not mutually exclusive but rather reflect differing emphases on what is very complex issue these different emphases can be seen when examining the lenses according to different policymaking criteria the governmental role differs substantially between the lenses in actual implementation any global climate change response would involve the government in multiple roles promoting new technology ensuring that the marketplace functions properly and educating the public table 4 presents other policymaking criteria once again one sees conflict and complementarity across the different lenses eliminating nonmarket barriers can be key to technological development removal that those peering through the economic lens would likely see as appropriate although difficult similarly those employing the technological lens have objection to the ecological orientation of those using that lens although they might question the need for such considerations especially since those looking through the ecological lens might demand such thorough analysis of the implications of new technologies that its costs of development could be greatly increased or its adoption might be delayed however those viewing through the economic lens might object to the perspective given by the ecological lens if it were to give weight to values or concerns that could not be justified through costbenefit analysis analysis to which those peering through the ecological lens might object crs33 table 4 review of lenses across different policymaking criteria approach economic efficiency effectiveness implementation depends on the cost tends to be very effective implementation is effectiveness of the at eliminating emissions straightforward once technologies developed however the effectiveness technology has been technological subject to considerable sometimes comes at the developed uncertainty during the expense of economic research and development efficiency stage depends on the effectiveness depends on implementation is functioning of the the level of taxnumber of straightforward from marketplace and how any permits allowed and the governmental economic distortions are existence of any non perspective economic handled market barrier to providing the private compliance sector with the maximum flexibility to respond to the markets signals depends on altered values can be very effective over implementation and broadened consumer the longterm however involves choices economic the timeframe involved is combination of public efficiency is redefined to unclear education and public ecological include ecological values policy to provide such as future consumers with the generations opportunities to act responsibly elements of all three lenses can be seen in the policies promoted during the george w bush administration and in the actions of the congress although different perspectives dominate for the administration the technological and to lesser degree the ecological lens appeared very important to the longterm success of its initiatives the focus of administration initiatives was on development and use of technology to achieve reductions without significant economic pain that the administration rejected mandatory program suggests that the economic lens heavily influenced the design of its climate change program unlike the clinton administration the george w bush viewed costs to be major obstacle to reducing greenhouse gases in the near term for the congress the failure to date to enact any comprehensive climate change legislation seems to reflect focus on increasing certainty about the problem and on the costs of actions consistent with the economic lens while congress did ratify the 1992 framework convention on climate change and enacted several global climate change provisions in the 1992 energy policy act goslow approach is manifest by such actions as the senates unanimous vote of 950 in support of sres 98 crs34 which stated the administration should sign agreement that would result in serious harm to the economy or that did not include developing countries along with developed countries within its control regime in addition the resolution stated that any agreement submitted to the senate include detailed and comprehensive economic impact assessment of the treaty yet while similar concern about the economy was expressed in samdt 866 in 2005 that action also put the senate on record for taking action action was initiated in 2008 with the reporting of and floor debate on s 2191 which would have established capandtrade program to address climate change this approach itself is consistent with viewing the issue from an economic perspective but the fact of action suggests either shift toward perceived benefits outweighing costs or perhaps refocusing through other policymaking lenses the effort by various interests to convince the public that their perspective is correct and that those of others reflect either wishful thinking misinformation or excuses will likely continue such efforts will be affected by improvements in the scientific understanding of global climate change and of the domestic and international implications for strategies for addressing it however the pivotal decisionmaking point whether that understanding warrants action or not will be mediated in large part by the lens through which policymakers view the new knowledge ultimately it is the balance between all three perspectives that will shape policy options and eventually determine the character and timing of any policy response to the problem for other versions of this document see
