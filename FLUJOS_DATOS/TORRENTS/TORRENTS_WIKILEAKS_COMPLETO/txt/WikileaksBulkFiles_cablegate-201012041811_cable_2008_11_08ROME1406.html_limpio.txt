nato it subject scenesetter for your december 3 visit to rome ref rome 1386 b rome 1320 rome 00001406 0012 of 003 classified by ambassador ronald p spogli for reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary 1 c summary the political conditions in italy are dramatically different from the conditions that existed when you last visited in july 2006 silvio berlusconi has returned to power after two years of divided and ineffectual prodi government berlusconi enjoys unparalleled levels of public support and his broad base of power has allowed us to make good progress in advancing our agenda including successfully pressing for significant reductions on caveats imposed on italian troops in afghanistan by the previous government and approval of major and crucial base expansion at vicenza during your visit i hope you can publicly announce the establishment of africoms army and navy subcomponent commands in italy an important symbol of the strength of our close bilateral security relationship 2 c our reenergized cooperation with berlusconi however does not extend to all issues berlusconis close personal relationship with putin has translated into italian support for nearly every russian initiative intended to weaken transatlantic support for nato expansion and our efforts to curb the kremlins worst instincts on iran after period of italian support for us and eu efforts to resolve the nuclear issue italys policy has become unfocused and even critical of the international process i hope you can let berlusconi know that italys renegade initiatives to soften international and transatlantic positions on russia and iran can only serve to create confusion and reduce collective security on the economic front italys banks have avoided the worst of the financial meltdown but the broader economy will suffer from the ensuing global economic slowdown end summary domestic politics berlusconi firmly in control 3 c prime minister silvio berlusconi is in an enviable position domestically enjoying so comfortable majority in parliament that he can pass virtually any legislation without the support of the opposition he used his first months back in government to deliver results on election promises though longterm solutions to most problems are still needed the trash problem in naples is not yet permanently solved but the streets are cleared and troops are keeping dumps and incinerators open public worries about street crime have been addressed by sweeping new security law public finance law has overhauled the annual budget process which traditionally has eaten up months of parliaments time but italys faltering economy casts doubt on whether budget targets will be met berlusconis government drafted and passed these laws mostly without consulting the centerleft opposition which has grown more fragmented and less effective most foreign policy initiatives will be directed by berlusconi personally without the need of any legislation 4 c berlusconi has made few missteps such as his awkward attempt at joke in referring to presidentelect obama as suntanned and centerleft contacts argue that the honeymoon period may end soon clearly berlusconis current level of popularity is unsustainable over the long run but predictions that the wind is changing already are premature the center rights first major electoral test will be the european elections in june which will be critical moment for the center left to evaluate whether it needs new leadership and for the center right to see if it continues to enjoy such high levels of approval from the italian people transatlantic relationship all russia all the time 5 c berlusconis close personal and some suspect financial relationship with putin has led him to champion unquestioningly every initiative the kremlin has rolled out italys russia policy is his personal game one which he conducts on tactical basis to gain the trust and favor of his russian interlocutors he consistently rejects the strategic advice of his demoralized resourcestarved and increasingly irrelevant foreign ministry in favor of his business cronies many of whom are deeply dug into russias rome 00001406 0022 of 003 european energy strategy as result of his shortsighted obsession with russia berlusconi has thrown his support behind medvedevs calls for new security architecture in europe to supersede nato and osce has publicly called for ukrainian and georgian nato aspirations to be put on hold in deference to russian sensitivities has called on presidentelect obama to withdraw support for missile defense and continues to insist that russia acted properly during the georgiarussia conflict he has even called on the eu to admit russia as member most disturbingly berlusconi has attempted to portray himself inside the eu as the bridge between the us and russia in practice this has meant that the goi has consistently worked to water down eu stances on russia and tried to derail usled efforts to contain moscows worst instincts his efforts to encourage greater dialogue have created more confusion between russia and the transatlantic community not less we have pushed back forcefully on this ref but you can provide sense of realism to berlusconi by letting him know that his efforts are working against us and transatlantic efforts muddying the waters on iran 6 c berlusconi came into power with tough public stance on iran and showed himself eager to support the p5plus1 this initial clarity has given way to an unfocused even critical policy with respect to building international consensus for further sanctions fm frattini recently questioned the efficacy of the p5 1 approach in public comments and reached out to irans nuclear negotiator saeed jalili to invite him to rome for consultations even while working within the eu framework to discuss further national measures workinglevel goi officials continue to question the efficacy of further sanctions economic crisis banks ok but economy suffers 7 c stodgy old fashioned banking practices allowed italy to avoid being directly hit by the global financial meltdown italian banks simply did not engage in the kind of subprime lending that got others in trouble and italian banks did not buy significant amounts of the toxic derivatives that are causing so much trouble around the globe but italy is being affected by the results of the financial crisis italian stock prices have plummeted stirring fears of possible foreign buyouts of italian firms and italys already shaky economy will be hardhit by the global recession that was sparked by the financial crisis as for italys preferred response to the crisis the italians seem to be following sarkozys lead and seem to share his enthusiasm for major reform of the international finance institutions as is the case in many other countries italy is also looking at the possibility of government support for industries hurt by the recession 8 c italys finance minister giulio tremonti often supports protectionist antiglobalization positions but in the ongoing discussion of the financial crisis we expect italy to adhere to the more moderate consensus policies hammered out by the eu little room for expanding presence in afghanistan 9 c italy is the sixthlargest contributor to isaf with 2200 troops prt in herat and command of rcwest berlusconi has made good on his pledge to president bush last june to remove geographic caveats and send 34 carabinieri to train afghan police and he has promised to address allegations of italian protection payments to insurgent leaders additionally fm frattini has announced his intention to host g8 ministerial on afghanistan with special focus on providing regional solution to the afghanpakistan border region but the italians now say that new troop deployments above the parliamentaryapproved cap of 2300 troops will be impossible for budgetary reasons and that its only new contribution to isaf this fall will be in the form of four tornado jet fighters italy has also been cool toward our requests to provide donor support to ana expansion and election preparation citing budgetary rome 00001406 0034 of 003 concerns you should stress that italys decision to reduce defense expenditures which will put them even further below the natorecommended threshold of 1 of gdp is of major concern to us and it risks making italy less reliable partner in international security operations just at point when the need for greater contributions from partners may grow in afghanistan rolling out africom 10 c your visit will provide an opportunity to highlight our cooperation on africa through italys hosting of portions of africom goi officials were initially hesitant to sign off due to concerns over how and under what circumstances us forces in italy might deploy to potential conflict zones in africa the goi eventually agreed to the establishment of africoms army and navy subcomponent commands in existing facilities in italy on october 1 but asked us to delay announcing the move ref b the south east europe task force setaf in vicenza has assumed the army component functions and component of naveur in naples is now fulfilling the naval functions italian concerns focused on setaf and hinged on two issues one legal and the other local and political the classified 1954 bilateral infrastructure agreement bia limits us basing in italy exclusively to troops deployed for nato purposes after long negotiations the goi accepted our broad interpretation of the bia and the nato sofa as applicable to the africom subcomponents due to their role in supporting nato operations in africa and their availability for other nato missions as required but the goi asked for us to delay public announcement of the shift due to local controversy over the expansion of the base in vicenza to the dal molin airfield 11 c the goi responded positively to our proposal for joint announcement of the shift during your visit to italy joint statement acknowledging the establishment of the two entities would allow us to highlight the security assistance and humanitarian aspects of africoms mission and also divorce the issue as much as possible from base expansion controversy in vicenza it will also provide an opportunity to showcase the synergies between africom and the gois own efforts to encourage stability in africa and also their excellent work at training primarily african peacekeepers through its center of excellence for stability police units coespu joint usitalian g8 initiative which is also located in vicenza when will the honeymoon end 12 c most of our contacts within berlusconis own party as well as in the center left expect this governments honeymoon period to end in the first half of 2009 as italians focus on the nations systemic problems that have easy solution most importantly the economy democratic party officials tell us that they see the declining standard of living among the middle class as the greatest opportunity to gain strength before the european elections in june should the rescue efforts for alitalia remain unresolved in the face of continued strikes or should the protests against education reform gain traction with broader segment of the electorate berlusconis popularity will suffer conclusion 13 c berlusconis shootfromthehip style and frequent gaffes frequently create bumps in the relationship with the us nevertheless he staunchly supports and admires the us and its people despite its economic malaise italy remains close and influential partner and will continue to be an important ally for the us in nato the region and the world your visit will be an important sign of the strength and closeness of the bilateral relationship and i am delighted that you are taking the opportunity to visit rome spogli
