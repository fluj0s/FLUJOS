prc began its economic reform and selfstyled opening up process more than two decades ago with the hopes of developing the countrys backward economy raising living standards incomes and the quality of life of its citizens deng xiaoping architect of chinas economic reforms stated that during the reform process some chinese may get rich faster than others but he believed that the rest of china would benefit from this process today there are many signs that wealth has come to china and its people the bustling metropolises of shanghai shenzhen and beijing are signs that some chinese did get rich however the economic prosperity generated by economic reforms created large geographic imbalances as foreign direct investment poured into the port cities and special economic development zones in the east and on the southern coast western china was largely ignored western china home to majority of chinas ethnic minorities has remained relatively impoverished left with inadequate infrastructure underdeveloped schools and healthcare and high rates of unemployment chinese leaders fearing backlash from ethnic minorities in xinjiang and tibet began program to develop the western region the program known as the go west campaign has the highest levels of support from the chinese communist party the go west campaign attempts to redirect large amounts of central government spending foreign direct investment and international economic development funding to the western regions its goals are to develop the backward economy and infrastructure and raise the standards of living in the west however many critics doubt the governments sincerity they suggest that the campaign is an excuse for china to exploit the vast natural resources of the western region while imposing strict security measures that will counter any attempt by ethnic separatists to break away from the prc they express their concerns that building physical infrastructure will attract large numbers of ethnic chinese and weaken many of the unique ethnic minority cultures in the west critics also fear that development could destroy the ecosystem of the western region congress has broad interests in human rights issues in chinas far western region for example congress is concerned about chinas treatment of ethnic minorities in the western region crackdowns on religious freedoms and involuntary resettlement in addition to human rights concerns congress is also interested in market access and fair competition for us businesses seeking opportunities in the western region the go west campaign also has received support from number of foreign corporations and foreign governments attracted by the regions economic potential especially in the areas of energy petrochemicals transportation and

autonomous regionschinas western development campaign background and overview during the 1980s most of eastern china prospered under the economic reforms of the late deng xiaopin g dengs reform and opening up process allowed billions of dollars of foreign direct investment fdi to flow into eastern provinces the central governments heavy focus on eastern provinces during the twenty years of economic reform caused china to develop in unbalanced way its western regions economy and infrastructure remain poor backward and underdeveloped leading to large disparities in income and living standards and myriad of social political and security problems in late 1999 the peoples republic of china prc began to discuss ways to develop its economically depressed western region this program frequently referred to as the go west campaign the povertyreduction campaign or the western development campaign is to be coordinated by the ministry of state planning and development led by zeng peiyan1 in 2000 the go west spirit as many party and government officials refer to it gained increased momentum with the chinese business community and general population the go west spirit has also attracted foreign business interest and has prompted many executives to visit the western region for closer look at opportunities for investment the central government defines the western region as comprising the provinces of sichuan gansu guizhou ningxia yunnan qinghai and shaanxi the municipality of chongqing and the two autonomous regions of xinjiang and xizang tibet2 this western area makes up more than 56 of chinas land mass comprises 285 million people 23 of the national total and has 50 of all the nations mineral resources the west is home to many of chinas ethnic minority groups with the most widely known group internationally being the zang tibetan nationality but with increasing international focus on the uighur and hui minorities both residing in xinjiang the western area is the poorest region in china home to nine out of ten of chinas poorest 80 million people over the last 20 years the western region has attracted only 5 of chinas foreign direct investment fdi

he underscored the importance that the central government has assigned to development of science and technology for the western region zhu further stressed the central governments desire to protect the natural environment while developing sound infrastructure the chinese government says it will spend an additional 455 billion this year to help develop the western region the 455 billion dollars will include 371 billion in subsidies to the local governments and 84 billion in treasury bonds dedicated to boosting infrastructure development china is planning to build more than 20000 miles of new highways and roads including sichuan to guangxi highway project china is also planning to build number of new special economic and technical development zones in the western region such as the ones being constructed in xian shaanxi province and yibin sichuan province the government also plans to add more than 2500 miles of railway lines in the western regions over the next ten years6 implications for us policy the go west campaign has broad policy implications for congress over the next decade the most critical challenges are how will the united states balance criticisms of religious persecution and crackdowns on ethnic separatism in xinjiang and xizang tibet with the interest of us businesses and investors seeking investment opportunities in the western region in competition with other foreign investors us companies are currently doing business in the western region and many more are seeking opportunities in natural gas petroleum mineral exploration transportation and telecommunications moreover the western development campaign has policy implications on an international security level the prospects of expanded cooperation between china russia and central asia on range of political economic and border security issues could have potential ramifications for us geopolitical interests in the central asian region

safeguard their distinct culture and identity hr 1779 and s 852 political and economic issues number of political and economic factors pose complex problems for the prcs policies on western development on the one hand beijing sees need to establish productive enterprises build sound infrastructure now nearly nonexistent and develop the vast and largely untapped natural resources all of which could help lift the western region out of their pervasive poverty on the other hand the wests substantial ethnic nonchinese population often resent what they see as chinese encroachmentin some cases to the point of actively seeking independence from china some see chinas development campaign as an excuse to exploit the wests vast natural resources for the benefit of the more developed eastern provinces thus each development decision is subject to political and cultural sensitivities httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31104crs4 10 the tsaidam basin much like the tarim basin in xinjiang is

alaska pipeline debate of the mid1970s in the united states environmental activist argue that the pipeline project will lead to depletion of tibetan natural resources and negatively affect the sustainability of tibets ecosystem some critics of the tibetan pipeline project object to foreign corporate investment in tibet in their view foreign investment in tibet will only contribute to chinese occupation in the area bp amoco has come under intense criticism from number of activists protesting energy exploration and investment in tibet bp invested 580 million in petrochina

creating better access and conditions in the west for investors from china and abroad with heavy focus on large infrastructure development projects this policy has come under criticism from both economists and social and environmental activists xinjiang model beijing points to the xinjiang autonomous region as proof of what infrastructure development can do for the economy for example chinese

that since 1992 over 60 counties in the xinjiang autonomous region have opened to the outside world they also note that trade with central asia is booming and that over 400 border trade companies have been established taking in over 800 million dollars in 2000 the xinjiang uighur autonomous region registered 2 billion in importexport trade 30 rise over the previous year beijing points out that xinjiang border trade made up as much as 58 of the trade volume in xinjiang this past year19 still development analysts question beijings motives for focusing solely on building large and expensive infrastructure projects they argue that beijing should focus on building cheap local roads which would help to link isolated uighur communities together under broader common market and schools that could help to educate and train poor farmers and merchan ts furthermore some ethnic minorities and western critics argue that construction of railroads bridges and large highways make it easy to move ethnic chinese troops and military equipment into and out of the region but these measures do very little to directly relieve poverty qinghai tibetan railway project another infrastructure project with plans to employ more than 50000 laborers and engineers will link the cities of golmud in qinghai province to lhasa in tibet the 1180 kilometer railway will be the longest and highest railway in the world at an altitude in some places of over 4000 meters20 the project has proven to be both technically and politically difficult and has met with strong resistance from the exile tibetan community and several non governmental organizations around the world environmentalists argue that the railway is likely to severely tax the fragile tibetan ecosystem by developing an industrial infrastructure and by attracting scores of migrant workers and others seeking resettlement in areas with employment and economic opportunities generated by the project however ran li chief engineer with ministry of railways stated that green belt will be built along the railway and that there will be more bridges and passages built near qiangtang hoh xil and other nature reserves in the area to

international visibility is the xizang tibet autonomous region in tibet number of human rights environmental and cultural issues may intensify as the prc government implements the go west campaign the western development plans for tibet are seen by many activists and analysts as the final push to fully incorporate tibet into mainstream china activists argue that the go west campaign if successful will make it more difficult for tibet to establish higher degree of economic political and cultural autonomy from beijing many tibetan exiles including the dalai lama argue that the chinese plan to develop the western regions will be devastating to the tibetan way of life the dalai lamas tibetan government in exile has come out strongly against the pipeline project in the tsaidam basin its leaders contend that this project will deplete tibets natural resources with little benefit going to the tibetan people in addition they argue the project will employ disproportionate number of chinese thereby increasing the chinese control and occupation of tibet furthermore the dalai lamas exile government argues that the western development campaign will increase the governments justifications for maintaining control over tibet by pumping in foreign money han chinese migrants and investing central government funds in heavy infrastructure projects however in an attempt to silence its critics beijing cites recent economic statistics that show an increase in overall economic performance in tibet for example they point out that over the last six years tibets annual gdp has increased by an average rate of 129 climbing well above the national average22 in addition they point out that the average life expectancy rate today is 62 years up from 36 years half century ago they also insist that in recent years china has permitted basic level of religious freedom and achieved major economic and social gains in tibet reportedly some tibetans feel that go west plans may bring economic development to tibet but doubt the plan will weaken tibetan culture they cite laws that forbid building around the sacred jokhang temple as evidence that the government is becoming more sensitive toward tibetan culture23 others suggest that as china becomes increasingly aware of the economic value of tourism in tibet and the dependence of the tourist industry in tibet on tibetan culture the prc may move further toward relaxing its repression of tibetan cultural and religious practices qinghai resettlement project the prc has also worked with the world bank and other international development agencies to secure funding for projects in tibet and neighboring qinghai province one such project between the world bank and china was the qinghai resettleme nt project

suggests that future western development projects may also be controversial although many tibetan activists and exiled leaders sensed the qinghai outcome as victory over beijings western development drive some analysts caution that beijing will proceed with the western development campaign in any case but that now it will try to avoid accepting loans that come with political strings attached the qinghai resettlement controversy also caused beijing to step up the effort to attract what it viewed as nonpolitical corporate investors to the western areas ethnic tension xinjiang has had considerable conflict over the last several years notably ethnic conflict between uighurs and chinese about which little has been reported outside the region for instance the largest riot in over 10 years occurred at changan university between chinese and uighur students in july 200125 analysts caution that this riot which included an attack with bricks and sidewalk pieces hurled through uighur student dormitory windows is just an example of more widespread ethnic tension in xinjiang and foreshadows things to come ethnically xinjiang province is made up of mixture of uighurs kyrgyz hui and kazakhs these peoples are turkicspeaking muslims and close kin to the residents of the central asian states xinjiang is also home to large number of ethnic chinese migrants who have been moving with government encouragement to xinjiang and other western provinces in large waves and creating growing resentment of what many minorities see as sinofication of their home land and cultures26 the

stimulate growth much faster31 number of chinese officials privately express doubts that rising living standards in xinjiang will have positive effect on uighurhan and uighur government relations they fear that increased living standards will create bourgeois nationalist group of uighurs who will be able to better fund uighur struggles for change32 these officials cautious and cynical of government

president rahmonov of tajikistan and chinas jiang zemin met to discuss the issues affecting the region just before the sco summit they agreed that the socalled three evil forces had become major threat to security and development in the region35 in addition chinese leaders came to see the central asian states as potential breeding ground for separatist movements in part because of cental asias ethnic makeup and additionally because of the example set by sovereignty gains of uighurs and kazakhs in the former soviet union subsequently many uighurs in xinjiang began to resist what they viewed as chinese occupation instead desiring future much like their central asian cousins who had gained their independence after the breakup of the soviet union confirming the fears of most leaders

communit is interested in chinas western development strategy and is ready to take an active part in it44 us concerns although us companies are present in chinas western region some analysts suggest that they may face more obstacles than european and canadian companies participating in such sectors as energy mining and transportation minority groups global activists and interest groups have labeled many projects in these sectors as exploitive and disastrous toward the ethnic minority communities in the west analysts point out that the united states foreign policy establishment over the last several years has been more inclined than its european counterpart to link human rights issues with international trade and commerce furthermore unlike european and canadian government officials us officials have issued strong policy statements in support of chinas western development campaignhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31104crs13 45 chairman mao zedong will also be remembered for the great leap forward and the great proletarian cultural revolution china analyst historians and many chinese citizens consider both events to be unmitigated disasters the great leap forwards aftermath reportedly killed and estimated 15 to 25 million chinese 46 the economist go west young han december 23 2000january 5 2001 47 see woodrow wilson center for international scholars asia program special report after jiang hu can hu jintao beat the successors dilemma by murray scot tanner june 2001implications for political succession in china some china watchers and analysts believe significant amount of the go west spirit as it is being referred to by beijing is driven by those close to president jiang zemin analysts point out that chinese leaders of the past mao and deng are both associated with some grand vision or grandiose program to assist chinas progress and development they point out that mao zedong45 will always be remembered as the founding father of new china and that deng xiaoping will be remembered for his decision to open chinas economy to the outside world however analysts argue that president jiang has yet to etch out any real development plan or program of his own the argument is that he is seen as merely the leader who oversees the implementation of the deng era economic reform program therefore analysts postulate with the chinese communist partys 16th congress coming up in 2002 and the potential retirement of jiang zemin the tempo and rhetoric of the go west spirit will continue to increase as jiang zemin seeks to create development program and legacy of his own46 other analysts point to the potential power struggles of succession and the background of hu jintao the leader reportedly slated to replace jiang zemin as the driving force behind the go westcampaign they suggest vice president hu jintao who began his career in three of chinas innermost provinces has lot to gain from successful western development drive analyst point out that hu first served as the deputy chief of construction in gansu province and later served as party secretary in guizhou 19851988 and tibet 19881992 they see this as evidence of his possible guiding influence on the western development drive47 when examining the go westcampaign and how it may help the succession possibilities of hu jintao it may be useful to consider his power base review of hu jintaos base shows that 5 out of 16 communist party rising stars of the socalled 4th generation of leaders are associates of hus from his term as party secretary of tibet zi cheng and danzim two of those 4th generation ccp rising stars are still party officials in tibet serving as deputy secretarypoliticallegal secretary and deputy secretary respectively in addition to the tibet officials hu also has strong ties to mao rubai the ccp party secretary for ningxia another western province some have suggested that hu intends to use his close associates in very strategic positions in the western region to help him advocate economic reform and development of chinas vast interior if successful the go west campaign could help him to further consolidate powerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31104crs14
