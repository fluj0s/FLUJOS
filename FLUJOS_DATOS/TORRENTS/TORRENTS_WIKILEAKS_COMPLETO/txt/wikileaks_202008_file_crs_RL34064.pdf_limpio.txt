proposed laws includes an oil and gas sector framework law and three supporting laws that would outline revenue sharing restructure iraqs ministry of oil and create an iraqi national oil company both the bush administration and the 110 th congress considered the passage of oil and gas sector framework and revenue sharing legislation as important benchmarks that would indicate the current iraqi governments commitment to promoting political reconciliation and long term economic development in iraq in the absence of new legislation revenue sharing mechanisms have been implemented and both the iraqi national government and the kurdistan regional government have signed oil and natural gas development contracts with foreign firms the central importance of oil and gas revenue for the iraqi economy is widely recognized by iraqis and most groups accept the need to create new legal and policy guidelines for the development of the countrys oil and natural gas however iraqs council of representatives parliament has not taken action to consider the proposed legislation to date because of ongoing political disputes iraqi critics and supporters of the proposed legislation differ strongly on number of key issues including the proper role and powers of federal and regional authorities in regulating oil and gas development the terms and extent of potential foreign participation in the oil and gas sectors and proposed formulas and mechanisms for equitably sharing oil and gas revenue concurrent related discussions about the city of kirkuk and proposed amendments to articles of

production in iraq began in the 1920s under the terms of wideranging concession granted to consortium of international oil companies known as the turkish petroleum company and later as the iraq petroleum company the nationalization of iraqs oil resources and production was complete by 1975 from 1975 to 2003 iraqs oil production and export operations were entirely state operated however from the early 1980s until the toppling of husseins government in 2003 the countrys hydrocarbon infrastructure suffered from the negative effects of war international sanctions lack of investment and technology and in some cases mismanagement according to the oil and gas journal iraq has 115 billion barrels of proven oil reserves the worlds thirdlargest other estimates of iraqs potential oil reserves vary in april 2007 oil industry consultants ihs estimated that iraqs proven and probable reserves equal 116 billion barrels with potential additional 100 billion barrels in largely unexplored western areas the us geological surveys median estimate for additional oil reserves in iraq is approximately 45 billion barrels in august 2004 iraqs thenoil minister thamer ghadban stated that iraq had unconfirmed or potential reserves of 214 billion barrels iraqs proven reserves are concentrated largely 65 percent or more in southern iraq particularly in the southernmost governorate of basrah significant proven oil resources also are located in the northern governorate of tamim near the disputed city of kirkuk see figure 1 below oil exports provide over 90 of iraqs government revenue

legislation that would define the terms for the future management and development of the countrys significant oil and natural gas resources the centerpiece of the legislative package is draft hydrocarbon framework law that would create regulatory and policy development framework for future oil and gas exploration and production in iraq three companion laws would complete the package by establishing terms and mechanisms for revenue sharing creating the iraq national oil company and reorganizing iraqs ministry of oil concurrent negotiations regarding constitutional amendments may have direct implications for the package of hydrocarbon legislation particularly efforts to clarify the specific authorities granted to federal and regional governments to regulate oil and gas development and export activities under articles 111 and 112 of the iraqi constitution

iraqi critics and supporters of the legislative package differ over the proper roles and authorities of federal and regional bodies the terms and extent of potential foreign participation in oil and gas production and development and potential formulas and mechanisms for equitably sharing oil and gas revenue iraqi labor groups have challenged the transparency and inclusiveness of legislative drafting and contract negotiation processes thus far and some blocs within iraqs council of representatives have vowed to oppose or attempt to significantly amend elements of proposed legislation to reflect their priorities see players and positions below iraqi us and other international observers have expressed concern that continuing violence and political tension in iraq may not be conducive to careful consideration of detailed hydrocarbon sector legislation or new national contracts at pr esent the four elements of the proposed package of hydrocarbon legislation remain at different stages of development and negotiation g6g155g138g143g157g561g10g162g141g155g152g140g138g155g139g152g151g561g8g155g138g150g142g160g152g155g148g561g14g138g160g561 beginning in mid2006 three member oil and energy committee working under the auspices of the iraqi cabinet prepared draft hydrocarbon framework legislation to regulate iraqs oil and gas sector political negotiating committee subsequently edited their draft following approval by the negotiating committee iraqs council of ministers cabinet approved draft version of the hydrocarbon framework law in february 2007 1 subsequent negotiations among iraqi leaders sought to clarify the responsibilities of federal and regional authorities as well as contracting procedures for oil fields on july 3 2007 iraqi prime minister nouri maliki announced that the council of ministers had approved final version of the framework law and had forwarded the bill to the council of representatives for consideration the council of ministers shoura council reportedly amended provisions of the bill to ensure their consistency with provisions of the iraqi constitution however kurdish officials protested the changes arguing that they are substantive rather than semantic and have tentatively withdrawn their support for the legislation the boy cott of cabinet and parliamentary proceedings 1 in response to june 2007 crs inquiry the us department of state referred to an english text of the draft legislation made available by the kurdistan regional governme nt as an official english draft version it is available online at

the law added to the controversy surrounding the proposed legislation statements from iraqi government officials and members of the council of representatives suggest that parliamentary consideration of the legislation continues to be delayed by disagreements between key political figures according to the june 2008 report to congress prepared by the us department of defense the chairman of the council of representatives oil and gas committee will not proceed with first reading of the draft legislation until the federal government and the kurdistan regional government reach political agreement on the hydrocarbon sector 2 the september 2008 report predicts that it is likely that several more rounds of negotiations between the two sides will occur before they reach an agreement and that controversy on the provincial elections in kirkuk will likely affect the hydrocarbon legislation package3 in the absence of new legal and regulatory framework the baghdad government has announced its intention to award longterm service contracts to expand oil production g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g17g146g149g561g138g151g141g561g9g138g156g561g5g152g158g151g140g146g149g561 the central element of the draft hydrocarbon framework legislation is the creation of federal oil and gas council fogc to determine all national oil and gas sector policies and plans including those governing exploration devel opment and transportation the fogc would become the most powerful body in iraqs oil sector with the power to review all contracts and would operate according to twothirds majority decisionmaking system the seats on the fogc are reserved for specific cabinet members representatives of constitutionally recognized regional governments hydrocarbon experts and producing governorates 4 panel of independent experts open to iraqi and foreign membership would work with the fogc in nonbinding advisory capacity the possibility that foreign energy experts or industry representatives could be chosen to participate on this panel has alarmed some iraqis and foreign observers although the draft law stipulates that the formatio n of the fogc shall take into consideration fair representation of the basic components of the iraqi society some observers have warned that the makeup of the fogc specified in the draft law could potentially contribute to sectarian or regional tensions given the potential for the majority shiite arab community to directly or indirectly control the makeup of iraqs cabinet in iraqs democratic system and the ineligibility of sunni arab governorates to qualify for fogc seats based on the other specified terms some sunni arabs fear their interests may not be adequately represented in the powerful council other iraqis may be encouraged to seek constitutionally recognized regional status in order to ensure their representation in the council 2 us department of defense measuring stability and security in iraq june 2008 report to congress in

the draft hydrocarbon framework law establishes several criteria that future exploration and production contracts must meet the criteria are designed to preserve iraqi control and maximize the countrys economic return the draft law does not mandate the use of socalled production sharing agreements as the sole model contract fo r future oil development in iraq the law states that contract holders may be given exclusive rights to exploration development production and marketing of iraqi oil for specified periods subject to approval of the contract and field development plan by iraqi authorities the law also outlines general terms and conditions for evaluating contracts and development plans designed to preserve the iraqi governments sovereign control of oil production economic returns to iraq and appropriate returns to potential investors 5 the fogcs panel of independent experts would use these criteria to evaluate contracts signed by the kurdistan regional government since 2003 and the ministry of oil and the fogc would use the criteria to evalua contracts signed by the former regime with international oil companies article 40 the contract provisions of the law have attracted significant attention because they would allow foreign participation and therefore represent in principle reversal of the nationalization of iraqs oil sector the specific details of model contracts developed by iraqis and the terms of specific individual contracts negotiated between iraq and potential foreign partners would determine the type of foreign participation and the specific long term revenue benefits to iraq or foreign companies the draft hydrocarbon framework law does not mandate specific form of contract or predetermine specific contract terms or details 6 the fogc would develop model contracts for use in iraqi oil and gas fields and evaluate agreements with foreign participants according to the stated criteria and the model contracts according to revenue watch

framework law states that iraqs oil wealth belongs to all of its citizens as reflected in the iraqi constitution however the draft legislation does not contain specific guidelines or mechanisms for revenue sharing the draft would create two funds for oil revenues the first an oil revenue fund and the second future fund to hold an unspecified percentage of oil revenue for longterm development goals both funds would be regulated and 5 according to article 9 of the draft framework all model contracts shall be formulated to honor the following objectives and criteria 1 national control 2

number of outside observers have emphasized the importance of proper oil revenue management and equitable oil revenue sharing as requirements for economic development and political reconciliation in postsaddam iraq the iraq study group recommended that oil revenue accrue to the central government and not to regions recommendation 28 this principle appears to have been included in the draft hydrocarbon framework and draft revenue sharing legislation which would create central accounts for oil and gas revenues according to the drafts revenue sharing would reflect populationbased system for revenue allocation with automatic monthly distributions to regional and governorate authoritiespotential obstacles to revenue sharing on terms include the lack of recent reliable national census

determine any funds that should be transferred to the national treasury and provides for the potential withholding of proportionate amounts of national budgetary funds from transfer to the krg in the event of nonpayment by the krg of revenues due to the national government article 19 of the law states that the percentages of the budget allocated to the krg and the governorates will be revisited in

the council of ministers february 2007 approval of the draft hydrocarbon framework legislation as an important step forward however the draft legislative package remains the subject of intense scrutiny from iraqi and international observers the draft framework law is imprecise on key issues including contract terms and revenue sharing and political observers have warned the legislation woul d create decision making structures that could contribute to sectarian or interregional tensions rather than defuse them both the us and iraqi administrations had hoped the hydrocarbon framework law would be approved by the parliament by the end of may 2007 however differences ov er oil field management responsibilities revenue sharing formulas and mechanisms and broader disputes concerning constitutional authority and the administrative status of kirkuk and other areas continue to preclude parliamentary consideration on july 3 2007 iraqi prime minister nouri maliki announced that the council of ministers had formally approved final version of the framework law and had forwarded the bill to the council of representatives for consideration iraqi officials stated that linguistic changes were made to the february 2007 draft but precise details on what changes may have been included have not been made public kurdish leaders raised questions about the changes and at least one kurdish official claimed that kurdish representatives were not consulted on the final version of the draft prior to its delivery to the parliament on july 11 kurdistan regional government krg natural resource minister ashti hawrami stated that the amendments to the draft law reduce the powers of the kurdish region and should not be approved 15 political groupings that favor strong central government control over production and revenue decision making also criticized the draft framework law the failure to achieve regular quorum in the iraqi council of representatives complicated efforts to consider or adopt legislation from late 2006 through september 200716 at present the draft hydrocarbon framework law has not been placed on the parliaments legislative calendar primarily because of continuing political differences between the national government and the kurdistan regional government krg over federal and regional oilrelated decisionmaking powers intense discussions among party leaders are ongoing amid reports that some groups may be seeking to revisit core compromises that enabled the draft legislation to move forward in february 2007 in january 2008 the chairman of the

much emphasis placed on the promulgation of these laws by the united states and argued that sorting out the complex issues of legislation needs time19 once the parliament begins consideration of the

negatively to the impasse and the krgs recent activities on september 8 iraqi oil minister hussein shahristani stated that the national government considers contracts signed by the krg to have standing and threatened that if for any political reason the hydrocarbon framework law is delayed well go ahead and start discussions with international oil companies at the national level22 the krg responded by stating that shahristanis views were irrelevant to what the krg is doing legally and constitutionally in kurdistan 23 tensions appeared to escalate further after minister shahristani warned international oil companies that the national government would not allow the export of oil produced under krg contracts24 the krg responded by accusing minister shahristani of mismanaging the oil ministry budget and restated its opinion that its contracts were both constitutional and legal25 in november 2007 60 iraqi oil sector leaders wrote to the council of representatives to state that the krgs unilateral signing of contracts constituted deliberate and dangerous action and had legal or political standing whatsoever26 at least 120 members of the council of representatives from wide range of political parties endorsed january 2008 joint statement underscoring their opposition to the krg contracts27 the crosssectarian opposition appears to be motivated by concerns about the production sharing model in the krg contracts and the precedent set by krg demands for regional autonomy in oil and revenue decisionmaking the ministry of oil has since refined its position slightly to emphasize its opposition to contracts signed by the krg after february 2007 contracts signed before february 2007 with firms currently producing oil for domestic consumption would be considered valid after review and potential amendments according to minister shahristani oil produced or exported under post february 2007 contracts will be confiscated28 the krg has signed over twenty production sharing agreements with international oil companie s but the limited amount of oil currently being produced in krg territory is not exported because of the national governments prohibition in november 2008 the ministry of oil agreed to allow technical work to connect two northern oil fields to the export pipeline system however mini ster shahristani reiterated that the position visavis

according to revenue watch34 middle east director yahia said the most contentious issue in the legal framework is the division of authority between the federal center and the regions the concept of federalism has been incorporated into iraqs constitution and law and iraqi attitudes toward the oil sector and proposed oil legislation often correspond with regional differences of opinion about the proper role and power of the federal government and regional and governorate authorities to make oil policy and revenue decisions however the constitutions ambiguity about the roles and powers of

governorates and regional governments shall undertake the management of oil and gas extracted from present fields italics added these provisions were included as means of ensuring consensus among iraqis and the adoption of the constitution iraqs constitutional review committee crc delivered its longexpected recommendations for constitutional amendments in late may 2007 but left many sensitive issues including the distribution of oil revenue to be decided by the political leadership in the country to settle them for the interest of the nation and to guarantee rights to all parties36 reportedly kurdish representatives on the committee pressed for regional power to distribute oil revenue while sunni and shiite arab members supported central government control over revenue collection and distribution 37 the crc was expected to release report with final recommendations on these and other sensitive issues by the end of august 20 07 in september the council of representatives extended the crc deadline until december 31 200738 in december 2007 crc chairman humam hamoudi requested and received further sixmonth extension39 the crc failed to produce final

and management of oil and gas41 according to one analysis of the crc recommendations relating to articles 111 and 112 draft amendments would strengthen federal authority in case of oil and gas related disputes with regions provide for automatic distribution of revenues according to legislated criteria and clarify that provisions related to revenue and certain management responsibilities apply to all fields not just new or currently producing fields 42 35 further complicating matters are article 115 which provides regional authorities the power to override federal law in the event of conflicts with regional legislation and article 110 which grants powers to iraqs federal government to formulate foreign sovereign economic and trade policy and regulate commercial policy across regional and

distribution or contribute to political reconciliation or economic growth to date iraqi kurds acting through their kurdistan regional government krg have demanded the right to sign oil development deals without much national government interference other subnational groupings also may contest the right of iraqs central government to control aspects of oil policy including some inhabitants of the oilrich governorate of basrah and members of the minority sunni arab community who fear that shiite arab and kurdish dominated national government may not administer hydrocarbon revenues fairly

g20g142g159g142g151g158g142g561g21g145g138g155g146g151g144g561 the central role of the oil sector in iraqs economy the uneven geographic distribution of iraqs oil resources and the legacy of communal favoritism practiced under saddam hussein have created lasting concerns among iraqis about the future equitable distribution of oil revenues these concerns deepened in the atmosphere of violence and sectarian tension that gripped iraq from mid2003 though mid2008 the principles and mechanisms by and through which iraqs oil revenues are to be collected and distributed remain contested most outside observers agree that an equitable mutually accepted revenue distribution formula will be critically important to iraqs future economic health and political stability article 112 of iraqs constitution requires the iraqi government to distribute revenues in fair manner in proportion to the population distribution in all parts of the country specifying an allotment for specified period for the damaged regions which were unjustly deprived of them by the former regime and the regions that were damaged afterwards in way that ensures balanced development in different areas of the country and this shall be regulated by law recent debate has centered on the content of draft revenue sharing legislation that must be considered and approved as part of the hydrocarbon package the principal issues remain formulas for ensuring equitable distribution of revenues to iraqs population and the mechanisms through which revenue will be collected and distributed debate over distribution formulas reflects efforts to agree on quantitative terms for ensuring equitable per capita distribution and providing for damaged and unjustly deprived regions in line with article 112 of the constitution debate on distribution mechanisms focuses on whether or not regions or governorates should retain the right to make decisions about revenue from oil and gas produced in their territory and whether federal revenue distribution should be automatic and fixed or whether the federal government should retain discretion over the allocation of funding to regions and governorates the us department of defense reported in march 2008 that the iraqi government continues to distribute oil revenues equitably to the provinces in the absence of comprehensive legislation 43 43 us department of defense

and sensitivity in iraq iraq completed the nationalization of its oil resources in 1975 and oil exploration production and exports were managed subsequently by staterun entities that employed thousands of iraqis given the effects of war sanctions and mismanagement of the countrys oil infrastructure since 1980 many energy experts believe iraq will need significant infusions of investment technology and expertise in order to rehabilitate and eventually expand its oil production capacity in line with the current governments plans 44 iraqs own oil revenues may provide significant resource base for such investment and for attracting technology and expertise however some observers have questioned the iraqi governments capacity to effectively direct large amounts of its own resources toward hydrocarbon sector rehabilitation in light of its past failures to manage and expend funds set aside in the federal budget for those purposes see revenues below 45 to date iraqs unstable security situation has presented significant barrier to largescale investment by most international entities over the medium to long term iraqis face difficult choices about the character and needs of their oil and gas industries preserving full control over all investment and technological inputs to the sector may not be compatible with its technical needs whereas some iraqis oppose foreign participation on any terms others support foreign participation in the form of technical service contracts and still others favor production sharing agreements psas which would grant internatio nal companies exploration and production rights over specific areas for specified periods subjec t to the terms of negotiated contracts iraqs ministry of oil is moving forward with

attitudes on the future of the countrys oil industry are shaped by number of factors including geography ethnicity political ideology and party affiliation sectarian identity politics is an important factor particularly with regard to the concerns of some members of the minority sunni arab community who fear exclusion from decisionmaking bodies and inadequate revenue sharing however viewing ongoing iraqi debates over oil resources and revenue through purely sectarian lens obscures other important nonsectarian dynamics constitutional questions relating to federal and regional authority concern all iraqis and members of different ethnic and sectarian groups have formed coalitions to oppose positions and compromises with regard to the package of draft hydrocarbon legislation many iraqi oil experts technicians and powerful unions also have taken strong positions on the legislative package that do not correspond to apparent ethnic or sectarian affiliations or interests 44

sixmonth extension of the deadline for referendum for technical reasons according to the department of defense the involvement of the united nations assistance mission for iraq unami in technical

procedural obstacle to broad international investment in iraqs oil and natural gas sector some energy experts argue that the persistence of insecurity has been more fundamental concern to international energy companies however in december 2007 us deputy treasury secretary robert kimmitt identified the lack of progress on the oil law as primary barrier to investment by international oil companies and encouraged us oil companies to refrain from signing contracts in iraq until new oil law is passed57 while some small international energy companies have signed limited production sharing agreements in the kurdishcontrolled region of northern iraq significant international investments in oil exploration and pr oduction elsewhere in iraq were not made from 2003 through mid2008 this may change in light of the licensing prequalification and service contract bidding processes being administered by the ministry of oil saddam husseins government signed contracts wi th several major intern ational oil companies and under the draft hydrocarbon legislation currently under consideration these contracts must be evaluated and reapproved by the federal oil and gas council58 in september 2008 iraqi oil minister hussein shahristani announced that 1997 contract signed by the saddam hussein regime and china national petroleum corporation to develop the ahdab oil field in wasit governorate would be transformed from produc tion sharing agreement to 20year technical service contract 59 in august 2008 iraq ended negotiations with russian oil company lukoil on renewing saddamera contract but invited lukoil to enter bid for new service contract in iraqs upcoming licensing round60 in new arrangement royal dutch shell and iraq have launched negotiations to develop systems for capturing and marketing associated natural gas in iraqs southern oilfields the gas currently is being wasted at cost estimated by the iraqi government to be 40 million per day 61 while the risks associated with investment in iraqs established producing oil fields are relatively low potential future investments in discovered but undeveloped or exploration blocks could carry more significant risks investors are therefore likely to seek contract terms that would provide adequate return and compensation and may seek terms that would allow for production sharing according to some observers concerns about corruption and the potential opacity of iraqs regulatory and contracting processes may also deter some outside investment over the long term particularly if key decision making powers are delegated to regional or governorate authorities 62 nevertheless recent reporting suggests that there is significant interest among international oil 57 bradley brooks top us treasury official

prices through august 2008 and expanded oil exports generated substantially higher than expected oil revenues for iraq through most of 2008 according to the us depart ment of state crude oil exports averaged 173 million barrels per day in the third quarter of 2008 at an average price of 110 per barrel 74 sharp drops in global oil prices since september 2008 have drastically undercut iraqi oil

security in iraq report stated that the iraqi governments failure to execute several billion dollars of its own funds in oil sector capital investments had limited the overall recovery of the sector79 although capital investment expenditure rates in the oil sector and in other sectors reportedly have increased since mid2007 broad shortcomings in iraqi revenue management practices and capabilities have contributed to the accumulation of budget surpluses according to the june 2008 measuring stability and security report the ministry of oil executed 11 billion of its 22 billion 2007 capital budget and may face continuing challenges because of lack of administrative capacity and international firms reluctance to engage in longterm multiyear development projects 80 the report noted marginal improvement in the government of iraqs ability to spend its resources although the report concluded that budget execution rates continue to be relatively low limiting iraqs ability to increase economic development and deliver essential services to its citizens among the considerable challenges facing efforts to improve the performance of iraqs ministries identified in the report were cumbersome budgetary approval and complex funding processes limited experience among available staff and the limited availability of resident contractors the us state department made similar assessments in july 2008 according to the departments latest section 2207 report on iraq relief and reconstruction impediments to effective budgetary expenditure in iraq persist at all levels the report concluded that continued assistance is needed to address impediments to capital budget execution the special inspector general for iraq reconstruction sigir reported in july 2008 that us funded ministerial capacity development programs had been hindered by weak coordination among multiple agencies that tended to implement their own programs with little prioritization of projects or coordinated planning the sigir concluded that us investments in capacity building are at risk unless more integrated programming is implemented 81 in light of these assessments both the us and iraqi governments have undertaken initiatives in recent months to improve public financial manage ment and the coordination of us assistance programs iraq has issued new decrees and reformed administrative bodies to grant greater contracting authority to ministries and provinces82 iraqs 2008 budget law allows provinces and government agencies to carry over their unused budget authority into the current

congress identified political reconciliation and long term economic development as key policy goals and benchmarks for the progress of us efforts in iraq the current military strategy employed by us forces in iraq seeks to create secure environment in which iraqis can resolve core political differences in iraq the ongoing debate over package of four draft hydrocarbon laws reflects iraqis unresolved political differences over the powers reserved for federal and regional authorities proper means for ensuring equitable distribution of hydrocarbon revenue s and longstanding shared concerns about preserving iraqs unity and sovereignty in light of the us military commitment and persistent iraqi political differences members of congress and us policymakers face number of challenging questions to what extent does the us investment in improving iraqs security permit the united states to influence either the pace or content of iraqi debates over the future management of iraqs sovereign economic resources should the united states encourage iraqis to complete constitutional reforms that will resolve core political differences before promoting the adoption and implementation of hydrocarbon legislation how can the united states most effectively ensure that iraqis adopt equitable revenue sharing mechanisms should the us government promote international investment in iraqs oil and gas sector and if so in what form and on what scale to the extent that iraqi factions perceive the united states to be promoting legislative solutions or processes opposed to or supportive of their interests they may oppose or support the hydrocarbon legislation and us preferences and policy goals if constitutional disputes over federal and regional authority remain unresolved the durability of compromises reached with regard to the hydrocarbon legislation may be undermined revenue sharing mechanisms based on per capita population formulas may ensure formerly disadvantaged regions receive adequate shares of oil and gas proceeds but could create new resentment in less populous governorates including areas inhabited by iraqs minority sunni arab populat ion international investment and technology may be necessary in light of the current iraqi governme nts ambitious plans for the expansion of iraqs oil and gas production however the terms and conditions of international participation are likely to remain highly controversial with powerful iraqi interest groups taking opposing positions the public positions that members of congress and administration officials take on each of these questions will likely influence iraqi attitudes toward the us presence in iraq toward the draft legislative package and toward each other
