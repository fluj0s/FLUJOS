httpwwwcrsgovproductsguidesguidehomeshtml agency supporting material each agency is responsible for providing the supporting materials from which the account and program detail in the budget appendix is prepared omb circular a11 contains detailed instructions on their preparation to ensure they adhere to standardized conventions and formats these materials are prepared in support of an agencys initial budget submission to the office of management and budget omb and then if necessary revised to conform to the decisions made by omb and the president the major elements of these materials for each account include 1 proposed appropriations language for the upcoming fiscal year 2 program and financing schedule which includes the obligations for specific activities and programs and the

its performance the budget schedules state the dollar amounts of appropriations and other sources of budgetary resources they show actual dollar amounts for the previous fiscal year enacted amounts for the current fiscal year and proposed amounts for the upcoming fiscal year reflecting the presidents request agency budget justifications the house and senate appropriations committees have jurisdiction over the 12 regular appropriations acts and other appropriations acts the appropriations committees of each house have 12 parallel subcommittees each of which is responsible for one of the 12 regular appropriations acts soon after the presidents budget has been transmitted to congress the appropriations subcommittees hold hearings on the individual agency budget requests crs2 agency officials usually testify before the appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over the agencys budget request central element of this testimony is the detailed written budget justifications prepared by an agency and submitted to the applicable subcommittee the testimony and written justifications usually are published as part of the subcommittees hearings each year the hearings of the house appropriations subcommittees combined often exceed 100000 pages covering testimony of about 10000 witnesses which include nongovernmental as well as agency officials the written justifications typically vary in form and content with each agency and appropriations subcommittee reflecting the ongoing relationship between them an agencys budget justification generally consists of detailed description of each program activity and its purpose agencies also include an extensive explanation of the proposed changes in appropriations and program activities for the next fiscal year often concentrating on the increase or decrease in spending the primary purpose of the budget justifications is to provide an appropriations subcommittee with more detailed information about an agencys program activities and their relationship with the appropriations request than is contained in the presidents budget documents agency officials use this detailed information to support their testimony at subcommittee hearings although the budget justification is not included in appropriations acts and thus does not have the force of law it serves as an agreement with the appropriations subcommittee as to the activities an agency plans to carry out during the next fiscal year subcommittee often modifies these plans by including language in the appropriations committees report accompanying the appropriations bill for more information on appropriations committee report language see crs report 98558 appropriations bills what is report language an agency usually has to go through formal process if it wants to change the program activity plans contained in its budget justification material after the fiscal year begins for example if an agency wants to shift funds from one purpose to another within the same appropriations account referred to as reprogramming funds an agency often is required to notify the relevant appropriations subcommittee and in some cases must get advance approval to go forward with the reprogramming finally it is important to note that when agencies interact with congress they are required to support the presidents budget proposals to ensure agency compliance with this requirement section 22 of omb circular a11 sets out general responsibilities of agency officials when dealing with congress on budgetary matters in particular all budgetrelated materials including the budget justifications must be submitted to omb for clearance prior to transmittal to congress see section 223 for other versions of this document see
