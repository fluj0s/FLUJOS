health insurance program for the aged and certain disabled persons most medicare benefi ciaries obtain covered health services through the original feeforservice prog ram also known as original medicare under the feeforservice program benefici aries obtain covered rvices through the providers of their choice and medicare pays for each service or package of services rendered the basic package of medicare services which includes range of institutional and noninstitutional services is the same throughout the country some beneficiaries are enrolled in medicare advantage plan these persons have elected to obtain all of their dicare services through managed care arrangement such as health maintenan ce organization hmo instead of through the feeforservice program at minimum these beneficiaries are entitled to the basic medicare benefit package some managed care enrollees may be entitled to additional benefits the scope of additional bene fits varies by plan the basic medicare benefit package provi des broad protection against the costs of many primarily acute health care services however beneficiaries may still be faced with significant additional costs medicare requires costsharing for most covered services provides only limited protection for some services such as long term care and includes protection agains t the costs of other services such as hearing aids and dentures further like most large group health insurance plans medicare contains upper catastrophic limit on outofpocket expenses as result the program covers only about half of benefici aries total health costs most medicare beneficiaries have some form of public or private coverage to supplement their medicare benefits public coverage is provide d primarily through medicaid private protection

of benefits contractor coba eligibility filebased cr ossover process the coba has assigned medigap insurers claim based identifiers which must be used when submitting claims 4 the law incorporates by reference as part of the statutory require ments certain minimum standards established by the national asso ciation of insurance commissioners naic these minimum standards known as the nai c model standards are found in the naic model regulation the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms the agency that administers medicare published notice in the federal register on march 25 2005 which recognized the latest version with cl arifications adopted by the naic on september 8 2004supplementary coverage most beneficiaries have so form of private or pub lic coverage to supplement medicare in 2004 only 93 of communityb ased beneficiaries relied solely on the traditional feeforservice program an additional 145 relied on coverage through their medicare managed care organization in 2004 607 of communitybased medicare enrollees had priv ate supplemental coverage an additional 140 had coverage through medicaid nd an additional 15 had othe r public sector coverage private insurance

had these plans in 20042 medigap medigap policies are intended to fill in some of the gaps in original medicare persons enrolled in medicare advantage pl an generally do not need medigap plan because their ma plans generally cover some of the same benefits offered by medigap plans beneficiaries with medigap insurance typi cally have coverage for some or all of medicares deductibles and coinsurance when beneficiary receives care the medicare contractor pays first the contractor then forwards the claim directly to the medigap insurer which then pays its portion of the bill3 some medigap policies also cover some items and services not covered by medicare in this case the claim is sent directly to the medigap insurer the social security act contains certain requirements governing the sale of medi gap policies4 policy choices standardized plans generally insurance companies can not sell medigap policies unless they conform to one of the standardized be nefit packages individualshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31223crs4 first purchasing medigap policy on or afte r july 30 1992 have been able to select from one of 10 standardized plans though not all 10 plans have been

additional be nefits plan j is the most comprehensive see table 2 the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl10533 added two high deductible plans to the list of 10 standard plans with the exception of the high deductible feature the benefit package under the high deductible plan is the same as that under plan f or plan h the 2007 deductible under these plans is 1860 this approach removed firstdolla r coverage which was expected to result in reduction in premiums reportedly few insurers have offered these high deductible plans as noted in table 2 plans h i and j include c overage for prescription drugs however effective january 1 2006 the effec tive date of the part d drug benefit new sales of policies with drug coverage are prohibited thus new h i and j policies sold on or after that date can not include drug coverage further medigap policy with an outpatient pr escription drug rider can be sold individuals who purchased h i and j policies prior to january 1 2006 may keep and renew such

law contains certain requirements relating to enrollment in medigap plans in certain cases beneficiaries are guaranteed the right to enroll in specified medigap plans under certain conditions these are known as guaranteed issue provisions sixmonth open enrollment federal law establishes an open enrollment period for the aged all insurers offering medigap policies are required to offer open enrollment for six months from the date person first enrolls in part b generally when the enrollee turns 655 during this time an insurer cannot deny the issuance or discriminate in the pricing of policy because of an individuals medical history health status or claims experien ce this requirement is known as guaranteed open enrollment if an individual applies for medigap policy after the open enrollment period the company is permitted to use medical unde rwriting this means that the company can use an individuals medical history to decide whether or not to accept the application and how much to charge for the policy there is guaranteed open enrollme nt period for the nonaged disabled population however when disabled pe rson turns 65 that individual has the same open enrollment period as other aged persons guaranteed issue the law guarantees issuance of specified medigap policies without an exclusion based on preexisting condition for certain persons whose previous supplementary coverage was terminated guaranteed issue also applies to certain persons who elect to tr out medicare advantage plan in these cases individuals are guaranteed issue of specific medigap plans generally

for purposes of medigap pre existing conditions are defined as those di agnosed or treated during the six months immediately preceding the start of mediga p policy at the time insurers sell medigap policy they are generally permitted to limit or exclude coverage for services related to preexisting health condition such preexisting condition exclusions cannot be imposed for more than six months however preexisting limitations may not be imposed at all in the following cases any individual who falls into one of the qualifying events categories discussed above under guaranteed issue these include persons whose previous coverage was invol untarily terminated or persons who elect to try out medicare advantage during the first sixmonth open rollment period if on the date of application the individual had at least sixmonths of health insurance coverage meeting the finition of creditable coverage under the health insurance portability and accountability act if the individual has less than six mont hs of creditable coverage the waiting period is reduced by the number of months of creditable coverage note that the insurer may impose preexisting exclusion limitation if the individual did not have such creditable coverage an individual who met the preexisting condition limitation in one medigap policy the individual does not have to meet the requirement under new policy for previously covered benefits however an insurer could impos exclusions for newly covered benefits ie for athome recovery if not covered under the previous policy the prohibition applies to persons who had coverage under prior policy for at least six months if the individual has less than six months prior coverage the policy must reduce the preexisting exclusion by the amount of the prior coverage implications of guarant eed issue protections the guaranteed issue provisions apply only to policies actually ffered by insurers for example plans b c or f may not actually be available in particular state while beneficiaries leaving terminating ma plan may be able to obtain medigap coverage their outof pocket expenditures are likely to increase first they will have to pay the mediga p premium second they ma have to pay outofpocket for some services previously covered by the managed care plan but not covered under original medicare or their medigap policy finally it is possible that the drug coverage available through standalone pa rt d drug plan may be more expensive than that available through the ma plan the guaranteed issue protections except for the one for persons who try ma upon turning 65 and disenroll within 12 m onths apply to both aged and disabled medicare enrollees however not all disabled persons will be able to take advantage of them because many medigap insurers do not market to the under65 populationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31223crs13 7 the centers for medicare and medicaid serv ices cms the agency that administers medicare reports that in 2007 the following

these requirements including those relating to st ate regulatory progra ms medigap policies and policy issuers and policy sales medigap premiums there is wide variation in medigap premiums nationwide this reflects number of factors including differences in th benefits of plan through plan l as well as differences in nonstandardized policies differen ces in underwriting practices and the difference in pricing stru ctures medigap insurers typically use one of three pricing mechanisms age at issue which bases the premium on the policyholders age when they first sign up attained age which bases the premium on the current age of the policyholder or community rating under which all policyholders pay the same rate attained age policies which are rapidly becoming the norm generally offer good rates to ounger enrollees however premiums go up significantly as the policyholders age communityrated policies are not widely available the last available survey of mediga p premiums is for 2005 the year before implementation of the part d drug benefit the survey conducted by weiss ratings inc found wide dispar ities in rates8 not only were there substantial variations between geographic regions but there were also dramatic differe nces for individuals purchasing identical plans in the same cation there were significant differences between the minimum and maximum premium for each policy type for

type premiums ranged from 516 to 10799 with an average premium of 17569 current issues currently the major issues facing digap are the types of policy options provided to medicare beneficiaries standardized plan options the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 obra 90 pl 101508 assigned the federal govern ment responsibility for regula ting medigap policies this legislation was enacted in response both to widespread marketing abuses in the sale of supplemental policies and consumer confusion with the wide array of policy choices among other things obra 90 provided for the standardization of medigap policies for number of years observers suggested that the existing standardized plans aj overemphasized firstdo llar coverage namely coverage of medicares cost sharing charges which many beneficiarie s could potentially budget for the plans included outofpocket prot ection for medicare costsha ring charges further they provided limited or protection for services not covered by medicare such as longterm care services another consideration was the impact of private coverage on medicare spending some studies estimated that medicare spending for beneficiaries with supplemental coverage was significantly hi gher than expenditures for those without such coverage1011 higher medicare spending reflected higher overall use of services high service use among those with priv ate supplementary coverage particularly medigap appeared to be di rect consequence of having such insurance beneficiaries who faced little or outofpocket costs at the time they used services even though they paid an often substan tial monthly premium for medigap may have perceived the services to be free comparison of service use between those with and without private supplementary coverage suggested that there may be somehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31223crs15 12 these outofpocket costs would however be considerably less than under the high deductible plans discussed earlieroverutilization of services however some of the increase may represent appropriate service use these observations prompted number of recommendations for change some observers recommended that the standard ized plans should be prohibited from offering firstdollar coverage for medicare s costsharing charges medigap policies would begin paying only after the bene ficiary had incurred some outofpocket costs12 this approach would be expected to make beneficiaries more cost conscious in their use of services and thereby hol d down medicares expenditures proponents asserted that medigap premiu ms should drop and therefore become more affordable other observers noted that the elderly are ri sk adverse and may not want to be liable for any outofpocket costs further they argued that beneficiaries might forgo needed medical services because they would be unable to pay the costsharing charges mma changes mma provided for the establishment of two additional plan types which may be sold as medigap policies unlike plans ah these plans include significant beneficiary costsharing coupled with catastrophic limit on outofpocket costs the legislation did not however eliminate existing beneficiary choices they are still able to purchase plans ah with the requis ite modifications in plans h i and j in theory insurers should be able to offer these policies for lower premiums thereby attracting some purchasers however the risk adverse nature of the elderly population may encourage them to continue purchasing plans that offer coverage for most outofpocket costs there are also questions relating to th interaction of part d with medigap purchase decisions it is po ssible that with the addition of drug coverage under part d and the accompanying premium some beneficiaries may elect to forgo medigap entirely data are not available to answer these questions naic recommendations mma required the secretary to request the naic to review and revise the medigap benefit packages taking into acc ount changes made by the new law the naic announced its recommendations in march 2007 the recommendations as described by the naic would eliminate unnecessary and duplicativ plans by
