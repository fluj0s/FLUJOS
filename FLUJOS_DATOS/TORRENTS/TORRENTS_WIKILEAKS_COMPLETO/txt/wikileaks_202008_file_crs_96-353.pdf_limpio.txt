general federal question jurisdiction is set forth in 28 usc 1331a which states that the district courts shall have origina l jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the constitution laws or treaties of the united states statutes providing for enforcement of federal statutes in federal court are common today although the earliest practice was to permit the state courts to adjudicate federal statutory rights 5 usconst art iii sec 2 cl 1 also provides for federal jurisdiction over cases between citizens of different states ie jurisdiction based upon diversity of citizenship and

power between state and federal government the case therefore addresses the basic premise of the constitution as establishing federal government sovereign in its sphere of delegated powers and state governments sovereign in realms reserved to them with the power of both derived from the ultimate sovereign the people3 the case also involve s the extent of judicial power established for the federal government article iii of the constitution inter alia specifies the judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity arising under this constitution the laws of the united states and

federal jurisdiction based on the phrase casesarising under this constitution the laws of the united states and treaties madeunder their authority is generally referred to as federal question jurisdiction the provision in igra that authorizes tribal suits against state is an example of statutory provision providing for jurisdiction on the basis of federal question ie on the basis of provision of federal statute enacted under authority of constitutional provision4 article iii also provides for what may be termed federal court citizenstate diversity hereinafter diversity5 jurisdiction over cases or controversies between state and citizens of another state as separate grounds for federal court jurisdiction in 1793 this language was interpreted to permit the supreme court under the authority of jurisdictional provision of the judiciary act of 1789 act of sept 24 1789 ch xx 1 stat 73 to entertain suit brought against an unconsenting state by citizen of another state that decision chisholm v georgia 2 dall 2 us 19 1793 created such public reaction that the eleventh amendment followed within two years of the decision6 the amendment reads the judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity commenced or prosecuted againsthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96353crs3 7 eleventh amendment jurisprudenc has become over the years esoteric and abstruse and the decisions internally inconsistent one with another and sometimes with the same decisionbecause of the centrality of the amendment at the intersection of federal

citizens or subjects of any foreign state whether its meaning is confined to overturning the result in chisholm or whether it was intended to reach fartherto prohibit all suits brought by citizens against unconsenting states in federal courthas not been an easy issue for the court to settle7 to some extent the jurisdictional provisions of article iii the language of the eleventh amendment and the common law notion of sovereign immunity have figured in the courts eleventh amendment decisions although the wording of the amendment and its proximity to the chisholm decision argue for its being confined to the diversity section of article iii and early decisions seem to substantiate this interpretation8 after the civil war the court ruled in actions to enforce state debt obligations against state officers that suits by citizens of another state were precluded by the amendment even if they were brought on the basis of federal question in louisiana v jumel 107 us 711 1883 hagood v southern 117 us 52 1886 and in re ayers 123 us 443 1887 the willingness of the court to hold the states immune to unconsented suits by citizens was further expanded 1890 in hans v louisiana 134 us 1 in that case the court ruled that the eleventh amendment precluded suit brought under the contracts clause of the constitution9 by citizen of state against the state to enforce state debt obligation that the state had repudiated the grounds on which the decision rested was not the wording of the eleventh amendment but rather the fact that the chisholm decision was so quickly overturned by the amendment and the inference that suits against sovereign were unknown at common law and thus not within the contemplation of the drafters of the constitution it might thus be said that view of common law sovereign immunity informed the hans decision although there was careful or extensive analysis of how that principle applied under the federalstate system established under the constitution the decision the main issue before the suprem court in seminole was whether the eleventh amendment bars congress from authorizing indian tribes to sue states to enforce the compacting provisions of igra the court in an opinion written by chief justice rehnquist and joined by justices oconnor scalia kennedy and thomas concluded that although congres s in enacting igra had intended to abrogate the states sovereignhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96353crs4 10 in reaching this decision the court refused to accept the tribes arguments that the provision was valid because it only authorized prospective relief not money damages or that it was valid because igra gave to the states some authority over indian gaming which they would not have had had it not been enacted 11 pennsylvania v union gas co 491 us 1 1920 1989 12 seminole tribe of florida v florida slip op at 17 13 id 14 among the defects noted were the absence of majority adhering to rationale for deciding the case departure from hans and misreading of other precedent includ ing the misapplication of fitzpatrick outside the context of the fourteenth amendment and the resulting confusion it spawned in the lower courts immunity it had power to do so10 to determine how to analyze the question of whether the constitution conferred power on congress to abrogate the eleve nth amendment as in igra the court looked to precedent and found two provisions of the constitution that had been held to provide congress with the power to abrogate states eleventh amendment immunity the fourteenth amendment fitzpatrick v bitzer 427 us 445 1976 and the interstate commerce clause usconst art i sec 8 cl 3 pennsylvania v union gas co 491 us 1 1989 the court distinguished abrogation under the fourteenth amendment from abrogation under provisions of the original constitution it viewed abrogation under the fourteenth amendment as grounded both in section 5 of that amendment which explicitly gave congress the power to enforce its provisions by appropriate legislation and in the fact that the fourteenth amendment had so expanded federal power visavis state power as to alter the balance established in the original constitution with respect to abrogation under the interstate commerce clause however the court reviewed union gas it noted that there was opinion of the court in that decision because justice white who was the deciding vote in the majority of five justices wrote separate opinion that concurred in the judgment but dissented in part from its rationale the opinion of four justices in union gas writte n by justice brennan saw the commerce clause as incomplete without the authority to render states liable in damages11 and found the power to abrogate under the commerce clause function of the states surrender of their sovereignty in ceding to the central government the authority over interstate commerce the court in seminole readily acknowledged that if anything the indian commerce clause accomplishes greater transfer of power from the states to the federal government than does the interstate commerce clauseclear enough from the fact that the states still exercise some authority over interstate trade but have been divested of virtually all authority over indian commerce and indian tribes12 it further agreed with the seminole tribe that union gas allows principled distinction in favor of the states to be drawn between the indian commerce clause and the interstate commerce clause13 and noting various defects in union gas 14 overruled ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96353crs5 15 monaco v mississippi 292 us 313 322323 1934 footnotes and citations omitted holding that suit against an unconsenting state by foreign state was not surrender ofimmunity in the plan of the constitutional convention the court declared that neither the literal sweep of the words of clause one of 2 of article iii nor the absence of restriction in the letter of the eleventh amendment permits the conclusion that in all controversies of the sort described in clause one and omitted from the words of the eleventh amendment state may be sued without her consent monaco v mississippi at 321 16 pennhurst state school v halderman 465 us 89 1984 in which the court presumed that the principle of sovereign immunity is constitutional limitation on the federal judicial power established in article iii pennhurst state school at 88 17 ex parte new york 256 us 484 497 citations omitt ed 1921 in which the court summarized its view of the established law that state may not be sued without its consent is fundamental rule of jurisprudence having so important bearing upon the construction of the constitution of the united states that it has become established by repeated decisions of this court that the entire judicial power granted by the constitution does not embrace authority to entertain suit brought by private parties against state without consent given not one brought by citizens of another state or by citizens or subjects of foreign state because of the 11th amendment and not even one brought by its own citizens because of the fundamental rule of which the amendment is but an exemplificationafter citing cases in which the court had held that foreign state could not bring suit against an unconsenting state15 citizens could not bring suit against state based on state law when the remedies sought required state action16 and that citizens of state could not bring an action in admiralty against an unconsenting state17 the opinion noted that seminole was the first instance other than union gas in which the court addressed the question of whether congress could abrogate states eleventh amendment immunity it found constitutional authority for such abrogation it relied not on the limited wording of the eleventh amendment nor on the bare holding of hans instead it seems to have attributed to hans the view that the eleventh amendment should be interpreted as validating the presumption that must have precipitated the public reaction to chisholm that the constitution preserved state immunity to unconsented suits the court rejected the contention that neither chisholm nor the eleventh amendment touched upon federal question jurisdiction raised in lengthy dissent written by justice souter and extensively covering references to state sovereign immunity at the constitutional convention and in the federalist papers as well as in the courts and in legal commentary the dissent and the opinion of the court draw conflicting inferences from the fact that there appears discussion of sovereign immunity visavis federal question jurisdiction at the time of the constitutional convention or the drafting of the eleventh amendment more important according the court is the absence of any statements by the framers acknowledging power in congress to waive or abrogate state sovereign immunity although the court found that the powers conveyed to congress to enforce laws properly enacted under article i did not include the power to authorize citizens to bring enforcement actions against the states it noted that various enforcement mechanisms were available to the federal government congress could 1 authorize suits in state courts 2 authorize the attorney general or federal officer to enforce federal law 3 induce the states to consent to such suits by offering something in return for such consent andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96353crs6 18 in ex parte young 209 us 123 159 1927 the court said the act to be enforced is alleged to be unconstitutional and if it be so the use of the name of the state to enforce an unconstitutional act to the injury for complainants is proceeding without the authority of sic and one which does not affect the state in its sovereign or governmental capacity it is simply an illegal act upon the part of state official in attempting by the use of the name of the state to enforce legislative enactment which is void because it is unconstitutional4 authorize suits to require individual state officers to conform to the requir ements of federal law the last type of suit is based upon the courts decision in ex parte young 209 us 123 1927 such suit has been held not to violate the eleventh amendment so long as what is sought is prospective relief and so long as the suit is directed against individual state officials ex parte young involved suit against state attorney general to enjoin enforcement of state laws setting rates for railroads that the shareholders of the railroads alleged confiscatory in violation of the fourteenth amendment ex parte young held the state statutes unconstitutional and therefore permitted the suit against the officer18 in seminole the court ruled that ex parte young suit against state official could not be maintained on the basis of igras provisions because such suit is not explicitly authorized and the remedies actually provided are so detailed as to preclude implying an ex parte young remedy the implication is that were there an explicit provision authorizing suit against states governor or other individual officer to negotiate compact the eleventh amendment would not stand as bar conclusion while the immediate reach of seminole is confined to igra it affects all of the powers of congress under article i except those exercised in reliance on the explicit enforcement authority section 5 of the fourteenth amendment unless congress has specifically provided for an ex parte young type suit against state official or obtained consent by state to suit in federal court statutes calling for citizen suits against states to enforce federal laws now appear to be unconstitutional
