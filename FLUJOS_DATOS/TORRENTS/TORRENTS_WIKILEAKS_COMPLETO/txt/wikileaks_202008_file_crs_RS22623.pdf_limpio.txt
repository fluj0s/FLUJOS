of workers average taxable monthly compensation for the highest 60 months of earnings times their years of service less 25 of any vested dual benefitsocial security benefits railroad workers who also had nonrailroad employment receive benefits from either rrb or the social s ecurity administration depending on the length of their railroad service to be insured fo r an rrb annuity worker must generally have at least 10 years of covered railroad work or five years performed after 1995 the family of an insured railroad worker receives rrb nnuities equal to or greater than the social security benefits they would have received if the workers railroad work had been covered by social security if worker does not qualify for an rrb annuity his or her railroad work counts toward social security benefits there are two basic components of rrb annu ities tier i and tier ii tier i amounts are equivalent to social security benefits they are calculated using the social security benefit formula with the rrb age and serv ice requirements and are based on both rrb and social securitycovered em ployment after tier i amounts are first paid they increase annually with costofliving adjustment col in the same manner as social security benefits2 tier ii retirement amounts are paid in addition to tier i amounts and any private pension and retirement savings plan s offered by railroad employers3 they are similar to private pensions and are based solely on c overed railroad service tier ii amounts are increased annually by 325 of the social security cola the surviving spouses and in some cases former spouses of railroad workers may be eligible to receive widow or widower annuities from rrb after the workers death rrb survivor annuities are generally higher than comparable social security benefits since families of railroad work ers may be entitled to tier ii amounts as well as tier i amounts which are equivalent to social security benefits at full retirement age surviving spouse may be eligible for up to 100 of the workers rrb annuity or his or her own social security benefit if higher as early as age 60 or age 50 if disabled widows and widowers may receive reduced nnuity at any age widower caring for deceas ed workers child under age 16 may recei ve an annuity of up to 75 of the workers tier i amount plus 100 of the workers tier ii amount railroad retirement and surviv ors improvement act of 2001 the railroad retirement and survivors improvement act of 2001 pl 10790 hereafter cited as the 2001 law was based on joint recommendations negotiated by railroad labor and mana gement the 2001 law increased initial annu ities for the widowers of qualifying railroad employees other provisions in the 2001 law which are not covered in this report include 1 llowing railroad retiremen t funds to be invested in nongovernmental assets 2 removing the early retirement reduction from tier i amounts for employees with 30 years of railr oad experience who retire at age 60 or 61

widowers affected by the 2001 law the changes to widowers annuities in the 2001 law apply to all widowers who receive annuities starting in february 2002 or later the ne w rules also apply to some widowers who began to receive annuities before that date if they would ve received higher benefit had the 2001 law been in effect on the day they began to receive annuities for many widowers who began to receive annuities before 2002 the new rules would not have increased their annuities because previous costofliving adjustments raised their annuities to higher amount changes to widow and widower annuities the 2001 law added new guaranty amount that increased initial annu ities for qualifying widowers under prior law widowers received 100 of the em ployees tier i amount and 50 of the employees tier ii amount the 2001 law added supplemental guaranty amount initially set at 50 of the employees tier ii amount to the amounts provided under prior law the total initial minimum amount after the 2001 law ie current law is 100 of the tier i and tier ii amounts the employee would have received at the time the widower begins to receive an annuity minus any applicab reductions eg fo r early

deceased spouses tier i amount tier ii amount 50 of deceased spouses tier ii amount100 of deceased spouses tier ii amount ie the sum of 50 of the deceased spouses tier ii amount and the guaranty amount source railroad retirement board notes these initial amounts are subject to any applicable reductions eg early retirement or family maximum prior law is before the 2001 law current law is after the 2001 law costofliving adjustments the components of widowers regular annuity change over time both the widowers tier i amount and regular tier ii amount ie not including the guaranty amount are increased each year tier i amounts are increased by the same amount as the social security cola and regular tier ii amounts are increased by 325 of the social security cola however the dollar amount of each years cola is offset by an equal reduction to th guaranty amount since the cola increasehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22623crs4 5 railroad retirement board annual railroad retirement act railroad unemployment insurance act data statistical t ables data through fiscal year 2005 table b2 sept 2006 at httpwwwrrbgovpdfactst05partb1pdf 6 this figure applies only to aged survivors however widowers of any age caring for qualifying child may also receive the higher initial minimum amountand the guaranty reduction are equal the total amount of widowers monthly annuity will not change for several years thus wi dowers annuity in this period will stay the same in nominal terms but decline in real terms ie after adjusting for inflation when the guaranty amount is ultimately reduced to zero the widower will begin to receive an increase in his or her total monthly annuity for the first time as the tier i and regular tier ii annuities continue to increase each year by the applicable cola higher widow and widower annuities after the 2001 law all widowers who are eligible to receive the initial minimum amount provided by the 2001 law receive annuities that are greater than or equal to the annuities they w ould have received under prior law in 2001 before the changes to widower annuities took effect the average aged widower annuity awarded was 1138 per month in real 2005 dollars5 in 2005 four years after the change the average aged widower annuity awarded was 1416 per month in real 2005 dollars6 illustration of widow annuity under prior and current law to see how widower annuities are calcu lated under current law and prior law consider widow who has reached the fu ll retirement age whose husband died in 2006 this illustration is based on hypothetical widow other widowers outcomes will vary initial annuity amount as shown in table 2 the widows initial annuity under prior law had it applied in 2006 would have been 1150 1000 tier i and 150 tier ii under current law the widows initia l minimum amount would be 1300 per month 1000 tier i and 300 tier ii her tier ii annui ty under current law is composed of regular tier ii amount of 150 as we ll as guaranty amount of 150 each representing 50 of the tier ii annuity her husband would have received in 2006 because of the addition of the guaranty amount to her regu lar annuity her total annuity amount is 150 more than she would have received under prior law costofliving adjustments table 2 also shows that the widows total annuity will not increase due to colas until her tier i and regular tier ii amounts begin to exceed her initial minimum amount thus her total annuity 1300 would not increase during the years between 2006 and 2012 though the tota l amount of her annuity stays the same the components would change each year th widows tier i amount would increase from 1000 in 2006 to 1023 in 2007 ie by 23 and her regular tier ii amount would increase from 150 in 2006 to 151 in 2007 ie by 1 this increase of 24 in the regular annuity mirrors what the widow w ould have received under prior law at the same time the widows guaranty amount would decrease by 24 from 150 to 126 because of the annual offset to the guaranty amount as result her total tier ii annuity under current law ie her regular tier ii amount plus her guaranty amount would be 277 in 2007 even though the widow does not receive cola her annuity is greater than it would have been under prior lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22623crs5 table 2 illustration of rrb monthly annuities for widow awarded benefits in 2006 under prior law

costofliving adjustments from the 2006 social security trustees report notes the guaranty amounts are included in the tier ii annuities under current law they are also presented separately in this table for illustrative purposes in 2012 the amount of the widows total m onthly annuity would begin to increase due to colas at that point her guaranty amount will have been re duced to zero after gradually declining each year to offset the amount of the annual cola in other words starting in 2012 her tier i and regular tier ii amounts would begin to exceed her initial minimum amount under current law the widow s total monthly annuity would be 1323 in 2012 higher than her 2011 annuity amount of 1300 in 2012 and for each year thereafter the amount of the widows total monthly annuity under current law is the same as it would have been under prior law for example in 2012 her annuity would be 1323 under both current law and prior law figure 1 presents the differences between cu rrent and prior law using the amounts shown in table 2 under prior law the widows monthly annuity in 2006 would have been the sum of the tier i amount 1000 and the tier ii amount 150 or 1150 shown at the top of the tier ii line in the figure under current law however the widow also receives the guaranty amount 150 bringi ng her total annuity in 2006 to 1300 shown at the top of the guaranty amount
