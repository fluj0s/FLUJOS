the declining salience of drug abus as public policy issue and the shift in emphasis within federal law enforcement and the us armed services from drug control to counterterrorism ce the events of september 11 20014 it is noteworthy that the question of whether illicit drug control still warrants special agency within the executive office of the president went unexamined during congressional consideration of ondcps reau thorization extended for an additional five years the agency will continue to play leading role in americas global war on drugs oversight of ondcp in the 110th congress in the house both authorization nd oversight of ondcp lie within the jurisdiction of the oversight and government reform committee accordingly that committees domestic policy subcommittee chaired by representative kucinich held an oversight hearing on march 12 2008 entitled the national drug control strategy for 2008 the fiscal year 2009 dr ug control budget and compliance with the ondcp reauthorization act of 2006 priorities and accountability at ondcp the stated purpose of the hearing was to examine 1 the priorities of the 2008 national drug control strategy 2 the pr iorities of the fy2009 na tional drug control budget and 3 ondcps compliance with th reauthorization act especially the revised budgetary reporting requireme nts and the mandated performance measurement system httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32352crs4 5 this statement and the written testimony of the hearing witnesses are available on the subcommittees website at httpdomesticpolicyoversighthousegovstoryaspid1801 transcript of the hearings proceedings is not yet availablein his opening statement5 chairman kucinich set forth issues concerning ondcps accountability and overa ll effectiveness to be covered at the hearing including the lack of transparency and accountability at ondcp which impairs ondcps and congresss ability to determine which federal drug control programs are eff ective in combating drug abuse the failure of ondcp to include in the national drug control budget all funding requests for any drug control activity including costs attributable to drug law enforcement activities such as prosecuting and incarcerating federal drug law offenders as required by the new reauthorization act ondcps unw illingness to comply with the standards of accountability congress has imposed in providing congress with the reports mandated by the reauthorization act the difficulty faced by congress in determining whether progress is being made in combating drug abuse because ondcp doesnt employ consistent or useful performance measures and frequently shifts its policy goals and the imbalance in the national drug control budget between supplyside programs such as sourcec ountry eradication and interdiction and demandside initiatives such as prevention and treatment with the supply side receiving grow ing share of the budget despite research that demonstrates that demandside approaches are generally more costeffective than supplyside approaches chairman kucinich also noted that the written testimony of the principal witness at the hearing ondcp director john p walters entirely omits discussion of ondcps compliance with the reauthorizati on act despite repeated clear requests that these issues be addressed the pr epared testimony of the other two hearing witnesses however did cover the concerns of the subcommittee former ondcp official j ohn carnevale expressed his disagreement with the current bush administration s emphasis on supply reduction by the 1990s we had learned that interdiction was relatively ineffective way of reducing drug use and expensive besides so we focused our efforts on demand reduction now at the beginning of the new millennium we have inexplicably come to believe again th at source and transit zone interdiction is an effective way to reduce drug use in america there is evidence to support this belief in short what we now know is that so long as there is demand for illicit drugs supply will follow he pointed out significant shortcomings in ondcps meeting of its statutory obligations and said as result of thes failures ondcp is longer seen as serious player in the drug issue he outlined some ways to restructure the agencyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32352crs5 so that it might regain meaningful role in shaping drug policy in the next administration such as moving some of its programs to other drug control agencies so that ondcp could return to being po licy office according to dr carnevale ondcp must rediscover its roots by this statement i mean that ondcp should again focus on becoming leader in policy formulation on behalf of the president to allow the administration to develop drug policy that is evidencebased and includes performance measurement to hold it accountable for results the final hearing witness economist rosalie liccardo pacula codirector of the drug policy research center at the rand corporation testified on what research says about the reasonableness of the current prior ities of national drug control in her view the 2008 national dr ug control strategy supports programs in several areas that have already been shown to be completely ineffective or that have never been scientifi cally proven to be effectiv and which on analytic grounds seem unlikely to be successful these include efforts in colombia and afghanistan intended to decrease the supplies in the united states of cocaine and heroin respectively random student drug testing and the national outh antidrug media campaign according to dr pacula research conducted at rand and elsewhere shows that sourcecountry crop eradication and in terdiction efforts along with prevention and education programs work best in emergi ng drug markets at the early stages of drug epidemic later in the cycle after th size of the market for particular has grown the epidemic reaches its mature pha and the number of new users declines at this point research shows that treatment programs directed at heavy and dependent users become more costeffec tive way of addressing the problem and reducing use given that drug market s for our three primary drugs of abuse marijuana cocaine and heroin are all in mature stages her written testimony states the continued emphasi s on supplyside strategies is inappropriate she concludes the strategy in its current form is ne ither balanced nor costeffective and as such suggests need for congress to carefully scrutinize the structure of the budget request by cutting the budget for programs lacking scientific support or strong analytic arguments and reallocatin g those funds to program areas that are known to be effective the nation will ve much better chance of successfully reducing substance abuse and its many costs on society this would produce strategy that more closely addresses the drug situation that exists here in the united states the first oversight hearing since enactment of the new reauthorization act in 2006 thus provided criticisms and insights regarding ondcps leadership of the federal war on drugs that might influe nce the appropriations process for fy2009 and beyond inform future congressional oversight and even provide the next administration with ideas for restructur ing ondcp and rethinking the goals and strategies of the federal g overnments approach to the problem of drug addiction in american societyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32352crs6 6 these bills from the 108th congress are discussed briefly in the final section of this report 7 us congress house

reauthorization act the discussion deals primarily with amendments or changes made by hr 6344 to the expired act the office of national drug control policy reauthorization act of 199816 provisions of the prior law that re main unchanged are mentioned only where necessary to provide context for understa nding the revisions made by hr 6344 short title and law being amended sec 117 unless otherwise stated the office of national drug control policy reauthorization act of 2006 am ends or repeals provisions contained in the office of national drug control policy reauthoriz ation act of 1998 pl 105277 21 usc 1701 et seq since hr 6344 was wr itten to amend the expired ondcp reauthorization act many of the provisions of this prior law re main untouched by the new reauthorization act these provisions that are carried over from the expired act along with the amendments provided in hr 6344 constitute cu rrent law and are so designated in the re mainder of this report amendments to definitions sec 101 the new reauthorization act changes the definition of certain terms as they were defined in the expired law sec 702 21 usc 1701 perhaps the most important changes are in the definitions of state and local affairs and supply reduction domestic law enforcement directed agai nst drug users has been dropped from the definition of supply reduction and placed under the definition of state and local affairs this change serves statutorily to move responsibility for handling domestic law enforcement matters from ondcps offi ce of supply reduction to its office of state and local affairs these changes are intended to make current law reflect what ondcp is already doing in practice and would make it clear that domestic law enforcement activities serve wi der purpose than supply reduction the new act also expands the definiti on of demand reduction to include demand reduction efforts abroad and it newl defines appropria congressional committees to mean the appropriations and judiciary committees of both chambershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32352crs10 18 the committee on government reform has been renamed the committee on oversight and government reform in the 110th congress 19 this and the following three provisions were taken from s 1860 sec 103b6 in the 108th congressalong with the senate cauc us on international narcotics control and the house government reform committee18 designation and du ties of ondcp officers sec 102 responsibilities current law sec 703a 21 usc 1702a requires that ondcp evaluate the effectiveness of the national drug control policy and agency programs the new reauthorization act has added language requiring that the evaluation be done by developing and applying specific goals and performance measurements rank of director current law sec 703b 21 usc 1702b has been amended by hr 6344 to give the ondcp di rector the same rank and status as the heads of the executive departments current law already assigns the director to the same pay scale as the executive department heads deputy directors as in the expired law the new reauthorization act provides for deputy directors for demand re duction supply re duction and state local and tribal affairs the new act specifies that these three deputy directors report to the deputy director of national dr ug control policy who reports to the director the new law further states that the deputy director for supply reduction must have substantial experience and expertise in dr ug interdiction and other supply reduction activities the deputy director for state local and tribal affairs is made responsible for the high intensity dr ug trafficking areas program and the counterdrug technology assessment center responsibilities of the director sec 103 the new reauthorization act retains th current structure of ondcp and makes limited changes to strengthen the authority of the director in addition to the directors responsibilities contained in current law sec 704b 21 usc 1703b the new act has added the following supporting the substance abus information clearinghouse administered by the substance abuse and mental health services administration

the impact each federal drug reduction strategy has had upon the availability addi ction rate use rate and other harms of illegal drugs20 country certification both hr 2829 sec 6g4 and s 2560 sec 105d4 would have added to the powers of the director sec 704 d 21 usc 1703d requirement that the director submit to the president later than august 1 of each year report that 1 iden tifies countries that are major drug transit countries or major drug producing countries 2 assesses those countries efforts to reduce the supply of illicit drugs to the united states and 3 assesses whether application of the procedures set fort h in the foreign assistance act of 1961 as amended 22 usc 2291j1 should be pplied against those c ountries that have not cooperated fully with the united states the standard by which the secretary of state evaluates the cooperation of fore ign nations in drug control efforts was reduced in 2003 from not fully cooperating to failed demonstrably the house government reform committee wanted the president to receive second independent assessment from the ondcp dir ector that would have been conducted under the older more rigorous standard21 this requirement however was not included in hr 6344 under the new reau thorization act therefore the director will continue to participate in the state departments country certification process but will not be required statutorily to submit independent findings based on the pre 2003 standard fund control notices the director has the power to issue to the head of national drug control program agency fund control notice to ensure that agencys compliance with the national dr ug control strategy sec 704d9 21 usc 1703d9 fund control notice ma direct that all or part of an amount appropriated to the national drug

not permitted to expend funds contrary to fund control notice issued by the ondcp director hr 6344 has amended the fund control notice provisions of current law sec 704f 21 usc 1703f to require that copy of each fund control notice be transmitted to the appropriate congressional committees it also has restricted the director from issuing fund control notice to direct that all or part of an amounthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32352crs12 22 this section of hr 6344 appears to contai n drafting error the language relating to drug interdiction is written as if it were replacing sec 711 of the expired act but the bill says the new language is to be added at the end of sec 711 the old sec 711 actually contains reporting and budget planning requi rements relating to interdiction that are outdated and should be replaced not added t these and other drafting errors undoubtedly occurred because of the hurried manner in which the bill was prepared near the close of the 109th congress 23

the annual national inte rdiction command and control plan and provide advice to the director and the united states interdiction coordinator concerning that plan and provide other advice to the direct

director and specified committees of congress detailing specific aspects of their departments drug control activities the new act also requires report from the attorney general on drug violation

purpose and if they had parate line item account in the presidents annual budget re quest these changes resulted in lower budget numbers for many drug control agencies and the elimination of some agencies from the drug control budget altogether ondcp said the new drug budget woul d better serve congress and the public and bring greater accountability to federal dr ug control efforts others however including some members of congress said the new drug budget distorted the true costs of the war on drugs by among other things excluding the costs of incarcerating drug offenders and the costs of other drug law enforcement activities this served to exaggerate the proportion of the budget slated for drug treatment expenditures thereby making the budget appear more evenly balanced between enforcement and prevention than in previ ous years even though little if any change had actually taken place the new reauthorization act contains provisions designed to force ondcp to return to the older more inclusive way of calculating the federal drug control budget summaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32352crs16 25 this provision was added to hr 2829 by floor amendment offered by rep terry 26

required is supplement to the strategy that reviews the activities of each individual national drug control program agency during the preceding year with respect to the national drug control strategy and that contains the directors assessment of the progress of each agency in meeting its responsibilities under the strategy the new reauthorization act drops the specific numerical targets for reducing drug use contained in the expired w sec 706a4 21 usc 1705a4 these targets covered the period 1999 to 2003 and were largely unmet the new act lets stand however the requirement for co mprehensive longrang and quantifiable goals for reducing drug abuse and its cons equences backed by annual objectives and targets that are designed to move the country toward the strategys goals and objectives not included in the new reauthorizati on act was provision in hr 2829 sec 8 that would have required the strategy to include data on current drug use trends that can be compared with

concerning how hidtas are designated beyond the directive in the expired act that the director may designate such areas in consultation with the attorney general the secretary of the treasury heads of the national drug control program agencies and the governors of th applicable states most hidtas have been designated through this consultative process although few have been created by congress in

regarding the merit of the petition to the director by panel of qualified independent experts organization of hidtas the expired act did not address how hidtas should be organized and operated th new

members of the house judiciary committee during its markup of hr 2086 in the 108th congress34 it is helpful to remember that the hidta program is law enforcement program and that treatment and prevention funds are found elsewhere in the federal drug control budget principa lly within the depar tment of health and human services counterterrorism activities the new reauthorization act allows the director to authorize the use of available hidta resources to assist federal state local and tribal law enforcement agencies in investigations and activities related to terrorism and terrorism prevention especially when such investig ations and activities are also related to drug trafficking the director however is required to ensure that assistance provided for counterterrorism rema ins incidental to the hidta programs purpose of reducing drug availability and carrying out drugrelated law enforcement activities and that significant program resources are not redirected to activities

the attorney general is now required to ensure that representative of the drug enforcement administration is included in the intelligence support center of each hidta annual hidta program budget submissions previously the amount of funding received by each hidta was dete rmined by the director after the annual appropriations bill was enacted thereby bypassing congressional scrutiny the new

instead the amended version of hr 2086 would have forbi dden any media campaign funds from being used for partisan political purposes or advo cacy in support of or to defeat any clearly identified

initiatives in the states and to curtail ondcps alleged use of dia campaign ads to persuade voters to oppose such initiatives at markup representative waxman the committees ra nking member offered an amendment to eliminate the requirement in current law sec 704b12 that the director take such actions as necessary to oppose any attempt to legalize the use of substance in any form that is listed in
