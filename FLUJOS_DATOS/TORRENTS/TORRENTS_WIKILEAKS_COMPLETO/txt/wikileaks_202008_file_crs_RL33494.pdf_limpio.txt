security classification however was not possible for some kinds of information deemed in some quarters to be sensitive other kinds of designations or markings came to be applied to alert federal employees regarding its privileged or potentially harmful character sometimes these markings derived from statutory provisions requiring the protection of type of information others were administratively authorized w ith little detail about their use in the current environment still affected by the long shadow of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 several issues have ar isen

protection of or provide privileged status for certain ki nds of information for the legislative branch for example the constitution in article i section 5 specifies that each house of congress shall keep journal of its proceedings and from time to time publish the same excepting such parts as may in their judgment require secrecy in the next section of the article privileged status for certain remarks of members is established when the constitution indicates that for any sp eech or debate in either house they shall not be questioned in any other place within the executive branch it seems likely that one of the earliestfelt needs for secrecy concerned preparations and plans for the defense of the country following longstanding military practice general george washington and other officers in the continental army seeking to ensure the protection of information had written secret or confid ential on strategic communiques to each other in the field and to headquarters there was immediate formalization of this practice by the new federal government but it was from these roots that security classification would emerge that history is briefly revi ewed in the next section of this report the application of security classifica tion subsequently came to be regulated through narrowing of the bases and disc retion for assigning official secrecy to executive branch materials due to that and other information management developments new kinds of desi gnations or markings came to be used to alert federal employees about the privileged status or sensitive content of record or document sometimes these markings derived from statutory provisions requiring the protection of type of information many others were administratively created but lacked detailed management regimes early c ongressional experience with these other markings is examined providing back ground for considering some of the current issues they raise finally the report considers some longstanding difficulties attending the management of security classified information controlling the volume of such material and attendant costs it looks as well at r ecent efforts by some agencies to withdraw archived records from public access and reclassify them activity which the information security oversight office isoo of the national archives and records administration nara critically evalua ted and

arrangements prescribed by an executive order of the president trace their origins to march 1940 directive issued by president franklin d roosevelt as eo 83811 this development was probably prompted somewhat by desires to clarify the authority of civilian personnel in the national defense community to classify information to establish broader basis for protecting military information in view of growing global hostilities and to manage better discretionary power seemingly of increasing importance to the entire executive branch prior to this 1940 order informat ion had been designat ed officially secret by armed forces personnel pursuant to army and navy general orders and regulations the first systematic procedur for the protection of national defense information devoid of special markings were established by war department general orders 3 of february 1912 records determined to be confidential were to be kept under lock accessible only to the officer to whom intrusted serial numbers were issued for all such confidential materials with the numbers marked on the documents and lists of same kept at the offices from which they emanated with the enlargement of the armed forces after the entry of the united states into world war i the registry system wa s abandoned and tripartite system of classification markings was inaugurated in november 1917 with general orders 64 of the general headquarters of the american expeditionary force during world war ii in addition to the presidents order and prevailing armed forces directives on marking and handling classified informati on the office of war information in september 1942 issued governmentwide regulation on creating and managing classified materials among other ad hoc arrangements of the era personnel cleared to work on the manhattan project for the production of the atomic bomb in committing themselves not to disclose protected information improperly were required to read and sign either the espionage act or special secrecy agreement establishing their awareness of their secrecy obligations and fiduciary trust which if breached constitute d basis for their dismissal2 few years after the conclusion of world war ii president harry s truman in february 1950 issued eo 10104 whic h while superseding eo 8381 basically reiterated its text but added to restricted confidential and secret fourth top secret

executive was relying upon the authority vested in by the constitution and statutes and as president of the united states in issuing the directive this formula appeared to strengthen the presidents discretion to make official secrecy policy it intertwined his responsibility as commander in chief w ith the constitutional obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed5 second information was now classified in the interest of national security somewhat new but nebulous concept which in the view of some conveyed more titude for the creation of official secrets it replaced the heretofore relied upon nati onal defense standard for classification third the order extended classification authority to nonmilitary entities throughtout the executive branch to be exercised by presumably but not explicitly limited to those having some role in national security policy the broad discretion to cr eate official secrets granted by eo 10290 engendered widespread criticism from the public and the press in response president dwight d eisenhower shortly after his election to office instructed attorney general herbert brownell to review the order with view to revising or rescinding it the subsequent recommendation was for new di rective which was issued in november 1953 as eo 105016 it withdrew classification authority from 28 entities limited this discretion in 17 other units to the agency head returned to the national defense standard for applying secrecy eliminated the restricted category which was the lowest level of protection and explicitly defined the remaining three classification areas to prevent their indiscriminate use7 thereafter eo 10501 with slight ame ndment prescribed operative security classification policy and procedure for the next two decades successor orders built on this reform these included eo 11652 issued by president richard m nixon in march 19728 followed by eo 12065 promulgate d by president jimmy carter in june 19789 for 30 years these classification directives narrowed the bases and discretion for assigning official secrecy to executive branch documents and materials then in april 1982 this trend was reversed with eo

of the new order were changing world conditions the democratization of many eastern european countries the demise of the soviet union and the end of the cold war accountability and cost consider ations were also significant influences in 1985 the temporary department of defense dod security re view commission chaired by retired general richard g stilwell declared that there were verifiable figures as to the amount of classi fied material produced in dod and in defense industry each year nonetheless it conc luded that too much information appears to be classified and much at higher levels than is warranted13 in october 1993 the cost of the security classification program became cl earer when the general accounting office gao reported that it was able to id entify governmentwide costs directly applicable to national security in formation totaling over 350 million for 1992 after breaking this figure down it included only 6 million for declassification work the report added that the us government also spends additional billions of dollars annually to safeguard information pe rsonnel and property14 eo 12958 set limits for the duration of classification prohibited the

gust 1971 questionnaire which among other questions asked what legend is used by your agency to identify records which are not classifiable under executive order 10501 the operative order at the time but which are not to be made available outside the government17 of 58 information control markin gs identified in response to this question the most common were for official use only 11 agencies limited official use nine agencies official use only eight agencies restricted data five agencies administratively restricted four agencies formerly restricted data four agencies and nodis or dissemination four agencies seven other markings were used by two agencies in each case18 crs review of the agency responses to the control markings ques tion prompted the following observation often authority is cited for the establishment or origin of these labels even when some reference is provided it is handbook manual administrative order or circular but not stat utory authority exceptions to this are the atomic energy commission the defense depart ment and the arms control and disarmament agency these agencies cite the atomic energy act nato related laws and international agreements as basis for certain additional labels the arms control and disarmament agency acknowledged it honored and adopted state and defens department labels19 at may 1 1972 hearing on the relationship of the foi act to the security classification system chairman william s moorhead of the foreign operations and government information subcommittee committee on government operations wondered aloud how the acts nine exemptions to the rule of disclosure could be expanded to the multiple information control markings which the departments and agencies had indicated they were using20 the following day when the hearing continued william d blair jr deputy assistant secretary for public affairs at the department of state explained that some information control markings were used to route otherwise classifi ed information to limited group of recipients those people who have responsibility for the subject matter concerned he then addressed the relationship question raised by chairman moorhead saying but if question came in under the freedom of information act or from the congress or other representative of the public for that given document the fact that it is marked lets say nodis is not relevant what is relevant to the making available of that document to th public is whether or not it was properlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33494crs7 21 ibid pp 24772478 22 ibid p 2478 23 ibid 24 ibid p 2479classified under the executive order and whether or not the freedom of information act for example once we have reviewed the document still pertains whether we feel that the need for the classification still pertains and whether in fact we are author ized under the act to withhold it21 moment thereafter he explained anot her marking which was not applied to route classified informati on but apparently had the same effect as security classification protective marking limited official use is not fixed distri bution channel such as some of these other terms you have mentioned it simply is an administrative red flag put on that document which means that the document should be given the same degree of protection physical protec tion as classified document even though it is not under the executive order classifiable22 however when asked if in applying this particular marking you mean to exclude all individuals outside the partment subject to the freedom of information act where they can go to c ourt to obtain it blai rs response indicated that the use of the marking was somewhat more complicated than functioning as parallel security label when he said not necessarily sir that may be the case for instance one set of files on which we use limited official use quite comm only is personnel files well we would be very likely to deny those personnel files if they were requested by member of the public on quite different grounds from classification on grounds of invasion of privacy but on the other hand we may use term like limited official use on an internal advisory document which we may be authorized under the freedom of information act to withhold if it were requested but we might decide not to claim that authority23 although an attempt was made to obtain further explan ation of how information control markings were used the questioner subcommittee staff member concluded that all you have convinced of is to reinforce my belief that distribution marking is merely more restrictive or stricter type of classification marking24 later in the hearing in an exchange with the subcommittees staff director dod general counsel j fred buzhardt made another attempt to clarify the use of control markings in the first place you have determination as to whether the material is to be classified once the decision is made th at the information should be classified then the limitation of access has to do with the protection of that which is classified we also have the responsibility to control the dissemination that is what these access limitations are for to control dissemination to confine accesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33494crs8 25 ibid p 2497 26 ibid 27 ibid pp 24972498 28 see ibid p 2935to the people who have need to know to work with the information it is protection device we must use pr otective devices of some sort25 asked if the control markings such as eyes only were applied to material that was not classified buzhardt said i presume you wouldnt find eyes onl in an authorized way upon any document that was not classified by one of the classifiers once it is classified you can use limitations on distribution to pr otect it that is protective device26 to this response blair added the purpose of classification is to dete rmine what information is or is not available to the public outside of the government these labels that you are referring to have nothing to do with th at they have absolutely value for determining what information or what document may be given to member of the public they are simply mailing device if you like means by which superior determines which of his subor dinates he wishes to deal with this particular matter and be aware of this particular information27 these explanations of information cont rol markings being used as devices to limit the distribution of classified informa tion within dod and the state department however did not appear to extend to all such markings blair for instance had testified that the limited official use marking was applied in his words quite commonly to personnel files which for the most part were not security classifiable materials at that time several entities indicating they used information control markings had original classification au thority these included among others the american revolution bicentennial commissi on arbc the depar tment of housing and urban development and th federal trade commission ftc28 does this situation mean that the control markings of these entities were applied only to limit the distribution of classified information received from other agencies that is possible but seems unlikely the arbc control marking administratively confidential appears to have been designed for information of different character from national security classified materials while the ftc label for staff use only does not appear to have provided much limitation on the distribution of classified information before this phase of the oversight hearings on the foi act concluded the subcommittee received testimony from assistant attorney general ralph erickson of the office of legal counsel department of justice on may 11 1972 during the course of his appearance before the s ubcommittee to discuss eo 11652 the use of control markings to limit the distribution of classified information was raised with

us today that these ki nds of distribution access stamps will not be used on unclassified material in any executive agency or department if you can guarantee that then i will go along and say section 4a is big improvement but i do not think that is going to be the case from other testimony we have had i think people are goin g to substitute limdis nodis and all these other stamps for the stamps authorized under the executive order and we are going to proliferate more and more and more29 erickson offered two part response first it is our hope within the depart ment of justice and i think in other agencies too that the use of this sort of restricted distribution will be severely limited or removed but more importantly it section 4a specifically limits the use of such designations to the poi nt where they must conform with the provision of this order and would have ffect in terms of classification it will not prevent the information from otherwise being made available it may in part restrict the distribution within the depa rtment but certainly if request were made under the freedom of information act it has applicability30 he assured his questioner that control markings used to limit the distribution of classified information will not have any ffect on disclosure under the foi act and would not in themselves be bar to disclosure later in may 1973 when reviewing this phase of the subcommittees oversight hearings report by the parent committee on government operations commented one of the difficult problems related to the effective operation of the security classification system has been the wide spread use of dozens of special access distribution or control labels stamps or markings on both classified and unclassified documents such control ma rkings were not specifically authorized in executive order 10501 but have been utilized for many years by many executive agencies having classification authority and dozens of other agencies who do not possess such authority the use of such stamps has in effect been legitimized in section 9 of the new executive order 1165231 on this matter the report concluded that while there is clear rationale for the use of such access or control markings the basic problem is the effect of the proliferation of their use on the effective operation of the classification system this problem it continued fully explored w ith executive branch witnesses during the hearings is one that this committee believe s should be carefully monitored by the newly created interagency classification review committee and by

information constituting ssi generally is not voluntarily submitted to the government which is required for the cii designation in addition ssi relates to both critical and noncritical infrastructure assets there may be cases however where the owner or operator of critical transportation asset voluntarily submits information such as vulnerability assessment to tsa or the coast guard if that information were to be designated by dhs as cii it would be governed by the requirements of handling of cii rather than by the ssi regulation another key difference between ssi and cii is the extent to which federal employee may disclose such information under the ssi regulation tsa may disclose ssi to persons with need to know in order to ensure transportation security this includes persons both within and outside the federal government the cii act however generally prohibits disclosure of properly designated cii outside the federal government thus th interim final rule clarifies that in

times 86 initial reported indications were that beginning in 1999 intelligence agencies pursuant to secret agreement with the national archives and records administration nara began secretly removing declassified records from public access and had reclassifi ed more than 55000 of them the effort was apparently an attempt to reverse what some regarded as hasty compliance with the automatic

the national archives and records administration for classification purposes p 1of the reclassified documents had been previously published in the department of states history series foreign relations of the united states other reclassified records were regarded to be rather innocuous such as 1948 memorandum on central intelligence agency cia plan to float balloons over communist countries in eastern europe and dr op propaganda leaflets pr emature cia assessment in october 1950 that chinese intervention in the korean war was not probable in 1950 but actually occurred late in that month and 1962 telegram from ambassador to yugoslavia george f kenna n containing an english translation of belgrade newspaper artic on the chinese nuclear weapons program the times story indicated that the director of isoo after reviewing 16 withdrawn records and concluding that none of them should have been reclassified d ordered an audit of the reclassification effort the results of the isoo audit were released on april 26 2006 agencies conducting the rereviews of withdrawn r ecords since 1995 included the cia the department of energy the department of the air forc usaf and the federal emergency management agency their efforts resulted in the withdrawal of at least 23315 publicly available records approx imately 40 percent were withdrawn b ecause the reviewing agency purported that its classified information had been designated unclassified without its pe rmission and about 60 percen t were identified by the reviewing agency for referral to another agency for declassification or other public disclosure review87 in reviewing sample of 1353 of the withdrawn records isoo concluded that 64 percent of them did in fact contain information that clearly met the standards for continued classification said the audit report isoo also found that 24 of the sampled records were clearly inappropriate for continued classification and an additi onal 12 percent were questiona ble overall said the audit report depending upon the review ffort the sample of records withdrawn clearly met the standards for continued classification anywhere from 50 percent to 98 percent of the time88 why did this withdrawal and reclassifi cation of records happen isoo offered the following explanation there are number of contributing factors to the issues identified by this audit sufficient quality control and oversight by both the agencies and isoo has been lacking as has proper documentation for declassification decisions in addition nara has at times acquiesced too readily to the rereview efforts or withdrawal decisions of agencies additionally nara has not had the necessary resources available to keep p ace with agencies rereview activity let alone the overall declassification activity of the recent past which has resultedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33494crs31 89 ibid p 2 90 ibidin the accumulation of hundreds of millions of previously classified pages which require processing by nara the most significant deficiency identified by this audit however was the absence of standards including requisite levels of transparency governing agency rereview activity at nara absent these nara along with cia and usaf resorted to ad hoc agreements that in retrospect all recognize should never have been classified in the first place89 regarding remedial actions the udit report offered the following as result of this audit the affected ag encies have agreed to abide by interim guidance that includes provisions that require the public to be informed that records have been formally withdrawn from public access at nara due to classification action as well as how many records are affected prior to official promulgation in regulation this interim guidance will be fully coordinated to include an opportunity for public comment in addition in response to many of the challenges highlighted by this aud it the principal agencies involved in conducting classification reviews of records accessioned into nara have agreed in principle to create pilot na tional declassification initiative in order to more effectively integrate the work they are doing in this area this initiative will address the policies procedures structure and resources needed to create more reliable executive branchwide declassification program in response to the findings of this audit the director of isoo is writing to all agency heads asking for their personal attention in number of critical areas to include facilitating classification chal lenges and routinely sampling current classified information in order to determ ine the validity of classification actions in addition isoo will be initiating number of training efforts in support of these objectives finally agency heads will be requested to provide status report within 120 days on the action taken w ith respect to these initiatives as well as with regard to the recommendations c ontained within this audit report isoo will report publicly on these actions90 remedial legislation hr 984 waxman executive branch reform act of 2007 among other provisions section 7 would require each federal agency not later than six
