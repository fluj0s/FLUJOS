from tables provided by the house and senate committees on appropriations because of differing treatment of offsets rescissions and the structure of appropriations bills the totals will at times vary from those provided by the administration the fy2004 and later total budget numbers for dot are not directly comparable to those of previous years due to the transfer of the coast guard and transportation security administration to the department of homeland security during fy2003 as well as other changes 3 between the house and senate passage of the fy2006 appropriations bill congress continued crs6 the fy2006 budget also reflects statutory change to one of the dots administrations the norman mineta research and special programs improvement act which was enacted as pl 108426 118 stat 2423 created two new operating administrations in place of the former research and special programs administration rspa the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration and the research and innovative technology administration the house committee on appropriations recommended 628 billion increases over the requested amounts were provided for federal aviation administration the federal highway administration the federal transit administration and amtrak the house approved two transportationrelated amendments to the bill increasing the level of funding for amtrak beyond the committeerecommended level and striking the committeerecommended provision barring federal funding for amtrak routes with perpassenger subsidy levels of 30 or more floor amendments increased the dot funding in the bill as passed by the house to 635 billion the senate committee on appropriations recommended 642 billion increases over the house proposal were provided for the federal highway administration fhwa the federal railroad administration mostly for amtrak while less funding was proposed for the federal aviation administration faa and the federal transit administration fta than was proposed by the house the senatepassed bill followed the committees recommendations the conference bill provided 607 billion an increase of 18 billion 3 over the fy2005 enacted level essential air service eas in its fy2006 request the administration once again proposed that the size of the eas program be reduced capping the program at the 50 million level the house committee on appropriations recommended 104 million for the program up slightly from 102 million enacted for fy2005 this was reduced to 50 million during house floor consideration when 54 million was struck on point of order relating to the source of the funding the senate committee recommended 110 million the senate approved this amount the conference agreement provided 110 million the eas program was established in 1978 when congress deregulated commercial aviation there was concern that airlines would drop service to smaller airports with low levels of ridership in order to preserve air service to small communities congress established the eas program which subsidizes the cost to airlines of providing service to these communities the eas program is operated through the office of the secretary of transportation and receives its authorized 3 continued passed legislation reauthorizing and providing new authorized funding levels for surface transportation programs the safe accountable flexible efficient transportation equity act legacy for users safetealupl 10959 crs7 funding from designated user fees collected from overflights of united states territory by foreign aircraft the eas program has had an annual authorized funding level of 50 million for the last several years the overflight funding mechanism however has never provided this much annual funding so funding has been provided from other sources to make up the difference in addition for the past few years congress has provided additional funding in order to enable the program to serve more airports the eas program continues to enjoy significant support in congress federal aviation administration faa httpwwwfaagov the bush administration request for fy2006 was 139 billion slightly more than the fy2005 enacted level of 138 billion the proposal was essentially devoid of major new initiatives but contained some program adjustments and significantly reduced funding for the airport improvement program aip the proposed cut to the aip program would have put its fy2006 appropriation below the level guaranteed in the century of aviation reauthorization act vision 100 pl 108176 both the formula provisions and the guarantee provisions of that act would have caused significant disruption to the aip program at the proposed funding level the house committee on appropriations recommended 144 billion for the faa and provided the authorized fy2006 level of funding for the aip the house passed bill provided 146 billion after 500 million rescission of contract authority the senate committee on appropriations recommended 136 billion after 12 billion rescission of contract authority which the senate approved the conference agreement provided 138 billion after 10 billion rescission of contract authority this was 266 million more than the fy2005 enacted level and 11 billion more than the administration request the vast majority of faa funding is provided from the airport and airway trust fund only om funding uses mix of trust fund and treasury general fund monies over the past ten years fy1996fy2005 the general fund has contributed an average of 21 of faas budget4 in fy2002 treasury general fund contribution of 11 billion was provided for om funding while the general fund contribution for fy2002 was on the low side historically 8 of faas total budget the fy2003 amount returned to higher contribution level of 32 billion 24 of faas total funding however the general fund contribution has been declining since then to 30 billion 22 of faas total budget in fy2004 to an estimated 28 billion 20 in fy2005 and to an estimated 16 billion 11 in the administrations fy2006 request5 historically the trust fundgeneral fund split has been an important part of the annual faa budget debate the rationale behind the 4 testimony of kenneth m mead inspector general department of transportation before the house committee on transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on aviation may 4 2005 p 4 5 ibid crs8 general fund contribution has been that the public at large realizes some benefit from aviation whether it uses the system or not6 trust fund revenues have been running below projections for several years with general fund contributions to faas budget also declining from their historical average the difference between faas budget level and these two funding sources has been made up by tapping the trust funds uncommitted balance which is now quite low by historical standards 24 billion operations and maintenance om for fy2006 the administration proposed 82 billion in total spending 500 million 6 increase over the 77 billion enacted for fy2005 the house committee on appropriations recommended 82 billion virtually identical to the administration request the housepassed bill provided 84 billion the senate committee on appropriations recommended 82 billion which the senate approved the conference agreement provided 82 billion the majority of funding in this category is for the salaries of faa personnel engaged in air traffic control certification and safetyrelated activities much of the increased funding called for in the fy2006 request is for increased air traffic control system costs and safetyrelated activities one issue is the increasingly urgent need to hire additional air traffic controllers there is concern that many of the current controllers who were hired after the air traffic controllers strike of 1981 are now rapidly approaching retirement age controller union representatives contend that the faa is not taking sufficient action to mitigate against potential future staff shortages the request funding included 25 million to hire 1249 controllers in fy2006 this is expected to result in net gain of around 604 controllers since around 645 controllers are expected to leave through attrition during fy2006 facilities and equipment fe the administration request for fe was 24 billion slightly down from 25 billion in fy2005 and below the fy2006 authorized level of 31 billion the house committee on appropriations recommended 31 billion the authorized level this was approved by the house the senate committee on appropriations recommended 24 billion which the senate approved the conference agreement provided 25 billion fe funding is used primarily for capital investment in air traffic control and safety research engineering and development red the administration requested 130 million in fy2006 identical to the fy2005 level the house committee on appropriations recommended the same amount the house concurred the senate appropriations committee recommended 1345 million which the senate approved the conference agreement provided 138 million most red activity is focused on safetyair traffic control activities significant new initiatives were proposed in the bush administration faa budget 6 general fund appropriations have varied substantially both in dollar terms and as percentage of faa appropriations as whole from year to year over the last 12 years the share has ranged from 0 to 47 see table 1 in crs report rs20177 airport and airway trust fund issues in the 106th congress by john w fischer crs9 grantsinaid for airports the airport improvement program aip provides grants for airport planning and development and for projects to increase airport capacity such as building new runways and other facility improvements the bush administration fy2006 budget proposal requested 30 billion for aip 500 million below the fy2005 level some members of congress have questioned aip cuts at time when aviation traffic is finally returning to preseptember 11th volumes and is expected to continue to grow construction of new runways is seen by many as the best way to alleviate airport congestion the proposed 3 billion level for fy2006 is also 600 million below the funding level guaranteed for fy2006 section 104 of vision 100 49 usc 48114c2 provides that it shall not be in order for congress to consider any bill appropriating funding for faa operations or research and development accounts if the combined funding for the grantsinaid to airports and facilities and equipment accounts is below their combined authorization level for that year the combined fy2006 proposal for the aip and fe programs is 545 billion 12 billion below their combined authorized level of 665 billion in addition the proposed aip funding level of 3 billion is below the 32 billion threshold set under aip distribution formulas in vision 100 due to provision in the authorizing legislation this shortfall could result in cutting most aip formula distributions in half the administration defended its proposed reduction with three arguments it noted that the aip funding level has increased significantly from its 19 billion level in fy2000 it asserted that airport capital development needs as measured by requests for issuances of airport revenue bonds and in faas national plan of integrated airport systems have declined by 15 in recent years and it asserted that airports could compensate for the reduction in aip funding by increasing their use of passenger facility charges7 the administration estimated that airports could raise an additional 350 million annually by increasing passenger facility fees to the maximum allowed by law some members of congress questioned the wisdom of imposing fee increases on an unprofitable airline industry struggling unsuccessfully with the impact of high fuel costs the house committee on appropriations recommended 36 billion for aip the authorized level for fy2006 the house concurred the senate committee on appropriations recommended 35 billion which the senate approved the conference agreement provided 355 billion federal highway administration fhwa httpwwwfhwadotgov the fhwa budget provides funding for the federalaid highway program fahp which is the umbrella term for nearly all the highway programs of the agency 7 marion blakey administrator federal aviation administration testifying before the house committee on appropriations subcommittee on transportation treasury hud the judiciary and the district of columbia may 10 2005 crs10 there are several major highway programs within fhwa and most funding is reserved for these core programs these programs are national highway system nhs interstate maintenance im surface transportation program stp bridge replacement and rehabilitation brr and congestion mitigation and air quality improvement cmaq all of these programs are subject to apportionment on an annual basis by formula and are not subject to programbyprogram appropriation there is another set of programs known as the allocated programs also referred to as discretionary programs these programs are under the direct control of fhwa or other governmental entities these programs include the federal lands highway program high priority projects former demonstration project category appalachian development highway system roads the national corridor infrastructure improvement program and several other small programs in recent years nearly all discretionary program funding has been earmarked by congress in the appropriations process the administration request federal surface transportation programs had not yet been reauthorized when the presidents budget was released the presidents fy2006 budget assumed that the authorization would conform to the presidents surface transportation reauthorization recommendations congress reauthorized surface transportation programs with the passage of safetealu signed into law in august 2005 pl 10959 for fy2006 the president requested 354 billion for fhwa that was slightly less than the 358 billion level for fy2005 it was significantly less than the fy2006 authorized level that was proposed in either the house 370 billion or senate 389 billion versions of surface transportation reauthorization legislation hr 3 the house committee on appropriations recommended 370 billion the amount authorized in the house reauthorization legislation the house concurred with this recommendation the senate committee on appropriations recommended 387 billion the senate approved this figure the conference bill provided 368 billion for fhwa after 2 billion rescission of contract authority the fhwa appropriations is scored for budgetary purposes at 347 billion federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa httpwwwfmcsadotgov fmcsa issues and enforces the federal motor carrier safety regulations that govern many aspects of specified commercial truck and bus operations including the interstate operation and maintenance of commercial vehicles and requirements for commercial drivers fmcsa also administers grants and programs to help states conduct truck and bus safety enforcement activities together with the states fmcsa conducts inspections of mexicandomiciled drivers and vehicles entering the united states advances intelligent transportation systems for commercial vehicle operations and each year reviews or audits thousands of carriers transporting property and passengers most of the funds used to conduct fmcsa activities are derived from the highway trust fund crs11 the fy2006 administration request for the fmcsa is 465 million 5 more than the fy2005 level of 444 million the house committee on appropriations recommended 501 million 12 above the fy2005 enacted level and 8 above the administration request the house concurred with this recommendation the senate committee on appropriations recommended 490 million the senate approved this amount the conference bill provided 495 million 11 above the fy2005 enacted level the fmcsa appropriation has two primary components fmcsa administrative expenses including operations and research and financial assistance provided primarily to the states to conduct various truck and bus safety programs administrative and operations expenses the presidents budget request for fmcsas administrative and operations expenses for fy2006 is 233 million the house committee on appropriations recommended 215 million the house concurred the senate committee recommended 211 million the senate concurred the conference bill provided 213 million this account includes funds for research and technology rt and regulatory development some of the activities that would be funded include enforcement to reduce the number of unsafe motor carriers and drivers and the funding of medical review board to assist fmcsa in improving its physical examination requirements for commercial drivers some of the core fmcsa activities or expenses supported by these funds include rent administrative infrastructure personnel compensation and benefits and other related staff expenses for more than 1000 employees outreach efforts to help educate the commercial motor vehicle industry about the federal safety regulations and monies to improve truck and bus as well as driver standards and oversight this account also funds agency information systems used to oversee the safety of motor carriers grants to states and other activities the administrations fy2006 request for these activities is 232 million house committee on appropriations recommended 286 million the house concurred the senate committee on appropriations recommended 279 million the senate concurred the conference bill provided 282 million these funds are used primarily to pay for the motor carrier safety assistance program mcsap which provides grants to states to help them enforce commercial vehicle safety and hazardous materials transportation regulations mcsap grants cover up to 80 of the eligible costs of states commercial truck and bus safety program some 9000 state and local law enforcement officers conduct more than 29 million roadside inspections of trucks and buses annually under the program national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa httpwwwnhtsadotgov nhtsa funding supports behavioral including both driver and pedestrian and vehicular including crash worthiness and avoidance programs that are intended to improve traffic safety more specifically nhtsa seeks to reduce impaired driving increase occupant protection improve police traffic services enhance emergency medical responses to crashes ensure compliance with various federal vehicle safety crs12 regulations and track and seek to mitigate emerging vehicle safety problems nhtsa also provides grants to the states for the implementation of various highway traffic safety programs for fy2006 the administration requested 696 million to carry out nhtsas mission 22 million 3 increase over comparable fy2005 funding8 of the total amount requested by the administration 465 million was designated to support general traffic safety and incentive grants to states the incentive grants are intended primarily to encourage use of occupant protection measures and reduce impaired driving the remaining 231 million was for nhtsas operations and research activities to reduce highway fatalities and prevent injuries due to traffic crashes more specifically the funds proposed would be used for activities including research and analysis eg collection of crash statistics research on vehicle performance and occupant injury during these crashes and driver distraction testing highway safety programs eg developing improved countermeasures to combat alcohol or drug impaired driving and measures to increase safety belt usage safety assurance eg testing of vehicles to ensure compliance with federal motor vehicle safety standards and maintaining legislativelyrequired database to track vehicle defects and conducting crash avoidance and crashworthiness testing and evaluating child safety seats the house committee on appropriations recommended 782 million for fy2006 108 million 16 over the comparable fy2005 enacted level and 86 million 12 over the administration request the house concurred the senate committee on appropriations recommended 779 million the senate added 6 million by floor amendment for total of 785 million the conference bill provided 815 million 141 million 21 over the comparable fy2005 enacted figure federal railroad administration fra httpwwwfradotgov the administration requested 552 million in funding for the federal railroad administration for fy2006 this is 880 million 61 below the 14 billion fra received in fy2005 the difference is largely due to the administrations request for funding for amtrak which received 12 billion in fy2005 the administration request also zeroed out the next generation highspeed rail program the house committee on appropriations recommended 732 million for fra for fy2006 the house provided 13 billion adding 626 million through floor amendment increasing funding for amtrak the senate committee on appropriations recommended 17 billion the senate provided 16 billion the major difference from the housepassed figure was recommending an additional 274 million for amtrak for total fy2006 level of 145 billion for amtrak the conference bill provided 15 billion 94 million over the fy2005 enacted level the increase is 8 the administrations request includes proposal to transfer 222 million from fhwas budget to nhtsas budget in previous years that money was budgeted in fhwa for programs that were administered by nhtsa crs13 largely due to the 13 billion provided for amtrak 100 million more than its enacted fy2005 level although most of the debate involving the fra budget centers on amtrak agency safety activities which receive more detailed treatment in the next section the next generation highspeed rail program and how states might obtain additional funds for highspeed rail initiatives are also continuing issues railroad safety the fra promotes and regulates railroad safety increased railroad traffic volume and density make equipment employees and operations more vulnerable to accidents the administration proposed 146 million in fy2006 for fras safety program and related administrative and operating activities 9 million 6 above the fy2005 enacted level the house committee on appropriations recommended the requested amount the house concurred the senate committee recommended the same the senate concurred the conference bill provided the requested level 146 million the funds requested support fras goals of reducing rail accidents and incidents reducing gradecrossing accidents and contributing to the avoidance of serious hazardous materials transportation incidents the railroad safety statute was last reauthorized in

program amtrak the administration requested funding for amtrak for fy2006 amtraks board of directors all of whom were appointed by the administration has requested 18 billion the dot inspector general has testified that amtrak requires at least 14 billion to survive in its current form amtrak received 12 billion in fy2005 combined with the nearly 200 million in cash amtrak had at the end of fy2004 that gave amtrak 14 billion for fy2005 amtrak expects to end fy2005 with little or cash on hand partly due to its difficulties with its acela trains on the northeast corridor the administration requested 360 million for the surface transportation board to administer amtrak operations necessary to support commuter rail services in the event of an amtrak shutdown the house committee on appropriations recommended 550 million for amtrak for fy2006 of which 50 million is for the secretary of transportation to make capital grants for repairs to the northeast corridor in consultation with amtrak crs14 to select the projects most critical to help bring the corridor into state of good repair the committee also recommended 20 million to be held in reserve for the surface transportation board to carry out directed service should amtrak cease operations and 10 million to support the orderly discontinuation of amtraks mail and express service in addition the committee established threshold subsidy figure for federal support to amtraks individual routes routes with federal subsidy greater than 30 per passenger would longer be eligible for federal support the committee noted that the states served by these routes could provide the funding needed to support the routes otherwise the routes would be eliminated in its report accompanying the bill the committee wrote that while the committee agrees that reform is critical it is also equally important to sustain passenger rail service in geographic regions where this service is viable9 in press release describing the bills amtrak provisions the committee wrote that the bill fully supports rail service for 80 percent of amtraks ridership10 whether the bill actually does that is not clear the routes whose per passenger subsidy level is below the committees threshold are chiefly in the northeast on the west coast and in the midwest the routes that would be eliminated serve other largely rural sections of the country in press release describing the bills amtrak provisions the committee wrote that the bill fully supports rail service for 80 percent of amtraks ridership11 whether the

amtraks funding problem its important to appreciate that while they are highly subsidized and often inefficient their total elimination will not come close to making ends meet savings ultimately would be in the neighborhood of around 300 million and the savings would not be immediate due to the need for labor severance payments13 amtraks thenpresident david gunn asserting that amtrak would owe its employees 14 billion over three years in severance payments if the longdistance trains were eliminated14 said the committees recommended funding would lead to an amtrak shut down because the company could not meet debt service pay its obligations to the railroad retirement fund and make required payments to the workers it would have to lay off 15 in an additional views section of the committees report on the bill the ranking members of the committee and the transportation subcommittee argued that the bill would make it impossible for amtrak to operate even limited number of routes after mandatory debt service payments of 275 million to 287 million and mandatory labor payments of 300 million or more severance payments to amtrak workers laid off as result of terminating the long distance routes are made funds would available to operate even few routes and funds would be available to invest in sorely needed capital upgrades16 during consideration of the bill on the house floor the chair of the house transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on railroads representative latourette and the ranking member of the transportation and infrastructure committee representative oberstar introduced an amendment to increase amtraks funding by 626 million to 1176 million this is 31 million less than amtrak received for fy2005 but 276 million more than the house proposed for amtrak for fy2005 the amendment was offset by reductions in several other accounts in the bill and passed by voice vote another amendment introduced by the ranking member of the transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on railroads representative brown and representative menendez and representative rahall deleted the appropriation committees recommendation that federal funding not be available to amtrak routes requiring more than 30 per passenger in subsidy this amendment passed by vote of 269152 the senate committee on appropriations recommended 145 billion for amtrak 274 million

of federal funding to support food and beverage service and sleeper car service on amtraks routes17 other provisions would require amtrak to adopt managerial accounting system that can identify average and marginal costs for amtraks services allow amtrak to impose surcharge on its passenger tickets to raise money for capital improvements and allow the secretary of transportation to impose fees on commuter rail operations using the northeast corridor to cover the direct maintenance costs imposed by each operator the senate supported the amtrak funding level recommended by the committee on appropriations the senate approved two floor amendments deleting some of the amtrak provisions recommended by the committee one amendment deleted the restriction on food and beverage service and sleeper car service the other deleted the permission to impose fees on commuter rail authorities using the northeast corridor the white house issued veto threat against the senates amtrak funding level reflecting the administrations stance that amtrak should not receive funding unless fundamental reforms are also made to amtrak18 the conference bill provided 1315 billion to amtrak 9 increase over the fy2005 enacted level the conference bill also included number of provisions affecting amtraks receipt of and use of these funds these provisions continue recent trend in which congress has attempted to exert more control over amtraks finances beginning with amtraks fy2003 appropriation pl 1087 congress directed that amtraks appropriation would not go directly to amtrak but rather that the secretary of transportation would provide funding to amtrak quarterly through the grantmaking process congress also imposed several other requirements on amtrak beginning in fy2003 which had the effect of reducing amtraks discretion with its federal funding among these was requirement that amtrak submit fiveyear business plan to congress which it did in april 2003 in this plan amtrak requested average annual federal support of 16 billion for fy2004fy2008 to both maintain the current network and begin to address the estimated 6 billion in backlogged maintenance needs the plan did not propose expansion of the existing rail network amtrak has submitted annual updates of this strategic plan to congress congress has not supported the funding levels requested in these strategic plans amtraks authorization expired in september 2002 efforts to reauthorize amtrak have been stymied by disagreement over the future shape of federal passenger rail policy the house committee on transportation and infrastructure has ordered to be reported out legislation reauthorizing amtrak at 2 billion annually for fy2006fy2009 hr 1630 similar legislation was reported out by the committee in the 108th congress but saw further action legislation reflecting the 17 recent reports by the amtrak inspector general and the dot inspector general found that amtrak loses money on both its food and beverage service and its sleeper car service these provisions would in effect require amtrak to either break even on these operations or eliminate them 18 white house statement of administration policy hr 3058 october 19 2005 1 crs17 administrations reauthorization proposal which would restructure amtrak and transfer responsibility for administering and funding passenger rail service to the states has also been introduced hr 1713 similar legislation was also introduced in the 108th congress but was not supported the amtrak board has submitted restructuring proposal to congress but legislation has been introduced reflecting that proposal the senate passed an amtrak reauthorization bill as floor amendment to s 1932 the deficit reduction omnibus reconciliation act of 2005 on november 3 2005 the amendment was approved by vote of 936 the reauthorization bill attached to s 1932 was similar to s 1516 the passenger rail investment and improvement act of 2005 which was reported out of the senate committee on commerce science and transportation in october 2005 the amtrak reauthorization section was not included in the conference version of s 1932 the dot and the amtrak board have also made changes on their own recently the board voted in september 2005 to create subsidiary to manage the northeast corridor and in november 2005 to dismiss david gunn amtraks president and ceo since 2002 in the wake of gao report critical of the way amtraks finances have been managed the dot announced that additional limits would be placed on amtraks autonomy amtrak will be required to submit plans for improving its financial reporting and management and must provide new annual report to congress describing its progress in implementing those plans federal transit administration fta httpwwwftadotgov president bushs fy2006 budget request for fta was 78 billion 167 million 2 more than ftas fy2005 appropriation of 76 billion the house committee on appropriations recommended 85 billion the amount authorized for fy2006 in the houses surface transportation reauthorization bill hr 3 as passed by the house the house concurred the senate committee on appropriations recommended 82 billion 430 million more than the request and 270 less than the housepassed figure the senate concurred the guaranteed authorization level for fta for fy2006 in the surface transportation reauthorization legislation approved by congress in july 2005 pl 10959 is 86 billion the conference bill provided that amount the administrations request also proposed changes to ftas program structure reflecting the administrations transit reauthorization proposals these proposals included grouping all funding into three categories administrative expenses formula funds and capital investment grants zeroing out the bus discretionary grant program and creating new freedom initiative program to help assist persons with disabilities with transportation to work other new proposals in the presidents request included an intermodal passenger facilities program to provide intercity bus intermodal passenger facility grants 75 million and national parks legacy project to improve access to national parks 30 million elements of some of these proposals were included in the surface transportation authorization legislation signed into law in august 2005 safetealu pl 109 59 crs18 fta program structure and funding the largest transit programs are the capital investment grants program and the urbanized area formula grants program there are also several smaller formula and discretionary programs capital investment grants program section 5309 this program formerly known as section 3 has three components discretionary grant program supporting creation of new transit infrastructure new starts formula grant program supporting modernization of fixed guideway transit infrastructure and discretionary grant program supporting the acquisition of buses and bus facilities the funds have typically been allocated among these three components on roughly 404020 basis respectively though safetealu increases the share going to new starts projects the administration request reflected its proposed change to this programs structure it requested 153 billion for the transit new starts program up about 6 from 144 billion in fy2005 it also requested 13 billion for the fixed guideway modernization component up 9 from fy2005s 12 billion which would be placed under different program area an enlarged formula grants program area funding was requested for the bus and bus facilities discretionary component which received 725 million in fy200519 the house committee on appropriation recommended 156 billion for the new starts program 9 above fy2005 139 for fixed guideway modernization 15 above fy2005 and 693 million for buses and bus facilities 4 above the comparable fy2005 figure the house concurred the senate committee on appropriations recommended 139 billion for new starts 131 billion for fixed guideway modernization and 797 million for bus and bus facilities the senate concurred the authorized level for fy2006 is 15 billion for new starts 14 billion for fixed guideway modernization and 822 million for bus and bus facilities the conference bill funded the overall fta authorized level for fy2006 without breaking down the funding by program however it transfers 478 million from the fixed guideway modernization program to the new starts account urbanized area formula program section 5307 this program formerly known as section 9 provides capital and in some cases operating funds for urbanized areas population 50000 or more eligible activities include bus and busrelated purchases and maintenance facilities fixed guideway modernization new systems planning and operating assistance funds are apportioned by formula based in part on population areas with populations over 1000000 receive twothirds of the funding urbanized areas with populations under 1000000 receive the remaining onethird and on transit service data for fy2006 the administration proposed 37 billion up 3 from fy2005s 36 billion the house committee on appropriations did not specify figure for this program the fy2006 authorization for this program in the house version of surface transportation reauthorization legislation hr 3 was 398 billion 11 above 19 in fy2005 as in previous years the bus and bus facilities appropriation was supplemented by 50 million authorized for the clean bus program the appropriation for bus and bus facilities was 675 million the additional funding resulted in total of 725 million crs19 fy2005 the senate committee on appropriations recommended 37 billion the senate concurred the authorized level under safetealu which added new formulas for small transitintensive urbanized areas and for fastgrowing and high density states is 38 billion with the enactment of tea21 in 1998 operating assistance funding was generally eliminated for urbanized areas with populations over 200000 however preventive maintenance generally considered an operating expense is now eligible for funding as capital expense urbanized areas under 200000 population and nonurbanized areas section 5311 can use formula funds for either capital or operating purposes job access and reverse commute program this program provides funding for transportation projects that assist welfare recipients and lowincome persons to find and get to work in suburban areas the administration proposed 164 million for it in fy2006 up from 125 million in fy2005 and proposed to convert it to formula program the house committee on appropriations recommended 175 million for fy2006 the house concurred the senate committee on appropriations recommended 122 million the senate concurred congress converted the program to formula basis in safetealu which authorized 138 million for the program for fy2006 maritime administration marad httpwwwmaraddotgov marads mission is to promote the development and maintenance of us merchant marine capable of carrying the nations waterborne domestic commerce portion of its waterborne foreign commerce and to serve as naval and military auxiliary in time of war marad administers programs that benefit us vessel owners shipyards and ship crews for fy2006 the president requested 294 million for marad about 3 below the fy2005 level of 305 million the house committee on appropriations recommended 291 million the house concurred the senate committee on appropriations recommended323 million the senate concurred the conference bill provided 301 million the maritime guaranteed loan program the title xi program provides guaranteed loans for purchasing ships from us shipyards and for the modernization of us shipyards the purpose of the program is to promote the growth and modernization of us shipyards as in budget requests in prior years the administration has requested funds for new loan guarantees calling the program corporate subsidy the administration has however requested 4 million for the administration of existing loans 1 million less than the fy2005 enacted figure the house committee supported this request the house concurred the senate committee recommended 5 million for administrative expenses the amount provided in fy2005 the senate concurred conferees agreed on 4 million for operations and training the administration requested 114 million about 5 above the fy2005 funding of 109 million the house committee recommended 112 million the house agreed to that the senate committee on crs20 appropriations recommended 119 million the senate concurred conferees agreed on 122 million most of this funding goes to the us merchant marine academy and to marad operations the administration requested 156 million 59 above the fy2005 level of 98 million for the maritime security program msp the house committee supported this request and the house concurred the senate committee on appropriations also recommended 156 million the senate concurred conferees agreed on 156 million the requested amount msp pays to support fleet of privatelyowned us flag commercial vessels engaged in international trade that are available to support the department of defense in national emergency the request would increase the size of the fleet from 47 to 60 vessels for the disposal of obsolete vessels in the national defense reserve fleet ndrf the administration requested 21 million about the same as provided in fy2005 the house and senate supported this request and the conferees agreed to it there are over 130 vessels in the ndrf that are awaiting disposal because of their age these vessels have raised environmental concerns due to the presence of asbestos and other hazardous substances marad has until 2006 to dispose of these surplus ships most of which are located on the james river in virginia and in suisan bay california the administration requested funding for the national defense tanker vessel construction program and requested rescission of the 74 million appropriated for this program in fy2005 the house committee on appropriations recommended funding for fy2006 but did not support the rescission of the fy2005 funding the house concurred the senate committee on appropriations recommended 25 million for fy2006 and did not rescind any of the fy2005 appropriation the senate concurred conferees agreed on the house position new funding rescission of previous funding the national defense tanker vessel construction program was authorized under subtitle d of the maritime security act of 2003 pl 108136 national defense tank vessel construction assistance the program would provide up to 50 million per vessel for the construction of commercial tank vessel in us shipyard provided that the vessel was also capable of carrying militarily useful petroleum products and the shipowner entered into an agreement with the department of defense to make the ship available for the militarys use in time of war the intent of the law is to decrease the department of defenses reliance on foreignflag oil tankers an aspect of the program that has proved controversial is the allowance of up to 10 of vessels total steel weight to be constructed by foreign shipyard some argue this is necessary to allow us shipyards to import foreign technological expertise while others argue that it results in subsidies flowing to foreign shipyards crs21 pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa httpwwwphmsadotgov phmsa was created with

framework transportation is function 400 in the annual unified congressional budget it is also considered part of the discretionary budget funding for the dot budget is derived from number of sources the majority of funding comes from dedicated transportation trust funds the remainder of dot funding is from federal treasury general funds the transportation trust funds include the highway trust fund which contains two accounts the highway trust account and the mass transit account the airport and airway trust fund and the inland waterways trust fund all of these accounts derive their respective funding from specific excise and other taxes in fy2005 trust funds accounted for threefourths of total federal transportation spending together highway and transit funding constitute the largest component of dot appropriations most highway and transit programs are funded with contract authority derived by the link to the highway trust fund this is very significant from budgeting standpoint contract authority is tantamount to but does not actually involve entering into contract to pay for project at some future date under this arrangement specified in title 23 usc authorized funds are automatically made available at the beginning of each fiscal year and may be obligated without appropriations legislation although appropriations are required to make outlays at some future date to cover these obligations where most federal programs require new budget authority as part of the annual appropriations process transportation appropriators are faced with the opposite situation that is the authority to spend for the largest programs under their control already exists and the mechanism to obligate funds for these programs also is in place vision 100 century of aviation reauthorization act the vast majority of the federal aviation administrations budget is funded by the airport and airway trust fund also known as the aviation trust fund which is supported by user fees and excise taxes funding for the faas two capital programs the airport improvement program and the facilities and equipment program as well as the research engineering and development funding are supported entirely by the aviation trust fund the operations and maintenance om component the largest component of the faa budget is in most years funded partially from aviation trust fund revenues and partially from treasury general fund revenues using general fund revenues for om is somewhat controversial and the size of the general fund share of the om budget does at times emerge as an issue in both the transportation authorization and appropriations process one of the justifications of using general fund revenues to support om is the belief that congresss original intent was that the aviation trust fund was mostly for the capital and research components of the faa budget the other rationale was that the public sector as well as the nonflying public benefit from the operation of the nations aviation system and should help pay for this benefit through general tax revenues crs26 the recent economic difficulties of the aviation industry have had negative effect on trust fund revenues historically the trust fund has ended each year with an uncommitted balance since 2001 the uncommitted balance has been decreasing according to gao the trust funds uncommitted balance decreased from 73 billion in 2001 to 48 billion in 2002 and has continued to fall at rate of 1 billion year since20 gao found this occurred because revenues started trending downward in 1999 while expenditures have exceeded revenues since fy2001 the increase in expenditures from the trust fund reflected increased spending under two authorization bills the wendell h ford aviation investment and reform act for the 21st century air21 pl 106181 which covered fy1999fy2003 significantly increased faa spending especially capital spending and vision 100 century of aviation reauthorization act vision 100 pl 10876 covering fy2004fy2007 which authorized continued increases in spending although at more modest rate gao has warned that revenue declines as small as 510 below projected levels could eliminate the trust funds uncommitted balances under current authorization levels air21 created budgetary regime for aviation programs that was closely linked to the availability of funds in the trust fund the act requires appropriators to use aviation trust funds only for aviation purposes and to fully fund faas capital programs the airport improvement program and the facilities and equipment program at authorized levels using house and senate pointoforder rules for enforcement one provision in the act made it out of order to consider legislation that spends aviation trust fund revenues for nonaviation purposes another provision made it out of order to consider legislation funding faas operations and maintenance and research engineering and development budgets if the airport improvement program and facilities and equipment program are funded at less than their authorized levels vision 100 continued this arrangement this budgetary regime was created at time when revenues to the trust fund were sharply increasing should revenues decline significantly funding beyond the guaranteed aip and fe components could be severely constrained unless supported by the general fund the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 and the safe accountable flexible efficient transportation equity act legacy for users safetealu during the 105th and 106th congresses major legislation changed the relationships between the largest transportation trust funds and the federal budget the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21pl 105178 linked annual spending for highway programs directly to revenue collections for the highway trust fund in addition core highway and mass transit program funding was given special status in the discretionary portion of the federal budget by virtue of the creation of two new budget categories the act thereby created virtual firewall around highway and transit spending programs the funding guarantees were set up in way that makes it difficult for funding levels to be altered as part of the annual budgetappropriations process additional highway funds can be provided annually by mechanism called revenue aligned budget authority raba raba funds 20 gao airport and airway trust fund preliminary observations on past present and future ga005657t may 4 2005 crs27 accrue to the trust fund as result of increased trust fund revenues for fy2003 however the raba adjustment if it had been applied during the appropriations process would have led to significant and unexpected drop in the availability of highway obligational funding congress set the raba adjustment for fy2003 to 0 in provision in pl 107206 and appropriators ultimately provided fy2003 highway funding at the same level as provided for fy2002 which was 4 billion higher than the fy2003 authorized level raba was not included in the fy2004 or fy2005 appropriations calculations tea21 changed the role of the house and senate appropriations and budget committees in determining annual spending levels for highway and transit programs the appropriations committees are precluded from their former role of setting an annual level of obligations these were established by tea21 and were adjusted by an annual raba computation tea21 also limited the discretion of the house and senate appropriations committees in exercising what some members view as their once traditional option of changing spending levels for specific core programs or projects though during the authorization period appropriators increasingly returned to their customary use of this option on july 29 2005 congress adopted new surface transportation authorization legislation the safe accountable flexible efficient transportation equity act legacy for users safetea lupl 10959 this legislation maintains the general program structure of tea21 it continued the practice of guaranteeing the authorized funding levels and further diminished the discretion of the house and senate appropriators by converting several discretionary grant programs to formula programs crs28 appendix c transportation budget terminology transportation budgeting uses confusing lexicon for those unfamiliar with the process of budget authority and contract authority the latter form of budget authority contract authority provides obligational authority for the funding of trust fundfinanced programs such as the federalaid highway program prior to tea21 changes in spending in the annual transportation budget component had been achieved in the appropriations process by combining changes in budgetcontract authority and placing limitations on obligations the principal function of the limitation on obligations is to control outlays in manner that corresponds to congressional budget agreements contract authority is tantamount to but does not actually involve entering into contract to pay for project at some future date under this arrangement specified in title 23 usc which tea21 amended authorized funds are automatically made available to the states at the beginning of each fiscal year and may be obligated without appropriations legislation appropriations are required to make outlays at some future date to cover these obligations tea21 greatly limited the role of the appropriations process in core highway and transit programs because the act enumerated the limitation on obligations level for the period fy1999 through fy2003 in the statute 112 stat 107 highway and transit grant programs work on reimbursable basis states pay for projects up front and federal payments are made to them only when work is completed and vouchers are presented months or even years after the project has begun work in progress is represented in the trust fund as obligated funds and although they are considered used and remain as commitments against the trust fund balances they are not subtracted from balances trust fund balances therefore appear high in part because funds sufficient to cover actual and expected future commitments must remain available both the highway and transit accounts have substantial short and longterm commitments these include payments that will be made in the current fiscal year as projects are completed and to much greater extent outstanding obligations to be made at some unspecified future date additionally there are unobligated amounts that are still dedicated to highway and transit projects but have not been committed to specific projects two terms are associated with the distribution of contract authority funds to the states and to particular programs the first of these apportionments refers to funds distributed to the states for formula driven programs for example all national highway system nhs funds are apportioned to the states allocated funds are funds distributed on an administrative basis typically to programs under direct federal control for example federal lands highway program monies are allocated the allocation can be to another federal agency to state to an indian tribe or to some other governmental entity these terms do not refer to the federal budget process but often provide frame of reference for highway program recipients who may assume albeit incorrectly that state apportionment is part of the federal budget per for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32945
