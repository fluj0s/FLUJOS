to debra c humphreys date 1 november 1999 from tia healy trust department telephon345 949 7212 fax 345 949 0993 subject masaya limited dear debra i have just completed an annual review and an investment review for masaya limited i have couple of concerns regarding the investments as brief background jbtc as trustees of g trust are sole shareholders mr j√ºrgen grossmann kehl settlor and primary beneficiary of g trust is sole director of the company we provide company secretary and registered office in the past the company has had varying investments the initial purpose of the company was to provide ownership of yacht which was for the sole use of the primary beneficiary the yacht was sold in 1990 the company has had other investments namely some painintgs which were distributed to mr g in 1997 an investment in some shares in porto pi marina in palma mallorca the shares entitled to the company to the exclusive use of berth at the marina and an investment in company called aerolift the shares in the marina were purchased in 1990 and were held at chf145120 until 1998 the berth was sold earlier this year the company secretary and you as alternate director on the instruction of the director issued poa to lawyer to facilitate the sale the sale price was dem45000 which would have represented loss of eur75000 from the book value the amount eventually credited to the companys bank account was eur15403 we have just had request for another power of attorney to authorise the lawyer who handled the sale of the berth to apply for tax number and to deal with the spanish tax authorities you will remember that i had discussion some time ago regarding the payment of taxes for the sale and i pointed out that there could not be any capital gains taxes as according to the books of the company we were selling the asset for considerably less than we had paid for it the company also had an investment in company called aerolift it appears that mr gs wife was the sole director of this company we have been notified that this company is going into liquidation this month and that it is possible that we might receive chf23000 from the proceeds there is also possibility that we will receive nothing it is intended that masaya be liquidated by year end my main concern is that we may be aiding mr g in fraudulent scheme i find it difficult to believe that the berth was only worth dem45000 given that we paid over twice that amount nearly 10 years ago if the berth was indeed only worth that amount then i cannot see why there would be any tax payable as the company has suffered loss i understand that there are some complications in spanish law regarding the sale of property but i do not understand why mr g who is the sole director cannot issue the power of attorney himself or why he cannot act on behalf of the company i would be grateful for your comments tia healy
