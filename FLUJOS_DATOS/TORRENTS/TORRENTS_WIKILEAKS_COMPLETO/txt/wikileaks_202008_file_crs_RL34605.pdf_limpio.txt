advancem ent of education re ligion and science4 in the absence of explicit statutory or regulatory requirement s applying the term charitable to hospitals it has been left to the irs to determine the criteria hospitals must meet to qualify as 501c3 charitabl organizations over the years the irs has developed two distinct standards the charity care standard and the community benefit standard charity care standard in 1956 the irs issued revenue ruling 56185 which addressed the requirements hospitals needed to meet in order to qualify for 501c3 status5 one of these requirements is known as the char ity care standard under the standard hospital had to provide to the extent of its financial ability free or reducedcost care to patients unable to pay for it hos pital that expected full payment did not according to the ruling provide charity care based on the fact that some patients ultimately failed to pay the ruling emphasized that low level of charity care did not necessarily mean that hospital had failed to meet the requirement since that level could reflect its financial ability to provide such care the ruling also noted that publicly supported community hospita ls would normally qua lify as charitable organizations because they serve the entire community and low level of charity care would not affect hospitals exempt status if it was due to the surrounding communitys lack of charitable demands community benefit standard in 1969 the irs issued revenue ruling 69545 which removed from revenue ruling 56185 the requirements relating to caring for patients without charge or at rates below cost6 under the standard deve loped in revenue ruling 69 545 which is known as the community benef it standard hospitals are judged on whether they promote the health of broa d class of individuals in the community the ruling involved hospital that only admitted individuals who could pay for the services by themselves private insuran ce or public programs such as medicare but operated fulltime emergency room that was open to everyone the irs ruled that the hospital qualified as charitable organization because it promoted the health of people in its community the irs reasoned that because the promotion of health was charitable purpose according to the general law of charity it fell within thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34605crs3 7 id citing to restatement second

expanding on this point the ruling stated that the promotion of health like the relief of poverty and the advancement of education and religion is one of the purposes in the general law of charity that is deemed beneficial to the community as whole even though the class of beneficiaries eligible to receive direct benefit from its activities does not include all members of the community such as indigent members of the community provided that the class is not so small that its relief is not of benefit to the community8 the irs concluded that the hospital was p romoting the health of class of persons that is broad enough to benefit the co mmunity because its emergency room was open to all and it provided care to every one who could pay whether directly or through thirdpart reimbursement9 other characteristics of the hospital that the irs highlighted included the following its surp lus funds were used to improve patient care expand hospital facilitie s and advance medical training education and research it was controlled by board of trustees that c onsisted of independent civic leaders and hospital privileges were available to all qualified physicians it appears that the community benefit st andard was adopted partly in response to the enactment in 1965 of medicare nd medicaid which some thought would reduce the need for hospitals to provide charity care10 its adoption by the irs may also have been response to concerns about the charity care standard these concerns were evidenced in legisla tive proposal introduced in the same year revenue ruling 69545 was issu ed that would have created an explicit category in irc 501c3 for hospitals11 the house report accompanying the bill expressed concern with how the charity care standard was applied in practice in number of cases internal revenue agents have challenged the exempt status of hospitals on the sole ground that th hospitals are accepting insufficient numbers of patients at charge or at rates substantially below cost this has resulted in significant uncertainty as to the extent to which hospital must accept patients who are unable to pay in order to retain its exempt status12 shortly after the house report was releas ed the irs issued revenue ruling 69545 the senate finance committee then rem oved the hospital pr ovision from the bill noting the existence of the new ruling and stating it would look at the issue when ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34605crs4 13 srept 91552 at 61 1969 14 see staff report supra note 10 at 56 the staff strongly recommends revocation of revenue ruling 69545 in light of the recent legi slative history and continuation of the prior position of the service until such time as congress can devise an alternative approach establishing reasonable yardsticks of charitabl service related to the financial capacity of hospital such action by the service would ssist in protecting the availability of necessary hospital care to medicare medi caid and other poor

for the clear change of previously administered policy ky welfare rights org v shultz 370 f s upp 325 33638 ddc 1973 the dc circuit court of appeals reversed the district court s decision finding that the irs interpretation of charitable was permissible because the term s definition has never been static and has been broadened in recent years and is thus capable of definition far broader than merely the relief of the poor ky welfare rights org v simon 506 f2d 1278 128690 dc cir 1974 the court reasoned that limiting the rm to relief of the poor fails to recognize the changing economic

subsequent finance committee staff document on medicare and dicaid issues advocated that the ruling be revoked and the charity care sta ndard be reimposed until congress could address the situation14 legal challenge to the co mmunity benefi t standard after the irs released revenue ruling 69 545 several indigents and or ganizations with indigent members filed class action suit challenging the authority of the irs to implement the community benefit standard which they argued was inconsistent with the term charitable in irc 501c3 because it di d not require treatment of the poor in 1976 decision simon v eastern kentucky welfare rights organization 15 the supreme court held that the plaintiffs lacked the constitutionally required standing to bring the suit to have standing plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendants allegedly unlaw ful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief16 the plaintiffs alleged injury was that the adoption by the irs of the community benefit sta ndard had encouraged hospita ls to not provide necessary medical care to the indigents the court in holding that they failed to meet the constitutional requirements for standing reasoned that it was purely speculative as to whether 1 the hospitals had denied the treatment because of the new ruling and not because of other nontax reasons and 2 the plaintiffs success would result in the care being provided since some hospitals could choose to give up their tax exempt status if the cost of the care was too high17 further development of the

classification of bad debt as community benefit an increasing number of partnerships between taxexempt hospitals and forprofit entities and the amount of compensation paid to highlev employees additionally some have questioned whether the community benefit st andard is correct or whether taxexempt hospitals should categorically be required to provide certain level of charity care in 2004 and 2005 more than 45 class action lawsuits were filed in at least 25 states that challenged the treatment and billing practices of 501c3 hospitals with respect to lowincome uninsured individuals20

public comment on the draft issued the final version in december 2007 drawn heavily from but not identical to the community benefit reporting model used by the catholic health association of the united states cha schedule h was drafted to combat the lack of transparency surrounding the activities of taxexempt organizations that provide hospital or medical care28 comments on the draft expr essed immediate concerns about the technical and procedural implications of the addition for example comments on draft versions of schedule h reflected uncertainty over what constituted hospital and whether multiple iterations of the schedule were required for entities that operated more than one hospital facility the comments by the irs released simultaneously with the final revision indicated that the irs intended to defer to definitions of hospitals found in the various states laws and that onl one schedule h would be required for an entity with single employer identification number regardless of the number of hospitals run by it29 the irs specifically solicited comments on the possibility that the proposed rollout of schedule h could impose heavy burden if entities would need to retool their internal accounting or reporting mechanisms in order to gather the necessary information30 in response to received comments the new schedule h will be rolled out gradually beginning with tax year 2008 returns filed in 2009 the only portion of schedule h required will be the disclosure and description of the hospital facilities operated by the filing entity the portions of the schedule used to report details of hospitals charity care program and community benefit expenditures will be optional however the entire schedule will be mandatory beginning with tax year 200931 schedule h

professions education subs idized health services research and contributions to other community groups32 aside from concerns about th technical aspects of th new schedule h several substantive criticisms also emerged from the public comments for the most part these criticisms stemmed from the perception that the categories of charity care and community benefit envisioned by the irs were underinclusive33 the agency had explicitly stated in its comments accompan ying the initial draft of schedule h that the schedule was an attempt to quantify in an objective manner the community benefit standard applicable to taxexempt hospitals34 while the irs did not suggest minimum level of expenditures that would be required in order to justify tax exemption it is probable that some hospita ls were concerned that the exclusion of certain expenditures would ma ke themselves appear on paper undeserving of tax exempt status by and large these criticisms focused on three specific omissions community building expenditures dicare shortfalls and bad debt part ii community building the final draft of schedule h includes an area part ii in which to report community building expenditures although the definition of community building may not be obvious at first glance it is generally understood to refer to programs that are intended to have beneficial impact upon the health of community but that do not provide medical care35 examples of community building taken from the fi nal draft of schedule h are housing improvements economic development community support

here is clear consensus in the public health community that social and environmental factors are strong determinants of health for vulnerable populations citing publications from the centers for disease control and other scholarly articles37 additionally the cha noted that every community building activity would qualify for exemption on standalone basis38 despite the inclusion of community building metrics in the final draft of schedule h these numbers are still separate from the reporting of charity care and community benefit expenditures in part i the irs commentary on the final draft reflected the view that the link between community building and health was still tenuous and that the reporting tools in sche dule h are intended to operate in part as data collection methods for the ir s to discern what links exist39 part iii medicare shortfalls hospitals incur costs when treating all patients including patients who are covered by medicare medicare however may not reimburse provider for the total cost of services received by patient the difference between the medicare reimburseme nt rates and the costs incurred by hospital are called shortfalls some commentators expre ssed belief that hosp ital should be allowed to include the aggregate amount of these shor tfalls in any calculation of the total community benefit provided by that hosp ital for example comments from the health law and taxation sections of the american bar association aba reasoned that the entire amount of an medicare shortfall should count as charity care because the elderly constitute cl

hospitals charity care program or medicaid in addition to medicare41 if these patients had been treated as charity care the entire cost of medical care would have been considered community benefit under part i additionally any shortfall in medicaid reimbursement would similarly have been included in community benefit others however argued that medicare shortfalls are not useful metric for determining community benefit the catholic health association opposing inclusion noted that many forprofit hos pitals compete aggressively for these medicare patients42 in its view measuring medicare

final draft of schedule h the irs provided dedicated area in schedule h in which to report medicare shortfalls despite the addition of part iii the irs does not treat medicare shortfalls as dir ect measure of community benefit in and of themselves instead hospitals are asked to describe the extent to which any shortfall reported in this part should be considered as community benefit44 part iii continued bad debt hospitals regularly engage in billing and collection practices in order to recoup cop ays deductibles and other expenses from patients during the collection process there may occur point at which it becomes apparent that debt owed to the hospital has little or potential of repayment in accordance with sound accounting practices it is customary to write off these debts as bad

community benefit community benefit in the context of the provision of health care services normally refers to meanstested eligibility programs but the aba noted that hospitals continue to have difficulty separating traditional uncom pensated care from true bad debt due to issues associated with identifying individua ls who qualify for uncompensated care45 some portion of bad debt therefore ppears to include the provision of care to individuals who would have b een eligible for charity care46 proponents argue that it is unfair to penalize hospital with reduced community benefit calculation simply because the charity care program did not accurately classify these individuals47 support for inclusion of bad debt wa s not universal among the comments submitted the catholic

after the fact50 in support of this argument cha also noted that m any catholic hospitals have changed their policies and improved their ability to identify patients eligible for financial

hospital also have proprietary interest in the joint venture referrals to that joint venture may violate federal prohibitions agai nst selfreferrals or kickbacks56 if directors or trustees of the hospital have proprietary interest in that joint venture the nonprofit status of the hospital could be jeopardized by any benefit that they receive as result of their interest in the venture57 similarly in st davids health care system v united states the fifth circuit held that joint ventures profit motive could undermine nonprofit partners stat us as charitable organization58

taxexempt organizations the majority of comments addressing this issue noted that the irs already receives information on joint ventures in the rede signed form 990 and that only organizations that operate hospitals are bur dened with this extra repor ting requirement in schedule h59 in response the irs noted that the unique relationship be tween hospitals and physicians resulting from their special status of having medical staff privileges without regard to employment appears to have clear analogy in other exempt organization contexts60 the irs did limit this reporting requirement to those joint ventures where directors trustees and physicians with staff privileges together owned at least 10 of the joint venture part v facility information organizations are asked in part v of schedule h to identify all hospital or medical care facilities and to indicate the types of medical services provided by each the finition of hospital or medical care does not include assisted living services vocati onal training for the disabled or medical education and research61 in order to alleviate the burden of adapting to the new schedule h this is the only part th at will be required for tax year 2008 part vi supplemental information part vi of schedule h provides an area in which to provide narrative inform ation regarding the amount of community benefit provided the irs stated that this area could be used to explain why some portion of medicare shortfall or bad debt reported in ot her areas of the schedule should be considered community benefit62 in addition hospita ls may provide details about other community benefits they pr ovide that are not easily quantifiable63 legislation 110th congress it does not appear that any bills have been introduced in the 110th congress that would address the taxexempt status of hospitals there is bill the charity care for the uninsured act of 2007 hr 973 that would create new tax credit for physicians who provide ch arity care the credit would range from 1000 for physicians who had provided betw een 25 and 30 hours of medical care on volunteer or pro bono basis to 2000 for t hose who had provided at least 50 hours of such care the care would have to be for diagnosis cure mitigation treatment or prevention of disease or for the purpos of affecting any structure or function of the body 109th congress in the 109th congress thenchairman william thomas of the house ways and means committee introduced the tax exempt hospitalshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34605crs13 responsibility act of 2006 hr 6420 this bill would have im posed requirements on 501c3 medical care providers rela ting to their treatment of lowincome uninsured individuals medical care providers subject to the bill would be those 1 with the principal purpose of providing medical or hospital care 2 with the principal purpose of providing medical ducation or research that are actively engaged in providing medical or hospital care or 3 required to be licensed as hospitals under state law medical care provider would have only b een eligible for 501c3 status if it 1 adopted policies and pr ocedures consistent with the requirements imposed by the new excise taxes discussed below for providing and charging for medically necessary care to lowincome uninsured i ndividuals and 2 nor mally operated in manner consistent with those policies nd procedures not only would provider that failed to meet these requirements be ineligible for 501c3 status but deduction would be allowed for making what would otherwise be charitable contribution to it medically necessary care would be defined as medical care within the scope of care provided by the provider unless 1 the treating physician determined the care to be unnecessary 2 the patient signed waiver acknowledging it was unnecessary or 3 the care involve d an organ transplant cosmetic or experimental care or treatment to improve the functioning of malformed member the bill would have also created three new excise taxes to penalize medical care providers that failed to meet certain re quirements first tax of 1000 would be imposed each time provider failed to provi the necessary care to lowincome uninsured individual who sought care in person second tax would be imposed if provider collected an amount for nece ssary care from lowincome uninsured individual that exceeded the maximum allo wed charge the tax would equal 3 times the excess the maximum allowed charge would be 1 25 per visit if the patients household income was not more than 100 of the applicable poverty line or 2 the average amount paid to the provider under c ontracts with private health insurers if the patients household income was be tween 100 and 200 of the applicable poverty line third providers would be taxed if they faile d to disclose their policies on providing and charging for medical nece ssary care the penalty would be 1 1000 for each time the provider failed to pr ovide the information in the patient admission process or when attempting to charge the patient or 2 1000 for each day with maximum of 50000 the provide r failed to make pub licly available its policies and average prices paid for medical care grouped by private health insurance selfpay and g overnment health programs the bill through its excise tax scheme would have addressed some of the concerns expressed bout 501c3 hospitals relating to charity care prices charged to lowincome uninsured patients and transparency about policies and prices without explicitly stating it the bill w ould have essentially defined the term charitable in irc 501c3 as it relates to hospitals to require relief of the poor however this implicit charity care requirement does not squarely match the historic charity care standard the bill would only require charity care if it is medically necessary and would not make any exceptions for hospitals that did not have the financial means to provide charity care it would appear that hospitals could fail to comply with the new excise tax requireme nts without jeopardizing their taxexempt status under this bill so long as such failu res were not normal this seems to leavehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34605crs14 open the possibility that for example hospital could choose to pay the 1000 tax rather than provide treatment to partic ular patient however even where such behavior was not normal these incidents might undercut hosp itals rationale for enjoying taxexempt status it could also be unclear where the bill would leave the community benefit standard since it would not expressly repeal it
