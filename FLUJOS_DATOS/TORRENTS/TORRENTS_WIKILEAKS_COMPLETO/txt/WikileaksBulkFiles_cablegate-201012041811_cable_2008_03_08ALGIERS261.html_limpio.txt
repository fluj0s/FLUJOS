as welch ref 07 algiers 1069 classified by ambassador robert s ford reasons 14 b and d 1 s summary in february 26 and 27 meetings with nea assistant secretary c david welch president abdelaziz bouteflika and prime minister abdelaziz belkhadem emphasized their familiar line on selfdetermination for western sahara as well as the need to find way out that would allow algeria to save face bouteflika said that relations with morocco were brotherly and that western sahara was the only issue standing between them because the us was unburdened by the colonial past of france in the region bouteflika felt it was ideally placed to serve as an informal referee in resolving the dispute although he said he understood morocco felt threatened by the prospect of western saharan independence bouteflika said that morocco only had itself to blame for the current situation as it had proceeded in clumsy manner with more elegant touch he said morocco could have encouraged puerto rico outcome where sahrawis would happily choose to remain part of morocco in some form welch underlined to the algerian officials that the us sought practical approach that could help the current negotiations make progress and the moroccan autonomy proposal offered such possibility end summary love for baker plan dies hard 2 s in response to as welchs assertion that the moroccan plan served to move frozen situation forward in the absence of any alternative bouteflika asserted that the plan of former secretary of state james baker was such an alternative he told as welch that if another option was necessary selfdetermination is that alternative and the baker plan should be discussed as welch replied that the baker plan is dead because it too failed to generate progress in bouteflikas view baker failed because it was not given chance and he blamed the us for not taking its security council responsibilities seriously bouteflika said the moroccan plan offered less autonomy for western sahara than an algerian province currently enjoys reftel he conceded that algeria does have influence in western sahara but swore he would not use it to violate what he sees as international law moroccan clumsiness to blame 3 s prime minister abdelaziz belkhadem told as welch on february 26 that the stability of morocco was in algerias interest and that attempting to transform an anticolonial issue was not the right path to take and was potentially destabilizing to the region bouteflika meanwhile said that he understood morocco felt threatened by the prospect of independence for western sahara but stressed that the moroccans only had themselves to blame for current sahrawi determination bouteflika explained saying that morocco could have easily used more elegant approach to produce western sahara independence that could be controlled or supervised instead he said they want anschluss like saddam hussein with kuwait bouteflika said he easily could have imagined an outcome in which western sahara chose to remain part of morocco after seeing the benefits of moroccan rule in much the same way as puerto rico chose to remain part of the us according to bouteflika morocco needs to offer the polisario something since you cannot ask concessions from people who have nothing in their pockets had it not been for moroccos clumsy approach bouteflika said they could have gotten what they wanted on france and us 4 s burdened by its colonial history in the maghreb france is unable to play constructive role in resolving the western sahara dispute according to bouteflika france has never really accepted algerian independence bouteflika said and he claimed that france was trying to settle scores with algeria by interfering in western sahara in support of morocco in contrast bouteflika said the us was an ideal counterweight to balance morocco as none of the parties algiers 00000261 002 of 002 involved had any bone of contention with the us bouteflika complained that the us treats algeria as second class compared to the preferential treatment it gives to tunisia and morocco he said the us should understand algeria better as you also paid price for your independence belkhadem told as welch of algerias admiration for us positions on the independence of east timor and kosovo why dont you share the same views on western sahara asked belkhadem it leaves us wondering what our us friends want with both algerians as welch underlined that the us sought practical approaches that would advance the western sahara negotiations forward the moroccan proposal he noted offered possibility he urged the algerians to consider what they could do to help the current negotiations make concrete progress comment need to save face 5 s bouteflika repeated to as welch several times the need for algeria to get itself out of the western sahara dispute in way that allowed it to save face he reiterated that algeria has claim at stake and spoke of looking towards positive future relations with morocco as one day we will need to get beyond this in february 27 meeting with foreign minister mourad medelci as welch invited the algerian delegation to visit washington immediately following the next round of negotiations at manhasset to continue the discussions 6 u this cable has not been cleared by as welch ford
