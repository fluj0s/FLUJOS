directions whereto focus attention robust auditcommittee better orientation forboard members conflict ofinterest policies closer oversightof executive compensation boardstaff relations disclosure practices the institute on governance has been working on these kinds ofissues with boards and ceos forover 15 years and has found thatthere are certain key issues boardsand organizations cannot afford toignore critical success factorsthat have to be in place if governance is to be effective our governance cannot be better than the individuals aroundyour board table three considerations need to be kept in mind here first to perform effectively boards need to comprise at leastsome individuals who bringneeded expertise to the table in theform of skills contacts and experience boards for public sectororganizations may also need atleast in part to be constituencybased ou need the mix of peoplethat best reflects your mission andthat takes account of where theorganization is going second directors should have an independence of mind and awillingness to engage constructively directors with excellent credentials but who are unwilling orunable to ask the tough ques tions or to participate as strongteam members are of littlevalue board recruitment is notjust about expertise it mustalso consider personal attributes last but certainly not least the top executive needs to besomeone who is up to therequirements of the job governance requires close partnership between the board andstaff and if the head of thestaff team is not up to the challenge governance will beaffected where organizationssuffer from shortage ofresources as is so often thecase in the voluntary sectorfinding and remunerating theeffective ceo or executivedirector can pose major roadblock to the attainment of goodgovernance nancy axelrod founder of boardsource has asked how cana group of intelligent individualsact so foolishly when they jointogether as board or groupwith varying degrees of talentbecome an exceptional boardhaving strong individual directorsis not enough good team needs agreat coach or leader that leader isthe chair chairs are the pivot point of governance whether they realize itor not they are enormously influential their powers will varydepending on bylaws and traditions however they are usually ina position to determine directly orindirectly the outcomes of keygovernancerelated decisions including who occupies key boardroles such as officer positions orcommittee chairs board prioritiesthe content of board agendas thepartnership with the ceo or executive director the results of boardmeetings the quality of information provided to directors and theprevalent culture at the board level often the chair can also exer cise considerable influence overwho will be brought on to theboard in future and sometimeswho the next chair will be problems in governance often resemble those related to organizational performance at the heart ofperformance problems one frequently finds simple lack ofclarity about what is to be donewhere the organization is going or who is responsible for what directors who do not understand their individualroles boards that collectively dont appreciate theresponsibilities of governance committees withvague terms of referenceuncertainty around wherethe role of the board endsand that of staff commences committee chairsor board chairs who donot understand their rolethese are stones in the shoeof sound governance these challenges are compounded when there isuncertainty about missionor strategic objectivesclarity of direction pro vides context within which morespecific problems related to rolesand responsibilities can beresolved fixing these problems can be difficult often underlying issuesof role uncertainty are problems ofturf politics or personality in myexperience simple lack of precision in the use of language alsocontributes to friction poorlydrafted role statements arebreeding grounds for corporateconflict boards sometimes forget that the most valuable asset of theirorganization is its reputation andits reputation lies in the hands ofkey stakeholders in the privatesector these typically include customers major shareholders partners suppliers and employees andperhaps communities where theorganization does business in the public sphere the list may include some of these samestakeholders plus others unique tothis sector such as funders members of nonprofits regulatoryorganizations interest groupsadvocacy organizations as well ascitizens at large sound governance rests on sound relationships and ethicalbehaviour key consideration inbuilding effective governancetherefore is to ensure that criticalorganizational relationships are ingood order and that behaviourboth at the board level and withinthe organization is abovereproach usually good deal of this responsibility can and should restwith the ceo but the board itselfshould exercise careful oversightrole board members themselvesmay find it prudent to play directrole in fostering certain key relations the board as whole has theresponsibility of ensuring that ethical behaviour is valued and prac tised both at the board level and atan operational level the reward of good relation ships and ethical behaviour is trustin the organization conversely thepenalty for loss of trust can be devastatingas enron discoveredwhen its accounting practicesbecame apparent as arthurandersen the nowdefunctaccounting firm found when thecollaboration of senior employeeswith enron was revealed and asthe canadian red cross foundwhen the tainted blood scandalcame to light in the 1990s it may sound somewhat pedes trian but it is nonetheless true thatsound policies and practices have alot to do with governance outcomes it is not an accident thatwellrun governments typicallyhave clearly defined procedures forhow policy documents should besubmitted to cabinet or how legislation should be crafted to function well boards need to ensure that staff provide them witheffective support certain key policies or practices must be in placethat are attuned to the needs of theorganization some of these maybe explicitwritten down othersmay be implicit or informal part ofthe unwritten culture of the organization whether formal or informal these practices should ensure theright people are involved in settingboard agendas the reports theboard receives for oversight shouldpresent the right information in away that directors can work withpolicy documents must presentissues understandably and set forthdecision options clearly key policies that have bearing on ethical behaviour should be inplace such as conflict of interestguidelines or codes of conductnot every board policy or practiceis critical to effective governancebut some are in summary in the quest for sound governance it is easy to getdistracted consistent focus onthe factors outlined above people leadership role claritysound
