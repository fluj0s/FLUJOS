violent federal crimes or providing material support to terrorist organizations members of terrorist cells in buffalo and portland have been convicted for providing material support based on their training in afghanistan some courts have indicated however that application of the definition of material support may be subject to constitutional challenge under some circumstances section 2042 creates new federal crime which outlaws the knowing receipt from or for the benefit of foreign terrorist organization of military training including instruction on the use of explosives and weapons of mass destruction under series of jurisdictional circumstances violations are punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years the jurisdictional circumstances include the fact that the offense is

prohibits providing material support for the commission of any of list of designated offenses 18 usc 2339a in addition anyone who aids or abets the commission of any of the offenses is subject to the same penalties as those violations they have made possible it is likewise federal crime to provide material support to designated terrorist organization 18 usc 2339b sections 2339a and 2339b apply within the us and in some instances to violations occurring overseas in the case of section 2339a the section has the same extraterritorial application as its predicate offenses section 2339b has an explicit statement of extraterritorial application section 2043 amends 18 usc 2339a and 2339b with respect to section 2339a in addition to clarifying amendments the bill adds to the designated offense list any crime of international or domestic terrorism as defined in the usa patriot act committed under specific jurisdictional conditions which it describes the bill also provides clarifying

weapons of mass destruction hr 10 sec2052s 2845 similar provision present httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21952 law condemns the use the threat to use and the attempt or conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction which it defines to include biological and atomic weapons as well as destructive devices bombs when the crime is committed overseas by or against an american when the crime is committed within the us and the use affects or would affect interstate or foreign commerce or when the crime is committed against federal property in the us or elsewhere individual parallel proscriptions cover biological weapons chemical weapons nuclear materials and explosives section 2052 enlarges the jurisdictional coverage of the generic weapons of mass destruction section so that it more closely approximates the jurisdictional reach of the individual proscriptions covering nuclear material as well as biological and chemical weapons it makes the generic provision applicable to chemical weapons in addition to the other weapons of mass destruction already included in the section it also enlarges the class of restricted individuals who may not possess biological toxins to include members and agents of designated terrorist organizations and agents of nations that support terrorism finally it adds biological weapon chemical weapon and nuclear materials offenses to the rico predicate offense list and consequently to the money laundering predicate offense list the purpose of section 2052 here seems to be one of emphasis since each of the offenses it appears to add to the rico predicate offense list is already there by virtue of its standing as federal crime of terrorism which rico includes in its predicate offense list participation in nuclear and weapons of mass destruction threats to the united states hr 10 sec 2053s 2845 similar provision section 57b of the atomic energy act of 1954 42 usc 2077b outlaws engaging in the production of special nuclear material outside the us

participation in the development of special nuclear material outside the us to the existing prohibition against production of special nuclear material outside the us the new 18 usc 832 consists of two crimes one crs4 concerned with foreign weapons programs and the other with misconduct in this country involving radiological weapons proposed subsection 832a bars participation in or providing

us or by one subject to us jurisdiction eg us company or citizen it also outlaws attempts or conspiracies to engage in such misconduct the subsection supplements existing proscriptions against

threatened use of such weapon against anyone within the us an american overseas of federal property regardless of its location the new section 832 is designated federal crime of terrorism and as

foreign intelligence information section 2191 expands the exception in number of ways it enlarges the class of government officials to whom grand jury material may be disclosed without court approval in order to assist in the grand jurys investigation the class already includes state local and tribal officials section 2191 adds foreign government officials with subsequent notification of the court but without prior court approval it permits any attorney for the us government to disclose any grand jury matter involving threat of actual or potential attack or other grave hostile acts of foreign power or an agent of foreign power domestic or international sabotage domestic or international terrorism or clandestine intelligence gathering activities by an intelligence service or network of

disclosure and may use it only in manner consistent with guidelines jointly issued by the attorney general and the national crs5 intelligence director it allows disclosure to foreign courts or

approval finally violations of the guidelines jointly issued by the attorney general and the director of central intelligence sic probably should read national intelligence director are punishable as
