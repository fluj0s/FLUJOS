side and prosperity on the economic side assistant secretary of state daniel fried testified in june 2008 that we want to help the nations of this region travel along the same path toward freedom democracy and marketbased economies that so many of their neighbors to the west have traveled we do not believe that any outside powerneither russia nor any othershould have sphere of influence over

abkhazia and south ossetia since 1993 successive us special negotiators for eurasian conflicts have helped in various ways to try to settle these frozen conflicts in early 2006 the state department eliminated this post and divided its responsibilities among the deputy assistant secretary of state and the office of caucasus affairs and regional conflicts5 congressional concerns about the nk conflict led to the inclusion of section 907 in the freedom support act which prohibits us governmenttogovernment assistance to azerbaijan except for nonproliferation and disarmament activities until the president determines that azerbaijan has taken demonstrable steps to cease all blockades and other offensive uses of force agai nst armenia and nk on waiver authority see below provisions in fy1996 fy1998 and fy1999 legislation eased the prohibition by providing for humanitarian democratization and business aid exemptions some observers argue that developments in the south caucasus are largely marginal to us strategic interests they urge great caution in adopting policies that will heavily involve the united states in region beset by ethnic and civil conflicts and some argue that since the european union has recognized the region as part of its neighborhood it rightfully should play major role some observers argue that the us interest in democratization should not be subordinated to interests in energy and antiterrorism 6 other observers believe that us policy now requires more active engagement in the region they urge greater us aid and conflict resolution efforts to contain warfare crime smuggling and islamic extremism and to bolster the independence of the states some argue that such enhanced us relations also would serve to contain russian and iranian influence and that close us ties with azerbaijan would benefit us relations with other islamic countries particularly turkey and the central asian states they also point to the prompt support offered to the united states by the regional states in the aftermath of the september 11 2001 attacks by qaeda on the united states some argue that energy resources in the caspian region are central

energy resources and helping it become peaceful stable and democratic as part of its european neighborhood policy the eu signed action plans with the three regional states in november 2006 that it hoped would foster both european and regional integration the eu took the international lead in mediating the august 2008 russiageorgia conflict and in deploying observers after the ceasefire see below the south caucasus region has developed some economic and political ties with other black sea and caspian sea littoral states besides those discussed above azerbaijan shares with central asian states common linguistic and religious ties and concerns about some common neighbors iran and russia the south caucasian and central asian states are concerned about ongoing terrorist threats and drug trafficking from afghanistan central asias increasing ties with the south caucasus make it more dependent on stability in the region

in peace stability and economic development since the soviet collapse in 1991 some observers lament the countries are faced with ongoing budgetary burdens of arms races and caring for refugees and displaced persons other costs of ethnic conflict include threats to bordering states of widening conflict and the limited ability of the region or outside states to fully exploit energy resources or tradetransportation networks us and international efforts to foster peace and the continued independence of the south caucasus states face daunting challenges the region has been the most unstable part of the former soviet union in terms of the numbers intensity and length of its ethnic and civil conflicts the ruling nationalities in the three states are culturally rather insular and harbor various grievances against each other this is particularly the case between armenia and azerbaijan where discord has led to the virtually complete displacement of ethnic armenians from azerbaijan and vice versa the main languages in the three states are dissimilar also those who generally consider themselves georgianskartvelians mingrelians and svansspeak dissimilar languages the borders of the countries do not coincide with eponymous ethnic populations efforts by ethnic minorities to secede are primary security concerns for all three states nk relies on economic support from armenia and

report that the election mostly met osce commitments in the preelection period and during voting hours but that serious challenges to some commitments did emerge especially after election day this

functions large majority of territorial and precinct electoral commission members were linked to the republican and prosperous armenia parties or the presidential administration media gave sargisyan

and nabucco gas pipelines and transcaspian gas pipeline so that azerbaijani and central asian gas could be transported to europe he has argued that these routes would be more economical than routes through russia in august 2007 the us trade development administration granted azerbaijan 17 million to fund feasibility studies on building both an oil and gas pipeline across the caspian sea to link to the btc pipeline and the scp the nabucco pipeline has faced numerous delays some of them attributable to russias counterproposals to build pipelines that appear to reduce the efficacy of the nabucco pipeline and questions about supplies for the pipeline see below latest eu planning calls for construction on the nabucco pipeline to begin in 2010 and be completed in 2013 some analysts raise concerns that without transcaspian gas pipeline there will not be enough azerbaijani gas to fill either the tgi or nabucco pipelines and argue that iran also should be considered as gas supplier 87 others suggest that azerbaijan wi ll be able to supply at least most of the needed gas for both the tgi and nabucco pipelines because of recent promising indications that there may be huge new reservoir of gas off the caspian seacoast highlighting this point deputy assistant secretary bryza stat ed in march 2008 that we now believe as an official us government view that azerbaijan has enough gas to fill tgi to launch nabucco and perhaps even to fill nabucco he stressed nonetheless that the united states also backed transcaspian gas pipeline as an additional source of supply for tgi and nabucco 88 putin reached agreement in may 2007 with the presidents of turkmenistan and kazakhstan on the construction of new pipeline to transport turkmen and kazakh gas to russia this agreement appears to compete with us and eu efforts to foster building transcaspian gas pipeline to link to the scp to turkey it also appears to comp ete with us and eu efforts to foster building the nabucco gas pipeline from turkey to austria89 on march 19 2007 armenian president robert kocharyan and iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad inaugurated an 88mile gas pipeline from tabriz in iran to kadjaran in armenia initial deliveries reportedly will be 141 billion cubic feet per year of iranian and possibly turkmen gas the russiancontrolled armrosgazprom joint venture operates the iranarmenia pipeline work has started on the second part of the pipeline 123 mile section from kadjaran to ararat when it is completed in early 2009 883 billion cubic feet of gas per year will be supplied some of this gas will be used to generate electricity for iran and georgia but the 87 us department of state transcript us official discusses ener gy security agreement with azerbaijan march 22 2007 associated press june 6 2007 88 us department of state transcaspian and balkan energy security matthew bryza deputy assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs ontherecord briefing with greek media march 18 2008 89 according to some observers russias efforts to discourage the building of transcaspian gas pipeline included an agreement with turkey in december 1997 that russia woul d build transblack sea pipeline termed blue stream to supply gas to turkey by building this pipeline russia hoped to discourage turkey from importing caspian sea region or middle eastern gas which could be transshipped to europe according to these observers despite these russian efforts the blue stream project was completed in 2005 turkey still signed framework agreement in 1998 and gas supply agreement in may 1999 with turkmenistan that envisaged the building of either pipeline traversing iran or transcaspian route through azerbaijan and georgia gas pipeline from tabriz to ankara began operating in 2001 but turkmen gas is not being sold to turkey through this pipeline in september 1999 turkmenistan also joined azerbaijan georgia and turkey in signing declaration on transcaspian gas pipeline plans at that time for transcaspian gas pipeline however were derailed in 2000 by clash between turkmenistan and azerbaijan over how much gas each nation could ship through the bakuturkey leg of the prospective gas pipeline and by turkmenistans rejection of proposals from consortium formed to build the transcaspian leg of the pipeline
