nonmilitary functions in an impartial manner these functions might include supervision of cessation of hostilities agreement or truce observation or pres ence inte rposition between opposing forces as buffer force maintenance and patrol of border or removal of arms from the area the charter did not specifically provide for peacekeeping operations this term was devised in 1956 with the creation of

the security council agreement by the parties to the conflict and consent of the host governments unrestricted access and freedom of movement by the operation within the countries of operation and within the parameters of its mandate provision of personnel on voluntary basis by members and noninterference by the operation and its participants in the internal affairs of the host government the conditions under which armed force may be used to carry out the mandate or for other purposes is set forth in the council reso lution or in council approval of the rules of engagement or concept of operations peacekeeping operations may take th form of either peacekeeping forces such as the force in cyprus unfic yp the operation in the congo in the 1960s or the interim force in lebanon unifil or observer missions such as the iraniraq military observer mission uniimog the observer group in central america onuc or the truce supervision organization in palestine untso the distinctions between observer missions and peacekeeping forces are found in the manda or function of the operation the numbers and types of personne l used and whether the pe rsonnel are armed usually peacekeeping forces are larger in the numbers of personnel equipment and cost than observer missions and are lightly armed ra ther than unarmed as are observers when the security council tablishes unconducted peacekeeping operation its resolution also specifies how the operation will be funded in most instances this is by special assessed acc ount to be created by the general assembly under the charter the general assembly pproves the budget and expenses of the organization this includes peacekeeping operations each operation has separate budget that is financed from separate asse ssed account in 1994 the assembly decided that the fina ncial period for each operation would be changed from january through december to july 1 to june 30 as peacekeeping operations grew in number and complexity the assembly found it required longer period of time to consider the budgets of each operation and other agenda items associated with united nations peacekeeping28 since 1948 the united nations has blished 63 peacekeeping operations 16 of which are currently active review of the data in appendix b peacekeeping operations numbers creat ed annually 19482008 shows pattern of increase in the creation of operations that escalated during the mid1990s this increase placed strain on the then notwelldeveloped cap acities of the secretariat to support larger numbers of operations and pers onnel

httpwwwunorgdepts dpkodpkoreportshtm fo r the reports s19991257 on rwanda and a54549 on srebrenicawhile the security council had in the past been reluctant to approve humanitarian assistance as major or primary function of peacekeeping operation it has now moved away from that position the council established protection for humanitarian operations in somalia as part of the major mandate for its operation there unosom and added humanitarian prot ection to an expanded mandate for the operation unprofor in bosnia and herzegovina35 another variable of peacekeeping in instances of humanitarian distress has been the extent to which peacekeepers can protect civilians including those who come to the peacekeepers for protection of ten such protection had not been part of the mandate approved by the secur ity council and neither the composition of an operation nor its rules of engagement or concept of operations allowed for such action two situations have been widely regarded as signifi cant examples of peacekeeping failures in the protection of ci vilians the first was the 1994 genocide in rwanda and the second was the fall of srebrenica in july 1995 and the killing of up to 200000 people36 reports examining these failures have helped focus the attention of officials and of member states especially members of the security council on the need to preven t and to respond to this sort of situation the continuing conditions in darfur sudan however reveal the difficulty of fashioning and implementing an effective response in the face of continuing reports of genocide the role of peacekeeping in monitoring elections s m authorities have called on the united nations to organize supervise andor monitor elections in various countries in the past the united nations had organized and carried out elections and act s of selfdetermination pursuant to its charter mandate for decolonization however it had not re sponded affirmatively to many requests for organizing or conducting elections in th peace and security domain for example in june 1989 secretarygeneral javier perez cuellar when considering nicaraguas request for participation in its electoral process characterized acceptance of election supervision in an independent country as unprecedented however in 1991 the general assembly authorized the electoral assistance division in the department of political affairs to serve as focal point for all electoral assistance activities this was in addition to the special peace and security situations when the security council might approve participation in plebiscites

were drawn from peacekeeping operations us financing fo r peacekeeping there are three major ways by which congress may finance us contributions to peacekeeping operations first congress currently finances us assessed contributions to these operations through th department of state authorization and appropriation bills under contributions to international peacekeeping activities cipa in the international organizations and conferences account these are the peacekeeping operations for which the general assembly creates separate assessed account against which every member state is obligated to pay specific percent of the expenses of the operation us arrearages to peacekeeping operations are associated with these assessed accounts second congress formerly funded one operation the peacekeeping force in cyprus unficyp from the foreign operations authorization and appropria tion bills under peacekeeping operations pko in the military assistance account the us cont ribution was funded this way because the cyprus force was initially financed from voluntary contributions from member nations on may 27 1993 the security counc il changed the basis of funding for the force in cyprus from solely vol untary to assessed plus voluntary37 future funding for us contributions to unficyp has m oved in the administrations request from the foreign operations military assistan ce pko account to th state department cipa account finally congress funds the u s contribution to some observer peacekeeping operations as part of its regu lar budget payment to the united nations there is separate ssessed account for these groups this is currently how the truce supervision organization untso and the military observer group in india and pakistan unmogip are funded because peacekeeping

initial funding for us contributions to the operations over the past several years these included reprogramming from other pieces of the international affairs budget such as economic support fund money obligated in past years for specific count ries but not disbursed another approach used was the transfer of funds to the in ternational affairs budg et from the department of defense for funding peacekeeping ope rations in recent years the president has requested and the congress has ppropriated funding for us assessed contributions to new or expanded peacekeep ing operations through the supplemental appropriations process in addition in 1994 and 1995 president c linton proposed that us assessed contributions for peacekeeping operations for which chapter vii of the charter is specifically cited in the authorizing secu rity council resoluti on be financed under the defense department authorizationappr opriations bills he proposed that the us assessed contribution for any other peacekeeping operations for which large us combat contingent is present also be financed from defense department money congress did not support this proposal proposals for strengthening peacekeeping agenda for peace 1992 as peacekeeping became an option of choice to resolve conflicts in the postcold war world proposals were made for strengthening the response to all aspects of this

to consign the united nations to future failures or to dramatically reduce the united nations role in efforts to manage conflict and build stable societies are unacceptable p 9091 member states must substantially increase the availability of capable designated forces properly trained and equipped for rapid deployment to peace operations on voluntary basis the cretariat should enhance its capacity to coordinate increases in member st ate contributions to the standby arrangements system p 97 the task force noted that while the unite d states formally participates in the united nations standby

management unit to conduct assessments and assist in the establishment of new peace operations 2 assessed funding for firstyear quickimpact projects in peace operations as well as the full range of early disarmament demobilization and reintegration assistance when thos have been identified in premission assessments as critical for success and 3 the adoption of twoyear budgets for support of

encourage deployment of established rather than patched together its to peacekeeping operations impose accountability of senior managers support effective data collection and management provide
