agricultu ral products mostly bulk corn and soybeans the lowcost highvolume capability of barge transportation has long provided an important competitive advant age for us agricultural products in international markets agricultural barge freight on the umriww grew rapidly for several decades in the postwwii era but has leveled off since the early 1980s there is disagreement over the cause for this lack of growth in barge demand shipping and agricultural interests argue that stagnant umriww barge traffic is due to delays associated with aging infrastructure and limited lock capacity that delays are increasingly forcing grain shippers to switch to alternate transportation modes to ensure timely arrival at downriver processing plants or gulf ports that the declining efficiency of the umriww is hurting both us competitiveness in international markets and us farm incomes at home and that investment is needed to modernize and expand the capacity of the locks other interest groups contend that growth in domestic demand as well as international market conditions have changed substantially since the period of rapid growth in barge demand experienced during the 1960s and 1970s changes in the shape and origin of international mand and supply an increasing number of bilateral and multilateral trade agreements and other factors have resulted in the emergence of new trade routes for agricultural commodities that have drawn exportable supplies of corn and soybeans away from the umriww system recent trade patterns coupled with usdas longrun market outlook suggest that us corn and soybean exports may increasingly turn to overland trade routes to access growing asian markets via the pacific northwest as well as to nearby markets in mexico and cana da in addition expected strong competition from south american producers particularly in gl obal soybean and product markets may lead to refocusing of us exports away from atlanticrim markets and toward canadian mexican and possi bly asian markets where geography offers some competitive advantages if these expectations are realized then growth in future barge demand from the agricultural sector may be well

figure 4 the same situation appears to hold for the iww however the corps suggests that such view of the data could be misleading the corps is responsible for operati ons and maintenance of the umriww navigation system5 officials from the corps report that the corps has been forced to significantly reduce allowable traffic flows due to problems associated with the lock systems aging infrastructure corps official suggested that over the past 14 years the corps has been compelled to increasingly reduce allowable traffic by as much as 10 annually due to accumu lating infrastructure degradation6 as result the corps argues that freight traffic on the first two reaches of the umriww has been essentially flat over the past two decades not from stagnant demand for barge transportation but because the delays nd uncertainties associated with moving commodities on the umriww system have prevented higher usage according to the corps commodity sh ippers under contract delivery deadlines are

1996why transportation costs matter to agriculture in competitive grain and oilseed markets transfer costs handling and transportation charges are major factor in determining market price differentials agricultural producers are concerned about tr ansportation costs because the price that they receive for their agri cultural commodities is derive d from the price established in major markets whether processing plant feedlot or export terminal by subtracting transportation and handling costs the more it costs to transport commodity to buyer the less the producer will receive and vice versa as result any process that reduces the cost of movi ng commodity to buyer likely benefits producers by raising the price that they receive which subsequently benefits the local economy by generating greater farm inco and associated economic activity8 in contrast raising domestic transpor tation costs widens the farmtomarket price differential widening differentia l generally compels exporters to offer the products in international ma rkets at higher prices that is less competitively higher us export prices relative to international competitors will lower the demand for us exports of corn and soybeans lower export demand reduces total demand and consequently lowers the prices and in come received by farmers for given level of production in the long run permanent changes to corn and soybean prices relative to the prices for other agricultu ral production activities will likely alter the crop or activity mix of farm s in the affected region barge transport and cost savings barge transportation represents lowcost method of moving bulk commoditie s long distances furthermore most economists and market analysts agree that inexpensive barge transportation helps keep in check rates charged by the rail and truck transportati on industries low internal transport costs relative to export competitors such as argentina and brazil have helped us products compete in international corn and soybean markets9 an evaluation of transportation cost s for the umriww system commissioned by the corps indicated that rate savings to waterway users averaged about 860 per ton

freight that can be carried in season is the time it takes to make each haul12 the shorter the haul time the more total hauls that can be made and the more freight that can be moved as result delays associated with aging locks and dams represent lost time lost potential freight and lost profits waiting delays also represent lost fuel towboats on the um riww burn about 80 gallons of diesel fuel per hour the engines are kept running while each towboat waits for its turn through the lock according to the corps the umriww sy stem has over half 19 of 36 of the most delayed lock sites in the c ountrys system of inland waterways13 existing delays vary based on the location in the system in general delays are greatest at the 600ft locks furthest downstream for the 10year period 199099 delays

services declines yu and fuller in the third of three studies have timated 05 decline in grain barge demand on the umr and 02 decline on the iww in response to 1 increase in barge freight rates17 for example the april 2004 barge freight rate from minneapolis to gulf ports of about 1071 per metric ton is equivalent to about 027 per bushel of corn and 029 per bushel of soybeans18 based on yus and fullers estimations 5 rise approxima tely 14cents per bushel in the barge freight rate would result in 25 decline in the volume of corn and soybean freight or about 089 mmt out of 41 mmt the barge price rise would shift these commodities to alternate uses feed food industrial or stor age to alternate transport modes rail or truck or to alternate trade routes eg ca mexico or the pacific northwest possible effect of sustained rise in barge transport rates is rise in rail freight costs due both to rising demand for rail as freight shifts away from barge and towards rail transport and to decreased efficiency due to longer rail delays as more traffic moves over the same mileage of fre ight track and through the same number of terminals the degree if any to whic h rail costs would rise in response to greater demand would depend on the level of slack capacity available to immediately absorb the agricultural freight that is being dive rted from barge transportation the level of rail slack capacity is seasonal but tends to be near full capacity at harvest time when barge demand is highest the rise in ra il rates will likely be more acute for goods that rely more heavily on umriww barge transportation as share of total freight shipped eg corn and soybeans due to limited alternatives trucks do not compete well with barge or rail for long distance movement of bulk commodities however the rise in rail rates would partially dampen the freight shift occurring because of barge delays and rising barge rates thus preventing greater shift of freight from barge to rail than would otherwise occur evans estimated that railroad freight ra tes for farm products will increase 14 for every 1 increase in umr barge freight rates19 in other words 2 cents per bushel rise in

the regions exportable surplus production of corn and soybeans on international market conditions and on the availability and cost of alternate transportation mode s and routes historically corn and soybeans exported from the western and central portions of th us corn belt have relied on the umr iww navigation system as the lowestcost most direct route to gulf ports and international markets however us domestic and international market conditions have changed substantially since the pe riod of rapid growth in barge demand experienced during the 1960s and 1970s21 as result traffic delays on the umr iww may not be the sole explanation fo r stagnant barge demand since the early 1980s in recent years the umriww regions agricultural production has faced strong demand from domestic users

soybeans is the livestock sector in recent years increas in us demand for meat products has maintained feed usage at hi storical high levels robus t growth in demand from food and industrial processing as well as from the renewable bi ofuels sector particularly cornbased ethanol production also has help ed to bolster growth in domestic use of corn and soybeans both in terms of total volume and as share of production for corn domestic use as share of producti on varied widely during the 1980s but has grown steadily through most of the 1990s peaking at an 88 share in 200203 in contrast domestic use of soybeans as shar of production has been fairly stable at about 66 since the early 1980s strong growth in domestic use as share of total production tends to limit growth in exportable supplies for two reasons first domestic users generally offer higher returns over international markets as result exports are generally supplied as residual outlet after dom estic users have been satis fied second strong domestic demand has traditionally kept us prices at slight premium to other international exporters hindering us competitiveness particularly as compared to foreign

us corn exports echoed this pattern but were further reinforced by widespread gr owth in foreign grain production since the late 1970s in addition specific circumstan ces first in the former soviet union fsu then in china and the european union eu further contributed to weak international demand highly competitive markets and flat us exports see figure 5 during the 1970s us feed grain exports rose sharply due to strong demand from the fsu between 1971 and 1985 fsu imports of us corn averaged over 65 mmt per year out of average annual us corn exports of about 43 mmt22 most of this corn was shipped to the fsu via th umriww system however us corn exports to the fsu fell to zero during 19861990 when the fsu reversed its policy of maintaining domestic livestock herds by buying corn on the international market the early 1990s witnessed the loss of hist orical demand source for us corn with the breakup of the fsu and the wide scal liquidation of fsu animal herds us corn exports to the fsu have averaged less than 1 mmt since 1990 in addition china entered world corn markets as ma jor exporter in 1984 just as the fsu was preparing to leave the market from 1984 to 2003 chinas corn exports averaged 65 mmt per year displacing us corn in many asian markets that had traditionally imported us corn eg south korea taiwan philippines and indonesia in addition to its favorable geographic proximity china appears to have routinely used implicit export subsidies such as price discounts on marketing and transportation fees on its corn exports making it difficult for us corn to compete in asian markets23 in the late 1980s three major us corn importers japan south korea and taiwan began to import increasing amounts of beef displacing their internal beef production and lowering their demand for feed grains this trend continued through the 1990s and had the effect of reducing mand for us corn us corn exports were dealt further blow in 1998 when the eu in dramatic policy reversal imposed facto ban on agricultura l products origina ting from genetically engineered seeds24 this move effectively shut us corn out of eu markets during the six years prior to the ban eu imports of us corn had averaged about 2 mmt per year since the facto ban annual us corn exports to the eu have averaged 88000 tons the net sum of these changes has been heightened competition in

international grain and oilseed demand but also possibly due to the rising costs and delays associated with the umriwws aging lock and dam system see figure 7 some of the major factors that have contributed to shifts towards other trade routes include the following first the north american free trade agreement nafta between the united states mexico and canada beginning in 1994 increased market access for us agricultural products to mexican and cana dian markets key feature of nafta has been the gradual elimination of tariffs on all commodities including agricultural products overland truck nd rail routes to the nafta partners mexico and canada have expanded ra pidly during the past 10 years particularly for perishables but also for grains and oilseeds in addition to naftarelated market access gains mexico has made major changes in its domestic agricultural policy that have contributed to growing imports of us agricultural products as result us corn exports to mexico have more than doubled since nafta took effect gr owing from 2 mmt average 45 share of us corn exports in 19891993 to 51 mmt average 11 share during 2000httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32401crs17 28usda ers effects of

early 1990s to po ssibly 20 or greater by 200129 us corn exports to canada also have shown strong growth in recent years this growth is linked to several factors the 1995 imination of canadian transportation subsidies under the west ern grain transportation act and the subsequent development of substantial pork industry in canadas prairie states growth in canadas poultry industry and agronomic limitations on canadas ability to produce corn during 198994 us corn exports to canada averaged 07 mmt annually since 2000 canadas imports of us corn have surged upward averaging 36 mmt for

looking for the most costeffective routes to china traditionally shipments of us grains nd oilseeds to asian markets have traveled down the umriww system to gulf ports then through the panama canal and across the pacific while this rema ins the principal route for asianbound agricultural products delays and higher co sts associated with the umriww system plus rising fees to pass through the panama canal have made the pnw route increasingly more attractive particularly for soybeans produced in the dakotas finally two other events have contribut ed to the development of an overland pnw route for soybeans from the western corn belt first recent genetic advancements have produced hardier soyb ean varieties that have pushed their production into the plains states at the expense of traditional small grains crops soybean production in the dakotas is located far enough from the umriww system to make pnw route more viable once the midwesttopnw route becomes established and economies of scale ensue more soybeans from the western corn belt could potentially be diverted from the umriww second factor has been the increased use of 110car shuttle trai ns to the pnw these longer trains are designed to capture the economies of scale i nherent in shipping larger volumes of commodity long distances us wheat export outlets historically most us wheat moving to international

surrounding the projected economic benefits of new investments to modernize and expand lock capacity on the umriww navigation system is the outlook for agricultural bulk trade particul arly corn and soybeans seeking access to international markets via gulf ports pr ojecting exportable surpluses of corn and soybeans involves evaluating the longrun outl ook for us agriculture in general and for competing land uses in particular given the western corn belts likelihood of remaining major corn and soybean produ cer projections of barge demand on the umriww system hinge on the outlook for th ree aspects of us corn and soybean production and trade 1 how will growth in us production co mpare with domestic use in other words what are the prospects for exporta ble supplies higher levels of grain exports would increase demand for rail and barge transportation with the relative shares of rail versus barge pending on routes used in contrast increased domestic offfarm feed us and increased domestic demand for processed grain products would dr ive up demand for truck and rail transportation32 2 what is the likelihood that such exporta ble surpluses if realized will demand barge transportation on the umriww navi gation system rather than alternate transportation modes and routes this hinges on projected changes in the sources of international demand for example shifting the center of soybean demand from europe to asia might favor an overland rail route to the pacific northwest over the umriww alternately unexpectedly strong growth in feed demand from middle eastern markets could accelerate the movement of corn exports via the umriww and gulf ports 3 how competitive will us exports be and in which international markets this relates to projections of export compe tition from foreign produ cers particularly argentina and brazil but also newly emerging eastern european producers umriww agricultural trade projections one of the corps objectives under the umriww navigation study has b een to evaluate the potential barge demand over 50year time horizon specifically 2000 to 2050 to date the primary studies undertaken either by or for the corps to examine projected umr iww traffic flows and barge demand have met with criticism from the national research council nrc of the national academies33 major shortcomings cited by the nrc include the following points first most studies have relied on fair ly optimistic outlooks for growth in both international demand for bulk commodities us exportable surpluses of bulk commodities and umriww traffic flows and barge demand see table 4 inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32401crs20 contrast us corn exports have shown growth during the past two decades and usdas longrun outlook suggests that in creasing competition in global soybean markets will dampen us soybean exports second the various models used to pr oject barge demand in corpssanctioned studies have been constrained partialequilibrium models for the most part to be operable these models have held constant important aspects of commodity and transportation markets as result the nrc review said that the corps barge demand projections inadequately consider the potential crossprice effects in commodity and transportation markets third the nrc review also indicated th at corps sanctioned studies have tended to ignore or minimize the potential for alternate routes to evolve based on international market conditi ons while projections fo r global population and income growth would suggest that demand for agri cultural products will increase this alone is insufficient to justify projections for strong growth in bulk commodity flows on the umriww system any comprehensive anal ysis must consider the evolution of specific market forces and the potential shifts in trade flows and patterns that they will engender table 4 compares the growth rates from va rious studies for agriculturerelated barge demand on the umriww with gr

economic growth increasing export competition strengthening global gdp growth over the next decade and beyond implies increased demand for livestock products and animal feeds which in turn supports increased international demand for corn wheat and soybeans and products an inherent weakness in this projection is that much of the economic and demand growth is from developing countries where optimistic proj ections have often turned out to be inaccurate usda projects that global import dema nd for animal feeds will push growth rates for trade in major feed stuffs higher over the next ten years however increased competition in these markets is expected from both traditional exporters argentina australia canada and the eu as well as from countries that are in the process of investing in

summary the corn belt has strong comparative advantage in the production of corn and soybeans that is lik ely to preserve the regions emphasis on production of these crops for years to co as such the umriww navigation system will likely remain an important co mponent of us corn and soybean export competitiveness however projections fo r substantial increases in umriww barge traffic will depend on corn and soybean production growing faster than their domestic demand and the evolution of inte rnational market conditions that would favor the umriww system over alternate trade routes and transportation modes while the longterm outlook for corn production may be optimistic the trend of the past five years suggests that domes tic consumption driven by growth in meat and dairy products as well as increasing ethanol production will continue to capture an important share of total use the introduction of renewable fuels standard rfs as proposed in pending energy legislation could accelerate this process38 furthermore growing trade with neighbor ing nafta partners and the longerterm prospects for increased trade with east asia suggest that alternate trade routes such as by rail
