1950s are the two key pillars upon which the useuropean partnership still rests the us congress and successive us administrations have supported both organizations as means to nourish democracy foster reliable military allies and create strong trading partners despite the changed european security environment since the end of the cold war and current transatlantic frictions many observers stress that the security and prosperity of the united stat and europe remain inextr icably linked both sides of the atlantic continue to face comm on set of challenges from countering terrorism and weapons

in the world annual twoway flows of goods services and foreign dir ect investment exceed 11 trillion while the total stock of twoway direct investment is over 16 trillion nevertheless the transatla ntic partnership has been fundamentally challenged in recent years as numerous trade and foreign policy conflicts have emerged the crisis over iraq is most notable but the lis t of disagreements is wide and varied it includes the israelipalestinian conflict the eu arms embargo on china the role of multilateral institutions and the use of force the us treatment of prisoners in iraq and at guantánamo bay aircraft subsidie s and trade in geneticallymodified food these disputes have been driven partly by leadership frictions and european perceptions of us unilateralism and partly by structural issues different policy preferences for managing threats the useuropean defense capabilities gap and the eus political evolution set in motion by the end of the cold war and september 11 these factors are also prompting so americans and europeans to question whether the two sides of the atlantic still share the same values and interests and whether enough commonality remains to make

for us policy introduction the united states and europe shar long and intertwined history1 us european political security and economic relations that today comprise the broad transatlantic relationship have their modern origins in postworld war ii efforts to deter the soviet threat and bring security to europe nato which was created in 1949 and the european union eu the test stage in process of european integration begun officially in 1952 ar the two main pillars upon which the transatlantic relationshi p still rests nato was founded upon shared commitment to protect common values of democracy i ndividual liberty and the rule of law in practice it sought to do this by providing collective defense against soviet expansion through mutual security guarantee for the united states and its european allies the european integration project was mean t to promote peace political stability and economic prosperity in eur ope by entrenching democratic systems and free markets the us congress and successive us administrations have strongly supported both nato and the eu believing that both organizations have helped foster democracy reliable military allies and str ong trading partners the united states also views the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce as an important transatlantic forum for promo ting democracy and human rights both in europe and in europes wi der neighborhood including russia ukraine belarus and the countries of the caucasus and centra l asia the united states and european nations also share membership in other major international organizations such as the world trade organization wto and the united nations since the end of the cold war both nat and the eu have evolved along with europes changed strategic landscape while natos collective defense guarantee remains at the core of the alliance members have also sought to redefine its mission as new security challenges have emerged on europes periphery and beyond at the same time eu member s have moved beyond economic integration nd have taken steps toward political integration with decisions to develop common foreign policy and defense arm both organizations have also enlarged in recent years to encompass many central and east european states bringing the number of nato and eu members to 26 and 25 respectively the unite d states was key

the united states and the eu share the largest trade and investment relationship in the world annual twoway flows of goods services and foreign direct investment exceed 11 trillion the total stock of twowa direct investment is estimated to be over 16 trillion making this huge investment position perhaps the most significant aspect of the relationship although some prominent useu trade disputes exist the vast portion of this bilateral economic relationship is harmonious some analysts estimate that trade tensions involve only 12 of tran satlantic commerce2 despite the shared history and close economic ties the transatlantic partnership has been fundamentally challenged in r ecent years the september 11 terrorist attacks on the united states prompted an initial display of transatlantic solidarity but much of the goodwill has since dissipate d as numerous trade and foreign policy disputes have emerged the crisis over iraq is most notable but the list of disagreements is wide and varied alt hough europeans are not monolithic in their views most states including those such as the united kingdom spain italy and poland that supported the us intervention in iraq object to at least some elements of us policy on range of issues including the israelipalestinian conflict the treatment of qaeda prisoners at guantánamo bay and the us practice of rendition missile defense geneticallymodified food and the kyoto protocol on climate change the bush administration says it will make mending transatlantic relations in both nato and the eu priority in its second term nevertheless debate is reemerging in policymaking and academic circles on the value and purpose of the useuropean relationship while many would argue that much still binds the two sides of the atlantic others worry that the relationship is in trouble some us critics question the extent to which the european allies share us threat perceptions of the challenges posed by islamist terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction wmd even if the allies agree on the necessity of tackling such problems us and european tactics are often at odds european governments remains firmly wedded to managing international crises through multilateral institutions while the united states views this approach as only one option the bush administration and members of congress are also concerned that deficient european military capabilities hinder the allies ability to share the security burden with the united states ot hers suggest that us actions in the prosecution of the war on terrorism and in iraq have prompted some to question whether the two sides of the atlantic still share enough values nd interests to make the transatlantic partnership work this report assesses the present state of the us european relationship and reasons for curre nt frictions and provides for the purpose of analysis spectrum of options for us policymakers in considering the future shape of the political and strategic dimensions of the transatlantic partnershiphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32577crs3 3 some suggest for example that european countries contributed military support to the usled 1991 gulf war not because those forces were essential to the operations success but in order to demonstrate alliance solidar ity against common threat similarly they contend that the us decision in 1995 to deploy ground troops as part of the nato peacekeeping force in bosnia was driven in pa rt by the belief that the united states must stand firmly with its nato allies see david c gompert america as

historically useuropean relations have experienced numerous ups and downs during the cold war even with the unifying pressure of common military threat transatlantic tensions flared from time to time over controversial issues such as vietnam and the stationing of us ballistic missiles in europe ineffective and tentative internationa l responses to the balkan conflicts in the early 1990s prompted serious questioning of natos role in the postcold war era and of europes ability to manage crises on the european continen t proponents of the alliance have always stressed however the underlying solidity of the transatlantic relationship given its basis in common values and shared intere sts thus conventional wisdom dictates that frictions merely represent disagreements among friends characteristic of us european business as usual many eu ropeans acknowledge that criticism of us policies in iraq and the middle east has been fierce recently but claim that they have only felt free to express their views because useuropean relations are so close and honesty is hallmark of true friendship even without the soviet threat to unite the two sides of the atlantic the united states and its european allies face co mmon set of challenges from countering terrorism and wmd proliferation to ensuring the stability of the global financial markets and have few other comparab partners s upporters of strong transatlantic ties argue that neither the united states nor europe can adequately address such diverse concerns alone and that the track record shows that they can accomplish much more in the world when they work together rather than at cross purposes us and european forces are promoting peace and stability in the balkans and afghanistan us and european law enforcement authorities have sought to intensify police and judicial cooperation ce september 11 to root out terrorist cells in europe and elsewhere useurop ean cooperation has also been critical in making the world trading system more open and efficient in addition proponents stress that the tr ust and habits of political and military cooperation that have developed among the allies and especially within nato over the last 50plus years are unique in interna tional relations and c ontinue to serve us interests natos organizational struct ure provides forum in which differences among allies can be discussed and narrowed the alliance has also fostered beneficial atlantic loyalty especially in times of extreme adversity as evidenced by the invocation of natos article 5 defense guarantee after

university 2003 5 interviews of us europe an and eu officials summer 2004as noted above the united states and the eu share huge and mutually beneficial economic relationship that is increasingly interdependent reports indicate that the transatlantic economy employs 12 to 14 million workers and that most us and european investments flow to each other rather than to lowerwage developing nations europe remains the most important foreign sour ce of global profits for us companies accounting for over half of u s firms total nnual foreign profits similarly the united states is the most important market in terms of earnings for many european multinationals between 1990 and 2000 for example us affiliate income of european companies increas ed from 44 b illion to nearly 26 billion although transatlantic rgers and acquisitions have slowed since the 2001 economic downturn the boom of the late 1990s has left european firms more engaged in the us economy than ever before4 this economic interdependency some argue is key reason tran satlantic divorce would be impossible us and european policymakers are keen to stress that working relations between us and european officials remain close and have not been impeded by the highly charged political confrontations over issues such as iraq some commentators suggest that without the soviet threat european allies feel freer to voice more robustly their own views european officials suggest that this simply represents the transatlantic allian ces evolution into more ma ture frank and open relationship us officials also note that some bumps in the relationship are to be expected as the united states and the european allies slowly chart new territory in grappling with how to address significant cha llenges outside of europe in their view for the first time since world war ii europe is rising that is increasingly concerned with events beyond europe in part because eu enlargem ent and the internal stabilization of the continent are nearly complete the current difficulties in the transatlantic partnership are thus just growing pains in the relationship that need time to be worked out5 useuropean frictions and relationship in flux despite the ties that bind the events of september 11 and the crisis over iraq have helped spark significant changes in the useuropean political and strategic relationship some observers argue that the recent useuropean frictions are largely driven by personality differences among us and european leaders many analysts contend however that the underlyi ng causes are deeper and structural and that september 11 merely kicked into high gear changes that had already been set in motion by the end of the cold war and the demise of the soviet union decade earlier such structural changes include different policy preferences the us european defense capabilities gap and europes ongoing but unfinished integration others ponder whether us and european inte rests and values have diverged to such an extent as to call into question whether sufficient commonality still exists to make the broad transatlantic pa rtnership desirable and be neficial for both sides

hould be noted however that such european charges of us unilateralism are not completely new many europeans in the 1990s complained that congress and the clinton administration often acted unilaterally citing for example the defeat of the comprehensive test ban treaty and us sanctions rela ted to cuba iran and libya regardless european governments from the start of the bush administration seized on its rejection of international trea ties such as the kyoto protocol and its decision to proceed with missile defense as evidence of new broader us unilateralism they were also extrem ely wary about the new administrations commitment to europe given that officials during the campaign had questioned the need to keep us troops in the balkan s and seemed to place greater emphasis on other regions of the world such as asia the september 2001 terrorist attacks swept such frictions under the rug for while as european governments nato and the eu condemned the attacks and expressed co mplete solidarity with the united states at the same time the initial us decision to forego using nato forces planning or logistical resources in the war in af ghanistan began stirring european concerns about natos relevance to the bush admin istration and us security interests6 in 20022003 useuropean tensions reem erged on wide range of trade and foreign policy issues us moves in the first half of 2002 such as rejecting the international criminal court and seeking to exempt us soldiers from its jurisdiction as well as imposing steel tariffs reignited european concerns that the bush administration was not interested in working with its longtime allies perhaps most unsettling for many europeans was the emergence in early 2002 of confrontational us policy toward iraq which culminated in the usled decision to go to war against saddam hussein in march 2003 many europeans perceived the united states as acting with little regard for the views of the international community and without much concern for the need to gain approval for the use of force as result of europes own bloody histor european allies place great emphasis on multilateral ins titutions as mean s for managing internati onal crises and legitimizing the use of force this is as true fo r the uk and other european countries that ultimately supported the usled intervention in iraq as it is for france germany and others that opposed us policy by 2004 critics of the bush administra tion began to contend that the us intervention in iraq and its aftermath were seriously damaging us credibility abroad including in europe the abu ghraib prison scandal stunned and dismayed the european allies many europeans viewed the actions of us soldiers at abu ghraib as following directly from us policies in the war on terrorism such as detaining suspected qaeda terrorists at guantánamo bay some charged that these actions violated human rights and sacrificed the longterm battle for muslim hearts and minds

credibility has made many european allies even less inclined to shoulder bigger financ ial or security role in iraq some europeans charge that the bush administrations pursuit of its goals in iraq damaged not only the credibility of the united nations but also of nato they assert that us pressure in early 2003 to deploy nato military assets to help turkey defend itself against possible attack from iraq forced an unseemly public confrontation within the alliance many europeans also worried that the bush administration was keen to keep europe w eak and divided they feared that us secretary of defense rumsfelds statement shortly before the us invasion of iraq that divided europe into old countries that opposed the invasion and new those countries especially in ce ntral and eastern europe th at supported it signaled an unofficial shift in us policy away fro m continued support for further european integration most european allies incl uding those included in the new category such as poland were critical of rumsfelds comments b ecause they object to any division of the continent and support building europe whole and free at the same time many analysts also blame some european leaders particularly french president jacques chirac and thengerman chancellor gerhard schroeder for contributing to the breakdown in transatlantic relations chirac has long espoused the concept of multipolarity in international affa irs but some bush administration officials have interpreted this concept as means to thwart us predominance many viewed chiracs oppositi on to the war in iraq as an attempt to constrain us power and influence in spite of the threat posed by saddam hussein8 relations between president bush and chancellor schroeder over iraq soured in september 2002 when schroede r began condemning us iraq policy to bolster his reelection campaign many observers maintain that both chirac and schroeder expressed their opposition to the war in ir aq in an undiplomatic and irresponsible way without due consideration of the implications for the broader transatlantic partnership they note that the failure of france and germany and belgium to clearly and quickly support their fellow nato ally turkey as the conflict with iraq loomed left damaging impression of allies unwilling to stand together in time of need and has caused some in wash ington to lose confidence in nato9 europeans have welcomed the bush admin istrations efforts in its second term to improve useuropean relations and responded positively to the european trips in february 2005 by president bush and

note that president bushs visit to the eus institutions while in brussels in february 2005 and his statement in support of eu integra tion have helped alleviate some european anxieties stemming from secretary rumsfe lds comments about old and new europe many point to the recent useu cooperation to curb irans nuclear ambitions as tangible positive development that demonstrates the value of the transatlantic partnership nevertheless others point out that many europeans still remain skeptical about the degree to which the bush administration views its european allies and friends as full partners structural drivers many analysts argue that the reasons for current us european frictions are largely structural stemming from the end of the cold war and exacerbated by september 11 and its aftermath in this view recent tensions are to some degree inevitable and go beyond indi vidual leaders and their personal styles one key structural change often cited relates to alterations in the us security outlook since september 11 some observe rs note that diverging useuropean threat perceptions are not new and have been emerging since the end of the cold war throughout the 1990s us policymak ers often complained that europe was preoccupied with its own internal transfor mation and largely blind to the new global threats however the september 11 attacks on new york washington and over pennsylvania as well as the still unsolve d anthrax attacks of october 2001 had profound effect on americas national psyche and further widened the gap in us european threat perceptions and policy preferences for managing those threats many in europe have been slow to unde rstand that many us actions in the war on terrorism are driven by the conclu sion that nothing should be left to chance especially with regard to the possibility of terrorists acquiring wmd the bush administrations promotion of preemptive action in the face of security threats has been source of great concern for european allies and partners especially if undertaken without authorization some claim this is in part because european publics do not feel the same sense of urge ncy regarding the terrorist threat even after the terrorist attacks in madrid in march 2004 and in london in july 2005 and in part because most european governments continue to view combating terrorism primarily as an issue for law enforcement and soft power diplomatic and economic tools in the postseptember 11 world how ever the united states is likely to be much more activist in confronting potential threats and more inclined to view multilateral efforts to tackle such probl ems as only one option regardless of who controls the white house europeans for example took note of democratic presidential candidate senator john kerrys statement at his partys convention in july 2004 that he would never give any nati on or international in stitution veto over our national security10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32577crs8 11 robert

approaches to managing threats and using fo rce to power problem in his view europe emphasizes multilateral institutions diplomatic pressure and foreign aid as the best tools to manage crises because most european countries with the possible exceptions of the uk and france lack the military capabilities necessary to project and sustain power especially outside of europe kagan asserts that europes military weakness has produced european interest in inhabiting world where strength doesnt matter where international law and international institutions predominate11 most europeans reject kagans thesis arguing that they are not pacifists and citing their roles in the 1999 natoled war in kosovo and their presence in afghanistan they acknowledge howev er the need to improve their military capabilities in order to better ensure their own security and to enable european forces to continue to operate with us forces but many expe rts assert that overall levels of european defense spending remain insufficient and skeptics say that european promises to spend existing defense resources more wisely have failed to materialize in any substantial way thus the useuropean capabilities gap will remain source of contention in the transatlantic alliance especially given that us attention for the foreseeable future will likely be focused on threats well beyond europe some assert that washington will increasingly measure europes value added in the years ahead by how willing and able the european allies are to help the united states manage the security burden not onl within but also outside of europe12 another major structural factor aff ecting useuropean relations is the european unions ongoing evolution ce the end of the cold war the eu has pursued further integration through both

capabilities have lagged behind and they doubt that current european defense budget s are sufficient to fund all of the eu defense arms requirements nevertheless eu efforts to develop cfsp are contributing to current us european strains some see the emergence of an eu strategic personality specifically european way of interpre ting and acting upon perceived threats and foreign policy opportunities th at stresses diplomacy and multilateral solutions as diverging from the us strategic position and outlook which places greater emphasis on the use of force and decisive action14 as the eus strategic personality continues to strengthen eu member states are increasingly and reflexively assessing major foreign policy decisions from european perspective ie with an eye toward meeting european strategic goals and establishing larger role for europe on the world stage eu members consult with each other on foreign policy concerns to greater degree than ever before and ofte n before consulting with washington as result washington does not hold quite the same influence over the european allies as it once did and eu member states are quicker to challenge us policies with which they do not agree some analysts also suggest that the eu s progress to date on cfsp plus the several small civilian and military crisis management missions the eu has led in the balkans africa and elsewhere have gi ven the organization and its member states new selfconfidence this is leading to more vocal europe which is more assertive about its right to an equal deci sionmaking role in the alliance such demands however often frustrate us polic ymakers who continue to view europes aspirations as outpacing europes abilities as one analyst remarks as an unfinished union of states europe now sta nds as power in the world which gives it legitimate voice that america must hear more and more clearly than has been the case to date but lacking the capabilities re quired for military action when necessary it is not or not yet the world power that it claims to be and the price of consultation is not always worth the benefits it brings15 regardless the eu is likely here to stay as an actor in the foreign policy security and defense field some cont end that larger more united and more confident eu may seek to rival the united states and could weaken nato and the transatlantic link the

security guarantee in addition eu mo mentum in the foreig n policy and defense fields may be in for period of stagnati on following the rejection in the spring of 2005 by french and dutch voters of the eu s constitutional treaty some observers expect eu attention in the near to medium term to be focused on internal reforms rather than external challenges others argue that europe able to speak with one voice on foreign and security policy may be more credible and reliable partner for the united states in both maintaining european security and tack ling global challenges during president bushs february 2005 trip to brussels he sserted that the united states wants the european project to succeed and that strong europe is in us interests16 at the same time more unified and selfassured eu may reduce us leverage on individual member states thus complica ting us efforts to rally support for its initiatives in nato or at the united nations to large extent however the eus ability to become stronger security partner for the united states will depend on the degree to which the eu succeeds in improving its defense capabilities and whether the operational and institutional links established between the eu and nato tinue to function smoothly the eus assumption of natos mission in bosnia in december 2004 is viewed as an important test of europes ability to shoulder greater degree of the security burden moreover the eus future evolution as foreign policy actor will also depend on domestic politics in individual member states and the political parties in power for example

states which they associate with undemocratic and aut horitarian societies current and key distinction between the two sides of the atlantic relates to the role of multilateral institutions and the use of force some analysts assert that the different us and european perspectives on these issues only represent different policy preferences thereby suggesting that the positions of the two sides of the atlantic can be managed by skillful diplomats others suggest however that the divide is deeper and goes to each sides core beliefs and values they claim that europe increasingly views multilateralism not only as policy preference but as an interest and value to pursue in and of its elf because it represents the best way to ensure european peace security and prosperity in contrast number of experts assert that the united states harbors stronger belief in the value of the use of force as tool for protecting us interests as result some question whether the di verging views of the united states and europe on the value of international institu tions and the appropriate role of the use of force can be reconciled and whether the allies can go forward together in tackling global challenges in coope rative and determined way henry kissinger observes the most important event in europe is the progressive erosion of the nation stateeuropean diplomats seek to appl their new

nationstate insistent on sovere ign freedom of action he goes on to assert that the eus resistan ce to the use of force without authorization deprives the atlantic alliance of its special status and

countries and the possible use of european airports as transit points for us flights transpor ting abducted terrorist suspects while some observers argue that such issues do not rise to the level of threatening the broader transatlantic secu rity and economic rela tionship others are less sanguine they believe that these i ssues are feeding the public perception that the united states and europe longer share the same values in the longer term they worry that this perception will cause leaders on both sides of the atlantic to question whether the benefits of the alliance outweigh the constraints it imposes many also fear that as ch differences proliferate younger american and european policymakers farther removed from world war ii and the cold war will not share the same conviction as previous genera tions about the need for close and intertwined political and strategic transatlantic relationship others contend that although europe may be looking increasingly outward it does not share us global concerns to the sa extent the eu is primarily focused on its own neighborhood the middle east and north africa as well as russia and the caucasus developments in asia how ever remain of lesser concern in large part because europe unlike the united states does not ve the same military commitments there and the rise of china the stability of the korean peninsula and indiapakistan relations may in creasingly preoccupy washington19 some analysts also maintain that europe remains largely preoccupied with its own internal transformation and even thoug h european officials claim to recognize the increasing threat posed to european societies by islamist terrorism or wmd they still do not perceive the threat to be quite as severe they believe such notions

reasons outlined bove for current useuropean frictions and relationship in flux are also driving the emerging debate on the future of the transatlantic partnership th question arises however what forces might transform this theoretical debate into true polic debate and prompt serious and sustained us consideration about reorganizing or reinvigorating the tran satlantic relationship some suggest that it may simply be natu ral evolution following from the structural changes since the end of the cold war and the events of september 11 others posit that much will depend on the perspective and vision of leaders on both sides of the atlantic and the degree to which they ar supported by their respective legislatures and publics in embarking on new course the extent to which each side perceives the need for new course will also likely depend on future events in particular if another catastrophic terro rist event occurs for example some suggest that terrorist attack in europe similar in scale to the 2001 attacks on the united states might prompt change in european thinking about the use of force and help bridge certain transatlantic gaps other pundits including many critics of the bush administration say driving force may be the decline in us influence in the world and the growing realization that the united states cannot ma nage all aspects of all conflicts alone for the purpose of analysis the following five possible options offer different scenarios for the future transatlantic partnership they focus primarily on the political and strategic dimensions of useurop ean relations despite some trade and economic frictions it would be nearly impo ssible and in neither sides interest to actively pursue less robust trad and investment relations thus the options below touch upon the economic aspects of the partne rship only to the extent that they have implications for transatlantic trade and investment additionally the options are meant to be illustrative guideposts in considering the future direction of us european relations rather than definitive exhaustive predictions or stark choices they should be viewed along spectrum the future transatla ntic relationship in reality will likely evolve over time and fall somewhere between any two given options or combine different elemen ts from more than one scenario although these selected options are pres ented as choices for the united states the future shape of the useuropean re lationship is not solely us decision much will also depend on outside circ umstances european assessments about europes new strategic reality and the value of its partnership with the united states as well as on the eus evolution and its future ambitions option 1 deemphasize europe this option essentially represents an end to the political and strategic transatlantic alliance as it exists today although the vast trade and investment relationship would remain intact those who support such political and strategic distancing do not necessarily advocate return to american isolationism or strictly unilateralist us path rather they claim that us interests would be best served by concentrating us efforts on developing new strategic partnerships with emerging powers such as russia china and india that may be more capable and better suitedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32577crs14 20 elements of the description of option 1 are drawn from thomas donnelly learning to live without europe american ente rprise institute may 2004 and thomas pm barnett forget europe how about these allies washington

weapons proliferation and the problems of the gr eater middle east unlike during the cold war europe is not the central front of such struggles but currently still constrains the us freedom of action at times propone nts of this option assert that it would not preclude the united states from working closely with european partners like the british whom they view as sharing us goals and who are able to make serious military contributions nato may even remain as an organization but would effectively be downgraded into forum fo r discussion rather than decisionmaking20 pros one possible benefit for the united states of this option is that it would free washington from transatlantic decisionma king constraints this applies both to the broad political level and on the nato military level some analysts suggest for example that pressure from the european allies to gain authorization for the use of force in iraq needlessly delayed u s intervention there in 2003 in addition many us officials are increasingly frustrated with natos cumbersome often timeconsuming decisionmaking procedures that require consensus and are viewed by some as an impediment to quick action21 deemphasizing the european allies as the automatic first partner of choice would also allow the united states more latitude in crafting responses to global trouble spots and potential partners such as russia or china may have fewer qualms about the use of military force others suggest that us deemphasis of europe may force the european allies to take more responsibility for ensuring their own security and provide the needed impetus for real european defense capability improvements22 cons skeptics argue that the european allies remain the most feasible partners for the united states in tackling global and regional challenges the benefits derived from the alliances institutional archit ecture and the well honed habits of political and military cooperation shoul d not be underestimated nd cannot necessarily be duplicated elsewhere especially with c ountries that do not share the same us commitment to freedom democracy human rights and the rule of law23 u s alignment with states that are not highly regarded for their respect of human rights may also further erode us credibility in areas of the world such as the middle east where it must be reclaimed in order to fulf ill us strategic goals in addition it is unclear to what extent countries like ru ssia or china would be reliable or even receptive partners and if such countries were receptive they would most likely expect some concessions in return which could conflict with ot her us interests india for example might demand less robust uspakistani relationship even though the united states views pakistan as an important

this could negatively affect the us european economic relationship in the longer term over time more distant political relationship could infect the econo mic partnership with growing distrust thereby complicating efforts to resolve useu trade disputes or to sustain useu cooperation in multilatera l trade negotiations similarly some fear this option would also lead to an erosion of close u seuropean cooperation against terrorism especially in terms of intelligencesharing this option would also likely encourage the eu to develop as political c ounterweight to the united states24 option 2 maintain the status quo in this option the united states would continue to muddle through with the european allies and maintain an uneasy tensionfilled partnership both sides of the atlantic would continue to proclaim rhetorically that th useuropean partnership is irreplaceable and decisionmaking by consensus would remain the norm in nato however disagreements nd differences would likely persist pros by maintaining the essential struct ures of the atlantic alliance this option hedges against future strategic uncertainties particularly resurgent russia and leaves open the possibility of the alliance eventually evolving into more useful tool to combat global challenges thereby relieving the us security burden supporters of preserving the status quo point out that despite the current difficulties the transatlantic partnershi p continues to function and produces tangible benefits for example nato has taken over the international security assistance force isaf in afghanistan and has been wo rking to extend isaf beyond kabul and kunduz to promote stability nd reconstruction in other pa rts of the country us european law enforcement efforts against terrorism have remained robust despite the tensions over iraq and natoeu coopera tion is enabling the eu to take on bigger role in ensuring peace and security in the balkans maintaining the status quo would also provide us policymakers time to pursue any changes stepbystep as well as time to assess the eus development and the degree to which eu member states are able to bridge the gap between their aspirations and capabilities25 cons some analysts assert however that blindly preserving the status quo will inevitably waste policymakers time and energy as they seek to manage the constant bickering among the allies on the us side this may detract from us efforts to tackle other more immediate challenges that threaten us interests new disputes could arise at any time that could further destabilize and erode the relationship and the effort needed to maintain the status quo may still constrain us policies as leaders try to accommodate the need within the alliance for consensus or attempt to avoi d useu policy confrontations26httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32577crs16 27 for more detailed analysis of this point see crs report rs21510 natos decision making procedure by paul gallis 28 also see the

the willing the coalitions of the willing concept for the transatlantic alliance has been debated since at least the mid1990s the balkans problem prompted debate about the use of nato for socalled out of ar ea or nonarticle 5 operations that were not of collective defense nature seve ral observers at the time suggested that decisionmaking unanimity should not be re quired for such missions because of the absence of an overwhelming threat in whic h the demonstration of alliance solidarity was crucial since then some argue th at even though the alliance has remained wedded to consensus decisionmaking this does not obligate every member state to contribute militarily to given nato opera tion and therefore coalitions of the willing exist in practice the bush administration has conte nded that nato military actions should mostly be conducted by coa litions of the willing which would enable the united states to pursue action with those allies th at agree upon the threat and have the means to counter it formalizing this option with in the alliance may tail changing alliance decisionmaking procedures and moving away from the consensus decisionmaking principle27 more broadly for the transatlantic relationship coalitions of the willing approach would essentially mean that the united states and its european partners would cooperate where possible nd agree to disagree on contentious issues pros proponents believe this concept would help min imize transatlantic quarrels and free the united states from eu ropean constraints on issues upon which agreement proves elusive bitterness would be defused by acknowledging that differences on certain international problems were irreconciable cooperation would proceed on those challenges in which the united states and the europeans could agree on the threats posed and the best ways to address them on the nato decisionmaking level this option would allow the united states to avail itself of european assistance from those allies willing and able to provide it thereby helping relieve some us security burdens although not all supporters view it as more realistic and effective option especially given the useuropean military capabilities gap and the lack of significant numbers of rapidly deployable european forces they claim it might also give individual european partners more free dom of action to join with the united states and as result it may weaken the development of an eu caucus prenegotiated comm on eu positions within nato28 cons skeptics assert that this option on the broader transatla ntic partnership level would not produce coordinated stra tegy with which to manage the full spectrum of global challenges and could result in allies working at crosspurposes or feed useu rivalry

taking prewar hit angeles times february 19 2003by european allies as us attempt to keep europe weak and divided because the united states would invariably try to sway certain eu member states to its point of view some observers assert that this is exactly what happened with the iraq issue which split eu member states between t hose that supported washingtons approach and those that opposed it and was one reas on why the transatlantic dispute over iraq was so divisive in this view pursuing coalitions of the willing could increase rather than decrease transatlantic tensions29 on the nato level us critics and many europeans believe that this option would essentially signal the end of the alliances consensus decisionmaking approach this in turn would undermine alliance solidarity by weakening the long held principle that all members have an equal stake in alliance security and that the sum of the alliance is greater than its part s in this view alliance consensus connotes certain international legitimiz ation of policy especia lly if it involves the use of military force over the longer term they worry it could weaken the transatlantic link and decouple north american and european security in addition the coalitions of the willing approach may not give the european allies sufficient incentives to significantly improve their defense capab ilities because they would be reluctant to be viewed as toolbox that the united states uses as it pleases option 4 division of labor like the coalitions of the willing concept this option has been the subject of considerable debate on both sides of the atlantic for some time this option focuses mostly on the militarysecurity dimensions of the transatlantic relationship several variations exist although most put the natoeu relationship at the core of any transatlantic division of labor some analysts have proposed division based largely on geography the european allies andor the eu would essentially bear the primary burden for maintaining security within eur ope and on its periphery including in the balkans and perhaps for managing small crises in the maghreb or in africa meanwhile the united states would assume responsibility for handling international crises elsewhere in the world especially in the persian gulf and in asia in such geographic division europe would most lik ely desire and the united states would most likely insist on joint responsibility within the nato context for managing crises involving russia and the caucasus the difficulties in drawing such stark geographic dividing lines however have led many to favor instead functional division the eu ropean allies andor the eu would concentrate on lower end humanitarian assistance crisis management and civilian recons truction tasks while the united states and perhaps more capable allies such as the uk and france would undertake higher end combat activities and peace enforcement operations additional permuta tions of the division of labor approach that combine different geographic and func tional elements may also be found in the security literature for example one an alyst has proposed construction in which the europeans prepare

the world with the united states30 pros supporters argue that functional division of labor already exists in practice to large extent us forces have been assuming the bulk of higherend warfighting tasks eu military missions to date have focuse d on lowerend stability and humanitarian operations moreover the eu is mu ch better equipped given its full range of political and economic tools to undertake peacekeeping and reconstruction tasks than is the us military by acknowledging that the united states and europe have differe nt strengths this option w ould make better use of these comparative advantages in more coordi nated strategy propone nts claim that this is the most feasible option because it would increase european burdensharing while lowering unreal us expectations for significant european military capability improvements especially given the dim prospects for any substantial nearterm increases in european defense budgets and the already wide useuropean capab ility gap reducing us expectations of eu capabilities particularly for highintensity conflicts might also remove conti nuous source of useuropean friction moreover this option would preserve th transatlantic partnership nato would likely remain intact serving as continued symbol of alliance solidarity and also as an insurance policy for europe nato coul d also be used to manage the division of labor between the european allies andor the eu and the united states cons rather than increasing burdensharing between the two sides of the atlantic critics argue that functional division of labor would institutionalize inequality because american forces would be left with the much more dangerous and difficult military tasks they worry it w ould ultimately undermin alliance solidarity as us soldiers were repeatedly put in harms way while european forces handled the relatively easier and less conflictintense task s associated with peace stabilization and reconstruction furtherm ore this option would likely do little to encourage the allies to enhance their defense capabilities if geographic division of labor were pursued in which europe had primary res ponsibility for maintaining its own security opponents say this would only serve to reinforce european inwardness and encourage an abdication of european responsibility fo r global security finally critics assert that useuropean military division of labor be it geographical or functional does not provide coordinated st rategy to manage global pr oblems in their view it would do little to bridge the political and policy gaps between the two sides of the atlantic on range of issues such as the middle east peace process or iran nor would it adequately addre ss useuropean differences over the use of

subcomm ittee hearing renewing the transatlantic partnership view fro m the united states 108th congress 1st session june 11 2003option 5 new bargain as with the previous two options devising new strategic bargain for the transatlantic rela tionship has been proposed by comm itted atlanticists for many years initially such proposals were made as ways to keep the alliance and especially nato in business in light of the demise of the soviet threat with the reemergence of serious useuropean fricti ons many variations of this option have been offered recently to help put the relationship on better footing most of these proposals place the natoeu relationship at the core of renegotiated partnership and advocate more equal sharing of responsibilities both within and outside of europe other common elements often include us commitment to strong and coherent europe and european commitment to building the eu as partner rather than rival to the united states us pledge to give the european allies larger decisionmaking role in exchange for eu ropean pledge to do more to help ensure peace and security beyond europes borders and an increased european understanding that multilateral so lutions often require the cred ible threat of force in exchange for us recognition of the benefits that multilateralism may bring in terms of helping to legitimize us policies internationally politically for new bargain to work dvocates believe that new us european deals or at least some sort of accommodation would have to be struck on host of contentious issues including for example iraq the israelipalestinian conflict efforts to curb radical islam and transform the broader middle east iran and the status of number of internationa l treaties such as the kyoto protocol and the international criminal court milita rily in order to promote fuller sharing of tasks and responsibil ities many believe that new bargain must also include enhanced european defense capabilities especially for higherend tasks and greater us recognition that crisis management and postconflict reconstruction skills are equally important one analyst sums up his view of new transatlantic security deal as one in which americans learn to peacekeep and europeans reequip to fight31 an extremely ambitious new bargain could also seek to set up new institutionalarrangements for the transatlantic commercial relationship some us and european officials might support creating transatlan tic free trade agreement to both contain trade disputes and bolster u seuropean political cooperation pros supporters assert that this opti on would help ensure stronger and deeper transatlantic partnership that would better serve us global political and security interests and protect ongoing close useuropean economic relations establishing the parameters of such new bargain would likely entail comprehensive useuropean strategic dialogue which would help guarantee greater complementarity if not commonality of policies and decrease transatlantic frictions proponents believe this option would promote more equitable burdenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32577crs20 32 see tertrais op cit sharing encourage the european allies to build more robust military capabilities and discourage the development of useu rivalry they claim that the european allies would not be required to match us military capabilities exactly which is viewed as an increasingly impossible task but the allies need to be able to do more both on their own and with us forces cons critics are skeptical about the rea listic prospects for reaching us european political agreement on such ne w bargain and about the degree to which it could be implemented in practice this option would likely require the united states to relinquish some decisionmaking authority within the alliance furthermore it would also probably require certain u s compromises on issues of particular importance to europe such as climate change or international law and us re commitment to the pursuit of multilateral solutions and international institutions some analysts doubt however that the ited states would be rewarded for such concessions that could constrain us polic ies and slow decisionmaking given that in their view europe will remain unable to squeeze more money for defense out of alreadystrapped european budgets they so note that the eu may be skeptical that the united states would keep up its side of the bargain and could view it as us scheme to keep eu ambitions on tight leash others note that the chances of reaching an accommodation with europe on issues such as iraq would be complicated because differences still exist within the eu and among european allies assessment of possible options as noted earlier the options discussed are illustrative guideposts meant to facilitate consideration of the future shap of the transatlantic relationship each potential option contains both pitfalls and promises for the united states however the bulk of the analysis suggests that maintaining the useuropean political and strategic relationship in some form would continue to offer the united states certain tangible benefits and serve to buttress at least some us foreign and economic policies all of the options with the possible exception of maintaining the status quo would require serious and sustained u seuropean dialogue and consultation this would also be true for deemphasizing europe in order to insulate the trade and investment relationship from being negatively affected by any political distancing the reality of the future shape of the transatlantic relationship may be most likely to surface somewhere between any of the two given options and combine different elements for example the multitude of security challenges facing both the united states and europe argue that neither side can do all and that there is bound to be some sort of division of labor especi ally given current differences in us and european military strengths at the same time politics and ambitions on both sides of the atlantic impede stark division of labor because neither the united states nor europe would want to relinquish segments of its security interests to the other32 thus these factors could prompt new barg ain to be reached at the political level entailing perhaps statement of useuropean solidarity in confronting global and regional challenges and an ela boration of joint policies to address issues such as iran or the middle east peace process while division of labor is practiced
