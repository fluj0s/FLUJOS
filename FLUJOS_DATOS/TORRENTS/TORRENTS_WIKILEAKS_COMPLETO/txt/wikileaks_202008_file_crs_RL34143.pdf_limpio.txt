intelligence surveillance ac t of 1978 was enacted in response both to the committee to study government operations with respect to intelligence activities church committee revelations with regard to past abuses of electronic surveillance for national security purposes and to the somewhat uncertain state of the law on the subject in creating statutory framework for the use of electronic surveillance to obtain foreign intelligence in formation the congress sought to strike balance between national security interests and civil liberties critical to an understanding of the fisa structure are its definitions of terms such as electronic surveillance and foreign intelligen ce information pl 11055 limits the construction of the term electronic rveillance so that it does not cover surveillance directed at person reasonably believed to be located outside the united states it also creates mechanism for acquisition without court order under certification by the director of national intelligence dni and the attorney general of foreign intelligence information concerning person reasonably believed to be outside the united states the protect am erica act provides for review by the foreign intelligence surveillance court fisc of the procedures by which the dni and the attorney general determine that such acquisitions do not constitute electronic surveillance in addition pl 11055 aut horizes the attorney general and the dni to direct person with access to the comm unications involved to furnish aid to the government to facilitate such acquisitions and provides means by which the legality of such directive may be revi ewed by the fisc petition review pool decision by judge of the fisc petition revi ew pool may be appealed to the foreign intelligence

s 1927 states that the short title of the law is the protect america act of 2007 sec 2 additional procedures for authorizing certain acquisitions of foreign intelligence information section 2 of the law contains its fi rst substantive provisions they are summarized in order below new section 105a of fisa c larification of electronic surveillance of persons outside the united states new section 105a of fisa as added by section 2 of pl 11055 states nothing in the definition of electronic surveillance under section 101f shall be construed to encompass surveillance directed at person reasonably believed to be located outside of the united states section 101f of fisa 50 usc 1801f sets forth the definition of electronic surveillance under the statute it provides f electronic surveillance means 1 the acquisition by an electronic mech anical or other surveillance device of the contents of any wire or radio co mmunication sent by or intended to be received by particular known united states person6 who is in the unitedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34143crs3 6 continued a1 2 or 3 of this section foreign power as defined in section 101a1 2 or 3 50 usc 1801a1 2 or 3 means 1 foreign government or any compone nt thereof whether or not recognized by the united states 2 faction of foreign nation or nati ons not substantially composed of united states persons 3 an entity that is openly acknowledged by foreign government or governments to be directed and controlled by such foreign government or governments 7 because new section 105a of fisa explicitly addresses electronic surveillance directed at person reasonably believed to be located outside the united states it would not appear to affect subsection 101f1 which deals with electronic surveillance of the contents of wire or radio communications acquired from an intentionally target ed us person within the united states under specified circumstances ectronic surveillance as defined in subsection 101f3 of fisa involves the inten tional acquisition of the contents of radio communications in specified circumstances where the sender and all the intended recipients to the communication are in the united states so it would not seem to be impacted by new section 105astates if the contents are acquired by intentionally targeting that united states person under circumstances in which person has reasonable expectation of privacy and warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes 2 the acquisition by an electronic mech anical or other surveillance device of the contents of any wire communication to or from person in the united states without the consent of any party thereto if such acquisition occurs in the united states but does not include the acquisiti on of those communications of computer trespassers that would be permissi ble under section 25112i of title 18 3 the intentional acquisition by an elect ronic mechanical or other surveillance device of the contents of any radi communication under circumstances in which person has reasonable expecta tion of privacy and warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes and if both the sender and all intended recipients are located within the united states or 4 the installation or use of an electronic mechanical or other surveillance device in the united states for monitoring to acquire information other than from wire or radio communication under circumstances in which person has reasonable expectation of privacy nd warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes to what extent would the new section 105a affect the scope of electronic surveillance as defined in section 101f of fisa absent the interpretation required by section 105a two of the four definitions of electronic surveillance under section 101f of fisa by their terms appear to be broad enough to encompass electronic surveillance directed at person abroad where the communications involved transcend us borders7 subsections 101f2 and f4 of fisa on their face appear to have th potential of reaching electronic surveillance of such communications targeted at pers on outside the united states in addition it might be argued that the language of subsection 101f4 might encompass the possibility of reaching some foreign to foreign communications in limitedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34143crs4 8 see greg miller the nation spy chief

communication means any communication while it is being carried by wire cable or other like connection furnished or operated by any person engaged as common carrier in provid ing or operating such facilities for the transmission of interstate or foreign communications it does not have separate definition of radio communication however subsection 101f4 of fisa appears to contemplate th at communications can be transmitted using technologies other wire or radio for example in title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act as amended 18 usc 251012 elect ronic communication includes other technologies under 2510 12 this term is defined to mean continuedcircumstances this would suggest that unde r fisa prior to the passage of section 105a of pl 11055 some interceptions dir ected at person abroad covered by the language of these subsections might have been regarded by the fisc as requiring court authorization8 in pertinent part electronic surveilla nce as defined by subsection 101f2 covers acquisition of the contents of wire communications to or from person in the united states where the acquisition occurs within the united states and party to the communication has consented to the interception unlike subsection 101f1 there is express requirement that the person in the united states be known that he or she be united states person or that he or she be intentionally targeted by the electronic surveillance to the extent that an electroni c surveillance under subsection 101f2 intercepts communications between persons in the united states it would not be impacted by section 105a of fisa as dded by pl 11055 nor would section 105a affect electronic surveillance targeted at person within the united states however to the extent that the language in s ubsection 101f2 might encompass interception of communications between person in the united states and one or more parties outside the united states where the surveillance is targeted at person outside the united states section 105a would seem to restrict the previous reach of the definition of electronic surv eillance in section 101f2 subsection 101f4 define s electronic surveillance under fisa to include the installation or use of an electronic mechanical or other surveillance device in the united states for monitoring to acqui re information other than from wire or radio

permanent select committee on intelligence the senate select committee on intelligence and the house and senate judiciary committees regarding incidents of noncompliance by an element of the intelligence community with guidelines or procedures for determining that the acquis ition of foreign intelligence authorized by the dni and the attorney general under section 105b concerns persons reasonably sic to continuedexpectation of privacy and warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes this subsection does not explicitly address the location of the parties to the communication or the location of the acquisition of the information involved thus by its terms it could conceivably be interpreted to cover some communications between parties in the united states between party in the united states and party outside the united states or between parties abroad if th other requirements of the subsection were satisfied the restrictions in this section are twofold the information must be acquired other than from wire or radio communication and the circumstances of the acquisition must be such that person would have reasonable expectation of privacy and warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes to the extent th at electronic surve illance under subsection 101f4 of fisa could have been or has been directed at pers on or persons abroad prior to the enactment of pl 11055 new section 105a may also have the effect of limiting the scope of this subsection of th definition of elect ronic surveillance as it was previously interpreted new section 105b of fisa additional procedure for authorizing certain acquisitions concerning persons located outsid the united states new section 105ba of fisa permits the attorney general and the director of national intelligence for periods of up to one year to authorize acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning persons reasonably believed to be outside the united states if the attorney general and the dni determine based on the information provided to them that five crite ria have been met under these criteria the attorney general and the dni must certify that 1 there are reasonable procedures in pl ace for determining that the acquisition of foreign intelligence information under this section concerns persons reasonably believed to be located outside the united states10 and suchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34143crs6 10 continued be outside the united states 11 section 105ba1 states that the procedur for determining that the acquisition of foreign intelligence information under this section concerns persons reasonably believed to be located outside the united states are to be submitted to the fisc for review pursuant to section 105c of fisa there appears to be some ambiguity in the language of section 105b particularly as compared with section 105c as to what the procedures cover and what procedures are to be submitted to the fisc the phrasing of section 105ba1 on its face seems to require submission to the fisc only of reasonable procedures for determining that the acquisition of foreign intelligence in formation under this section concerns persons reasonably believed to be located outside the united states this is the only mention in section 105b of procedures being submitted to the fisc thus there is mention in section 105b of creation of or submission to the fisc of procedures upon which the government bases its determination that the acquisition does not constitute electronic surveillance however section 105c by its terms addr esses only the submission by the attorney general to the fisc of the procedures by wh ich the government determines that acquisitions conducted pursuant to section 105b do not constitute electronic surveillance making mention of the procedures referred to in s ection 105ba1 in light of this apparent inconsistency it is unclear what review if any the fisc is intended to give the procedures for determining that the acquisition of fo reign intelligence information under section 105b concerns persons reasonably believed to be loca ted outside the united states it is also not made clear in the language of either sec tion by whom the procedures to be reviewed by the fisc under section 105c are to be promulgated on the other hand section 105a provides that the definition of electronic surveillance shall not be construed to encompass surveillance directed at person reasonably believed to be located outside of the united states in light of this it might be argued that the procedures by which the dni and the attorney general determine whether an acquisition of foreign intelligence information under section 105b concerns persons reasonably believed to be located outside the unite d states could be regarded as part of the fiscs analysis as to whether the procedur to determine that the acquisitions under 105b constitute electronic surveillance are clearly erroneous 12 section 101h of fisa 50 usc 1801h defines minimization procedures for purposes of title i of fisa dealing with electronic surveillance to mean h minimization procedures with resp ect to electronic surveillance means 1 specific procedures which shall be adopted by the attorney general that are reasonably designed in light of the purpose and technique of the continuedprocedures will be subject to review of the court pursuant to section 105c of this act11 2 the acquisition does not constitute electronic surveillance3 the acquisition involves obtaining the foreign intelligence information from or with the assistance of communicati ons service provider custodian or other person including any officer employee ag ent or other specified person of such service provider custodian or other person who has access to communications either as they are transmitted or while they are stored or equipment that is being or may be used to transmit or store such communications 4 significant purpose of the acquisition is to obtain foreign intelligence information and 5 the minimization procedures to be used with respect to such acquisition activity meet the definition of minimi zation procedures under section 101h 12httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34143crs7 12 continued particular surveillance to minimize the acquisition and retention and prohibit the dissemination of nonpublicly available information concerning unconsenting united states persons consis tent with the need of the united states to obtain produce and disseminate foreign intelligence information 2 procedures that require that nonpublicly available information which is not foreign intelligence information as defined in subsection e1 of this section shall not be disseminated in manner that identifies any united states person without such pe rsons consent unless such persons identity is necessary to understand foreign intelligence information or assess its importance 3 notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2 procedures that allow for the retention and dissemination of information that is evidence of crime which has been is being or is about to be committed and that is to be retained or disseminated for law enforcement purposes and 4 notwithstanding paragraphs 1 2 and 3 with respect to any electronic surveillance approved pursu ant to section 1802a of this title procedures that require that cont ents of any communication to which united states person is party shall be disclosed disseminated or used for any purpose or retained for longer than 72 hours unless court order under section 1805 of this title is obtained or unless the attorney general determines that the information indica tes threat of death or serious bodily harm to any person it may be noted that while section 105b of fi sa appears to be located in title i of fisa which deals with electronic surveillance th dni and the attorney general under section 105ba2 of fisa are expressly required to certify that the acquisitions under section 105b do not constitute electronic surveillance similarly the minimization procedures in section 101h of fisa 50 usc 1801h deal explicitly with minimization in the context of electronic surveillance while unde r subsection 105ba5 of fisa the dni and the attorney general must certify that the mini mization procedures to be used with respect to such acquisitions meet the definition of minimization procedur under section 101h this seems likely to be intended to mean th at the minimization procedures applicable to such acquisitions must set parallel standards to those applicable to electronic surveillance under the minimization procedures in sec tion 101h of fisa 50 usc 1801h 13 protect america act of 2007 pl 11055 sec 105ba 121 stat 552 august 5 2007 hereinafter pl 11055 14 pl 11055 sec

criteria have been satisfied must be in the form of certification under oath supported by affidavit of appropriate officials in the national security field appointed by the president by and with the advice and consent of the senate or the head of any agency of the intelligence community where imminent government action is require d the determination must be reduced to certification as soon as possible within 72 hours after the determination is made13 t h certification need not identify specific f acilities places premises or property at which the acquisition will be directed14 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34143crs8 15 pl 11055 sec 105bc 16 pl 11055 sec 105bd 17 in the context of the subsection 105bd the reference to such procedures might be seen to be susceptible of two possible interpretati ons perhaps the more likely and more limited interpretation would be that this may be reference to the applicable minimization procedures referenced earlier in the subsection alternatively more expansive view might interpret this as reference to the applicab minimization procedures plus the relevant certification including the r easonable procedures in place for determining that the acquisition of foreign intelligence information under this section concerns persons reasonably believed to be located outside the ited states or oral instructions regarding the acquisition at issue 18 section 108 of fisa 50 usc 1808 provides 1808 report of attorney general to congressional committees limitation on authority or responsibility of information gathering

sition under section 105b that such acquisition does not constitute electronic surveillance the reporting requirement in section 105bd may be intended to direct the dni and the ttorney general to

foreign intelligence information concerning persons reasonably believed to be outside the united states may be acquired at least in part from persons including us persons who ar located within the

their effective date unless the attorney general determines immediate action is required and notifies the committees immediately of such mini mization procedures and the reason for their becoming

under that section to be carried out in accordance with the attorney generals certification and applicable minimization requirements and directs the attorney general to assess co mpliance with such procedures and report his assessments to the house and senate intelligence committees under the provisions of section 108a of fisa section 102a4 which permits the ttorney general to direct specified communication common carrier to provide information facilities or technical assistance to the government needed to ca rry out the electronic surveillance involved and to compensate that communication common carrier at the prevailing rate for its aid is structurally similar to section 105b and f however subsections 105be and gi permit the attorney general and the dni to direct person rather than

easonable procedures in place for determining that the acquisition of foreign intelligence in formation under this section concerns persons reasonably believed to be located outside the united states and requires such procedures to be subject to review of the fisc pursuant to section 105c of this act see footnote 11 supra for further discussion of the seeming ambiguities in the statutory language

be fore the petition review pool of the same court and permit both the government and the recipient of the directive to appeal that courts decision the authority to challeng the legality of such

the government to target for collection international communi cations into or out of the united states where there is probable cause to believe that one of the communicants is member or agent of qaeda or an asso ciated terrorist organization as result of these orders any electronic surveillanc that was occurring as part of the terrorist surveillance program will now be conducted subject to the approval of the foreign intelligence surveillance court42 question may arise as to whether ne w section 105as interpretation of the definition of electronic surveillan ce under fisa might impact the fiscs jurisdiction over some or all of the interceptions to which the attorney general referred under section 103a of fisa 50 usc 1803a the chief justice of the united states sh all publicly designate 11 district court judges from seven of the united states j udicial circuits of whom fewer than 3 shall reside within 20 miles of the dist rict of columbia who shall constitute court which shall have jurisdiction to hear applications for and grant orders approving electronic surveillance anywhere within the united states under the procedures set forth in this chapter except that judge designated under this subsection shall hear the same applica tion for electronic surveillance under this chapter which has been denied previously by another judge designated under this subsection section 102b of fisa 50 u sc 1802b provides that applications for court order under title i of fisa 50 usc 1801 et seq are authorized if the president has by written authorization empowered the attorney general to approve applications to the court having jurisdiction under section 1803 of this title and judge to whom an application is made may notwithstanding any other law grant an order in conformity with section 1805 of this title approving electronic surveillance of foreign power or an agent of foreign power for the purpose of obtaining foreign intelligence information except that the court shall not have ju risdiction to grant any order approving electronic surveillance directed solely as described in paragraph 1a of subsection of this section unless such surveillance may involve the acquisition of communications of any united states person the answer to the jurisdictional questi on raised above would seem to depend on whether those interceptions were dir ected at the communications of person reasonably believed to be locat ed outside the united states if so then by virtue of section 105a such interceptions would not be construed to fall within the definition of electronic surveillance under fisa and therefore review of the underpinnings of such interceptions would not be within the fiscs jurisdiction in connection with an application to authorize electronic surveillance if treated instead as acquisitionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34143crs16 43 section 105ca of fisa as added by pl 11055 sec 3 44 section 105bh of fisa as added by pl 11055 sec 2 45 section 105ba5 of fisa as added by sec 2 of pl 11055 for further discussion of minimization procedures in s ection 105ba5 see footnote 12 supra and accompanying text under section 105f of fisa 50 usc 1805f in approving an application for electronic surveillance under fisa an fisc judge must find in part that the proposed minimization procedures applicable to that rveillance meet the definition of minimization procedures under section 101 h of fisa 50 usc 1801h in authorizing an acquisition under section 105b the dni and the attorney general must certify in writing under oath in part that the minimization pr ocedures to be used with respect to such acquisition activity meet the definition of minimization procedures under section 101h 46 section 104 of fisa 50 usc 1804 which deals with application for fisc court orders authorizing electronic surveillance requi res eleven categories of detailed information to be submitted by federal office in writing under oath or affirmation to an fisc judge each application must be approved by the ttorney general based upon his finding that the application satisfies the criteria and requirement s set forth in title i of fisa section 105 of fisa 50 usc 1805 sets out the findings that fisc judge must make in approving such an applicationunder new section 105b of fisa then the fisc would seem to be limited to reviewing under clearly erroneous sta ndard the general pr ocedures under which the director of national intelligence dni and the attorney general would make determinations that acquisitions did not constitute elect ronic surveillance43 and judges of the fisc petition review pool w ould have jurisdiction to consider petitions challenging the legality of directives to persons to furnish aid to the government to accomplish those acquisitions44 implicit in the previous discussion is the question what impact if any any possible narrowing of the interpretation of the definition of electronic surveillance under fisa might have upon the scope of acquisitions under new section 105b of fisa in other words if an interception of communications dir ected toward person reasonably believed to be located outside the united states does not constitute electronic surveillance for pur poses of fisa regardless of where the other parties to the communication may be located or whet her some or all of those other parties may be us persons could so or all such intercepti ons be deemed acquisitions under the provisions of section 105b for this to be the case it would appear that the interception would have to be authorized by the dni and the attorney general under secti on 105b of fisa to acquire foreign intelligence information concerning persons reasonably believed to be outside the united states and would have to satisfy the five criteria set forth in section 105ba including the use of minimization procedures45 if these requirements are met then it appears that some communications to which us persons located within the united states might be parties could be intercepted for periods of up to one year without court order under section 105b this contrasts markedly with the deta iled information to be provided by the government to the fisc in an application for court order for electronic surveillance under section 104 of fisa 50 usc 180446 and the level of fisc review provided for such applications to the ex tent that new secti on 105a circumscribeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34143crs17 47 see footnote 6 supra for the definition of foreign power under section 101a1 2 or 3 of fisathe previous interpretation of electroni c surveillance as fined under section 101f of fisa 50 usc 1801f it could be argued that this might significantly diminish the degree of judicial review to which such interceptions might have heretofore been entitled on the other hand if the interpretation of the definition of electronic surveillance contem plated in new section 105a of fisa is consistent with prior practice then this concern w ith respect to section 105as impact would appear to be eliminated somewhat closer parallel might be dr awn between the statutory structure for acquisitions contemplated in section 105b and that for electronic surveillance under section 102 of fisa 50 usc 1802 th latter section permits the president through the attorney general to authorize electronic surveillance for up to one year without court order if the attorney ge neral certifies in writin g under oath that the electronic surveillance is so lely directed at the acquisition of the contents of communications transmitted by means of communications used exclusively between or among foreign powers as defined in s ection 1801a1 2 or 3 of this title47 or the acquisition of technical intellig ence other than the spoken communications of individuals from property or premises under the open and exclusive control of such foreign power in addition the atto rney general must certify that there is substantial likelihood that the surveillance will acquire the contents of any communication to which united states pe rson is party and that the proposed minimization procedures with respect to such surveillance meet the definition of minimization procedures under s ection 1801h of this title and he must comply with reporting requirements regarding those minimization procedures subsection 102b of fisa denies the fisc jurisdiction to grant any order approving electronic surveillance directed solely at the acquisition of communications used exclusively between or among such foreign powers or the acquisition of such technical intelligen ce from property or premises under the exclusive and open control of such foreign powers unless such surveillance may involve the acquisition of communica tions of any united states person section 105b provides the fisc similar jurisd iction if an acquisition involves the communications of united states person again if the interpretation of the definition of electronic surv eillance contemplated in new section 105a of fisa is consistent with prior practice then th is concern regarding section 105as effect would appear to be eliminated to the extent that any intentional interceptions of communications which were previously deemed to be covered by th definition of electr onic surveillance under fisa are now excluded from that defin ition another question which may arise is whether any of those interceptions may now be found to fall within the general prohibition against intentional inter ception of wire oral or electronic communications under title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of 1968 as amended 18 usc 2511 under 18 usc 25112f electronic surveillance as defined in section 101 of the foreign intelligence surveillance acthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34143crs18 48 if there are any types of intentional inte rceptions of communications previously covered by fisas definition of electronic surve illance which may now be prohibited under 18 usc 2511 this in turn might give rise to the question whether if the president were to carry out such interceptions under an assertion of his constitutional authority under article ii the application of title iiis prohib ition to those interceptions would be found by court to be unconstitutional or whether the application of this prohib ition to such interceptions would withstand constitutional scrutiny cf in re sealed case 310 f 3d 717 742 746 us foreign intell surveillance ct rev 2002 49 this appears to be reference to secti on 105bof fisa as added by pl11055 sec 2
