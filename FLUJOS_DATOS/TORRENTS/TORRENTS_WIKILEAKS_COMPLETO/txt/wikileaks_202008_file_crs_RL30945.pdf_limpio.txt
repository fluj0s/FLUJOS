specialist on the congress government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30945house and senate rules of procedure comparison summary more differences than similarities emerge when comparing selected house and senate rules of procedure for referring legislation to committees and for scheduling raising and considering measures on the floor while the house uses four calendars u nion house private discharge the senate only employs two calendars legis lative and executive the houses system of special days for considering certain type s of measures eg district days has equivalent in the senate in making scheduling decisions the speaker typically consults only with majority party leaders and selected representatives whereas the senate majority leader confers broadly with minority party leaders and interested senators the speakers dual position as leader of the ma jority party and the houses presiding officer gives him more authority to govern floor proceedings than the senates presiding officer while debate time is always restricted in the house individual senators generally have the right to unlimited debate most noncontroversial measures are appr oved by suspension of the rules in the house and by unanimous consent in th senate floor cons ideration of major bills is generally governed by special rules in the house and by complex unanimous consent agreements in the senate the house typically meets in the committee of the whole to consider major legislation such committee exists in the senate the house consid ers and amends legislation in more structured manner eg by section or title than the sena in addition while germaneness of amendments is required in the house it is mandated only in four instances in the senate rollcall votes can be requested at almost any t ime in the senate but only after completing voice or division vote in the house because the senate often recesses instead of adjourning at the end of the day senate legislative days can continue for several calendar days by contrast the house routinely adjourns at the end of each legislative dayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30945contents introduction 1 r f r r l f l g i s l t i n 1s c h d u l i n

comparis on of house and sena procedures 13httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30945house and senate rules of procedure comparison introduction house and senate rules of procedure are largely function of the number of members comprising each chamber in the house structured legislative process and strict adherence to the bodys rules and precedents have resulted from the need to manage how 435 represen tatives make decisions by contrast the senates smaller membership has broug ht about less formal policymaking process and more flexible approach to the chambers standing rules while individual representatives must typically yield to th majority will of the house the senate usually accommodates the interests of individual senators this report compares selected house nd senate rules of procedure for various stages of the legislative process referral of legislation to committees scheduling and calling up measures and floor consideration attemp t is made to present comprehensive discussion of how both chambers operate referral of legislation in both the house and senate the presid ing officer see presiding officer and recognition practices section refers ne wlyintroduced legislation and measures passed by the other chamber to the appr opriate standing co mmittee u pon advice from the parliamentarian the presiding officer bases referral decisions on the chambers rules and precedents for subject matter jurisdiction legislation passed by the other body usually receives floor consideration without reference to committee if there already is compan ion bill on calendar see discussion of calendars in next section the house changed its referral rule rule x ii clause 2 at the beginning of the 104th congress this change was aimed at reducing the number of measures referred to more than one committee commonly called multiple referrals the rules change eliminated joint referrals type of multiple referral where measure is simultaneously referred to two or more committees under the new rule the speaker designates committee of primary jurisdiction based on the committee jurisdictions itemized in rule x when referring measures to more than one committee in practice two types of multip referrals can take place if the speaker first selects primary committee sequential referral the measure is referred to one committee then to another and so on the speaker can establish time limits for each committees consideration and split referral specifically designated portions of measure are referred to one or more committees in the 108th congress househttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30945crs2 1 treaties and nominations submitted by the pres ident also are referred to committees to be studied and reported this report does not discuss procedures governing senate consideration of treaties and nominations the discussion of these procedures in us congress senate riddicks senate procedure sdoc 10128 101st cong 2nd sess washington gpo 1992 1608 prules were changed to allow the speaker to not designate primary committee under exceptional circumstances house committees ofte n develop memorandums of understanding sometimes referred to as letters of agreement which explain an agreement between committees about how to divide jurisdic tion over specific policy issues these memorandums are sent to the speaker in the form of letters from the involved committee chairmen and are sometimes printed in the congressional record the memorandums seek to advise the speak er on referral deci sions where committee jurisdictions are unclear or overlapping under the senates referral rule rule xv ii paragraph 1 legi slation is referred to the committee which has jurisdiction over subject matter which predominates in the measure sometimes referred to as predominant jurisdiction1 senate rule xxv lists the subjects for which the sta nding committees are responsible senate rule xiv requires that measures be read twice on different legislative days see adjournment and legislative days section before being referred to committee most bills and joint resolutions however are considered as having been read twice and are referred to committee upon introduction under rule xiv when senator demands two readings and there is objecti on to the measures second reading the measure is placed directly on the calenda r of business see next section without reference to committee three types of multiple referrals joint sequential and split are allowed in the senate in practice measures are referred to multiple committees by unanimous consent under the senates standing rules rule xvii graph 3 the senate majority and minority leaders can make joint leadership motion to jointly or sequentially refer legislation to multiple committees however this rule has never been used since its adoption by the senate in 1977 in general multiple referrals are more common in the house than in the senate scheduling and raising measures calendars measures reported from house committees except for private measures are referred to either the union or house calendar rule xiii clause 1a in general the union calendar receives all measures which would be considered in the committee of the whole such as tax au thorization and appr opriations measures all other public bills and public resolutions are referred to the house calendar rule xiii clause 1a2 the house also maintains private calendar rule xiii clause 1a3 and rule xv clause 5 fo r measures of private character affectinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30945crs3 individual persons or entities and calendar of motions to discharge committees rule xiii clause 1b and rule xv clause 2 from further consideration of particular measures see legislation blocked in committee section for discussion of the discharge motion the senate only has two cal endars the calendar of business commonly called the legislative calendar and the executive calendar nominations and treaties are referred to the executive calendar legislation reported from committee are referred to the calendar of business or placed on this calendar by unanimous consent as discussed earlier rule xi v provides procedure for placing measures on the calendar of business w ithout reference to committee measure commonly becomes eligible for floor consideration in both chambers once it has been placed on calendar the calendar number assigned to measure indicates the chronol ogical order the measure was placed on the calendar not the order for floor consideration calling up measures the scheduling of legislation for h ouse floor action is the fundamental prerogative of the speaker individual representatives cannot easily circumvent influence or reverse leader ship decisions about which measures should come to the floor the most significant and controversia l measures are usually made in order for floor consideration by special rule pa ssed by majority vote of the house see next section less controve rsial measures are often ra ised under the suspension of the rules procedure rule xv clause 1 every monday tuesday and wednesday and during the last six days of session on these suspension daysand at other times by unanimous consent or by special rule the speaker may recognize member to move to suspend the rules and pass measure suspension motion must be approved by twoth irds of those present and voting the house may also agree to take up measure by unanimous consent but does so much less frequently than the senate house rules set aside specific days of the month when bills from the private calendar always the first tuesday rule xv clause 5a also the third tuesday rule xv clause 5b1 at the speake rs discretion can be brought up for floor consideration legislation involving the di strict of columbia can be raised on the second and fourth mondays of each month rule xv clause 4 sometimes referred to as district days the calendar wednesday procedure rule xv clause 6 reserves wednesdays for the call of committees during which time committees can raise reported bills that have not been granted special rule or otherwise made privileged for floor action in today s house calendar wednesday is usually dispensed with by unanimous consent all these procedures require simple majority for passage except for correction m easures which require threefifths vote certain privileged measures reported by the committees on appropriations budget house administration rules nd standards of official conduct can be called up at any time under house rule x iii clause 5a rules governing privileged reports by the committee on rule s are detailed under rule x iii clause 6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30945crs4 2 special rules are usually reported as original measures by the rules committee therefore to attempt to discharge special rule from this committee representative must first introduce special rule in the form of simp resolution the resolution cannot provide for the consideration of more than one bill or resolution the representative can move to discharge this resolution from the rules committee after seven legislative days have passed 3 simple unanimous consent agreements which are offered orally are used for noncontroversial measures and routine floor business eg to rescind quorum callthe senate majority leader has the authority to raise measures for senate floor consideration most measures reach the nate floor either by simple unanimous consent request or under complex unanimous consent agreement described in next section the majority leader also can offer debatable motion to proceed to the consideration of measure before scheduling measures for floor action the majority leader consults with the minority leader appropriate committee chairmen and individual senators who ve notified him of their interest in specific measures consultation with individual senators is necessary because most measures are raised by unanimous consent senator or group of senators can place hold on the bringing up of measures holds are an informal custom in the senate early in the 106th congress senate majority leader lott and minority leader tom daschle announced that all senators who wished to place hold on any measure must notify the sponsor and the committee of jurisdiction of their intentions before providing such notice in writing to the respective party leader special rules vs complex animous consent agreements special rules establish the parlia mentary conditions governing house floor consideration of most major measures the house rules committee reports special rule often referred to as rule in the form of simple resolution the typical special rule provides specific amount of time for general debate and determines whether or not amendments are in order rule may limit debate on specific amendments and waive points of order ag ainst specific provisi ons or amendments because special rules are privileged for floor consideration under rule x iii clause 6 they can be called up deba ted and voted upon at any time special rules must be agreed to by majority vote of the house according to house precedents the ru committee can report special rule for bill that is pending before committee the effect of this rarelyused authority is to discharge the bill from the committee conversely representatives can move to discharge the rules committee from considering special rule after it has been before the committee for seven legislative days see legislation blocked in committee section for discussi on of the discharge motion2 the calendar wednesday procedure see previous secti on allows committees to call up measures they have reported but which have not been granted special rule in the senate complex unanimous consent agreements specify the parliamentary conditions governing floor cons ideration of major measures3 these agreements sometimes referred to as time agreements can limit debate time structure thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30945crs5 4 there are four instances when germaneness of amendments is required in the senate see the amending measures section for more information amendment process and waive points of order against specific provisions or amendments the agreements are negotiated by the majority leader in consultation with the minority leader committee chairmen and interested senators these negotiations are conducted in private m eetings or less freque ntly on the senate floor unanimous consent agreement must be accepted by all senators on the floor when the majority leader or his designee formally offers the agreement the objection of one senator prevents the agr eement from taking effect an individual senator can then request the leadership to modify the unanimous consent agreement to accommodate his or her concerns complex unanimous consent agreements are printed in the senates daily c alendar of business and in the congressional record legislation blocked in committee both chambers have procedures for calling up measures that have not been reported by committee in deference to each committees right to consider legislation representatives and senators are generally reluctant to employ these procedures members of the house may offer motion to discharge committee from considering measure 30 days after the measure was referred to the committee 7 days for resolutions before the rules committee if 218 members then sign discharge petition the discharge motion is placed on the discharge calendar and can be called up on the second or fourth m ondays of each month if the motion is adopted motion to call up the underlying measure for immediat consideration can then be offered most discharge motions do not attract the required 218 signatures and few have been adopted since the discha rge rules rule xv clause 2 inception nevertheless the act of filing discha rge petition or threatening to do so is sometimes used to prompt committee action on measures the motion to suspend the rules and pass measure is another pr ocedure for raising unreported measures but is rarely done over the objection of the relevant co mmittee chairman as discussed earlier the twothirds vote required for approving suspension motions means they are generally employed to call up noncontroversial measures it is easier to circumvent committees in the senate than in the house primarily because senators generally have the right to offer nongermane amendments commonly known as riders to meas ures being considered on the floor4 for example senator could offer an amendment containing the text of bill blocked in committee senator also could use rule xiv discussed earlier to bypass committee that has not reported particular measure in this situation the senator would reintroduce the bill demand two readings and then object to the second reading under rule xiv the measure would be placed directly on the calendar of business other senate procedures for bypassing committees such as the motion to discharge committee and the motion to suspend the rules are employed so infrequently they are not discussed here senate committees are sometimes discharged by unanimous consent httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30945crs6 table 1 scheduling and raising measures comparison of house and senate procedures house senate four calendars union house private discharge two

suspension of the rules and calendar wednesday procedures for raising measures from the private calendar and for bringing up legislation involving the district of columbia floor consideration presiding officer and recognition practices the speaker of the house is both the leader of the majority party and the chambers presiding officer in this dual position the speaker uses his parliamentary and political powers to govern house floor proceedings he has the discretionary power to recognize or not recognize members to speak when representative seeks recognition the speaker will frequen tly ask for what purpose does the gentleman gentlewoman rise the speaker does so in order to determine what business the member wants to conduct if the business does not have precedence eg special order speech the speaker can usually deny recognition the speaker does adhere to some estab lished house practices of recognition such as giving members of the committee reporting bill pr iority recognition for offering floor amendments speaker has the right to vote and to bate from the floor if he wishes the extent to which this right is exercised varies from speaker to speaker the speakerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30945crs7 5 in his absence the speaker appoints majority party representative to preside over meetings of the house as speaker pro tempore 6 the vice president may vote to break tie senator serving as presiding officer retains his right to vote in all casespresides over house floor proceedings5 but not over meetings of the committee of the whole formally the committee of the whole house on the state of the union he appoints majority part representative to preside as chairman of the committee of the whole the house resolves into the committee of the whole committee to which all members belong to consider measures that will be amended see amending measures section nonpartis an parliamentarian an officer of the house is always present to advise the presiding officer on rulings and precedents the vice president of the united states is the senates official presiding officer formally president of the senate as provided in article i of the constitution the constitution also requires that president pro tempore preside over the senate in the vice presidents absence the pr esident pro tempore in modern times the most senior senator of the majority party is elected by majority vote of the senate in practice the vice president and the president pro tempore seldom preside over senate proceedings the vice president typi cally presides when he might be required to break tie vote on an important adminis tration priority most of the time the president pro tempore exercises his right under the nates standing rules rule 1 to appoint senator as acting president pro tempore this senator in turn can appoint another senator to rve as acting president pro tempore as result the duties of presiding officer are routinely f illed by rotation of junior and firstterm senators of the majority pa rty who preside for approxima tely one hour at time since the senates official presiding fficer is not member of the body the presiding officer position does not have the same powers to control floor proceedings as those held by the speaker of the house the senates presiding officer may speak only if granted permission to do so by the unanimous consent of the membership and he may vote as noted above only to break tie6 he also must recognize the first senator standing and seeking recognition when several senators seek recognition at the same time the senates precedents gi ve preferential recogn ition to the majority and minority leaders and the majority nd minority floor managers in that order the senates presiding officer never inte rrogates senators about their purpose for seeking recognition nonpartisan senate parliamentarian is always present to advise on rulings and precedents appealing rulings of the chair by house tradition the presiding officers rulings on points of order raised by members are seldom appealed as result the house has relatively large and consistent body of precedents based on rulings of the chair if the chairs ruling is appealed the full house decides by majority vote whether to sustain or overrule this ruling because this vote is viewed as serious test of the chairs authority it is typically settled along party lines with the majority sustaining the chair in contrasthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30945crs8 7 for example the chair does not rule on poi nts of order established under the unfunded mandates reform act of 1995 pl 1044 to the senate there are only few situations when the houses presiding officer does not rule on points of order7 in the senate the presiding officers rulings on points of order raised by senators are frequently appealed the fu ll senate votes on whether to sustain or overrule the ruling under rule xx the presiding officer has the option of submitting any question of order to the full senate for majority vote decision he is required to submit questions of order that raise constitutional issues and those concerning the germaneness or relevancy of amendments to appropriations bills to the full senate senate votes on appealed rulings of the chair and on points of order submitted to the full body often turn on the political concerns of the moment rather than on established senate practices and pr ocedures as result the senate has smaller and less consis tent body of precedents than does the house yet because the senate usually operates informally it is more precedent than ruleregulated institution debate time restrictions house debate nearly always takes place under some form of time restriction there is the onehour rule for debate in the house rule xvii clause 2 and the fiveminute rule during the amendment process in the committee of the whole rule xviii clause 5a debate is limited to forty minutes for bills considered under the suspension of the rules pro cedure special rules can impose time restrictions on debate and rulemaking provisions in statutes often limit debate on certain types of measures such as budget resolutions time restrictions make it difficult for individual representatives to get debate time on the floor when members are accorded debate time they rarely receive more than two to five minutes representatives can be recognized to speak for up to five minutes during the morning hour debate s before legislative business commences on mondays and tuesdays for oneminut speeches at the speakers discretion and usually at the beginning of the legi slative session and for special order speeches of specified length ordinarily at the end of the day in the senate individual senators have the right to unlimited debate senators also can seek unanimous consent to speak out of turn on another subject or to interrupt proceedings with an unrelated matter unanimous consent is usually granted senators may use their right to extended debate and employ other parliamentary maneuvers to delay floor action tactic known as filibuster the threat of filibuster particularly at th end of session or near scheduled recess can be used to try to extract cessions from the senate leadership to be sure it would be impossible for the senate to act on legislation in timely fashion if senators always exercised their right to extended debate for this reason the senate often agrees to debate restrictions as set forth in complex unanimous consent agreements floor debate on cer tain types of measures such as budgethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30945crs9 resolutions is often limited by rulemaking provisions in statutes as is the case in the house ending debate representatives can offer motion for the previous question to end debate in the house rule xix clause 1a adoption of this motion by majority vote ends debate on the pending question prevents th offering of any further motions and amendments and brings about an immediat vote on approving the pending question this motion cannot be offered when the house meets in the committee of the whole in the committee of the whole representatives may offer motion to close or limit debate on the pending question rule xviii clause 8 the motion may propose to end debate immediat ely or when specified time expires adoption of this motion by majority vote only closes or limits debate on the pending question it does not preclude members from offeri ng additional motions or amendments although they may be precluded from debating them and does not produce an immediate vote on the pending question mbers also may ask unanimous consent to end debate on pending amendments in committee of the whole when special rule establishes time limitations on general debate or on the debate of specific amendments debate ends when these time limitations expire senate debate us ually ends when senator yields the floor and other senator seeks recognition or when previous lyestablished time limitation eg in complex unanimous consent agreement or rulemaking statute expires the senates adoption of motion to table by majority vote will end debate on pending measure motion or amendment the pr actical effect of adopting this motion however is to reject the pending question the senate can only resume consideration of the tabled matter by unanimous consent usage of the motion to table is generally reserved for cases when the senate is pr epared to reject the pending question cloture motion signed by 16 senators can be filed to end ex tended debate on measure motion or amendment this motion is filed when informal negotiations cannot end filibuster discussed in previo us section once the cloture motion is adopted by threefifths of the senate bate can only continue for maximum of 30 more hours called the post cloture period at the nd of the postcloture period debate time expires or has b een yielded back and the senate votes on the underlying matter amending measures the house typically meets in the committee of the whole to consider legislation that will be amended the house resolves itself into the committee of the whole by motion of the majority floor ma nager or pursuant to the provisions of special rule the rules of the committee of the whole expedite floor consideration of measures consideration begins with designated period of time for general debate followed by the offering of ame ndments legislation is amended in an orderly fashion ie by sec tion or paragraph or under the terms specified in special rule members can only offer amendments to the part of the bill that has been readhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30945crs10 8 see house practice guide to rules pr ecedents and procedures of the house 108th cong 1st sess washing ton gpo 2003 pp 2731 9 see riddicks senate procedure pp 7295or designated for amendments any devi ation from this orderly sequence requires unanimous consent or provision in speci rule amendments must always be germane unless special rule permits the offering of specified nongermane amendments the principles governing the order of voting on amendments in the committee of the whole are graphically displayed in one basic amendment tree8 when the committee of the whole approves amendments it does not actually amend the bills text the committee of the whole similar to house standing committee reports the measure back to the house with the amendments it adopted such amendments must then be approved by the full house the senate the chamber does not have committee of the whole considers and amends legislation in less structured manner than the house as result the sequence and duration of floor consideration is less predictable in the senate when recognized senators can decide whether they wish to debate the bill in general or offer an amendment amendments to th bill may be proposed in any order at times the senate agrees to complex unanimous consent agreement that allows only specific amendments to be offered and limits the time for debate on each amendment however even under unanimous consent arra ngements it is rare for the senate to impose specific sequence for debate and amendment four amendment trees depict the principles of precedence for offering and voting upon amendments in the senate9 germaneness of amendments is not re quired in the senate except in four specific instances 1 if unanimous consen t agreement so requires 2 in the post cloture period see previous s ection 3 if rulemaking provision in statute so requires eg provisions of the congre ssional budget and impoundment act of 1974 governing consideration of budget resolutions and reconciliation bills and 4 if the underlying measure is ge neral appropria tions bill quorum calls the constitution requires that quorum simple majority of the membership be present for the house 218 and the nate 51 to conduct business when the house meets in the committee of the whol quorum of 100 members is required both chambers typically assume that quorum is present unless it can be demonstrated otherwise the rules of the house restrict when members can make point of order that quorum is not present in the house or in the committee of the whole this point of order is generally permitted only in connection with record votes in recent years house quorum calls have typi cally lasted 1517 minutes senate quorum calls are in order at almost any time quorum calls made for the purpose of obtaining the presence of ma jority of senators are called livehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30945crs11 10 senate rule explicitly governs voice or division votes also counted as voice vote is senate action on which the chair declar measure agreed to without objectionquorums more commonly however nator will suggest the absence of quorum for purposes of constructive delay this type of quorum suspends action on the senate floor without requiring the nate to recess or adjourn this pause in floor action provides time for informal nego tiations to take place and for absent senators to reach the floor the clerk slowly calls the roll until senator asks unanimous consent to rescind or dispen with the quorum call there is time limit on this type of quorum call voting procedures the house and senate each have three main types of votes voice division and record record votes include all those in which the names of members voting on each side are individually recorded and the cumulative totals of yeas and nays are compiled the senate refers to record votes as yea and nay votes or rollcall votes in the house record votes in clude both yea and nay votes and recorded votes in each house most questions are first put to voice vote for voice votes the chair first asks those in favor to res pond aye and then those in opposition to respond house rule i clause 610 the chair then announces which side has prevailed before he or she does so mber may ask for division or record vote for division votes also called standing vot those in favor stand up and are counted by the chair followed by those in opposition the chair then announces the result house rule xx clause 1a division votes in the senate are rare they are sometimes taken by senators raising their hands instead of rising and the chair does not announce the number voting on each side the two chambers differ in their conduc t of record votes after voice or division vote has taken place in the house but before the final result had been announced representatives can demand either yea and nay vote or recorded vote except that yea and nay vote may not be demanded in committee of the whole the demand for yea and nay vote must be supported by onefifth of those present or the vote may be ordered auto matically if member objects to pending vote on the ground that quorum is not pres ent the demand for recorded vote must be supported by onefifth of quorum in th house minimum of 44 members or by 25 members in committee of the whole house rule xx clauses 1b 6a constitution ar ticle i section 5 record votes in the house normally take place by electronic device members vote with electronic voting cards and their votes are displayed on an electronic board in the chamber while vote is taking place members preparing to vote often look at the electronic board to see how other members voted the majority and minority party floor whips also use their board to carry out their votecounting responsibilities house rules rule xx clauses 2a 9 require minimum 15minute voting period for record votes except that in specified situations eg when record vote immediately follows quorum call in the committee of the whole the presidinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30945crs12 11 under standing order rarely enforced any senator may demand that senators vote from their desksofficer may reduce the time to not less than five minutes the voting period may also be extended at the discretion of the chair the chair also has the authority to postpone and cluster certain votes such as those ordered on motions to suspend the rules rule xx clause 10 the senate does not use an electronic voting system to conduct rollcall votes under rule xii the clerk calls the name s of all senators in alphabetical order formally calls the roll senators come to the well of the senate to vote and the clerk announces how each senator voted11 senators can track how colleagues have voted by checking the tallies kept by majority and minority floor staff senators demand for rollcall vote must be supporte d by minimum of 11 senators which is onefifth of the minimal quorum for doing busin ess 51 in genera l this requirement is casually enforced 15minute period fo r rollcall votes is usually established in unanimous consent agreement adopted on the opening day of new session of congress the party floor leaders can extend this voting time period at their discretion senators can and usually do ask for rollcall vote at any time question is pending before the senate they do not have to wait for voice or division vote to first take place for example senator ffering an amendment can ask for rollcall vote even before debate on the amendment be gins when this happens the yeas and nays are ordered after the clerk confir ms that sufficient second supports the request the ordering of the yeas and nays does not bring about an immediate vote in fact most rollcall votes in the nate do not take place immediately upon being ordered adjournment and legislative days the house routinely adjourns at the end of days proceedings as result the houses calendar days and legislative days are almost always the same the exceptions are when the house is in sessi on past midnight and in rare procedural situations the motion to adjourn in the senate ends the days proceedings and creates new legislative day when the chamber next convenes motion to recess however keeps the senate in the same legislative day this means that legislative day in the senate can continue for many calendar days at times there are procedural advantages for the majority leader to keep the senate operating in the same legislative day in doing so he avoids having to conduct some routine business required on new legislative days senators might otherwise use this routine business for purposes of delay at other times there may be procedural advantages for the majority leader to create new legislativ day by adjourning at the beginning of new legislative day the motion to proceed to consider measure is nondebatable this motion is fully debatable at any other time thus creating an opportunity for filibuster httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30945crs13 table 2 floor consideration comparison of house and senate procedures house senate presiding officer has considerable
