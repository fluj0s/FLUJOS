hr 27 by unanimous consent s 1021 is simila r to the workforce investment act amendments of 2003 s 1627 which was passed by the senate during the 108th congress one of the most contentious issues in the house version of hr 27 was provision that would have llowed religious organizations that operate job training programs to take religion into considerati on in hiring this provision is not included under the nondiscrimination provisions of cu rrent law and was not included in the senate version another ma jor difference between the two versions of hr 27 was that the house version would have cr eated consolidated adult program by combining funding for adult activities disl ocated worker activities the employment service and reemployment grants the funding for these programs is currently allocated under separate formulas the senate version would not have created consolidated adult program funding stream s would have remain ed separate the senate version would have however permitted local boards with the approval of the governor to transfer up to 100 of their allocations between the adult and dislocated worker programs both versions of hr 27 among other things would have also amended and reauthorized adult education and literacy programs title ii of wia and the rehabilitation act of 1973 title iv of wia5 this report focuses on workforce investment systems title i of wia summary of amendments to title i onestop delivery system under current law services for adu lts are provided primarily through coordinated servicedelivery system overseen by local wo rkforce investment boards wibs this onestop system is inte nded to provide sea mless combination of services to improve employment opportun ities for individuals the law mandates that certain partners which are entities that administer programs such as adult education and vocational re habilitation provide applicab services through the onestop system in addition to these mandatory partners wia specifies certain programs such as temporary assistance for needy families tanf as optional partners both the house and senate ve rsions of hr 27 would have made tanfhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32778crs3 required partner unless the states gover nor notified the depar tments of labor and health and human services that tanf was not to be required partner under current law each required part ner must enter into memorandum of understanding mou with the local wib regarding among other things how the operating costs of the system will be funde d the house version of hr 27 would have required that each governor determin portion of onestop partner programs federal funds for administrati on to be contributed toward paying the costs of the one stop centers infrastructure d efined as nonpersonnel costs only funds available for the costs of administration for each mandatory or participating optional partner program could have been used except that federal direct spe nding programs such as tanf would have contributed an amount equal to their proportionate use in the state each state wib would have develope d the formula to be used by the governor in allocating the funds to the onestop centers it would certify for this purpose the senate version of hr 27 would ve required the gove rnor to make this determination only if the local board chief elected official and the onestop partners in local area failed to reach agreement in the mou on methods to sufficiently fund the infrastructure costs under the senate version there would have been cap on the portion of federal funds th at could be required to be contributed the cap would have applied to all fe deral funds allotted to program but the funds could have been contributed only from the administrative f unds this cap would have been 3 of federal funds for wi programs and the employment service authorized under the wagnerpeyser act and 15 for othe r required partners for vocational rehabilitation the cap would have increas ed from 075 to 15 over five years under both versions of hr 27 the method for determin ing the appropriate portion of funds to be provided by native am erican programs to pay for the costs of infrastructure of onestop center would have been determined as part of the mou structure of state and loca lly administered programs under current law the state wib which functions as an advisory body to the governor includes in its membership the g overnor members of the state legislature chief elected local offi cials representatives of the lead state agen cies responsible for the programs carried out by onestop partne rs business and labor organizations and individuals and representatives of organizations having experience with youth both the house and senate versions of hr 27 w ould have added the state agency officials responsible for economic deve lopment to the required memb ership clarified that the director of the state vocational rehabilitation unit be member of the state wib and removed representatives of outh organizations as members both versions of hr 27 would have amended the functions of the wib by adding the requirement that they develop and review statewide policies affecting the provision of coordinated or integrated services through the onestop system the house version would have also amended th functions of the wibs by adding the requirement that they assist the governor in certifying onestop centers and awarding infrastructure fundshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32778crs4 6 the house version of hr 27 does not define perform successfully the senate version defines the standard to mean that the local area performed at 80 or more of its adjusted level of performance for core indicators of pe rformance eg entry into employment see discussion of performance accountability below 7 the senate version of hr 27 defines fiscal integrity to mean that the secretary of labor has not made formal determination that f unds were misexpended in the local area due to willful disregard of the requirements of th law gross negligence or failure to comply with accepted standards of administrationone function of the state wib is to assist the governor in the designation of local workforce investment areas under current law request for designation is automatically approved if it is from any unit of general local government with population of 500000 or more an area served by ruralconcentrated employment program or from local area in rhode is land the house version of hr 27 would have eliminated the automatic designa tion for local areas in rhode island but continued automatic design ation for jurisdictions with populations of 500000 or more and ruralconcentrated employment programs although allowing the governor to deny request for designation if the unit of government did not perform successfully6 during the preceding two years the senate version would have continued to allow for automatic designation of any unit of general local government with population of 500000 an area served by ruralconcentrated employment program or local area in rhode island but only if the area performed successfully and sustained fiscal integrity7 in the twoyear period following the enactment of the bill in addition the senate version w ould have made any area that was local workforce investment area in the two years preceding enactment an automatically designated area if the area had performed successfully and sustained fiscal integrity within each local area local wib is certified by the governor under current law these local boards have broad res ponsibility for developing local workforce investment system membership includes representatives of businesses local educational entities labor organizations communitybased organizations economic development agencies and one stop partners both the house and senate versions of hr 27 would have eliminated the requirement that representatives of the one stop partners be included on the local wibs onestop partners are required members of the state wibs under current law each local board is required to establish youth council as subgroup of the wib to develop the youth portion of the local plan to recommend eligible providers of youth activities and to coordinate youth activities in the local area both versions of hr 27 would have made youth councils optional the house version woul d have added faithbased organization to the list of entities that must be represented on the local board the senate version would not have made this change but it would have included faithbased organization in the definition of comm unitybased organization representatives of communitybased organizations are required members of the local boards state and national programs
